            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Introduction.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are ſome men who write, and others who read controverſy, merely from a wrangling diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without any regard to truth, right, or the importance of the matters conteſted. That this is a turn of mind unbecoming a Chriſtian, and even a man, needs not be ſaid. Others have an utter diſlike to all diſputes relative to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of religion, becauſe they are Sceptics; thinking there is nothing of this kind worth diſputing about. Only thus far they are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded, that it is a pity the world ſhould be diſturbed by ſuch trifling debates, in the peaceable purſuit of pleaſure, or of ſolid gain; very gravely condemning all diſputants as quarrelſome people that would ſet the world in a flame, and making no ſmall merit of their own indifference to all religion in general. A third ſort are thoſe good men, who ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love and practiſe religion themſelves; but yet are ſuch great lovers of peace, of ſuch a timid make, and ſo apprehenſive of the bad
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009441_0004_0F748D760FEC2818"/>effects of contention, that they think it beſt never to enter into debates on religion, or any thing relative to it, on any occaſion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe who do ſo, as at beſt imprudent, ill-adviſed perſons.</p>
            <p>BUT ſurely, there may be juſt and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe for diſputing, if religion itſelf is of any great importance. We are enjoined to contend earneſtly for the faith: Nor are even the means, modes and circumſtantials of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wholly unworthy in all caſes to be the ſubject of controverſy. The epiſtles of the apoſtle PAUL, who would not have the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles troubled about circumciſion, or other Jewiſh rites; and exhorted them to ſtand faſt in their LIBERTY, inſtead of ſubmitting to any yoke of BONDAGE, ſufficiently evince this. And if the good, peaceable gentlemen who were mentioned above, are left to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their own liberty and diſcretion, either to read or not read diſputes; one would think, they ſhould allow others the like liberty and diſcretion as to writing: No one will compel them to read, contrary to their inclination—</p>
            <p>THE author of the following pages ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſubject of them to be of real importance, not only to the general intereſt of religion in AMERICA, but particularly in NEW-ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND. In which reſpect he is very far from being ſingular in his opinion. Indeed, none beſides thoſe who think that our Forefathers ſeparated from the Church of ENGLAND
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009441_0005_0F748D76DA2F6650"/>without juſt grounds; and that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſubſiſting betwixt the people of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and ours, are quite immaterial, can ſuppoſe this a needleſs controverſy. The proſperity, if not the very being of our NEW-ENGLAND Churches, is eſſentially concerned in it; as may appear in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>AN evident occaſion was lately given for ſome perſon or other amongſt us to write upon it, by a Gentleman on the other ſide of the queſtion, who has attempted, as he tho't proper to expreſs himſelf, "to determine it <hi>once for all,</hi> by authentic vouchers." The author of the enſuing pages pretends to no ſuch great matters; and would have been ſincerely glad, if ſome perſon of greater abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and more leiſure, would have ſaved him this trouble. But ſome of his friends, perhaps partial in his favor, expreſſed a deſire that he would take ſo fair an opportunity to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſome of his thoughts to the public, on the point in queſtion. In a word, his averſion to controverſy has, on this occaſion, given way to his regard to truth and juſtice, back'd in this manner.</p>
            <p>THO' he really believes the conſtitution, worſhip and diſcipline of the Church of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND much leſs agreeable to the word of GOD than our own; yet he has an high ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for many perſons of that communion, as perſons of great learning and wiſdom, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and piety. He therefore requeſts that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009441_0006_0F748D76F74598E0"/>nothing which here follows, may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a general reflection upon the people of that perſuaſion. He is alſo ſenſible that the SOCIETY, &amp;c. area very reſpectable BODY, and to be treated with all the regard that is conſiſtent with truth and juſtice. But he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think, an implicit faith is to be placed in any BODY of uninſpired men, however great or good; or that there is any indecency in examining into ſome of the Conduct of the ſaid SOCIETY, and comparing it with their CHARTER; that ſo, if there is any real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency betwixt them, it may appear. This he takes to be the undoubted right of every BRITISH ſubject, as well as his own. But tho' he propoſes to lay ſome of his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on this ſubject before the world, in ſimplicity and with freedom; yet he declares, it is by no means his intention to charge that venerable BODY with any <hi>wilful, known</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct, or improper application of monies: And therefore he requeſts the candor of his readers, that no advantage may be taken of any incautious expreſſion that may eſcape him in the purſuit of his argument, even tho' it ſhould at firſt view have the appearance of ſuch an accuſation; for it is not deſigned as ſuch.</p>
            <p>IF his obſervations are futile in themſelves, or if there is any indecency in the manner of his propoſing them, as he hopes there is not, the diſhonor will be to himſelf: And he even
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009441_0007_0F748D77B6973070"/>wiſhes others to judge with the fame freedom and impartiality that he intends to write.</p>
            <p>THE reverend Mr. NOAH HOBART of <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> in a book entitled <hi>A ſecond addreſs to the members of the</hi> EPISCOPAL SEPARATION IN NEW-ENGLAND, <note n="†" place="bottom">Publiſhed 1751.</note> entered into this argument concerning the SOCIETY's conduct; which he handled in a manner becoming both a truly <hi>Chriſtian Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Patriot</hi>; and deſerves the thanks of his country, as well as the high eſteem of his flock. His book has been of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me; and wherever I make uſe of it in the following ſheets, proper acknowledgments are made. In ſhort, Mr. HOBART wrote ſo ſolidly and judiciouſly upon this ſubject, that it would hardly have been needful to ſay any thing farther upon it at this time, except in conformity to that maxim, That every thing <hi>newly publiſhed</hi> on a controverted point, muſt be <hi>anſwered</hi>;—unleſs it is either convincing and ſatisfactory to the <hi>knowing,</hi> or ſo mean and trifling, that even the <hi>ignorant</hi> are in no danger of being impoſed upon thereby. Probably there are not many, who know any thing of the matter, that think the <hi>former</hi> the true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Mr. APTHORP's <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> &amp;c. And if I ſuppoſed they deſerved the <hi>latter,</hi> I ſhould think my time ill employed in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prevent their having <hi>that effect.</hi> They ſeem to me to hold ſuch a <hi>medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt evidence to the wiſe, and glaring abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009441_0008_0F748D78779E4BE8"/>to the fooliſh, as to render ſome ſtrictures upon them very expedient.</p>
            <p>THIS Gentleman's diſcretion is, at leaſt in <hi>one</hi> reſpect, very conſpicuous; perhaps in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Having taken the defence of the SOCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY upon himſelf in quality of an <hi>advocate,</hi> the validity of his plea is then humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his venerable CLIENTS in quality of JUDGES. His <hi>Conſiderations</hi> are inſcribed to the SOCIETY, "in appeal to their JUDGMENT and DECISION." And can it be ſuppoſed that ſo ingenious an <hi>advocate</hi> as Mr. APTHORP will loſe a cauſe, wherein he is ſo happy as to have the ſame honorable and venerable perſonages both for CLIENTS and JUDGES?—eſpecially if he has them for his WITNESSES too; as will appear in due time and place to be his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar felicity. I ſhould, however, have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to the SAME TRIBUNAL to which he has appealed, had I not feared it might be thought a piece of rudeneſs, or kind of inſult, to inſcribe to ſo venerable a BODY thoſe <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,</hi> the profeſſed deſign of which is, to ſhew that they have, in ſome reſpects, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-acted and defeated the truly noble ends of their INSTITUTION, however contrary to their intention.</p>

               <head>SECTION I.
The <hi>QUESTION</hi> ſtated.</head>
               <p>THE author of the following pages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to have what he diſputes about, relative to the <hi>charter,</hi> SOCIETY and their <hi>miſſionaries,</hi> clearly underſtood in the firſt place. He apprehends there is no ground for controverſy as to religious liberty, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and legal right which proteſtants of all denominations have, in any part of his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's dominions, to worſhip God in their own way reſpectively, without moleſtation.</p>
               <p>NOR is the queſtion, whether any perſon or perſons in Great-Britain have a right, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their private capacity, if they think it expedient, to encourage and propagate epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in America, by tranſmitting money to build churches here, to ſupport miſſions and ſchools, or the like. Whatever our ſentiments may be about the church of England, we are not ſo vain as to aſſume a right of dictating to them the manner in which they ſhall, or ſhall not beſtow their charity; or in any ſort to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009441_0010_0F748D79F8006918"/>controul them herein. This is ſaid with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to people in England, conſidered in their private capacity, as was intimated before.</p>
               <p>AGAIN: The queſtion is not, whether that very reſpectable Body corporate, <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the goſpel in foreign parts,</hi> are to judge for themſelves in what particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and under what circumſtances their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to be employed, conformable to the true deſign of their charter. They muſt, in the nature of the thing, judge for themſelves in this reſpect, if they act with integrity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the truſt repoſed in them; which is not diſputed. Though as this is a matter of public concernment, in which the civil as well as religious intereſt of the King's ſubjects in America is nearly concerned; other people have a right to give their opinion about the manner in which that charitable fund is employed; whether agreeably to the intent of the charter or not; and even publicly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate againſt any miſapplications of it, whether through miſ-information, or any other ſuppoſeable means, in order to a reformation of ſuch abuſes, if real. Moreover;</p>
               <p>THERE is no diſpute, but that the venerable Society have a right to plant churches, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port miſſions and ſchools, &amp;c. in many of the Britiſh American colonies; or whether this is in conformity to the intent of their charter. No one that has ever read it, can poſſibly make a doubt of this; or imagine that the Society's
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009441_0011_0F748D7B5F9816C8"/>care and charity ought to be confined to the heathen ſlaves in, or the ſavages bordering on the plantations.</p>
               <p>BUT then it is ſuppoſed by many perſons, that there are ſome of theſe American colonies, whoſe religious ſtate is ſuch, as renders them improper objects of this charity; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that whatever has been done by the Society in ſupporting epiſcopal miſſions in them, is a miſapplication of that part of their fund, which has been employed in this way; to the neglect, prejudice and injury of other colonies, the Negroes and Indians, who were unqueſtionably proper objects of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>THIS therefore, is the main queſtion now propoſed for a free and candid diſcuſſion; Whether the planting epiſcopal churches, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting miſſions and ſchools, &amp;c. in certain parts of America, particularly in New-England, in the manner, and under the circumſtances in which this has been, and ſtill is done by the Society, is conformable to the true deſign of their inſtitution, according to their charter; or a deviation therefrom, and conſequently a miſapplication of their fund?</p>
               <p>THIS is a queſtion of no ſmall importance: And it can be determined only by comparing the manner and circumſtances in which the Society have planted churches, ſupported miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp;c. in theſe parts, with their charter it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And all who are capable of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009441_0012_0F748D7BD5FBAB98"/>the charter, which is very plain, and who are apprized of the facts and circumſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, may be deemed competent judges of the merits of this cauſe.</p>
               <p>THAT part of the charter which explains the deſign of the inſtitution, will be produced in the next ſection. In the mean time it may be obſerved, that the ingenious Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> has propoſed a certain queſtion for diſcuſſion, or rather to be "determined once for all," which was probably never thought of before; and is indeed hardly intelligible. It is this, <q>Whether the Society—conform to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their incorporation, by maintaining epiſcopal churches in the <hi>ſettled towns and villages</hi> of North-America: or whether they have not miſapplied a fund originally <hi>limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the converſion of the heathens.</hi>

                     <hi>Conſiderations on the Inſtitution and Conduct of the Society,</hi> &amp;c. p. 1.</note> This he ſpeaks of as a very intereſting queſtion to "the Miſſionaries and their congregations." Poſſibly it may be ſo. But what does the gentleman mean by the <hi>ſettled towns and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of North-America</hi>? Is this deſigned in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>unſettled,</hi> or <hi>uninhabited</hi> towns and villages here? I know of none ſuch: But if there were any, who ever ſuppoſed that it was expected the Society ſhould <hi>maintain epiſcopal churches</hi> in ſuch, but not in the <hi>inhabited</hi> towns and villages? It were hard indeed, to confine the pious labors of the miſſionaries to places
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009441_0013_0F748D7C5ECE3EE8"/>without inhabitants!—Eſpecially while there are ſo many <hi>ſettled</hi> towns and villages in North America, Indian as well as Engliſh, where they might be uſeful. But by the disjunction which he makes, it ſeems as if by <hi>ſettled</hi> towns, &amp;c. he meant places inhabited by Engliſh ſubjects and profeſſed Chriſtians; for the Society's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their charitable fund in order to the <hi>converſion of the heathens,</hi> is the other part of the disjunction; and ſo ſtands in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>maintaining epiſcopal churches in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled towns and villages here.</hi> But if this is what he means by <hi>ſettled</hi> towns, &amp;c. the queſtion ſeems at beſt very vague and indeterminate: For ſome of theſe towns and villages have all along had miniſters of other proteſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions in them; others have not. And it was proper, one would think, that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſhould have let us know which of theſe he intended. If he meant the latter only; and intended that the ſociety rightly applied their fund in maintaining epiſcopal churches in <hi>them,</hi> as well as in the converſion of the heathen, it is allowed; there is no controverſy as to this. But if he meant the former alſo; and that the Society rightly apply their fund in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing epiſcopal churches in places where other proteſtant churches were before ſettled, and the adminiſtration of God's word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances provided for, then indeed he oppoſes us. But, on any ſuppoſition, his disjunction is extremely lame and imperfect. And how

                  <hi>intereſting</hi> ſoever his queſtion may be to the <hi>Miſſionaries and their congregations</hi>; yet, as he has ſtated it, the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> miniſters and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of New-England will not probably think themſelves much concerned in it. For if the queſtion is determined only in the ſame looſe, vague manner in which it is propoſed, it can do little good nor hurt to any cauſe, even tho' it ſhould be thus determined <hi>once for all.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>THE following obſervations are ſubmitted to the candid reader's judgment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. NOTHING is to be ſuppoſed the object, or any part of the object of this charitable and royal inſtitution, but what plainly appears to be really ſo, from the very words of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Even tho' it were certain that thoſe perſons to whom it was granted, had, at the very time, ſome farther views and ends in obtaining it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which are expreſſed, or plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; yet the words of the charter itſelf muſt determine and limit the ſenſe of the royal <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and conſequently the legal power conferred on the noble and reverend <hi>Grantees,</hi> the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. It was <hi>only</hi> for thoſe purpoſes that are particularly expreſſed, not any private or ſecret ones, which they might poſſibly have had in their own minds, that they were incorporated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT appears that the Britiſh plantations, &amp;c. were really the primary, more immediate object of this inſtitution: or the King's ſubjects. In which term, ſubjects, may be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>ſlaves</hi> in the plantations, who are the moſt inferior ſubjects. But it alſo appears that the grand, ultimate deſign of the inſtitution was, the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009441_0017_0F748D80C3065E48"/>
                  <hi>propagation of the</hi> GOSPEL <hi>in thoſe parts</hi>; which neceſſarily includes the deſign of chriſtianiſing the <hi>Indians</hi> bordering on the colonies, as a principal part of the general deſign.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THIS charitable foundation was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for <hi>all</hi> the plantations, colonies and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories indiſcriminately; but for ſuch of them only as really ſtood in great need of relief and help in this way, and whoſe religious ſtate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded to the deſcription in the charter. This diſtinction betwixt the colonies, &amp;c. is clearly ſuppoſed in the charter itſelf, by the manner of expreſſion uſed; particularly thoſe words, "Whereas—<hi>many</hi> of our plantations;" and— "<hi>many others</hi> of our ſaid plantations." Had it been ſaid, the <hi>reſt of them,</hi> or <hi>all others,</hi> it would have materially altered the caſe. And it is at leaſt probable that ſome ſuch expreſſion would have been uſed, had it not been taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe plantations were in a quite different ſtate with reference to religion.</p>
               <p>THIS charity muſt needs have been inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally <hi>limited</hi> to thoſe plantations, &amp;c. which were or ſhould be, in the ſtate repreſented in the charter; in ſuch ſort, that the Society had no warrant to extend it to any others, if others there were, whoſe religious ſtate was materially and eſſentially different.</p>
               <p n="4">4. EVEN amongſt thoſe plantations, &amp;c. which were truly the objects of this charity, there is ſome difference; for they are differently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and come under two diſtinct heads in the charter, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:009441_0018_0F748D818C62F988"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> THOSE in which the "proviſion for miniſters is <hi>very mean</hi>:" which are paſſed over with this curſory mention, as not being the plantations whoſe relief was principally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. [And this, by the way, naturally implies that ſome of the plantations, &amp;c. were at that time ſupplied with <hi>ſuch</hi> miniſters as are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the charter, "learned and orthodox" ones: For there is no complaint againſt theſe miniſters <hi>themſelves,</hi> but only againſt the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their <hi>ſupport.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> SUCH plantations as are "<hi>wholly</hi> deſtitute, and unprovided," &amp;c. And theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the places more eſpecially regarded in the charter, their deplorable and pitiable ſtate is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon: They are repreſented as <hi>wholly</hi> deſtitute of the "<hi>public worſhip</hi> of God;"— "wanting the adminiſtration of God's word and ſacraments;"—"ſeeming to be abandoned to <hi>atheiſm</hi> and <hi>infidelity</hi>"—and in danger of being perverted to "<hi>Popiſh ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>idolatry.</hi>" Sad ſtate indeed! but one degree better than that of pagan barbarity. And who that reads this firſt paragraph of the charter, can poſſibly doubt, but that the relief of theſe places was principally deſigned, not only in diſtinction from thoſe plantations where a tolerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was already made for miniſters, and the ſupport of God's public worſhip, but alſo in diſtinction from thoſe where the proviſion was "very mean?"</p>
               <p n="5">5. IT is evident that, by "miniſters," or as they are afterwards called, "learned and orthodox
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009441_0019_0F748D8251AEDB00"/>miniſters," and "an orthodox clergy," were not intended miniſters of any one denomination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt proteſtants, excluſively of others. For this it may ſuffice at preſent to aſſign only three reaſons: There will be occaſion to reſume the conſideration of this point hereafter, when many others will be given. <hi>Firſt, Orthodox mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> in the charter, ſtand in direct oppoſition to <hi>Romiſh prieſts and jeſuits</hi>: For it is ſaid, that for want of the <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> were the more encouraged to <hi>pervert</hi> the King's ſubjects. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not ſaid, that for want of ſuch miniſters to inſtruct the people in the <hi>peculiar</hi> doctrines, diſcipline and worſhip of the church of England, or any other particular proteſtant church, the Romiſh prieſts were thus encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but for want of ſuch to inſtruct them in the "principles of true religion" in general; or, as it is afterwards expreſſed, in "the chriſtian religion." There is not the moſt remote hint in the charter, at any controverſies ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting amongſt proteſtants; but only at thoſe which ſubſiſted betwixt them and Roman-catholics. The evils propoſed to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, or guarded againſt by this inſtitution, are thoſe of <hi>atheiſm, infidelity</hi> and <hi>popery</hi>; not the errors, whether real or ſuppoſed, of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants out of the communion of the church of England. It could not even be known from the charter, that there were any diſſentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt proteſtants; ſo general, generous and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic is the language of it; and ſo far is it from countenancing any party-deſign. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> King
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009441_0020_0F748D8308897490"/>William himſelf was bred up in the Calviniſtic principles and diſcipline, quite oppoſite in ſome reſpects to the epiſcopal; and is generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have retained a regard for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his education all along; tho' as King of England, and Head of that church, there was a neceſſity of his externally conforming to its rites and diſcipline. Can it be reaſonably ſuppoſed then, that in this charter, by <hi>orthodox</hi> miniſters, he intended thoſe of the Engliſh church in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction from thoſe of all other churches in the world; and conſequently to brand all the reſt as <hi>heterodox</hi>! For this will neceſſarily be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; <hi>orthodoxy</hi> being always and only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>heterodoxy</hi> or <hi>hereſy.</hi> To ſuppoſe that <hi>that</hi> noble-ſpirited Prince had any ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is quite unnatural: And to ſay that the Grantees underſtood the term orthodox in this narrow, excluſive ſenſe, is to reflect upon their underſtandings as well as their catholiciſm.</p>
               <p>FROM the foregoing obſervations it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that, none of thoſe plantations, &amp;c. if any ſuch there were, in which a tolerable proviſion was made for miniſters, tho' not of the church of England, to adminiſter "God's word and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments," and to inſtruct the people in the "principles of true religion," or "the chriſtian religion"—and ſo, to guard them againſt "athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and infidelity" on one hand, and "Popiſh ſuperſtition and idolatry" on the other, were in any ſort the intended objects of this charity. And therefore,</p>
               <p>THAT if the ſociety have applied any
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009441_0021_0F748D83C079EAF0"/>part of their fund to ſupport and encourage the peculiarities of epiſcopacy in any ſuch places, they have applied it in a manner not warranted by their charter. And</p>
               <p>THIS abuſe is ſo much the greater, if at the ſame time they have either neglected to ſupport God's public worſhip in thoſe, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, &amp;c. which were exactly in the poor and deſtitute condition repreſented in the charter; or to propagate the goſpel amongſt the heathen bordering on the colonies. This, if real, is a double abuſe; with-holding their charity from thoſe for whom it was originally deſigned, and beſtowing it upon thoſe whom the charter, by natural and neceſſary conſequence, excludes from it—The truth of theſe ſuppoſed facts will be conſidered hereafter: In the mean time it will not be amiſs to take ſome notice of Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s miſtakes as to the charter, and the deſign of this inſtitution.</p>

Of Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s manner of quoting and repreſenting the Charter.</head>
               <p>THIS gentleman having intimated his intention to determine the queſtion "<hi>once for all,</hi> by authentic vouchers;" (<hi>Conſid.</hi> p. 7.) ſays (p. 8.) <q>The propoſed vindication is deſigned to convince the <hi>candid.</hi> To confute the <hi>obſtinate,</hi> and ſilence the <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:009441_0022_0F748D8475AD16C0"/>is not in the <hi>power of reaſon.</hi>
                  </q> From a perſon who ſets out in this modeſt manner, we have doubtleſs a right to expect very direct, plain authorities, and great candor, as well as the utmoſt clearneſs and ſtrength of reaſon: For ſhould he fail in theſe reſpects, even thoſe who are neither uncandid nor malicious, may poſſibly remain unconvinced. But in the next page, juſt after a very heroic threatning (in ſome lines from VIRGIL) what a ſevere and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved revenge he would take on ſome unknown perſon who, it ſeems, had provoked him in a news-paper; we find him taking a method to accompliſh his grand deſign of vindicating the Society, ſo as to convince all but the uncandid and malicious, which does not ſeem the beſt adapted to this end: And that is, <hi>miſ-quoting</hi> the charter. He there undertakes to give the words of the charter, which, he ſays, "thus <hi>expreſſes</hi> the deſign of their" [the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's] "inſtitution;" and then goes on with the uſual ſign or mark of a quotation. Nor, indeed, do I accuſe the gentleman of inſerting, as from the charter, any words that are not in it. But whoever compares his quotation (p. 9.) with the charter itſelf, or only with the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it is quoted <hi>verbatim</hi> in the preceeding ſection, will find the following particulars true: —That he has taken the liberty to tranſpoſe ſome clauſes, and wholly to leave out others, without giving the leaſt notice of it to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the uſual way, by a blank or —; and alſo that he has thus omitted clauſes which are
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009441_0023_0F748D853401B880"/>very material, in order to aſcertain the true ſenſe of the charter. For he has intirely dropped the following clauſe—"and ſeem to be adandoned to <hi>atheiſm</hi> and <hi>infidelity</hi>"—and theſe alſo—"divers Romiſh prieſts and jeſuits are the more encouraged to pervert and draw over our loving ſubjects to <hi>popiſh ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>idolatry</hi>;" miſplacing the intermediate clauſe concerning "learned and orthodox mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters." And yet the pointing all along in this 9th page, is as it ought to be, if the charter had been quoted <hi>verbatim,</hi> without any omiſſions or tranſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>NOW, can even the moſt candid think, this gentleman dealt ingenuouſly by his readers, in thus mangling and caſtrating the charter? Or can it be ſuppoſed that he thought the clauſes thus ſuppreſſed, were of no uſe in aſcertaining the ſenſe? The importance of them is quite obvious in this reſpect; they ſhew the <hi>very ſad</hi> and <hi>deplorable</hi> condition of thoſe places, which were in an eſpecial manner the objects of this charitable inſtitution; — that they were not merely deſtitute of epiſcopalian miniſters, but miniſters of any other denomination among proteſtants; ſo as to be in a manner abandoned to <hi>atheiſm</hi> and <hi>infidelity,</hi> or in great danger of being perverted to <hi>popery.</hi> Conſidered in their proper connexion, and in this view, any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon man may eaſily ſee the importance of the clauſes. But it would have ruined his deſign, if it had plainly appeared from his own quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it does from the charter itſelf, that the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009441_0024_0F748D8675F58D88"/>inſtitution was not intended for the ſupport of an epiſcopal clergy, where a competent proviſion was already made for a clergy of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or preſbyterian perſuaſion; but where there was no competent proviſion made for any miniſters of any denomination amongſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, capable of inſtructing the people in "the principles of true religion," and ſo, by God's bleſſing, guarding them againſt the fatal errors of atheiſm, infidelity and popery. There was therefore evidently an end to be ſerved, <hi>ſuch as it was,</hi> by thus mangling and mutilating the charter; whether he had any ſuch deſign in it or not. For it would anſwer his purpoſe much beſt, to have the true, and very forlorn condition of thoſe plantations, &amp;c. kept out of ſight as much as poſſible, which the royal Founder of the Society had in his mind, and which thoſe omitted clauſes ſo clearly and ſtrongly expreſs; that ſo people might be the eaſier induced to believe, that any of the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations where there was no epiſcopal clergy, were actually the objects of this charity, even tho' they had ever ſo many miniſters of any other denomination, competently ſupported. And, that this was his intention, there is hardly any room even for the candid to doubt, when his own words juſt after this extraordinary quotation, are conſidered. For there he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces this as one of his "certain concluſions" from that view of the charter which he had given; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That the primary intention of the Society was,—to provide a maintenance
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009441_0025_0F748D87040196C8"/>for an orthodox clergy; which (as the charter was obtained by the members of the Church of England) muſt—mean a clergy of their own church.</q>

                     <hi>Conſid.</hi> p. 10, 11.</note> It might indeed be naturally expected that the Society, being at leaſt chiefly epiſcopalians, whenever they ſent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries abroad, would ſend thoſe of their own communion. But it will not from hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they were to ſend and ſupport ſuch, in any or all of the colonies indifferently, where a competent proviſion was already, or ſhould be made, for proteſtant miniſters of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other communion. This latter is what the defence of the ſociety requires; and it is a ſophiſm, perhaps undeſigned, which runs thro' the <hi>Conſiderations.</hi> But of this more hereafter. —If Mr. Apthorp did not perceive thoſe clauſes which he has ſuppreſſed in ſo ſingular a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to be of any importance, I bluſh for him as a reputed Scholar: But if knowing them to be ſo, he omitted them in order to impoſe upon his unwary readers, and the better to diſguiſe the true deſign of that excellent inſtitution, I am quite in pain for him as a Chriſtian;— eſpecially as One who is by office, I would hope by example alſo, an inſtructor of others in chriſtian <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and godly <hi>ſincerity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT whatever might be his deſign therein, which is left to his own reflections, he has not left out enough of the charter to anſwer his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Thoſe remaining clauſes—"proviſion for miniſters is <hi>very mean</hi>"—"<hi>wholly</hi> deſtitute and unprovided of a maintenance for miniſters, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009441_0026_0F748D8773743208"/>the <hi>publick worſhip of God</hi>"—"miniſters to inſtruct our loving ſubjects in the <hi>principles of true religion</hi>;—"<hi>want</hi> the adminiſtration of <hi>God's word</hi> and ſacraments;"—which are all deſcriptive of the pitiable ſtate of the places whoſe relief was deſigned by this charitable foundation, are ſufficient to invalidate his <hi>defence</hi> of the Society, without the aſſiſtance of the clauſes ſuppreſſed in ſuch a manner. For if it can be ſhewn that the Society maintain many miſſions and ſchools in thoſe plantations, &amp;c. to which no part of this deſcription is applicable, but quite the reverſe is true; the gentleman muſt certainly <hi>conſider</hi> at leaſt <hi>once again,</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> a little more cloſely, before he will convince the candid and judicious, that the Society have not miſapplied their fund. The charter warrants them to maintain no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or ſchools in the colonies, but in ſuch places as anſwer to the deſcriptions in the charter; in order to make converts to the church of England from chriſtians of other denominations. The charter knows of no diſtinction amongſt chriſtians, except that of proteſtants and papiſts: Its grand object, a truly glorious one, is, to promote chriſtianity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in oppoſition to atheiſm, infidelity and popery; not epiſcopacy and the liturgy of the church of England, in oppoſition to preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm, &amp;c. Tho' if the profeſſion of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is upheld, or if the goſpel is propagated at all, it is readily acknowledged that this muſt be done in ſome particular way, mode or form. And
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009441_0027_0F748D8A4EA16068"/>when epiſcopalians do any thing to theſe ends, it is to be expected that they will do it in that way, mode or form, which themſelves moſt approve. Neither is this the thing objected againſt in the preſent argument; but, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's turning their arms, as it were, againſt other proteſtants; and expending a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their monies in ſupporting a party.</p>

Of ſome other Things tending to explain and confirm the Senſe of the Charter, and the deſign of the Inſtitution aforeſaid.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THE name itſelf by which this reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table corporation is diſtinguiſhed and known, is agreeable to the ſpirit of the charter as before explained: <hi>The Society for the propagation of the</hi> GOSPEL, &amp;c. From this name or title any one would naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if heathens and barbarians were not the more immediate objects of the charitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but only the more remote; yet it had for its object people in very deplorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances at beſt; ſuch as were in a manner deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of God's word and ſacraments, or the means of grace. It would never enter into any one's heart to conceive, that any part of its deſign was, the building up any one proteſtant church on
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009441_0028_0F748D8B21A0F688"/>the ruins of others. Thus the name of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the charter well agree. But accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome things which Mr. Apthorp and others have advanced, not to ſay at preſent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome proceedings of the Society, it ought rather to have been called, <hi>The Society for propagating the church of England, in thoſe parts where the adminiſtration of God's word and ſacraments is provided for, after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational and presbyterian modes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. THE common ſeal of the Society, which often ſerves as a frontiſpiece to the charter, is agreeable both to the charter and name of the Society. The device is, a ſun in the upper part of a circle, ſhining gloriouſly on the world; a natural and noble emblem of the <hi>ſun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>; of Him that ſaid, "I am the light of the world." Within the circle to the right, is a ſhip under full ſail; on the prow of which ſtands a clergyman with a book in his hand, (I ſuppoſe intended for the Bible) which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to a company of naked ſavages on the left, who are eagerly thronging to the ſhore, to meet and receive the bleſſing. Juſt over them is a ſcroll with theſe words, <hi>Tranſiens adjuva nos</hi>; alluding to Acts xvi. 9. "Come over—and help us:" the words of the man of Macedonia, whom St. Paul ſaw in a viſion; from whence he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Lord called him "to preach the goſpel" to the heathen there. And in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circle or circumference of the ſeal, is the aforeſaid title or name of the Society. This is a fine device for the ſeal of ſuch a ſociety, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its name and charter.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:009441_0029_0F748D8B5B613F30"/>3. THE ſermons preached annually before the Society, in the general ſtrain and tenor of them, correſpond very exactly to the noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the inſtitution, as before repreſented. The grand topic inſiſted on in them, is promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing THE GOSPEL; the undoubted doctrines and duties of the Chriſtian religion. The preachers on theſe occaſions ſeem evidently, however, to have had the heathen in their minds, rather than profeſſed Chriſtians who only needed aſſiſtance in order to the ſupport of God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ordinances: In which reſpect the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons rather coincide with the ultimate than the more immediate deſign of the inſtitution; and ſo harmonize rather more perhaps with the ſeal and name of the ſociety, than with the charter. This is not ſaid with the leaſt deſign to reflect on the preachers of them, as if they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the deſign of the inſtitution, which is indeed kept in view in thoſe ſermons; tho', as was intimated before, the ultimate deſign of the inſtitution is much more enlarged on, than the primary or more direct. And the grand argument inſiſted on, to induce good people of all denominations to aſſiſt the Society with their charity, is, the <hi>common cauſe of chriſtianity</hi>; partly for ſupporting the public worſhip of God in thoſe Britiſh colonies, where it could not be tolerably ſupported without ſuch aſſiſtance; but chiefly for the ſake of the poor heathen ſlaves and ſavages in, or bordering on the Engliſh plantations: An argument which has been handled with the greateſt propriety and pathos
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009441_0030_0F748D8BF4C61608"/>in theſe ſermons; and has doubtleſs drawn ſome thouſands of pounds from proteſtant diſſenters in England.</p>
               <p>I HAVE read many of theſe excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, both the very earlieſt, and thoſe preached from time to time ſince; and have many of them now by me: So that it were eaſy to fill volumes with quotations to exemplify and prove what is here aſſerted concerning the general ſtrain of them. But I am not willing needleſly to load and ſwell the preſent publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by quotations to prove what, it is taken for granted, no perſon who knows any thing of the matter, and either has or deſerves the leaſt reputation, will preſume to deny. But by way of ſpecimen, for the ſake of thoſe who may not have read any of theſe ſermons, ſome extracts ſhall be ſubjoined from the late biſhop BUTLER's ſermon before the Society, 1739: A great ornament of the epiſcopal order, and of the church of England; the clearneſs of whoſe head, the preciſion of whoſe language, and the goodneſs of whoſe heart, are ſo conſpicuous in all his writings.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>NO one has a right to be called a chriſtian, ſays, he, who doth not do ſomewhat in his ſtation, towards the diſcharge of this truſt; [meaning the goſpel, which he conſiders as a truſt] who doth not, for inſtance, aſſiſt in keeping up <hi>the profeſſion of</hi> CHRISTIANITY where he lives. And it is an obligation but little more remote, to aſſiſt in doing it in our factories abroad, and in the colonies to which we are related—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:009441_0031_0F748D8CBB7FCFC0"/>OF theſe our colonies, the SLAVES ought to be conſidered as inferior <hi>members,</hi> and therefore to be treated as <hi>members</hi> of them; and not merely as cattle or goods, the property of their maſters. Nor can the higheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, poſſible to be acquired in theſe ſervants, cancel the obligation to take care of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious inſtruction. Deſpicable as they may appear in our eyes, they are the creatures of God, and of the race of mankind, for whom Chriſt died: and it is <hi>inexcuſable</hi> to keep them in ignorance of the end, for which they were made; and the means, whereby they may become partakers of the <hi>general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
                  <p>THE like charity we owe to the NATIVES; owe to them in a much ſtricter ſenſe than we are apt to conſider, were it only from neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and our having gotten poſſeſſions in their country. For incidental circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind appropriate all the general obligations of charity to particular perſons; and make ſuch and ſuch inſtances of it, the duty of one man rather than another. We are moſt ſtrictly bound to conſider theſe <hi>poor unformed creatures,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
                  <p>AND it may be ſome encouragement to chearful perſeverance <hi>in theſe endeavours,</hi> to obſerve, not only that they are our duty, but alſo that they ſeem the means of carrying on a great ſcheme of providence, which ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be accompliſhed. For <hi>the everlaſting</hi> GOSPEL <hi>ſhall be preached to every nation</hi>:
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009441_0032_0F748D8D78D80080"/>And <hi>the kingdoms of this world ſhall become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>AFTER diſcourſing for two or three pages, concerning the good effects that might be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expected from theſe pious endeavours to propagate chriſtianity, he goes on thus—<q>The deſign before us being then unqueſtionably good, it were much to be wiſhed that ſerious men <hi>of all denominations would join in it.</hi> And let me add, that the foregoing view of things affords diſtinct reaſons why they ſhould. For, firſt, by ſo doing, they aſſiſt in a work of the <hi>moſt uſeful importance,</hi> that of ſpreading over the world the SCRIPTURE ITSELF, as a DIVINE REVELATION: and it cannot be ſpread under this character, for a continuance, in any country, unleſs CHRISTIAN CHUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHES be ſupported there; but will always, more or leſs, ſo long as <hi>ſuch</hi> churches ſubſiſt; and therefore their ſubſiſtence ought to be provided for. In the next place, they [<hi>viz.</hi> ſerious men <hi>of all denominations</hi>] ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that if CHRISTIANITY is to be propagated at all, which they acknowledge it ſhould, it muſt be in <hi>ſome particular form of profeſſion.</hi> And tho' they think <hi>ours</hi> liable to objections, &amp;c.—Upon the whole therefore, <hi>theſe perſons</hi> would do well to conſider, how far they can with reaſon <hi>ſatisfy themſelves</hi> in neglecting what is <hi>certainly right,</hi> on account of what is <hi>doubtful,</hi> whether it be wrong</q>—<note n="†" place="bottom">Edit. p. 14—22.

And how cogent is his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, to induce ſerious men <hi>of all denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in England to join in, and contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carrying it into execution, upon the true <hi>original</hi> plan? But let me juſt aſk by the way, what force there would be in this excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, to induce proteſtant <hi>diſſenters</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to aſſiſt the Society, upon ſuppoſition it was a known fact, that the Society deviated very eſſentially from this noble plan, by applying a large proportion of their fund in ſupporting a party in America, and undermining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational and preſbyterian churches here? Could it be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that thoſe of the ſame religious principles in England, would aſſiſt the Society in any deſigns or endeavours againſt their brethren in New-England? or in promoting epiſcopacy here, in oppoſition to the churches of their own denomination? Or could any preacher on thoſe occaſions, who knew this to be fact, with integrity and uprightneſs make uſe of arguments of this catholic ſtrain, in order to get money out of the pockets of Engliſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters? I am fully perſuaded that the great and good Biſhop BUTLER would have deteſted ſuch an artifice, and even the whole ſcheme of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſupporting epiſcopal churches in divers places in America, had he been appriſed of the true ſtate of religion in them.—The foregoing extracts from his ſermon, as was intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009441_0034_0F748D8EF79D59B8"/>are given only as a ſpecimen of what is the uſual ſtrain of the ſermons preached on the ſame occaſion. Tho' I am not inſenſible, that ſome of them, eſpecially within the laſt twenty years, have expreſſions in them of a much leſs catholic ſtrain, and quite aliene from the ſpirit of the charter; an example or two of which may perhaps be given hereafter. But then, it is to be obſerved, on the other hand,</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT in ſome of theſe anniverſary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, all narrow, party deſigns are condemned and diſclaimed in very ſtrong terms; and a zeal for catholic chriſtianity recommended in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to every thing of this kind. Thus parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Dr. BEVERIDGE, Biſhop of St. Aſaph, in his ſermon before the Society, 1706, after commending the zeal of the primitive Chriſtians, ſays, <q>But then we muſt take care, that our zeal be as theirs was, according to knowledge —Not for any <hi>private opinion, party</hi> or <hi>fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not for either ſide of a <hi>doubtful diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or for unwritten traditions, wherein men are <hi>apt to ſpend all their zeal,</hi> ſo as to have little or none left for that which is the <hi>proper object of it.</hi> But as it is ſaid of <hi>Phineas,</hi> in his great commendation, that he was zealous FOR HIS GOD; Num. xxv. 13.

               <p>NOW it is to be obſerved, that theſe anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſermons are almoſt always preached by members, and printed and diſperſed by order of the Society: A principal deſign of them being, to ſhew what a noble and generous work they are engaged in; that ſo-people of all denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions amongſt proteſtants may be encouraged to bear a part with them in it, by their donations, legacies &amp;c. How great therefore muſt be the

Some general Account of the State of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in New-England, before and ſince the incorporation of the Society.</head>
               <p>HAVING in the preceeding ſections taken a view of the charter, and repreſented it in its true light, in oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009441_0037_0F748D91F8E3E378"/>miſquotation and miſrepreſentation of it; and alſo confirmed that ſenſe which has been given as the true, by the name and common ſeal of the Society, as alſo by the anniverſary ſermons preached before, and diſperſed by them, to get ſubſcriptions, &amp;c. It will now be proper to come to ſome facts relative to the conduct of the Society in planting churches, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſſions in America. And as the principal objection lies againſt their conduct as to New-England, it will be neceſſary, in order to ſet the objection in a fair and true light, in the firſt place to make ſome remarks on the ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion here, before the Society ſent any miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries into theſe parts, and ſince. This is propoſed in the preſent ſection. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT is well known, that the firſt ſettlers of New-England were ſuch as came hither chiefly on account of their ſufferings for non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the church of England. They fled hither as to an aſſylum from epiſcopal perſecution, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by royal power; which often conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to be ſubſervient to the views of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering prelates, before the glorious revolution. That this was the occaſion of their flight hither, appears even from the Society's own publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus in the <hi>Account of the foundation, proceedings and ſucceſs of the Society,</hi> publiſhed Anno 1706, it is ſaid, (p. 10.) <q>
                     <hi>It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,</hi> that it was the unhappineſs of New England and the adjoining parts, to be firſt planted and inhabited by perſons who were generally diſaffected to the church by law
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009441_0038_0F748D92D3A9D040"/>eſtabliſht in England; and had <hi>many of them</hi> taken <hi>refuge</hi> or <hi>retirement</hi> in thoſe parts, on account of their <hi>ſuffering</hi> for non-conformity here at home.</q>
This fact muſt indeed be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed</hi>; and that it was their <hi>unhappineſs</hi> to ſuffer thus, ought to be confeſſed alſo. But, that it was the unhappineſs of New-England to be firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inhabited by theſe conſcientious non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts to the eſtabliſhed church of England, is not ſo clear a point: Neither is it to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, if they were <hi>diſaffected</hi> to ſuch a cruel, perſecuting church as that was before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT is no leſs certain that theſe <hi>refugees</hi> were very far from being perſons of a looſe, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious character. Had they been void of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience toward God, they would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo much for non-conformity, and fled their dear native country, for the ſake of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him without fear in a wilderneſs. If they had been perſons void of religious principle, they would in all probability have lived and died in the communion of that church, for diſſenting from which they ſuffered ſo much.—That they were a ſober, virtuous and religious ſet of people in general, is certain: Tho', that they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or free from all human errors and frailties, is not pretended.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IT is well known that they very early made proviſion for the public worſhip of God, and founded a ſeminary of learning, which has been encreaſing and flouriſhing to the preſent time. The zeal which they ſhewed both for
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009441_0039_0F748D93752170C0"/>learning and religion, from the firſt, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very uncommon; and greatly to their honor. The public worſhip of God, and the adminiſtration of his word and ſacraments, have all along been provided for in New-England: I mean, in the Province of <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay</hi> and in <hi>Connecticut</hi>; which two may contain perhaps about eight parts in ten of the inhabitants of New-England. In the other two ſmall governments, <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland and Providence Plantations,</hi> there has, to be ſure, been much leſs care taken for the ſupport of a public worſhip. But in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> the public profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religion has all along been very regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upheld, nearly after the ſame mode of profeſſion. The doctrines almoſt univerſally profeſſed in both, are and ever have been, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to the doctrinal articles of the church of England. Their external polity, and form of worſhip, are indeed known to be different; the churches of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> the principal New-England government, being generally of the <hi>congregational</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which the epiſcopalians affect to reproach under the name of <hi>independency</hi>; and thoſe in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> of the <hi>presbyterian</hi>; or at leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer to the eſtabliſhed church of Scotland.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IT is farther to be obſerved, that in theſe two principal governments of New-England there has been, not only proviſion, but <hi>legal</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:009441_0040_0F748D95B2D6E868"/>proviſion made for the ſupport of a <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>orthodox</hi> miniſtry, and of ſchools; and that, before the Society for propagating the goſpel had a being. Particularly in the Maſſachuſetts, there was a law enacted in the 4th of WILLIAM and MARY, for thoſe purpoſes; which having been nine years before the Society obtain'd their charter, it will be needleſs to look any farther back for a <hi>civil</hi> eſtabliſhment of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion here, upon this occaſion. Some extracts from the law aforeſaid may be ſeen in the margin <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>The act is intitled, <hi>An act for the</hi> SETTLEMENT <hi>and</hi> SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORT <hi>of</hi> MINISTERS <hi>and</hi> SCHOOLMASTERS. It begins thus, <q>Be it ordained by the governor, council, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives convened in general court or aſſembly, and by the authority of the ſame, That the inhabitants of each town within this province ſhall take due care from time to time, to be provided of an ABLE, LEARNED, OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THODOX miniſter or miniſters, of good converſation, to diſpenſe the word of God: which miniſters ſhall be SUI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TABLY encouraged, and SUFFICIENTLY ſupported and maintained by the inhabitants of ſuch towns</q> —It is provided in the ſame paragraph, that all <hi>contracts</hi> which had been or ſhould be made by towns, relative to their miniſters or ſchoolmaſters, and their maintenance, ſhould be <q>made good, &amp;c. And where there is no contract reſpecting the ſupport and maintenance of the miniſtry, or when the ſame happens to be expired, and the inhabitants of ſuch towns ſhall neglect to make ſuitable proviſion therein,</q> then the court of quarter Seſſions is impowered and directed "to order a competent allowance to ſuch miniſter;" and the manner in which the aſſeſſment ſhall be made, &amp;c. is pointed out.</p>
                     <p>In the next paragraph it is ordained, that if any town ſhall be deſtitute of a miniſter "qualified as aforeſaid,"— "ſix months"—the ſaid court of quarter-ſeſſions, after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king certain ſteps to induce the inhabitants to conform to the law in reſpect of the ſettlement of a miniſter, ſhall, if this proves ineffectual, themſelves <q>take effectual care to procure and ſettle a miniſter qualified as aforeſaid, and order the charge thereof, and of ſuch miniſters MAINTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANCE to be levied on the inhabitants of ſuch town.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is afterwards enacted, that every town having <q>fifty houſholders or upwards, ſhall be conſtantly provided of a <hi>Schoolmaſter</hi> to teach children to read and write.</q> But towns that have "one hundred families," are obliged to be provided with "Grammar ſchools." &amp;c.

DIVERS acts, relating to the ſettlement and ſupport of the goſpel miniſtry here, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the royal ſanction, our churches ſeem to have a proper <hi>legal</hi> eſtabliſhment. And it ought to be particularly remembered, that the act aforeſaid was paſſed about nine years before the Society's charter was granted. Can it then be ſuppoſed that this province, where ſuch proviſion was made for the ſettlement, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintenance of an "able, learned, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. miniſtry," was either one of thoſe plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. intended in the Society's charter, where the proviſion for miniſters was "very mean;" or one of thoſe which were "<hi>wholly</hi> deſtitute and unprovided of a maintenance for miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;" ſo that the King's ſubjects "ſeemed to be abandoned to <hi>atheiſm</hi> and <hi>infidelity</hi>;" or were, for want of <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>orthodox</hi> miniſters to inſtruct them "in the principles of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion," in imminent danger of being perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to "popiſh ſuperſtition and idolatry! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the charter cannot in reaſon be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009441_0042_0F748D9683A9DDC0"/>to have had the leaſt reference to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or any other Britiſh plantation, where a ſimilar proviſion was or ſhould be made for the adminiſtration of God's word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p n="6">6. CHURCHES and ſchools have from time to time been founded, and are continually multiplying in New-England, in conformity both to the pious inclinations of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and to the legal proviſion made for thoſe purpoſes. A competent number of young men have alſo been educated from time to time in the Colleges of Maſſachuſetts-Bay and Connecticut, for the ſupply of both. And our <hi>ordinations</hi> are carried on in a regular, orderly and <hi>ſcriptural</hi> way; at leaſt according to our own conceptions: And we have doubtleſs as good a right to judge for ourſelves as to that matter, as the Society have to judge for us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. THE people of New-England, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in thoſe two principal governments of it, are all in general profeſſed Chriſtians. There is no ſuch monſter as an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> known amongſt us; hardly any ſuch perſon as a <hi>Deiſt.</hi> And as to the ſuperſtitions and idolatries of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there neither is, nor has been the leaſt danger of their gaining ground in New-England. The Congregationaliſts and Preſbyterians are known to hold them <hi>at leaſt</hi> in as great abhorrence as the Epiſcopalians do. And ſince the revolution, hardly a Roman-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic, except ſome few tranſient perſons, has
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009441_0043_0F748D97407D7D00"/>been ſeen in New-England, till after remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the French from Nova-Scotia, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing them in the colonies. Theſe are a plain, ſimple, ignorant people, who have now no Romiſh prieſts or Jeſuits amongſt them; and by whom we are ſurely in no danger of being perverted from the proteſtant faith. How much better then, in all theſe reſpects, is the ſtate of religion amongſt us, than it is even in England, under the immediate eye and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments of the venerable biſhops? Where, notwithſtanding all their pious endeavours, there are ſo many Roman-catholics, Infidels and Sceptics, if not right down Atheiſts! It may be added, that the common people in New-England, by means of our ſchools, and the inſtructions of our "able, learned, orthodox miniſters", are, and have all along been, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and divines in compariſon of the common people in England, of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the church there eſtabliſhed. This is commonly ſaid by thoſe who have had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity perſonally to inform themſelves: And a rationale might be given of the fact, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without any reflexion on the church aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="8">8. AS to practical religion, tho' we have no cauſe for boaſting, yet, to ſay the leaſt, we have no cauſe for bluſhing on a compariſon of our morals with thoſe of the people in England, in the communion of that church: And many vices that are common there, are
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009441_0044_0F748D97FA4490A0"/>almoſt, if not quite unknown here. So that if we appeal to fact and experience, there is much leſs danger of irreligion in principle or practice, and of Romiſh ſuperſtition and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry prevailing in New-England, amongſt the Presbyterians and Congregationaliſts, for want of learned, orthodox and pious miniſters "to inſtruct them in the principles of <hi>true religion,</hi>" than there is of their prevailing in England: Tho' in the <hi>Abſtracts</hi> annexed to the biſhop of Clogher's ſermon before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, 1714, (p. 53.) there is indeed an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that the <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> in America are in imminent danger of falling into thoſe errors, for want of biſhops to reſide amongſt them. And ſhould any be ſent hither, to prevent theſe evils amongſt the people of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it is to be hoped they will have better ſucceſs in ſo pious an undertaking, than the biſhops have hitherto had in England—</p>
               <p n="9">9. FROM the foregoing faithful, tho' brief repreſentation of religion in New-England, from the time that the firſt ſettlers of it were perſecuted out of England by the eſtabliſhed church, to the preſent, (I ſpeak particularly of the two principal governments of New-England) it appears that there neither is nor has been any occaſion for the Society to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port miſſions and ſchools here; and that they had not even a warrant for doing ſo, by their charter. New-England (the two ſmall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of New-Hampſhire and Rhode-Iſland
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009441_0045_0F748D98F59F0530"/>excepted) does by no means anſwer to the deſcription of thoſe plantations, &amp;c. in the charter, for ſupporting "God's public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip" in which, a charitable proviſion is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made.</p>
               <p>IF it ſhould be ſaid, (which is the moſt plauſible thing that can be ſaid) that in ſome parts even of the Maſſachuſetts and Connecſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, the proviſion made for the maintenance of miniſters has been "very mean," and that therefore they come within the true deſign of the charter; ſeveral things may be obſerved in anſwer hereto. Firſt, good miniſters of JESUS CHRIST, who have the intereſt of religion at heart, do not aſpire after worldly <hi>riches, pomp</hi> and <hi>grandeur.</hi> Secondly, the proviſion for miniſters here, tho' not to be compared with the rich benefices in England, has not yet been ſo "very mean," but that a competent number of learned and orthodox miniſters have been found to ſupply our churches. Thirdly, the government here, which took the ſupport of miniſters into conſideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Society was founded, muſt in reaſon be ſuppoſed more capable of judging, what a competent proviſion for them is, in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than the venerable Society. But, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if notwithſtanding this legal proviſion, a number of them in ſome of our poor, ſmall, or frontier towns, have been "very meanly" provided for; (which is not denied) and this is alledged as bringing ſuch places within the true
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009441_0046_0F748D9978DDC8F8"/>intent of the charter; I will allow the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and validity of the argument, upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two following ſuppoſitions. Firſt, that the charitable Society have remitted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from time to time to <hi>our</hi> poor, tho' learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, orthodox and pious miniſters, ſettled in <hi>ſuch</hi> places, for their help and encouragement; which would have been quite agreeable to the ſpirit of the charter, and the catholic princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the royal <hi>Grantor,</hi> however aliene it might poſſibly have been from the principles and views of the epiſcopal <hi>Grantees.</hi> Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if it appears that the Society have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually eſtabliſhed their <hi>own</hi> miſſions in ſuch poor, little or expoſed places only, inſtead of doing it in our richeſt and moſt populous towns, where the beſt proviſion was before made for miniſters. But if neither of theſe things can be made to appear, it will be in vain, and indeed a piece of hypocriſy, to allege the "very mean" ſupport of miniſters here, as an argument for the Society's applying a great part of their revenue for the maintenance of God's public worſhip in New-England.</p>
               <p>That there was very little, or rather no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for Miſſionaries in New-England, Mr. HOBART has very pertinently produced the teſtimony of the pious and judicious Dr. BRAY, who, before the Society's incorporation, was the biſhop of London's commiſſary in Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. This worthy divine took great pains to inform himſelf of the ſtate of religion in
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009441_0047_0F748D9A39D98A30"/>the colonies, and their various exigencies; of which he publiſhed an Account, and delivered it as the reſult of his inquiries, that <q>from New-York northward, he found <hi>very little need</hi> of miſſionaries for the propagation of chriſtianity; and in the colonies of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut and the Maſſachuſetts NONE AT ALL.<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Second Addreſs,</hi> &amp;c. p. 126.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS teſtimony of Dr. BRAY ought to have the more weight, not only becauſe he was ſuch a leading man with reference to the charitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution aforeſaid, as to have been honoured with name of "the Father of the Society"; but becauſe of the great reſpect with which I find the Society ſpeaking of him, of his conduct in, and his account of the Affairs of America, in the following words— <q>The Lord biſhop of London—did afterwards ſend over the Rev. Dr. THOMAS BRAY, as his commiſſary to Maryland; who being aſſiſted—did ſettle and ſupport ſeveral new miniſters in that province, and did fix and furniſh ſome parochial libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and did other public ſervices, of which he has himſelf given a TRUE and modeſt account <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Account of the Society,</hi> p. 14.</note>
                  </q>.</p>
               <p>IT is ſubmitted to the judgment of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial reader, whether the aforeſaid teſtimony of Dr. BRAY, ſo inquiſitive, obſerving and active a man, is not more than a balance to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> produces from the Dean, afterward bp. BERKLEY's ſermon before
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009441_0048_0F748D9B05ED5968"/>the Society;—"that the likelieſt Step towards converting the heathen, would be to begin with the Engliſh. The miſſionaries do good ſervice in bringing them to <hi>a ſerious ſenſe of religion,</hi>" &amp;c <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> p. 19.</note>. The excellent Dr. BERKLEY lived a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe, ſtudious life the greateſt part of the time he was in N. England; and that in the ſmall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rhode-Iſland, where there was indeed then but little of the <hi>face</hi> of religion,—except perhaps among our good <hi>friends</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi>— Beſides; he does not ſpeak particularly of N. England, or any part thereof, but of the colonies in general; thinking that the miſſionaries in them do good ſervice in bringing the Engliſh to a <hi>ſerious ſenſe of religion.</hi> Which is doubtleſs true as to ſome of the colonies: Tho' the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut had at leaſt as <hi>ſerious a ſenſe of religion,</hi> long before there was a ſingle miſſionary in them, as they have had ſince. And Dr. BRAY is expreſs, that in theſe two colonies, there was no occaſion AT ALL for miſſionaries <hi>to propagate chriſtianity</hi>: And the Society ſay, he gave a TRUE account of things in America. So that if they ſend miſſionaries into theſe colonies, it cannot be ſo much to propagate <hi>chriſtianity,</hi> as to propagate <hi>ſomething diſtinct from it, viz.</hi> the <hi>peculiarities</hi> of the church of England.</p>

               <p>THAT the Society have <hi>chiefly</hi> ſent their miſſionaries into thoſe Britiſh plantations where they were much needed, according to the true deſign of their inſtitution; and that they have hereby ſerved the intereſt of religion in them, is by no means denied: It were very criminal to deny them the praiſe that is juſtly due to them in this reſpect. But, that they have deviated from their original plan according to the charter, in ſome other reſpects; and thereby left undone much of the good which they might probably have effected, with the ordinary bleſſing of God, may perhaps be equally evident from this and the following ſections. Moſt of the following facts are very notorious, even from the anniverſary ſermons, <hi>abſtracts,</hi> and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications of the Society; ſo that they will not be denied.</p>
               <p n="1">1. FOR ſeveral years, I think about eight or nine, after the Society was founded, they ſent no miſſionary into N. England. Which may naturally be looked on as one argument, that it was not originally conſidered among thoſe plantations
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009441_0050_0F748D9C9B80F078"/>which were ſuppoſed to ſtand in need of their charity <note n="†" place="bottom">There was no church of E. in N. E. till about the year 1678 or 1679, in the reign of the unhappy, infatuated Roman-catholic K. <hi>James</hi> II. and the adminiſtration of the Roman-catholic Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Sir <hi>Edmond Andros,</hi> in this Province. It was at this time that <q>the Ld. bp. of London, upon an addreſs of ſeveral of the inhabitants of <hi>Boſton</hi> did prevail with his Majeſty [aforeſaid] that a church ſhould be allowed in that town, for the exerciſe of religion according to the church of E.</q> [<hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Society,</hi> p. 11.] If I miſtake not, there was no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary from the Society in N. E. till about the year 1710. It is not material: In the year 1718 there were only three of them in all N. E. <hi>viz,</hi> one at Rhode-Iſland, another at Marblehead, and a third at Newbury; according to the <hi>abſtract</hi> for that year, p. 44.</note>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THEY have from time to time, ſince they began to ſend miſſionaries into theſe parts, been adding to their number, ſupporting epiſcopal ſchools, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IT is alſo to be obſerved, that a very <hi>large proportion</hi> of their miſſionaries have fallen to the ſhare of N.

               <p>IT does not appear from the <hi>abſtracts,</hi> that the Society have any miſſionaries at all in the other W. India Iſlands, where, as is commonly reported, there is hardly any ſhew of public worſhip kept up, of any kind; and where there are ſo many thouſands of Negro ſlaves in total ignorance of chriſtianity.

               <p n="3">3. IT is notorious that the miſſionaries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being ſent to the frontier and other poor Towns in N.

It is not denied, however, that there arc a few miſſions eſtabliſhed in N. England, particularly in Rhode-Iſland government, where they might be needed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It needs not to be proved, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that theſe miſſions, &amp;c. have not been ſupported, but at a large annual expence of the Society. The amount of the ſalaries here, excluſive of books to be diſtributed, &amp;c. for the year 1761, was about £. 1270 ſterling, according to the <hi>abſtract.</hi> The other expences of the Society for N. England being added hereto, might probably make up the ſum of £.1500 ſterl. <hi>communibus annis,</hi> for many years paſt: Tho' I pretend not to be very exact in this calculation.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:009441_0053_0F748DA12129B348"/>5. TO thoſe who are well acquainted with N. England, and the manner and circumſtances in which epiſcopal churches have been gathered and founded here, it appears that the Society have manifeſted a <hi>ſufficient</hi> forwardneſs to encourage and increaſe <hi>ſmall diſaffected</hi> parties in our towns, upon an application to them;—in thoſe towns, I mean, where a regular, legal and due proviſion was already made for the ſupport of God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip. Some of theſe little parties, or rather factions, it is well known here, have taken their riſe from no fixed principle of a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſſent from our manner of worſhip, but from mere levity, petulance or avarice;—from ſome trifling, groundleſs diſguſt at the ſtated mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; or a diſſatisfaction about pews and rates; or at their being under, or likely to come under cenſure for their immoral practices. I do not affirm poſitively, that either of theſe has always been the caſe, without exception: But, that it often has been, is as well known amongſt us, as a thing of that nature can be known. Theſe people being thus affronted and angry without cauſe, preſently declare for the <hi>church,</hi> without really knowing any thing of the ſtate of the controverſy; and apply to ſome miſſionary or miſſionaries, to recommend them to the charity of the Society. And divers of the miſſionaries have been much injured, (which there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe) if they have not been very buſy in intrigues in order to foment theſe diviſions and parties, <hi>for the good of the church</hi>; yea,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:009441_0054_0F748DA1E91EF658"/>been at the bottom of them. In which they perhaps thought, they conformed to the true deſign of that ſtanding direction of the Society to their miſſionaries; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſit—thoſe that <hi>oppoſe</hi> them, or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> from them, to convince and reclaim them—</q> They add indeed, <q>with a ſpirit of meekneſs and gentleneſs;</q> which ſeems not to have been ſo much remembered in all caſes, as the other branch of the direction.</p>
               <p>BUT from whatever cauſe theſe little diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented parties have generally taken their origin, in towns where there were learned and orthodox miniſters duly ſupported; thus much is certain, that they have not only been recommended to the Society from time to time, but been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thereby, and had miſſionaries ſent to them. The number of theſe humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants in a town, have ſometimes not exceeded eight, ten or twelve heads of families; and this in towns conſiſting of two or three hundred families. It is commonly, and I believe truly ſaid, that there are ſcarce ſo many as ten fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the town of Cambridge, which uſually attend the ſervice of the church lately ſet up therein, but about half a quarter of a mile from the College, and from the meeting-houſe there. What is this but ſetting up altar againſt altar? And ſome there are, who think the principal end, and true ſpirit of that miſſion was not ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by an epiſcopalian, who, as is reported, expreſſed himſelf thus on the occaſion— <q>I
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:009441_0055_0F748DA2792A00B0"/>don't care for them; we have now got a church in the very <hi>munns</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">A cant term well underſtood among us.</note> of 'em.</q> It is a known fact, that in ſome other churches, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>abſtracts,</hi> have been repreſented as growing, flouriſhing, and increaſing in reputation for near half a century, the number of ſtated worſhippers at this day very little, if any thing, exceeds ten or twelve families. Theſe ſmall parties thus encouraged and ſupported by the Society in different parts of New-England at a great expence, have in ſhort all the appearance of entering wedges; or rather of little lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made in carrying on the cruſade, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſiege of our churches, with the hope that they will one day ſubmit to an epiſcopal ſovereign. And it will appear at leaſt probable in the ſequel, that this has long been the formal deſign of the Society; and that it is the true plan, and grand myſtery of their operations in New-England.</p>
               <p n="6">6. IT is well known to us in New-England, that after ſupporting and encouraging theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle parties, till in ſome places they have, by one means or other, become conſiderable both for number and riches, and well able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their own miniſters; the Society have ſtill continued to pay theſe out of their charitable fund. The only reaſon why I do not come to particulars here, is, left it ſhould ſeem too invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. This conduct of the Society, for ſome years proved no inconſiderable means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the church-party: I mean, till a law of this province was made, obliging the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:009441_0056_0F748DA333BD50C8"/>to pay miniſterial rates in common with other people; the money levied on them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to go to the ſupport of <hi>their own clergy.</hi> This law ſeemed to give ſome check to the progreſs of epiſcopacy, and a zeal for the liturgy, in New-England. And if there had been no ſuch act, or the epiſcopalians had been exempted from all miniſterial taxes, as the Quakers are, almoſt all who loved their money better than <hi>any thing elſe,</hi> might in the courſe of a few years have declared themſelves for, and adorned the communion of the church— But this is not deſigned as a general reflexion on the people of that communion here; ſome of whom are doubtleſs perſons of principle, and ſincere piety.</p>

                     <p>I AM altogether a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to you, and muſt needs be <hi>unknown</hi>; for my name is much too <hi>little</hi> to have been heard of by perſons of your <hi>dignity</hi> in the eſtabliſhed church.

                     <p>NEITHER our <hi>own</hi> people in thoſe parts, nor their African <hi>ſlaves,</hi> nor their <hi>Indian</hi> neighbours have ought to accuſe us of. At leaſt we have given no juſt <hi>offence</hi> to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> there, nor to the church of God.

We give our money, our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, our correſpondence, our ſeveral ſorts of care, pains and trouble: Forgive us this wrong: If we have done any other, God do ſo to us, and more alſo.</p>
                     <p>SIR, there is ſuch an air of <hi>ſincerity</hi> in theſe words, that I cannot but have a perfect <hi>eſteem</hi> of the good, and truly noble ſpirit breathed in them. I doubt not but you fully believe as
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:009441_0058_0F748DA4C06D15C8"/>you ſpeak, and are accepted by God in your pious deſires of ſerving the intereſts of religion in theſe remote parts of the earth. I greatly honor the <hi>intentions</hi> of your moſt honourable Society, their abundant labors and expence.</p>
                     <p>A MORE noble charity never was projected than your ſending the <hi>goſpel</hi> among the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> here, and into <hi>heatheniſh</hi> places, where the ſettlements have been made void of the form of religion. The <hi>harveſt</hi> of this nature is too plentious thro' <hi>Virginia, Maryland,</hi> the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> our <hi>Eaſtern</hi> country alſo, and the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganſett,</hi> and ſome places about <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> which have been too long <hi>neglected,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to run wild into <hi>ſectaries,</hi> and prejudicies againſt any miniſtry of the word at all.</p>
                     <p>THIS <hi>vaſt</hi> and <hi>waſte</hi> ſpace, deſolate and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, cries aloud to you for your charitable care: And verily the <hi>fund</hi> which the Society has contributed and gathered is but too little yet by far, for theſe neceſſitous places; while at the ſame time many of your miſſions into our parts, are unto places where the goſpel is received and preached, and churches gathered in very good order and manner.—I cannot but let you know my thoughts, that the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and honourable Society have been once and again miſled, and even impoſed on by miſ-informations, and private deſigns and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, of perſons and parties here, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend (and ſo neceſſarily pervert) great portions of their noble charity, to ſuch <hi>ends</hi> and in ſuch <hi>manner</hi> as do not at all anſwer the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:009441_0059_0F748DA5743BA888"/>of the goſpel</hi> among us, but which do really break in upon and hinder the ſpreading and ſucceſs of it. To evince which, I will fairly put the caſe, and offer an inſtance or two.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt give me leave, Sir, to ſuppoſe a <hi>town</hi> and <hi>towns</hi> here, wherein <hi>religion</hi> is ſettled, <hi>miniſters</hi> legally fixed, the word of God faithfully <hi>preached,</hi> and the <hi>ſacraments</hi> of Chriſt adminiſtred; and yet there happen a diſcontented perſon or two in the place; or ſome difference about the placing a new <hi>houſe</hi> for public worſhip, or about paying their little <hi>rate</hi> to the miniſtry, or the like: Immediately they are adviſed, or in their own mind they propoſe to themſelves, <q>Let us ſend over to the <hi>Lord biſhop of London,</hi> or to the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Society for propagating the goſpel, for a miniſter of the church of England! He will bring a ſalary of £. 50 ſterling</q>—Now ſuppoſe, Sir, they actually ſend and obtain, I demand, whether it be not a real injury and <hi>abuſe</hi> of the Society and their charity; their declared end, and the proper <hi>uſe</hi> of ſo <hi>great a gift</hi> as fifty pound <hi>per annum</hi> is?—Yet are there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſuch notorious inſtances in our <hi>New-Engliſh provinces.</hi> One was lately in the town of <hi>Braintree,</hi> within ten miles of <hi>Boſton,</hi> which <hi>application</hi> to you the Rev. Mr. <hi>Miles</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> refuſed to countenance; and was free to ſay, that were the circumſtances of the place known, my Lord of <hi>London</hi> and the Society would never approve of it: For it is a notorious matter of fact, that ſetting aſide

                        <hi>two families</hi> in that party at <hi>Braintree,</hi> the reſt neither <hi>know why</hi> they ſought the <hi>church wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> there, nor could be any <hi>credit</hi> to it. Their number was ſo very <hi>minute,</hi> and their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſo very <hi>mean,</hi> that when a miniſter was ſent to them, he was <hi>aſhamed</hi> of his errand, and diverted to ſome other place of ſervice.</p>
                     <p>THIS laſt year a difference happened in the town of <hi>Newbury</hi> about placing their <hi>meeting-houſe</hi>: The matter was brought before our <hi>general court,</hi> who determined it according to the free vote and act of the <hi>precinct,</hi> whereby they had obliged themſelves to each other. Whereupon a number of them declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the <hi>church of England</hi>; many of them, I will ſuppoſe, perſons of ſobriety and virtue, only in a <hi>pet,</hi> and to ſave their <hi>rate</hi> to their aged and worthy miniſter, Mr. Belcher; utterly <hi>ignorant</hi> of the church they declare for, nor <hi>offended</hi> in the leaſt with the form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or dicipline which they turn from;—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till now among the moſt <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> diſſenters.—</p>
                     <p>IN ſhort, Sir, there is a <hi>ſordid motive</hi> which will find you <hi>beggars</hi> enough for your charity in our country-towns! if you will free them from <hi>rates</hi> to any miniſtry, and <hi>maintain</hi> it for them—You will beſt judge, Sir, if there be no <hi>offence</hi> to the church of God, in the ſteps taken by too many, <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there.</hi>—</p>

               <head>SECTION VIII.
That the aforeſaid Conduct of the <hi>Society</hi> is not agreeable to the Letter or Spirit of their Charter.</head>
               <p>SUPPOSING the truth of the <hi>principal</hi> facts repreſented in the foregoing ſections; particularly as to the ſtate of religion in New-England, the number of miſſionaries, &amp;c. maintained here by the Society, and the places in which they are ſupported; which I conſider as the <hi>principal</hi> facts, even in diſtinction from the <hi>diſhonourable manner</hi> in which epiſcopal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have often aroſe, been encouraged and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed here; (which is conſidered only as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental circumſtance, not a principal fact, upon which the argument finally turns) Suppoſing the truth of thoſe facts, I ſay, almoſt any unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced perſon may eaſily ſee, that ſuch a conduct in the Society is not conformable to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in any one material circumſtance, but eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially repugnant thereto. The contraſt, or the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition betwixt the charter and ſuch a conduct, may be made to appear in a very few words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT is allowed on all hands, that one mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial end of this inſtitution, according to the charter, was, <hi>propagating the goſpel</hi> among the <hi>heathen</hi> bordering on the Britiſh plantations. But no one will pretend to ſay, that the miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in New-England are employed directly in <hi>that good work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:009441_0064_0F748DAA2BD0CC00"/>2. ANOTHER end was, the maintaining a public worſhip in thoſe colonies, where the people, tho' called Chriſtians, were <q>
                     <hi>wholly</hi> deſtitute and unprovided,</q>—where they <q>wanted the adminiſtration of God's word and ſacraments, and ſeemed to be abandoned to <hi>atheiſm</hi> and infidelity,</q> &amp;c. But, that this neither is, nor ever was, the true ſtate of New-England, at leaſt not of the Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut, is ſufficiently apparent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. ANOTHER end of the inſtitution, which is indeed the firſt mentioned in the charter, was, the benefit and aſſiſtance of thoſe plantations, in which, tho' there were ſuch miniſters as are deſigned in the charter, yet there was not a tolerable or competent proviſion made for their ſubſiſtence; or, in the words of the charter, in which the proviſion made for them was "very mean." Whereas it is a known fact, that in moſt of thoſe places in New-England where the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſupport miſſions, there was a legal and competent proviſion before made for the ſupport of an "able, learned, orthodox miniſtry."</p>
               <p n="4">4. THESE three are the <hi>only</hi> ends of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution expreſly mentioned in, or that can fairly be inferred from the charter of the Society. And conſequently, if they have annually expended a large ſum here in New-England, not conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to either of them, this muſt needs be a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application. Whatever they have expended, more or leſs, to accompliſh ends different from theſe, or ſuch as are not directly ſubſervient to them, has been laid out in a manner not warranted
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:009441_0065_0F748DAACC1BD698"/>by the charter; and therefore perverted and alienated from the true, important ends of their inſtitution.

               <head>SECTION IX.
Of Objections againſt the Reaſoning in the preceeding Sections; and particularly as to a <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>orthodox</hi> Miniſtry.</head>
               <p>IF the facts aforeſaid are allowed, no <hi>ſolid objection,</hi> it is conceived, can be brought againſt the general concluſion as to the perverſion or miſapplication of the Society's charity; tho' a perſon who ſets himſelf to invent <hi>evaſions,</hi> may poſſibly think of a number of <hi>weak</hi> ones. And the ingenious Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> has been ſo lucky as to hit upon ſeveral ſuch in his <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> deſigned to vindicate the Society againſt that charge, which has often been brought againſt their conduct in reſpect of New-England. One of theſe evaſions has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been hinted at: But it may be proper to ſpeak of it a little more diſtinctly, tho' briefly, here—It is ſaid, the miniſters ſpoken of in the charter, are ſpoken of under the deſignation of "learned and orthodox."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:009441_0066_0F748DAB8C6D32B8"/>NOW, as to <hi>learning</hi>; tho' the miniſters edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in our young, but growing Colleges in New-England, may not vie with this gentleman, who brought with him the <hi>advantageous</hi> repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a conſiderable Scholar from one of the ancient and renowned Britiſh Univerſities, in which, it is ſaid, he reaped ſome laurels;—a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which he doubtleſs merited; yet, as the truly knowing and learned, are generally <hi>candid</hi> alſo, it is hoped that he will not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny <hi>that qualification</hi> to our clergy, in the degree neceſſary to render them uſeful and ſufficient miniſters, provided they are not defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the other material point, <hi>orthodoxy.</hi> And, to do the gentleman juſtice, he ſeems wholly to wave the former, and to deny our clergy <hi>nothing but orthodoxy</hi>; in which, other people generally ſuppoſe, they are not deficient. After mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as the primary deſign of the inſtitution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, to <q>provide a maintenance for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox clergy;</q> he ſubjoins, <q>which (as the charter was obtained by the members of the church of England) muſt, in all reaſonable conſtruction, mean a clergy of their own church.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Conſid.</hi> p. 11.</note> So that, there being no ſuch miniſters amongſt <hi>Us,</hi> in the ſenſe of the charter, it was incumbent upon the Society to ſupply Boſton, Cambridge, &amp;c. &amp;c. with <hi>orthodox</hi> miſſionaries: in doing which, they conform to the original and <hi>charitable</hi> deſign of their inſtitution. This is the obvious intent of what the gentleman ſays upon this head; tho', for certain prudential rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he did not chuſe, in a more explicit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:009441_0067_0F748DAC48A06790"/>to monopolize <hi>all the orthodoxy</hi> in New-England to himſelf, the other miſſionaries, and the people of the church of England; ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing all our miniſters and churches as <hi>heretical</hi> or <hi>unorthodox.</hi> This is indeed the unavoidable conſequence of his appropriating and confining the terms <hi>orthodox miniſters,</hi> to thoſe of the epiſcopal communion. But, to have reproached us thus in plain words, might have been a <hi>bolder</hi> ſtroke than the <hi>times</hi> would well bear as yet; and ſo, rather prejudiced than ſerved the cauſe in which he engaged. This might perhaps have contributed to fruſtrate the modeſt hopes which he expreſſed of great acceſſions to the epiſcopal party at Cambridge, in his letter to the Society ſoon after his miſſion there, dated Aug. 30. 1760. ſome time before the church was <q>fit for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice.</q> For it is ſaid in the <hi>abſtract</hi> printed in 1761, that Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> had written, that the <q>building of the church was in ſuch forwardneſs, that he hoped it would be fit for divine ſervice in <hi>November</hi>; and particular care had been taken to make the ſtructure uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and durable, as well as decently elegant; and, in caſe of <hi>future acceſſions</hi> to the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, it might be <hi>eaſily enlarged</hi>; and he had the ſatisfaction to add, that it <hi>already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi> to be one of the <hi>beſt ſupported,</hi> and <hi>moſt flouriſhing churches in</hi> America.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Abſtract,</hi> 1761. p. 44, 45.</note> It would doubtleſs be a great pity that the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's wiſhes and expectations ſhould prove abortive, if there is no <hi>orthodox</hi> miniſter in Cambridge beſides himſelf, tho' there are three
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:009441_0068_0F748DACFB76FDF0"/>of our congregational churches, as well as the College, in that town.</p>
               <p>BUT the following conſiderations, ſome of which were before hinted at, (p. 21) will be ſufficient to ſhew that our miniſters are not deſtitute of <hi>orthodoxy,</hi> altho' they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts to the church of England; and that the gentleman is a little too ſelfiſh, in endeavouring to engroſs the whole of that precious <hi>commodity</hi> to himſelf and his party. Tho' if <hi>orthodoxy</hi> has the property which an eminent divine of the church of England <note n="‡" place="bottom">Bp. HARE, <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Diſcouragements,</hi> &amp;c.</note> ſarcaſtically aſcribes to it,—that of "covering a multitude of ſins," I will not deny, but yet do not affirm, that they have rather more <hi>occaſion</hi> for it than thoſe whom they would ſtrip of it, leaving them nothing <hi>better</hi> than <hi>charity</hi> to ſupply its place—</p>
               <p>ORTHODOXY, in the commonly-received ſenſe of the word amongſt proteſtants at leaſt, notwithſtanding its general etemology, relates particularly to doctrinal points, or articles of faith, as diſtinguiſhed from opinions about the beſt modes of eccleſiaſtic polity, external or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, rites and ceremonies. To theſe latter it has no reference in its moſt common uſe. And it can hardly be ſuppoſed, that a gentleman ſo well ſkilled in Chriſtian philology as Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp,</hi> will diſpute this point.</p>
               <p>FROM whence it follows, that miniſters or churches differing widely in opinion about an hierarchy, diſcipline, and modes of worſhip, may yet be equally orthodox; agreeing nearly in the ſame common faith reſpecting GOD, JESUS CHRIST, his offices and redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:009441_0069_0F748DADC40B4740"/>IT is alſo a known fact, that the miniſters and churches in New-England, with a very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, if any, agree in doctrinal points, and therefore in reſpect of orthodoxy, with the church of England, according to her articles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to theſe points.</p>
               <p>IT is moreover known, or at leaſt generally ſuppoſed amongſt us, that our New-England mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, a very few excepted, adhere much more cloſely in their preaching, both to the letter and ſpirit of thoſe doctrinal articles, than moſt of the epiſcopal clergy themſelves, whether here or in England. And if this be fact, as I am fully perſuaded it is, the former are really <hi>more</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox than the latter, even according to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their own church. Beſides:</p>
               <p>BY the ſame rule that this gentleman and ſome others deny our miniſters the title of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, limiting it to the "clergy of their own church;" they muſt deny it to the miniſters of the eſtabliſhed church of Scotland, and of all other churches, except perhaps that of Rome. For none of them fully agree with the church of England, except in doctrinal points, as we alſo do; which, it ſeems, is not ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate them orthodox. According to which pretence, there will be no orthodox miniſters in the world, except of the church of England: And is not this very modeſt and candid!</p>
               <p>DIVERS of <hi>our</hi> laws relative to miniſters, and in which they are deſigned as orthodox, having had the allowance of the King, the head of the Engliſh church, this ſeems to be a royal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:009441_0070_0F748DAE8F7A91F8"/>of their orthodoxy. And is it not ſomewhat preſumptuous for any of the members of that body to contradict their head!</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING thoſe miniſters and churches in England, with which ours in New-England very nearly agree in doctrine, diſcipline and worſhip, have often been accuſed by the epiſcopalians as <hi>ſchiſmatical,</hi> on account of their diſſent from the church there eſtabliſhed; yet they have not often been reproached as hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, heretical or un-orthodox in that reſpect. So far from it, that I do not think there can be a ſingle epiſcopal divine of reputation produced, or other approved writer on that ſide within a century paſt, who has taxed them in a body as heretics, or denied them to be orthodox, on account of their non-conformity. Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſeems to have forgotten that the epiſcopal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in England, even in their higheſt flights, have generally diſtinguiſhed betwixt heterodoxy and ſchiſm; while he, it ſeems, is for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding them together, and will not allow us to be orthodox even in New-England, unleſs we will become conformiſts to a church that is not eſtabliſhed here.</p>
               <p>IT has before been obſerved, how unnatural it is to ſuppoſe that King WILLIAM deſigned to limit the terms "orthodox miniſters" in the charter, to thoſe of the church of England; and thereby to brand the miniſters of all other proteſtant churches as heterodox; which were to ſuppoſe that catholic-ſpirited Prince as great a bigot as any of his royal predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:009441_0071_0F748DAF95E122A0"/>BESIDES: The whole air and complexion of the charter are catholic in the higheſt degree: There is no hint or alluſion therein as to any differences amongſt proteſtants. The grand end propoſed therein, is propagating the <hi>goſpel,</hi> the principles of <hi>true religion,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian religion,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>atheiſm, infidelity</hi> and <hi>popery</hi>: And orthodox miniſters ſtand there in direct oppoſition to popiſh prieſts and jeſuits; as before obſerved. It is therefore contrary to all the rules of good criticiſm, as well as to catholic chriſtianity, to appropriate and confine theſe terms to the miniſters of the church of England, and thereby to hereticate the miniſters of all other proteſtant churches. Nothing can be leſs conformable to the language, and whole ſpirit of the charter.</p>
               <p>IF this argument of Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> were of any force, it is not eaſy to ſee why the Society might not ſend miſſionaries into Scotland to convert the kirk to epiſcopacy, by virtue of their charter, as well as into New-England, to convert us; excepting only that Scotland is not a "plantation, colony or factory beyond ſeas;" and, in that reſpect, certainly not within the deſign of the charter.</p>
               <p>THIS point may be now diſmiſſed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding the reader of the reply of Mr. HOBART to ſome of his antagoniſts, relative thereto. "If," ſaid he, <q>they think that none but the clergy of the church of England are in a legal ſenſe <hi>orthodox</hi> miniſters, Dr. MACSPARRAN can inform them how that matter was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined

Where they learn this ſilly cant, it is not worth while to enquire I am not willing to impute ſuch pitiful conceits to the ingenious Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>; eſpecially ſince his anonimous friend in the piece dated at Cambridge the 25th March laſt, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the New-England <hi>Chronicle,</hi> ſpeaks of him as no bigot, but a catholic-ſpirited gentleman;—as one who is <q>ſo far from thinking every punctilio in the modes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip eſtabliſhed in the church of England, <hi>jure divino,</hi> that he makes no ſcruple to confeſs even to thoſe who <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede</hi> from her, that he is of opinion no particular mode of worſhip can be preciſely aſcertained from any thing re-revealed in the new teſtament, and that therefore mutual forbearance ought to he exerciſed in this reſpect.</q>— as one <q>publickly averring he deſired not <hi>to make one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte from the congregational</hi> CHURCH;</q>—and <q>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a friendly interchange of viſits with its PASTOR</q> —There ſeems, however, to be ſome difficulty in reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this declaration, that he <hi>deſires not to make one proſelyte from the congregational church,</hi> with the hopes expreſſed in his letter to the Society, of <hi>future acceſſions to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>; ſo that there might be occaſion for <hi>enlarging</hi> the church, &amp;c.

               <p>BY way of anſwer to the objection ſo often made againſt the Society's conduct in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting miſſions in thoſe colonies, where the people <q>have the means of religion already, in other proteſtant communions;</q> Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> ſays, <q>This is not univerſally true: or wherever it happily is true; this brings us back to the claim of liberty of <hi>conſcience.</hi> The means of religion are NO MEANS to him whoſe <hi>conſcience</hi> cannot uſe, or does not approve them: no more than Popery or Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm afford the means of religion to a good Proteſtant, who happens to reſide in Popiſh or Mahometan countries.</q>

                     <hi>Conſid.</hi> p. 14.</note> Something of this ſort has been ſaid in divers of the anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſermons before the Society: And Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> might perhaps take the hint from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prelate <q>who now ſo worthily <hi>preſides over the church of England,</hi>
                  </q> [I hope he meant in ſubordination to the King] <q>AND THE SOCIETY ITSELF;</q> (<hi>Conſ.</hi> p. 19.) This great Prelate, a diſtinguiſhed member of the Society, is one of the two witneſſes whom Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſummons to bear "teſtimony" in favor of the Society, after producing that of
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:009441_0074_0F748DB29A4E11E0"/>Biſhop BERKLEY, another member of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, in this cauſe. Speaking of whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly, he ſays, he <q>confidently reſts his <hi>proof</hi> on the unexceptionable teſtimony of two moſt candid and truly Chriſtian Prelates,</q> &amp;c. (p. 18.) The teſtimony of the worthy Biſhop BERKLEY has already been taken notice of. The other of theſe witneſſes is quoted by Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> as having given an anſwer ſimilar to his own, to the objection aforeſaid, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words—<q>An objection to the conduct of the Society, is that they have ſent miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſome places in which there were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Chriſtian aſſemblies eſtabliſhed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. But in the <hi>leſt</hi> exceptionable of <hi>theſe aſſemblies,</hi> there are ſeveral things, which the <hi>conſciences</hi> of many (we apprehend, with great reaſon) cannot acquieſce in; who were not therefore to be left deſtitute of public worſhip; eſpecially as our charter was granted in expreſs terms, <hi>for the maintenance of an</hi> orthodox <hi>clergy in thoſe parts.</hi>
                  </q>

                     <hi>Conſid.</hi> p. 21</note> So that, it ſeems, one material point which his GRACE is called to bear teſtimony to, is, that the <hi>conſciences</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people in theſe parts, cannot <hi>acquieſce</hi> in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things found even in <hi>the leaſt exceptionable of our Chriſtian aſſemblies,</hi> &amp;c. Let me make a few remarks upon the foregoing paſſage in the <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> thus ſupported by the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of this great Prelate. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. MR. <hi>Apthorp</hi> plainly allows that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſome of the colonies have the means of religion already, without the Society's charity,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:009441_0075_0F748DB35F0E93A8"/>
                  <hi>in other proteſtant communions</hi>; by ſaying that <hi>this is not univerſally true; or wherever it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily is true,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IF this is <hi>happily true</hi> in any of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican colonies, I conclude he will allow it to be ſo in this province and in Connecticut, which have much the faireſt pretenſions to ſuch a preeminence; and to the proceedings of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in which, the objection principally relates. It is therefore conceived, that it may be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken as a conceſſion of Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> that in theſe principal parts of New-England, where ſo many epiſcopal miſſions have been ſupported by the Society, the inhabitants had the means of religion already, <hi>in other proteſtant communions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. THEREFORE, according to the reaſoning in the preceeding ſections, which needs not to be here repeated, theſe are not <hi>ſuch</hi> colonies as were the proper objects of that charity: For their ſtate in reſpect of religion, is eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of the places deſcribed in the charter; and for which a charitable proviſion was made thereby. So that the money expended here by the Society as aforeſaid, is not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conformity to the true intent of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: For who can, with the leaſt appearance of reaſon, ſay, that the charter makes proviſion for thoſe plantations, in which the people enjoyed the means of religion already, in ANY <hi>proteſtant communion</hi>?—thoſe in which a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of proteſtant miniſters of ANY denomination were competently provided for, and God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip was conſtantly upheld?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:009441_0076_0F748DB3D3AA5128"/>4. As to the plea of <hi>conſcience,</hi> that there are ſome perſons amongſt us, who cannot uſe the means of religion, which they have in our <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant communions</hi>; and that to ſuch perſons theſe are NO MEANS, any more than Popery or Mahometaniſm, &amp;c: If theſe very conſcientious people were as entirely proteſtant in their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as our communions are in their nature, it might perhaps in part remove the difficulty. What there is in the leaſt exceptionable of our truly Chriſtian and proteſtant aſſemblies, which ſhould give offence to the conſciences of ſincere, good proteſtants, neither Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> nor his GRACE has particularly declared: Whether it be the preaching, ſo ſtrictly agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in general to the doctrinal articles of the church of England; or the devout prayers, not read to GOD, but dictated by the heart, as in the truly primitive and apoſtolic churches; or the adminiſtration of the ſacraments in the molt ſimple and ſcriptural manner, without any of thoſe additions which the wiſdom or the clergy afterwards invented; or whether it be any thing elſe, we are left to conjecture; and ſo cannot particularly anſwer this objection againſt our <hi>proteſtant communions,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> or <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian aſſemblies,</hi> as his GRACE is pleaſed to call them. It ſeems they both decline giving theſe the name of <hi>churches</hi>: But for what reaſon, it is not eaſy to ſay. It is to be hoped, they can form ſome idea of a truly chriſtian and proteſtant church, without a King or Queen at its head; without numerous acts of parliament to model
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:009441_0077_0F748DB4767D2090"/>its conſtitution, and eſtabliſh its ceremonials; without printed forms of devotion; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an hierarchy reſembling that of the Romiſh church, in which <hi>one</hi> great Prelate <hi>preſides</hi> over the whole, with all the inferior religious orders, the loweſt of which are as it were trodden in the dirt;—an hierarchy which, in a word, may be compared to JACOB's ladder,
<q>"Its foot on earth, its top above the ſkies."</q>
               </p>
               <p>IF there are any perſons amongſt us, who have no conceptions of a truly Chriſtian church, but in connexion with ſuch things as theſe, it is not indeed ſtrange that the means of public religion which they might have in our <hi>proteſtant communions,</hi> ſhould be NO MEANS to them; or that their conſciences ſhould not fully <hi>acquieſce</hi> in them; not even ſo readily as they might in <hi>Popery.</hi> Indeed I have myſelf heard ſome epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians amongſt us, who were reckoned very good church-men, ſay, that they ſhould much prefer the <hi>communion</hi> of the church of Rome to ours; and would ſooner go to maſs than come to our aſſembles, if there were here any Romiſh, and no Engliſh churches. This I declare, of my own certain knowledge, and could mention names; and I have divers times heard credible perſons ſpeak of ſome <hi>conſcientious</hi> epiſcopalians amongſt us, as expreſſing themſelves after the ſame manner: Tho', to do them juſtice, I do not ſuppoſe that theſe ſentiments generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail amongſt them. Some of them may <hi>poſſibly,</hi> without going theſe lengths, have conſcientious ſcruples about the means of religion in our <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:009441_0078_0F748DB540803C20"/>communions</hi>: But to ſay, that becauſe there are ſome things or circumſtances attending them, which they cannot intirely <hi>acquieſce</hi> in, or <hi>approve</hi> of, therefore they are abſolutely NO MEANS at all to them, is at beſt a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary poſition. However,</p>
               <p n="5">5. IT is readily granted, that great allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to be made for <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ſcrupulous, tender,</hi> and even <hi>erroneous</hi> conſciences; and for the prejudices of education, in matters merely of a religious nature. And this plea of conſcience ought to be allowed valid thus far, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe conſcientious people among us, ſhould not be <hi>compelled</hi> to join in our <hi>proteſtant communion</hi>; but left intirely at liberty to worſhip GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the epiſcopal mode, even tho' we may think it conſiderably leſs proteſtant and ſcriptural than our own. Indeed there are not a few of them, whom we ſhould be far from <hi>deſiring</hi> to ſee coming to <hi>our communion,</hi> unleſs they were much more <hi>conſcientious</hi> in ſome other reſpects, than they appear to be— The government here neither pretends nor deſires to deprive them of their religious liberty: Tho', by the way, had the government in England allowed our Fore-fathers the like liberty of conſcience, they would have had no occaſion to take refuge in New-England, from their ſufferings for non-conformity. BUT,</p>
               <p n="6">6. HOW good a plea ſoever this of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be for liberty, in oppoſition to all <hi>reſtraint</hi> or <hi>conſtraint</hi> in matters purely religious; yet it ſeems far from a ſolid one as uſed by his
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:009441_0079_0F748DB5F91D4EB0"/>
                  <hi>Grace the Arch-bishop of Canterbury,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> in order to juſtify the Society in the application of ſo much of their money, or even any part of it, for the ſupport and increaſe of the epiſcopal party among us. The reaſon is obvious from what has been ſaid before: Their whole fund and revenue are <hi>otherwiſe appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi> by their charter itſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the goſpel among the heathen, and to the maintenance of God's public worſhip in thoſe plantations, in which no competent proviſion was before made for miniſters; and in which the people, for want of the means of religion in any proteſtant cammunion, ſeem'd abandoned to atheiſm and infidelity, or in imminent danger of being perverted to popery. To alienate their revenue from <hi>theſe</hi> important ends, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of gratifying ſome <hi>ſcrupulous conſciences,</hi> in places where a legal and competent proviſion was before made for the maintenance of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and a public, proteſtant religion; is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt abuſe and perverſion of that charity, even upon ſuppoſition that theſe conſcientious people among us were much to be pitied, and really the objects of charity. If any perſons in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in their private capacity, ſhould think it a deed of charity to advance money for ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing epiſcopal churches here, for the ſake of thoſe comparatively few <hi>conſcientious</hi> people, to whom the means of religion which are to be had in our proteſtant communions, are NO MEANS at all, any more than Popery or Mahometaniſm;
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:009441_0080_0F748DB6B8F36C08"/>they have an undoubted right to do it. But the caſe of the Society is eſſentially different in this reſpect, from that of private perſons: They have not the ſame right to diſpoſe of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that a private man has to diſpoſe of his property; the former being particularly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to certain uſes and ends, from which it may not be alienated to any others, even tho' good in themſelves.</p>
               <p>THAT argument which Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> quotes from the great Prelate aforeſaid;—that "the charter was granted in expreſs terms, for the maintenance of an <hi>orthodox</hi> clergy" in the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; cannot be thought one of his GRACE's "invincible reaſons" which Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſpeaks of, till it is proved that no clergymen beſides thoſe of the church of England, can properly be called <hi>orthodox</hi> miniſters, even tho' they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the doctrinal articles of that church more cloſely than her own clergy. But enough of this before. And the intelligent reader is now left to judge, whether Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> had reaſon to uſher in his <hi>two witneſſes,</hi> as he does in the following words— <q>To take leave of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular objection with <hi>ſo full a confutation,</hi> that it will be <hi>diſingenuous</hi> ever to advance it again; the writer <hi>confidently reſts his proof on the unexceptionable teſtimony</hi>

                     <hi>Conſideration</hi> p. 18.</note> That he does this <hi>confidently,</hi> no one will deny; but that theſe teſtimonies are ſo intirely <hi>unexceptionable</hi> in this cauſe, as to be a juſt ground for ſuch confidence,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:009441_0081_0F748DB8C8EE58B0"/>is far leſs apparent;—eſpecially conſidered as teſtimonies or the party <hi>accuſed.</hi> But yet it is not eaſy to ſee, why he might not call in the Society as witneſſes in their own cauſe, with as much propriety at leaſt, as he had before ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his defence of them to their <hi>own judgment and deciſion.</hi> One of the witneſſes, however, biſhop BERKLEY, ſays nothing directly to the main point, as to the miſſions in thoſe colonies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in proteſtant churches were <hi>before ſettled</hi>: The other, his GRACE of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> does; but yet perhaps not ſo convincingly, as to render it quite <hi>diſingenuous ever to advance this objection again.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

They muſt be ſtrange objectors indeed, who could object after this manner; which is the plain import of Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s words. And one may be confident, without preſumption, that no perſon among us ever objected againſt the Society's conduct, or their miſſionaries, that the ſtate of religion among us <hi>is much ſuperior</hi> to what it was formerly; tho' many have objected the direct contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. AS to the important fact which Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> ſuppoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſtate of religion here is much <hi>ſuperior</hi> to what it formerly was; many perſons who were men of obſervation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> or I was born; who have always lived, and ſtill are living in the country, will by no means agree with him. In their opinion, the general ſtate of religion in this country, is not ſo good as it was "when the miſſions were firſt appointed in it;" tho' I will not myſelf aſſert any thing poſitively upon this head. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. THO' this fact were certainly true; yet it is by no means a clear point, that this reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>ſo greatly the work of the Society</hi> or their
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:009441_0083_0F748DBA271D7168"/>miſſionaries, as he is pleaſed, in his great civility to them, to take for granted. I might engage to bring twenty perſons who think the religious ſtate of the country worſe than it was, and who attribute this in a great meaſure to the <hi>ſame cauſe</hi> to which he aſcribes the reformation of it, for one that he can produce to ſupport his double hypotheſis.

               <p n="4">4. SUPPOSING the truth of both theſe facts; yet this will not juſtify the Society in a <hi>miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of monies entruſted with them; and neglecting thoſe places which were the direct, proper objects of their charity, according to the charter. To plead the good done in ſuch a caſe as this, however undiſputed; tho' it may be conſidered as ſome apology for, yet it cannot be conſidered as a proper vindication of, thoſe who did it; eſpecially if it has occaſioned the neglect of a much greater good to the heathens, or to thoſe colouies wherein no tolerable proviſion was made for the adminiſtration of God's word and ſacraments. This plea is as invalid, as if, when a particular perſon is accuſed of miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the money put into his hands expreſly for the uſe of A, periſhing with hunger and cold; it ſhould be alleged in his vindication, that he had laid it out for the benefit of B; and fed and cloathed him <hi>more elegantly</hi> than he was cloathed and fed before. How would this excuſe him in leaving A, the intended and proper object of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:009441_0084_0F748DBAA273AFD8"/>the charity, to periſh for want of thoſe things that are <hi>needful</hi> for the body? The application is eaſy, and cannot be miſtaken.</p>

Some farther reflections on the ſame Point, occaſioned by the <hi>Conſiderations.</hi>

               <p>BUT Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> deſcends to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, in which he ſuppoſes the ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among us is greatly improved by the charitable care of the Society.

                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:009441_0085_0F748DBCB44EBF40"/>BUT yet here ſeems to be a conceſſion, that the boaſted reformation in the ſtate of religion among us, very little, if at all conſiſts in the improvement of our <hi>morals, manners,</hi> and <hi>piety.</hi> It is not pretended by Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> that there has been any conſiderable reformation in theſe reſpects, ſince the miſſions were firſt appointed here, which is <hi>greatly the work of the Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But</p>
               <p>HE ſays, <hi>Religion no longer wears among us that ſavage and gloomy appearance,</hi> &amp;c. And, not to diſpute with this ingenious gentleman about ſmall matters, it ſhall be allowed, (if that is what he means) that the <hi>faces</hi> of people in general are leſs <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſolemn</hi> than they were a century ago, or even ſince the inſtitution of the Society: And this <hi>improvement,</hi> it may alſo be conceded, is <hi>greatly the work of the Society,</hi> by the inſtrumentality of thoſe good gentlemen the miſſionaries, who commonly appear with a pretty gray, debonair and jovial countenance. But it is not quite clear from hence, that <hi>the ſtate of religion is now much ſuperior to what it was before.</hi> If divers of our Forefathers had ſomewhat <hi>too long</hi> faces, and a too ſet, formal air; yet they might be very pious, virtuous and worthy men. And tho' I would by no means deny the venerable Society or their miſſionaries any praiſe which may juſtly belong to them for contributing to the mirth, gaiety and chearfulneſs of our countenances; yet methinks the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man went a little two far in uſing the expreſſion
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:009441_0086_0F748DBCC35028E8"/>SAVAGE <hi>and gloomy appearance</hi>; partly (unleſs I miſtake his meaning) to expreſs his diſlike to the <hi>faces</hi> of our good Fathers, ſome of whoſe pictures he may probably have ſeen. And it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be worthy of his conſideration, whether this diſlike might not in part be owing to the unſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the <hi>painters</hi> of thoſe days. But be that as it may, it might ſtill be worthy of his conſideration, whether, ſince the miſſionaries came among us, many people are not run into an extreme quite oppoſite to gloomineſs and preciſeneſs, and even to that gravity and ſobriety which become the Chriſtian character; putting on a light, thoughtleſs air and behaviour. He will not deny but that people may riot, laugh and frolick, curſe, ſwear and game too much, as well as wear too grave and formal a countenance. Thoſe are much worſe, and more dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes than this. And many perſons that were men before either of <hi>us</hi> was born, can atteſt that ſuch exceſſes are, beyond all compariſon, more frequent ſince the church of England pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed here, than they were before; and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in ſome proportion to its flourishing. But, what the true cauſe hereof is, ſuppoſing the fact, is another point: And, for my own part, I will not affirm that this is <hi>greatly the work of the Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the gentleman intimates, that the ſtate of religion is much improved among us, in reſpect of its ſpeculative doctrines, how little ſoever it may be in reſpect of <hi>manners</hi> and <hi>piety— Its
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:009441_0087_0F748DBD90741110"/>ſpeculative doctrines,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are freed from thoſe ſenſeleſs horrors with which fanaticiſm had perverted them.</hi> Let it be here obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſeems not only too harſh, but a little impolitic in giving ſuch an account of our Forefathers. He had juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of religion among them, as having been <hi>terribly arrayed by ſuperſtition.</hi> And here they are repreſented as a parcel of wretched <hi>Fanatics,</hi> who had perverted the ſpeculative doctrines of religion with <hi>ſenſeleſs horrors.</hi> Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> in his <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> (p. 23.) expreſſes great indignation at the author of a ſuppoſed inſult on the memory of a deceaſed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary; which was yet, perhaps, no inſult. But whoſe memory does this ſame gentleman now inſult in ſo licentious a manner? In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the memory of all the pious Fathers of New-England, ſo juſtly venerable and dear to their poſterity, whoſe faith is in ſubſtance the ſame with their's to this day. So that he does, in a ſort, inſult the living and the dead at the ſame time; and not a few particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, but the people of a country in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. This, to be ſure, does not ſeem the likelieſt way to make proſelytes to the church—</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS outrage is the more to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, becauſe the gentleman does, by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral implication, inſult the Fathers and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his own church at the ſame time. For it is a known fact, that the <hi>ſpeculative doctrines</hi> almoſt univerſally received and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:009441_0088_0F748DBE365E9058"/>in New-England from firſt to laſt, are in effect the ſame with thoſe of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land according to her articles. I ſuppoſe, with others, that the gentleman had here a more particular view to the Calviniſtic doctrines of original ſin, juſtification by faith alone, elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reprobation. In this ſentiment I am confirmed by a paſſage in a ſermon of Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> publiſhed a year or two ſince; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he expreſſes himſelf with ſo much contempt and horror of thoſe, who <q>draw portraits of the DEITY from the ſanguinary paſſions of the worſt men—repreſenting the all-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father as the tyrant of the univerſe, reprobating his creatures, pre-determining their crimes, and predeſtinating their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery:</q> of perſons who falſely charge on Chriſtianity opinions <q>ſubverſive of all moral obligation, leading weak minds into enthuſiaſm and licentiouſneſs</q>—of perſons by whom <q>a juſt attention to the cauſe of virtue is reproached as derogating from the glories of HIM, <hi>who hath ſanctified us with His blood</hi>; and the juſtification of ſinners— is propoſed in ſuch a manner, as to render virtue uſeleſs and even a crime:—theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</q> &amp;c. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The Conſtitution of a Chriſtian Church,</hi> &amp;c. p. 8.

                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:009441_0089_0F748DBEF80EA988"/>Forefathers; the effects of which are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have been, the making them <hi>ſavage</hi> and <hi>gloomy,</hi> and filling them with <hi>ſenſeleſs horrors.</hi> I would not be over confident; but yet take this to have been his true meaning. And, what the church of England profeſſes in her arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles reſpecting thoſe doctrines, the reader may be pleaſed to ſee in the margin, where the ſubſtance of ſeveral articles is quoted: <note n="*" place="bottom">

But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. TO ſpeak ſincerely, I own it is my <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> opinion, that it has been too common a thing for people in New-England to expreſs themſelves in a manner juſtly exceptionable upon theſe points, however agreeably both to the letter and ſpirit of the articles aforeſaid: But yet, I believe, not more exceptionably than many eminent divines of the Church of England did in the laſt century.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IT is probably true, that for half a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury paſt, many miniſters and others in New-England have diſcourſed more cautiouſly upon thoſe points than the greater part did before; and ſome perhaps have run into an oppoſite extreme: Which may be owing to the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the church of England amongſt us; many of whoſe miniſters, if not the moſt, have long preached in a ſtrain almoſt diametrically oppoſite to the articles aforeſaid. But upon ſuppoſition that we are really indebted to the Society or their miſſionaries in any degree, for freeing the ſpeculative doctrines of religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, from what Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> calls <hi>ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs horrors</hi>; (which will not be generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed) yet we may well think it ungenerous and inconſiſtent in this gentleman, to revile
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:009441_0091_0F748DC076E60038"/>our Forefathers as a company of ſuperſtitious, ſenſeleſs Fanatics, for adhering ſo cloſely as they did to the doctrinal articles of the church of England.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Apthorp</hi> adds, as another particular of our reformation, which is greatly the work of the Society, that <hi>hypocriſy has worn off in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as men have ſeen the beauty of holineſs.</hi> As to which it may be obſerved, that we have not more clearly ſeen the <hi>beauty of holineſs</hi> ſince the prevalence of the church of England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, than it was diſcerned before, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhaps by way of <hi>contraſt.</hi> He does not pretend to ſay, that the ſtate of religion has been improved here, ſince the miſſions, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>morals, manners</hi> or <hi>piety.</hi> So that the <hi>holineſs</hi> which he ſpeaks of, ſeems to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinct from theſe; and what ſort of holineſs that is, I will not pretend to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But whereas he ſuppoſes that <hi>hypocriſy has worn off</hi> in proportion to the glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it in the church of England; I muſt obſerve, that the moſt deteſtable hypocriſy in the ſight of God and wiſe men, is that which is ſhewn in a zeal for rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for external modes and forms; eſpecially uninſtituted ones, the inventions of men, while the zealots are comparatively negligent of the weightier matters of the law and goſpel. Of which kind of hypocriſy there has unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably been much more amongſt us, ſince the Society was inſtituted than before. But, to

               <p>Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſubjoins: <hi>And above all, that exterminating monſter</hi> perſecution, <hi>is itſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated both from the temper and practice of the preſent age.</hi> This he mentions as another inſtance in which the ſtate of religion is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly improved among us, by means of the Society and the epiſcopal miſſions. And any one, ignorant of the country, would from hence naturally conclude, that there had been here <hi>acts of uniformity</hi> in worſhip, rigorouſly put in execution, till the eſtabliſhment of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal churches in theſe parts: For otherwiſe this is not ſo pertinently ſaid, as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſo ingenious a gentleman. But this is a miſtake at beſt: No ſuch acts ever took place here, ſo far as I have learnt. But if there were, in the early days of the country, ſome inſtances of unjuſtifiable ſeverity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Quakers, &amp;c. they were uſed much leſs under the notion of theſe people being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters from our mode of worſhip, than of their being diſturbers of the peace, and of our religious aſſemblies; in which reſpects they were indeed very diſorderly, abuſive, and highly culpable. Some learned and good men in England, who had not a thorough underſtanding of the caſe, have, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, paſſed much too harſh a judgment on the conduct of our Forefathers; tho' I will not undertake to vindicate all their conduct
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:009441_0093_0F748DC3110B2CA8"/>relative to this point. But ſuppoſing them to have been juſtly chargeable with ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of perſecution; from whom? — from what church did they learn this practice? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians, certainly, ſhould lay their hands upon their mouths—</p>
               <p>MOREOVER: How blameable ſoever our Forefathers might have been in this reſpect; yet how does it appear that our reformation therein, is <hi>greatly the work of the Society</hi>? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that kind had been known amongſt us for many years before the Society had any miſſionaries among us, or was itſelf in being. Nor is it a little odd that this gentleman ſhould inſinuate, that the poſterity of thoſe who ſo cruelly perſecuted our Fathers out of England into America, ſhould follow us hither to teach us charity and moderation, and to extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the <hi>exterminating monſter perſecution</hi> from among us! Is he in jeſt or in earneſt? — Wherever we learnt Chriſtian forbearance and charity towards thoſe that differ from us, he may be aſſured we did not learn it of the church of England; from which our beloved and honoured brethren in England, even at this day, do not in all reſpects find the kindeſt uſage; being ſubjected to divers temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences on account of their non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. And notwithſtanding the gentleman ſays, perſecution is exterminated both from the temper and practice of the preſent age; I have myſelf heard ſome of the epiſcopalians a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:009441_0094_0F748DC385A44278"/>us ſpeak with much regret, and even indignation, of the <hi>act of toleration,</hi> by which that of <hi>uniformity</hi> was in part repealed. Nay, it is credibly reported, that ſome of the warm epiſcopalians here, have ſaid, <hi>they hoped for the time when they might ſhoot</hi> diſſenters <hi>as freely as they might ſhoot pigeons.</hi> Not a few of them diſcover a like ſpirit. Let the reader then judge, whether the exterminating mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is intirely exterminated; and if ſo, how <hi>greatly this is the work of the Society</hi> and their miſſionaries.</p>
               <p>IT does not appear, upon the whole, that we are at all indebted to the Society for the improvement of the ſtate of religion amongſt us, in any of the inſtances which this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mentions: It is probably in ſome reſpects, particularly as to our <hi>morals,</hi> worſe than if there had never been an epiſcopal church in theſe parts. But upon ſuppoſition that what Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſays as to this matter, was true in fact; ſtill it muſt be remembered, that this is no juſtification of the Society in alienating their fund and revenues from their direct, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ends expreſſed in the charter.</p>

Farther Reflexions relative to the views and Conduct of the Society, the State of Religion in New-England, and the prevalence of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> here; with Remarks on ſome expreſſions in Dr. <hi>Bearcroft</hi>'s ſermon before the Society, <hi>1744.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>DR. BEARCROFT, who has many years been Secretary to the Society, near the beginning of his ſermon before it, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the deſign of the inſtitution, expreſſes himſelf in a very rhetorical ſtile about the great <q>charity of bringing back their brethren in America to good manners and a chriſtian life.</q> And had he ſpoken only of profeſſed epiſcopalians, or of people in ſuch an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh ſtate as thoſe in ſome of the colonies, no one would have doubted the charitableneſs of ſuch a deſign. But to me it is evident that he comprehends us Congregationaliſts and Preſbyterians in New-England, in the terms <hi>brethren in America.</hi> Taking this for granted,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:009441_0096_0F748DC5CF300020"/>it may be obſerved, that how much ſoever we may be obliged to him for his catholiciſm in acknowledging us for his brethren, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our apoſtacy from epiſcopacy; yet we are not much obliged to him for the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, that we are ſadly departed from good manners and a chriſtian life; ſo that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Society <hi>to bring us back</hi> thereto, is produced as an argument of their prodigious charity. And if by thus bringing us back, he really intended any thing more than conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to epiſcopacy; the Society have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto failed very much in their charitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. For though their miſſionaries have, firſt and laſt, made a conſiderable number of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes from our churches, many of whom needed to be bettered in their morals; yet it may be queſtioned whether any of them have thereby been brought back to good manners and a chriſtian life: Poſſibly there may have been ſome, though I never knew an example of it. But the examples of the contrary are numerous: I mean, of perſons whoſe morals, though not unexceptionable before, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently much worſe after their being thus epiſcopally converted. It is a known fact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, that theſe proſelytes often become exceeding looſe, profligate, vain and cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſeemingly placing no ſmall part of their religion in railing at their <hi>unconverted,</hi> i. e. congregational and preſbyterian neighbours, whoſe lives are chriſtian, excepting this one
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:009441_0097_0F748DC69622CB38"/>capital fault, that they go to MEETING every Lord's-day!</p>
               <p>THE Doctor a little afterwards ſeems to be quite in a rapture, when he ſays, <q>The word of God mightily grows and prevails in New England <hi>according to the liturgy of the church of England.</hi>
                  </q> Brave indeed! What good news was this from a far country?—that the word of God ſhould mightily prevail here <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the liturgy</hi>; which he ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as the ſtandard, or the touchſtone by which <hi>the word of God</hi> was to be tried. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had lately been reading ſome of the pompous, hyperbolical accounts of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries concerning the ſucceſs of their pious labors. Of many of which accounts from time to time, as to the number of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, baptiſms, communicants, &amp;c. I have at preſent only time to ſay, that no perſon who knows any thing particularly about America, can read them without aſtoniſhment; tho' the direct proof of a <hi>negative</hi> in ſuch caſes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falſe the accounts may be, is no eaſy matter—Could the Doctor have truly ſaid, that pure religion mightily prevailed in New-England according to the holy ſcriptures, and that the converts to the church were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pious, virtuous and good men, it might have been a triumph altogether as becoming a Chriſtian divine, as that the word of God prevailed <hi>according to the liturgy.</hi> Or if he had ſaid that the word, inventions and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:009441_0098_0F748DD1E5C678A0"/>of men, mightily prevailed in New-England <hi>according to the liturgy,</hi> he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have come nearer the truth. But with ſome gentlemen, it ſeems, the liturgy! the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy! is all and all. If that is embraced, from whatever petulant, frivolous humour, or diſhonorable motive, O! then to be ſure the word of God mightily grows and prevails; and every <hi>unſtable</hi> ſon of REUBEN, every tho'tleſs, giddy changeling or out-caſt, is, without more ado, repreſented as brought back to good manners and a chriſtian life. Theſe proſelytes are, perhaps, ſpoken of in the accounts tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Society, as perſons of very good characters, of much conſideration; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their penetration. I lately met with a very remarkable account of the ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome of them in one of the <hi>abſtracts,</hi> and the prodigious improvement which they had made in a ſhort time under the documents of a miſſionary: It was to this purpoſe;—They had diſcovered that there were in the liturgy <hi>no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of popery</hi> and the <hi>maſs-book,</hi> as they had formerly ſuppoſed!—Nor are there a few epiſcopalians, who ſeem to have much the ſame opinion of <hi>that compoſition,</hi> that the old Epheſians had of their famous, adored image, which, they were ſo confident, <hi>fell down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Jupiter</hi>; and of their church, that thoſe zealots had of their goddeſs, when they bauled by the ſpace of two hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians</hi>!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:009441_0099_0F748DD28CF5CF60"/>THE Doctor ſays afterwards; <q>The powers there in being, [i.e. in New-England] to do them juſtice, had taken care for God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, and erecting ſchools for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of their youth</q>— What occaſion was there then for the Society to maintain miſſions and ſchools here at a great expence, to the neglect of the heathen, and of thoſe colonies in which no ſuch pious care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the government; which, according to their charter, were the direct, proper objects of their charity? Is not this at beſt very myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? O, no! the Doctor explains himſelf in the next words — <q>but not in the true ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox principles of the church of England.</q>— Sad indeed! And therefore we Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaliſts and Preſbyterians in New-England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo much worſe a ſtate than the others, were proportionably ſo much the more proper objects of the Society's charity; to the end that the word of God might mightily grow and prevail here <hi>according to the liturgy</hi>; whether the heathen, and thoſe that were but one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree better, had the word and goſpel of God preached to them at all or not—Here the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor explains at leaſt the ſentiments of his own ſoul, probably the views of the Society alſo. But can the unprejudiced even among the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, think it a matter of equal importance to convert US to epiſcopacy, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly <hi>unneceſſary</hi> ceremonies, however <hi>decent,</hi> as to propagate the knowledge of the only
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:009441_0100_0F748DD336CE6158"/>true God and Jeſus Chriſt among the heathen, or in heatheniſh places, where there is hardly any appearance of religion? It were doubtleſs bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that WE ſhould be deſtitute of thoſe ſuper-eminent, ſuper-abundant, and, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, ſuper-ſcriptural means of grace and ſalvation, which are to be had in the communion of the church of England, than that any of thoſe for whom Chriſt died, ſhould periſh for want of God's <hi>own word and ſacraments,</hi> or be perverted to Popiſh <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT would doubtleſs rejoice the Doctor's heart, if <hi>the powers here in being,</hi> in inſtead of contenting themſelves with taking care for God's public worſhip according to his <hi>own</hi> word only, ſhould be convinced of their error and neglect in this reſpect; and for the future take care for it <hi>according to the liturgy</hi>; Which may be about as much of an <hi>improvement</hi> upon the Bible, as ſome of the Society's conduct is upon their original plan according to their charter. Yea, I believe it would not a little refreſh the good gentleman, only to hear that the <hi>powers in being in New-England,</hi> (if ſuch a thing ſhould ever be) on ſome public occaſion went in a body to church; tho' it were only from the ſame principle that the great <hi>Syrian</hi> Captain and Courtier formerly attended his royal maſter to the houſe of RIMMON, when he went to bow and worſhip there. <note n="§" place="bottom">2 Kings Ch.

<pb n="103" facs="unknown:009441_0101_0F748DD3F7FD38B0"/>that they were gradually coming off from their <hi>ſtifneſs</hi> and <hi>preciſeneſs</hi>; poſſibly conclude, that in their hearts they condemned their Forefathers ſeparation from the church of England; and intended to lead the riſing generation into an opinion, that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt that communion and ours are quite inconſiderable. How might this exalt his hopes into a plerophory? And what a ſure preſage would it be, that the glorious aera was nigh at hand, when the word of GOD ſhould ſtill more mightily grow and prevail in New-England <hi>according to the liturgy</hi>! —</p>

And one ſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Society to their miſſionaries, is in theſe remarkable words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>X. That they <hi>frequently</hi> viſit their reſpective pariſhioners; thoſe of <hi>our own communion,</hi> to keep them ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the profeſſion and practice of religion, as taught in the church of England; and thoſe that <hi>oppoſe us,</hi> or <hi>diſſent from us,</hi> to CONVINCE and RECLAIM them,</q> &amp;c. This clearly ſhews what they are after. It will alſo be obſerved
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:009441_0105_0F748DD79848C818"/>here, that WE are conſidered as PARISHIONERS of the miſſionaries, no leſs than profeſſed epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians: And we are often ſpoken of AS SUCH by them in their letters to the Society, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <hi>Abſtracts.</hi> How <hi>aſſuming</hi> is this!—</p>
               <p>THE affair of Biſhops has lately been, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably now is in agitation in England. And we ſee the Society ſpare neither <hi>endeavours, applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> nor <hi>expence,</hi> in order to effect their grand deſign of <hi>epiſcopizing</hi> (if I may uſe the term) all New-England, as well as the other colonies. And it is ſuppoſed by many, that a certain <hi>ſuperb edifice</hi> in a neighbouring town, was even from the foundation deſigned for the <hi>Palace</hi> of one of the <hi>humble ſucceſſors</hi> of the apoſtles.</p>
               <p>BUT however that matter may be, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things are evident:</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT the Society have long had a formal deſign to diſſolve and root out all our New-England churches; or, in other words, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them all to the epiſcopal form; or, in the words of their <hi>own Account,</hi> before cited, <q>to promote, <hi>as much as poſſible</hi> an <hi>agreement</hi> [uniformity] in faith and worſhip</q>—</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS fully and clearly accounts for their being ſo ready to encourage <hi>ſmall epiſcopal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> all over New-England, by ſending them miſſionaries, &amp;c. altho' the people had the <q>means of religion already, in other proteſtant communions.</q> For theſe handfuls of people, ſcattered here and there, it is ſuppoſed, or at leaſt hoped, will in time, by ſome means or other, become conſiderable for numbers; and at length eat out, or abſorb all our churches.</p>

                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:009441_0106_0F748DD7DD8E6800"/>BUT ſuppoſing them finally to carry this favourite point, at a vaſt expence, as I hope in God they never will; yet one would think it impoſſible even for themſelves to imagine, that the intereſt of religion in the colonies would be a quarter part ſo much ſerved hereby, as if they had employed this money in thoſe ways which are plainly pointed out in the charter, and from which they have alienated it. Is the effecting an exact <hi>uniformity</hi> among us in diſcipline, modes of worſhip, ceremonies, &amp;c. an object worthy of any attention or expence, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with that of maintaining a public worſhip in places deſtitute thereof, or the converſion of the heathen! Can wiſe men, free from bigotry and the ſpirit of party, poſſibly think it is, tho' they are themſelves epiſcopalians in ſentiment?</p>

<pb n="109" facs="unknown:009441_0107_0F748DD9DA432500"/>of thoſe people, who were indiſputably the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects of that charitable inſtitution; and they had applied only the <hi>ſurpluſage</hi> for the ſupport and encouragement of the epiſcopal party in New-England, in oppoſition to preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, &amp;c. their conduct would have been much leſs exceptionable than it is: Since, upon this ſuppoſition, others would not have been <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured</hi> by ſuch an application. Tho' even in this caſe, it might well be queſtioned whether their conduct would have been entirely juſtifiable; becauſe their charter warrants neither their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving nor expending any money for ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one party whatſoever amongſt proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, in oppoſition to another; but only for the common cauſe of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> in oppoſition to atheiſm, infidelity and popery. But the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have by no means thus abounded in money. They have been making great complaints for half a century paſt, how ſtreightened they were for money; how much their annual expences exceeded their certain annual income. Dr. HUTTON, biſhop of Bangor, in his ſermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Society 1745, (p. 24.) ſays, they have borne <q>an expence frequently more than <hi>five times</hi> equal to their certain annual income.</q> Theſe repreſentations have been very pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made from time to time, in order to induce good people of <hi>all denominations</hi> to aſſiſt them in ſo pious a work, as that of ſupporting the public worſhip of God in thoſe colonies which muſt otherwiſe be deſtitute of it, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the goſpel among the poor <hi>Negroes</hi> and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:009441_0108_0F748DDA4FF4CB08"/>
                  <hi>Indians.</hi> This ſhall at any time be proved at large by quotations from the ſermons, and other publications of the Society, if any perſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation denies it, as I am confident no one will preſume to do. And yet, while theſe loud, and almoſt tragical complaints have been mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Society have been expending large ſums every year in New-England, quite beyond the deſign of their inſtitution, to ſupport and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the epiſcopal party as ſuch; greatly to the neglect of the Southern colonies upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, the Indians bordering upon us, the Weſt India iſlands, and the many thouſands of Negro ſlaves in them; all of which and whom were the direct proper objects of their charity; and whoſe <hi>names</hi> were made uſe of moſt pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to excite compaſſion in, and draw money from well diſpoſed people of <hi>every</hi> denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! It needs no proof, that by how much more was done by the Society for the ſupport of the epiſcopal party here; by ſo much leſs muſt unavoidably have been done for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or for the colonies in a ſtate but little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that of heatheniſm. And if the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot, in this reſpect, be ſaid to have "rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed other churches," to eaſe and gratify the epiſcopalians here; yet they may be ſaid to have <hi>robbed</hi> the heathen, the ſlaves, and heatheniſh colonies aforeſaid; who had an excluſive right, according to the charter, to the benefit of that very money which has been ſunk in the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal gulph here, where the people actually "had the means of religion in other proteſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions."
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:009441_0109_0F748DDB105B0EB8"/>He that can conſider theſe facts, and ſuch a flagrant abuſe of a noble inſtitution, without <hi>admiration,</hi> has doubtleſs that qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the poet ſpeaks of, as the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential foundation of happineſs—

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>EVEN upon ſuppoſition that the Society has ſuch an extraordinary "diſcretionary power" as Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſpeaks of; (which will hereafter be conſidered) ſo that they cannot be juſtly charged with violating their charter, by expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their money for the ſupport of an epiſcopal party in New-England, to the prejudice of other colonies, &amp;c. or if they have a <hi>legal right</hi> to act thus; yet in how extraordinary and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable a manner do they uſe that ſuppoſed right and power? Can any wiſe and candid man, who allows the main facts and circumſtances as before repreſented, poſſibly think the intereſts of CHRIST's kingdom ſo much ſerved in this way, as they might have been by a different conduct in the Society? If they are not, this is certainly a miſapplication both of their charity and their power, in ſome degree. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever powers or monies the Society are entruſted with, they were to be employed in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſhould moſt effectually anſwer the ends expreſly mentioned in their charter. And they have all along profeſſed to apply their fund and revenues in ſuch a manner as ſhould be likely to do the moſt good, and beſt to ſerve the general intereſt of religion in the colonies, and adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:009441_0110_0F748DDB782D9F50"/>countries. That they have not done ſo, but alienated their revenues from a truly noble to a comparatively mean, narrow, party deſign, is as certain as any thing of this nature can be: Tho' I would by no means be underſtood as charging ſo reſpectable a BODY with any wilful, criminal abuſe of power, or miſapplication of monies.</p>

Of the good that might probably have been done, had the Monies which have been miſapplied in ſupporting the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> in New-England, been applied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true and noble Deſign of the Inſtitution.</head>
               <p>IT is no inconſiderable ſum that the Society have ſunk in the epiſcopal gulph here in New-England, quite beyond, and therefore contrary to, the deſign of their inſtitution; there being no medium, as has before been obſerved, betwixt a right application of their fund, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their charter, and a perverſion of it. According to the <hi>Abſtract</hi> 1730, £. 705 ſterling was expended on the miſſions, &amp;c. in New-England. In 1739, the ſum was £. 1030 ſterling. And in 1761, the lateſt <hi>Abſtract</hi> which I have been able to procure, it was £. 1270.
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:009441_0111_0F748DDC35EFBD40"/>Theſe diſburſements, it muſt be remembered, are excluſive of books to be diſtributed, and other incidental charges. So that, according to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate calculation, there may have been about £.1200 ſterling expended by the Society for N. England, one year with another, for 32 years paſt; amounting to 38,400 And about £.200 per <hi>Annum</hi> for 20 years preceeding 1730, amounting to 4,000 <hi>Total Er. excepted,</hi> 42,400 ſterl.</p>
               <p>BUT then a deduction is to be made on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that part of this ſum which may have been expended conformably to the deſign of the charter, in ſupporting the public worſhip in ſome places in N. England, particularly Rhode-Iſland government, where the Society's charity was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If we deduct £.7400, there has been about 35,000 ſterl, miſapplied in N. England, according to the reaſoning in the proceeding ſections. I ſhall take the liberty to go upon this ſuppoſition, tho' I do not pretend to be very exact as to the <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>; I believe it is not leſs than that. The benefit of this ſum then, other perſons, the Negro ſlaves, Indians and heatheniſh colonies, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of; tho' the money was as it were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in <hi>their name,</hi> or with a profeſſion of employing it in <hi>their</hi> ſervice.</p>
               <p>NOW let it be conſidered, how much good might probably have been done to the ſouls of theſe people, the direct, proper objects of this charity, had the aforeſaid ſum of 35,000 ſterl.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:009441_0112_0F748DDD13AC8790"/>been duly applied in maintaining and propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chriſtianity among them, inſtead of being laid out to ſupport and increaſe the epiſcopal party in thoſe towns of N. England, in which people <q>had the means of religion already, in <hi>other proteſtant communions.</hi>
                  </q> Forty or fifty miſſions might, with this ſum, have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably maintained among the heathen, and in heatheniſh places, every year, for more than thirty years paſt; and a conſiderable number for ſeveral years antecedent thereto. It is well known that in ſome of the Southern colonies, there are large diſtricts of 10, 20, 30, and 40 miles extent, and I think more, wherein there is no publick worſhip of any kind regularly kept up, for want of miniſters; in which colonies there are alſo many Roman-catholics and ſlaves. And their ſtate, to this day, anſwers very exactly to the deſcription in the charter, of thoſe places which are therein marked out as the objects of this charitable inſtitution. The ſame in general is applicable to ſome of our Weſt-India iſlands, all which ſo much abound with Negro ſlaves.</p>
               <p>LET us ſuppoſe then, that about one half the aforeſaid ſum had been employed in ſupporting miſſions and ſchools in thoſe colonies, and the other half among the <hi>Indians</hi> bordering upon us. How much good might probably have been done, by keeping up ſome form of religion, and giving a <hi>check</hi> at leaſt to infidelity, vice and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity in the former; and by propagating the knowledge of true religion amongſt the latter?
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:009441_0113_0F748DDDDBF09298"/>In what degree it might have pleaſed almighty God to ſucceed theſe miſſions, it is indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for man particularly to ſay. But ſuch an application of the money would unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been right and proper, according to the charter: And the deſign had at leaſt been cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, noble and laudable, whatever the ſucceſs had been. Nor is there any reaſon to doubt in general, but that ſome, yea, great good would have been done, if all the miſapplied money had been diſcretely expended in theſe ways. The general ſtate of religion in thoſe colonies would, in all probability, have been much better at this day than it is. Many perſons might have been reſtrained from open vice and impiety; not a few brought to a ſerious ſenſe and practice of religion; a great number of the Negro ſlaves in, and the Indians near the colonies, brought to ſome hopeful knowledge of God and his truth had as many pious, and duly qualified miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries been ſent to one and the other, for thirty or forty years paſt, as might have been tolerably ſubſiſted on the aforeſaid ſum, which has been very little, if any thing better than thrown away; yea, which many think really worſe than thrown away, all circumſtances conſidered. Nor am I either aſhamed or afraid to own myſelf of this latter opinion; being perſuaded that there is leſs real religion now in thoſe parts of N. England where it has been expended, than there would have been, had it been ſunk in the ocean inſtead of the epiſcopal gulph here: Tho' it is
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:009441_0114_0F748DDE8F304670"/>not to be ſuppoſed that any epiſcopalians can be of this opinion; neither is any ſtreſs laid upon it in the preſent argument. But even allowing that ſome good has been done by converting a number of preſbyterians, &amp;c. to the church of England; yet what ſober and candid perſon can poſſibly imagine, that the common cauſe of chriſtianity has been a tenth part ſo much ſerved hereby, as might have been reaſonably expected from a different application of this money, in ways directly and indiſputably agreeable to the intent of the charter? What the venerable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety may think of theſe things, I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay: But I know, many wiſe and good men think they have reaſon to bleſs God, that they are not themſelves to give an account to him for ſuch managements; and that the blood of ſo many as have probably periſhed thereby, <hi>will not be required at</hi> THEIR <hi>hands.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THO' I will not affirm it for truth, yet I have been very credibly informed, that the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:009441_0115_0F748DDF73CF9C60"/>people in ſome of the Southern colonies, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe parts of N. Carolina which were intirely deſtitute of miniſters, have made earneſt and repeated applications to the Society for miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be ſent to them; ſometimes without any anſwer at all, for years together; and at laſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs. And ſome ſolid, ſenſible and ſerious perſons from that country, with whom I conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Boſton ſeveral years ago, I think gave me the ſame account: But whether they did or not, I know they made ſuch a repreſentation of their ſad ſtate for want of miniſters, and expreſſed ſo ſerious a deſire of having the public worſhip of God introduced among them, that at this very moment it is not in my power to refrain from tears in reflecting on it—What they told me, at leaſt confirms in ſome meaſure the report afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, concerning the ineffectual ſollicitations from thence to the Society; who perhaps had it not in their power to comply therewith, by reaſon of the large expence which they were at in the noble deſign of ſupporting and increaſing little epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parties, or factions, here and there in N. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. And according to the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> 1761, the Society had only five miſſionaries in the whole country of N. Carolina, while they had about thirty in N. England; chiefly in the moſt populous towns of it, where a due and legal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was made for the ſupport of miniſters, and the public worſhip of God!</p>
               <p>AS to the Indians; no one can doubt but that there have been, and ſtill are, ſome great, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:009441_0116_0F748DE002EDB9B0"/>in attempting to chriſtianize them. But, according to divers appearances, the Society have had this work leſs at heart than that of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the peculiarities of epiſcopacy and the liturgy in N. England, in oppoſition to preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm and congregationaliſm. The neglect of the Natives in America, has long been complained of, and the accuſation in ſome ſort allowed to be juſt by themſelves, in times paſt. This will appear in part from Bp. WILLIAMS's ſermon before the Society, 1705. <q>But whilſt we find <hi>fault</hi> with others,</q> ſays he, <q>we muſt not forget <hi>our own.</hi> It has been the continual matter of <hi>reproach</hi> to us, that this application to the <hi>Natives</hi> has been <hi>neglected on our part.</hi> Where are the numbers you have converted to the Chriſtian faith? Where the fruits of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? when you have under your care thoſe vaſt dominions which are called the <hi>Engliſh empire</hi>; and from whence you draw ſo much of your emoluments to enrich and pleaſure yourſelves at home. This is an objection that <hi>has its weight,</hi> and perhaps is <hi>uncapable</hi> of a juſt and ſufficient anſwer. Recriminations are but a kind of confeſſion of guilt: And the beſt way to anſwer, is, <hi>to mend what is amiſs in ourſelves</hi>
                  </q>—<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Edit. p. 32.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT is unneceſſary to confirm and juſtify this complaint by an appeal to any of the later ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons before the Society; which would be no difficult matter. Some eſſays they have indeed
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:009441_0117_0F748DE159D56F10"/>made from time to time, towards the converſion of the Savages: but they ſeem to have been very faint and feeble; and with a ſparing hand as to money, when compared with the goodneſs and importance of the work, or the difficulties to be expected in it; with the zeal of our French neighbours to chriſtianize, or rather <hi>popize</hi> the Indians, and even with their <hi>own zeal</hi> and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in order to <hi>epiſcopize</hi> the Congregationaliſts and Preſbyterians of N. England. I am not ignorant however, that they and their miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have frequently given the world ſufficiently pompous accounts of their efforts in order to the converſion of the Indians; not to ſay, ſpoken ſomewhat hyperbolically of the real and great difficulties attending this work. Tho' I doubt not but that the Society kept to the accounts given them by their miſſionaries; who ſeem to have been leſs indefatigable, and ſooner diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in their labors among the Indians than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Us. And tho' the following remark of Dr. DOUGLASS, a very attentive and capable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of what paſſed in the colonies, is not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true of <hi>all</hi> the miſſionaries in America, yet it deſerves notice here: <q>The miſſionaries from the Society,</q> ſays he, <q>do not <hi>in the leaſt</hi> attempt the converſion of the Indians, <hi>becauſe it requires travel, labor and hardſhip.</hi>

               <p>IT is certain from authentic records, even from ſeveral publications of the Society, that the <hi>Five,</hi> alias <hi>Six nations,</hi> a reſpectable and war-like
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:009441_0118_0F748DE1CBAE66F8"/>people on the Frontiers of N.

Their chiefs have even petitioned for them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly; of which the Society was duly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the Governor of N. York, as appears from the <hi>Abſtracts,</hi> &amp;c. Nor have they been <hi>wholly</hi> neglected by the Society; than which, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, little more can be ſaid, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> has written concerning their "unwearied zeal in this attempt <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Conſid.,</hi> p 15, 16.</note>". In ſpeaking of this matter, Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> has referred to Dr. BARCLAY, now a miſſionary in the city of N.

It will not therefore be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to obſerve a few things relative to that worthy gentleman's miſſion to the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> or <hi>Six Nations</hi> aforeſaid, as a ſpecimen of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's zeal for the converſion of the Indians <note n="*" place="bottom">The following facts relative to Mr. now Dr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Indian miſſion, are taken from the <hi>Hiſtorical Memoirs</hi> relating to the <hi>Houſatonnuk</hi> Indians, and the excellent Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> a Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the latter from <hi>another Society</hi>: By the Rev. <hi>S.

                  <q>As for the <hi>Society,</hi> they have allowed me <hi>thirty pounds</hi> for one year: What further encouragement they will give me, I know not.

               <p>MORE than two years after Mr. BARCLAY had taken <hi>Orders,</hi> he wrote thus in another let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dated at Albany <hi>Aug.</hi> 21, 1740. <q>I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied I ſhould have much greater ſucceſs, if I had a <hi>ſchool-maſter</hi> and <hi>interpreter.</hi> I had the ſatisfaction laſt Lord's day to preach to a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> who came to this town to treat with the Governor, who alſo was preſent; and has taken a great deal of pains to countenance my deſign. My <hi>Mohawk</hi> congregation behav'd ſo well, that all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:009441_0122_0F748DE552412820"/>were exceedingly delighted. I aſſure you I have the cauſe at heart, and am well perſuaded of your zeal.</q>—</p>
               <p>FROM the foregoing repreſentation it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that a wide door was opened for the goſpel to enter among thoſe heathen tribes; The fields were white unto the harveſt, had but labourers been ſent, and duly encouraged to the noble work. Theſe tribes would probably have been in general profeſſed Chriſtians before this day, had the buſineſs been duly forwarded and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. Which might perhaps, by reaſon of the great fame of the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> have had a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and happy influence on many other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But, alas! the Society, tho' ſo deſirous of chriſtianizing the natives, could not afford ſalaries to a ſchool-maſter and interpreter, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps about £.20 or £.30 ſterling each; nor to Mr. BARCLAY himſelf, who was ſo zealous in this good cauſe, half a proper ſupport! Why not? The reaſon was apparently this; that they ſupported ſo many miſſionaries here in N. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land at a great expence, for the encouragement of the epiſcopal party, and in order to convert us to the liturgy. If ſo great a proportion of their revenue had not been thus unprofitably ſunk in places where God's word and ſacraments were duly adminiſtred, how eaſy would it have been for them to ſupport 5, 6, or more miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and as many interpreters and ſchool-maſters among the <hi>Iroquois</hi>? Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſpeaking of the "promiſing appearance" there was among the

                  <hi>Iroquois</hi> about this time, ſays, <q>— From the lateſt authorities — we find this miſſion either much dwindled, or greatly interrupted.</q>

The Indians doubtleſs, perceived how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs the Engliſh were in the cauſe, ſo that they could hardly think them in earneſt; and the French jeſuits, or other emiſſaries, no queſtion made their advantage of this negligence. Can it be expected that miſſions will ſucceed, which are conducted after ſuch a manner?—This ſpecimen may perhaps ſerve to explain and confirm what Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſays, where he introduces the affair the <hi>Mohawks</hi>; — <q>
                     <hi>Indian</hi> converſions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by <hi>our</hi> Society <hi>incidentally,</hi> and as it were <hi>ex abundanti</hi>

And to reconcile what he immediately ſubjoins, with plain facts, even with relation to this very miſſion which he ſo much glories in, is impoſſible— "Yet," ſays he, <q>have they <hi>omitted no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of promoting this pious work, <hi>as far as they found it practicable.</hi>

Of the important <hi>political ends</hi> that might have been anſwered, had the Society taken due care to ſend proper Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the <hi>Indians</hi>; and the pernicious Conſequences of their Neglect.</head>
               <p>THE author of theſe obſervations is ſenſible that worldly politics, and temporal things were not the direct objects of this inſtitution; but the promotion of true religion, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs of men. However, theſe things often ſtand in a cloſe connexion, and are in a meaſure interwoven with each other. And the Society's proſecuting that important part of their plan, the converſion of the heathen bordering on our American colonies, would at the ſame time have anſwered very valuable ends of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical nature. This, one would think, was an <hi>additional</hi> obligation lying upon them to do ſo, inſtead of neglecting it for the ſake of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to the liturgy, in the manner they have done. That ſuch ends would, in all probability, have been anſwered thereby; and that this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect has been attended with very fatal conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a civil conſideration of things, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the following remarks.</p>
               <p>IT is known that the Indian nations lie on the back of our ſettlements, from N. Scotia
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:009441_0125_0F748DE7905B87D0"/>Northward, round to the Weſt and S. Weſt as far as Georgia and Florida. And had early and due care been taken by the Society to ſend as many miſſionaries among them, as could have been ſubſiſted on the money ſo unprofitably ſunk in N. England; it would have had a direct and manifeſt tendency to attach them to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh intereſt. Had this £.35,000 ſterl. or the greater part of it, been employed in maintaining a number of ſenſible, diſcrete miniſters among the Indians, and enabling them to make them ſmall preſents from time to time, in order to gain their eſteem and good-will, it might probably have been the means, not only of giving them at leaſt ſome favourable impreſſions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in general, but of the proteſtant religion; and ſo making the greater part of them our faſt friends.</p>
               <p>And there was the more occaſion for taking this courſe, in order to counter-act the deſigns of the French, till of late our dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and rivals on this continent. They, if not from a principle of piety, yet of ſound policy, have all along made a point of ſending jeſuits, prieſts and other emiſſaries to all the Indian tribes that would admit them. It is evident that the Society were not ignorant of theſe circumſtances; which were well known the Britiſh court, even before the charter was granted; and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, were one reaſon of its being granted. It may be added, that the Society did, from the firſt, <hi>profeſs</hi> to have a regard to them. The
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:009441_0126_0F748DE844E68058"/>following extracts from the <hi>Account of the Society,</hi> will ſerve at once to throw light upon this affair, and to render their neglect the more <hi>unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> They ſay,
<q>Nor hath the Society been unmindful of uſing their <hi>utmoſt endeavours</hi> for propagating the goſpel among the heathen <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> and ſlaves in and near our plantations. They received with great ſatisfaction a letter from the <hi>Lords commiſſioners of trade and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> directed to the Ld. arch. bp. of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</q> ſignifying, <q>That the earl of Bellamont had ſeveral times repreſented to them the great want of ſome miniſters of the church of England, to inſtruct the Five Nations of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians on the frontiers of N. York, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being practis'd upon by French prieſts and jeſuiſts.</hi>
                  </q>— <q>At the ſame time the Lords commiſſioners imparted to his Grace, and to the Lord bp. of London, ſome farther advice upon the ſubject—in particular this remarkable extract of what was ſaid by One in the name of the reſt of the <hi>Sachems</hi>—to the commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the Indian affairs in Albany, June 28, 1700</q>—Says he, <q>We are now come to trade; and not to ſpeak of religion. Only thus much I muſt ſay, all the while I was here, before I went to Canada, I never heard any thing talk'd of religion, or the leaſt mention made of converting us to the Chriſtian faith. And we ſhall be <hi>glad</hi> to hear, if at laſt you are ſo piouſly inclined to take pains to inſtruct your Indians in the Chriſtian religion. I will not
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:009441_0127_0F748DE8F69B85D0"/>ſay but that it may induce ſome to return to their native country. <hi>I wish it had been done ſooner,</hi> that you had had miniſters to inſtruct your Indians in the Chriſtian faith,</q> &amp;c. `This repreſentation,' the Society add, <q>was laid before the Queen in council; from whence his Grace the Archbiſhop of Canterbury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this order.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the Court at St.</hi> James's, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Upon reading this day at the Board a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation—ſetting forth, among other things, that as to the Five Nations bordering on New-York, leſt the intrigues of the French in Canada, and the influence of their prieſts, who frequent and converſe, and ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit with thoſe Indians, ſhould debauch them from her Majeſty's allegiance, their Lordſhips are humbly of opinion—that two proteſtant miniſters be appointed,</q> &amp;c. The Society add, <q>Upon communicating this order to the Society, it was immediately agreed, that it ſhould be referred to a committee,</q> &amp;c. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Account,</hi> &amp;c. p. 38—41. printed 1706.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE chief deſign of this quotation, is to ſhew how early and fully the Society were appriſed of the intrigues of the French with the Indians on this continent, and the importance of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-acting their deſigns, in a political as well as religious conſideration of things. Theſe things they have known all along, from the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Society. And yet, that they have done hardly any thing towards the converſion of the Indians; and either could not or would
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:009441_0128_0F748DE9ED8AD040"/>not allow even an interpreter or School-maſter to Mr. BARCLAY, is equally certain: Their object, to all appearance, having been rather the extirpation of preſbyterianiſm and congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm from the colonies, than the planting of Chriſtanity among the Indians; whereby they might at once have been inſtrumental of ſaving many ſouls, and doing an important ſervice to Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>HAD the Society applied the money which they have ſunk in New-England, (in a way quite unauthorized by their charter) to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of miſſions among the Indians, it is quite probable, as was intimated before, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of thoſe bordering on our colonies might long ſince have received very favourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Chriſtian, proteſtant religion, and been amicable to us. We ſhould of courſe have had a much larger ſhare of the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trade with them, which has been almoſt engroſſed by the French. And, as many of them might have been in a degree civilized at the ſame time, and brought into the Engliſh way of living; they would of courſe have taken off a greater quantity of Britiſh manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and other commodities, to the national advantage. The lives of great numbers of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubjects in the plantations, deſtroyed by the Savages from time to time, would have been ſaved. The colonies which have been kept in terror, and ſtunted in their growth, their frontiers having often been quite cut off, or broken up, would have been in a much more
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:009441_0129_0F748DEAA1BCE2F8"/>flouriſhing condition than they are at preſent. And moſt of theſe Indians, inſtead of being at the command of the French, to cut our throats and ſcalp us, whenever they thought proper; might have been ready to act for us againſt them, on any juſt occaſion.</p>
               <p>THESE are ſome of the important political ends that might probably have been anſwered, had the Society thought proper to ſend miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries among the Indians, (whoſe converſion they have all along declared to be a principal, tho' not a primary object with them) inſtead of ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much money in the epiſcopal gulph in New-England. And when we alſo conſider how duly they have been advertiſed of the French intrigues from time to time, and of the importance of counter-acting them; it is not eaſy to ſay, whether their piety or their patriotiſm is the moſt conſpicuous, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this part of their conduct. And, whether their affection for, and ſtrong attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the peculiarities of a <hi>party,</hi> are not at leaſt as conſpicuous as either of them, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who is not afraid to think, is left to judge from the whole ſeries of facts and circumſtances.</p>

Of the <hi>diſcretionary Power</hi> of the Society, and Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s Reaſoning thereon.</head>
               <p>THE ingenious Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> to whom I muſt now again pay my devoirs, urges the large diſcretionary power of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, in order to vindicate their conduct. The paſſage to which I refer, ſeems to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo very <hi>curious</hi> in it, that I cannot but quote it at large for the <hi>entertainment</hi> of the reader.</p>
               <p>"IT is obſervable," ſays he, <q>that a <hi>large diſcretionary power</hi> is left to the Society, to regulate their inſtitution, <hi>and even occaſionally to make</hi> ALTERATIONS in it, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to render it moſt beneficial to religion, whether in our colonies, or among the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering nations. For this purpoſe, they and their ſucceſſors for ever are empowered to make any laws or conſtitutions that ſhall ſeem reaſonable, profitable or requiſite for the good eſtate and government of the Society, and the effectual promoting its <hi>charitable deſign.</hi> Thus, <hi>with an evidence beyond exception,</hi> it appears that their conduct in placing churches AMONG US, <hi>is in all reſpects</hi> CONFORMABLE <hi>to their inſtitution</hi>
                  </q>—<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Conſid.</hi> p. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:009441_0131_0F748DEDB524D008"/>1. IT is to be obſerved, that Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> here refers to that part of the charter which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to by-laws; but in quoting which (p. 10.) he has tranſpoſed ſome clauſes and omitted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without giving notice of it to his readers in the uſual way. However, ſince in his own way of quoting it, there does not ſeem to be any very material alteration in the ſenſe; it will not be worth while to compare the quotation and charter together, merely for the ſake of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of his harmleſs errors. But had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Scholar quoted any diſputed paſſage in LIVY, TACITUS or CICERO, in the manner in which this gentleman quoted another part of the charter, before taken notice of; it would have been no eaſy matter for him ever to regain his reputation in the learned world. Whether miſquoting the charter in this controverſy, is not an offence of a much higher nature, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the judgment of the impartial reader.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT ſeems a pretty extraordinary poſition, that any incorporated Society ſhould have power by their charter, <hi>to make alterations in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi> If this Society has any ſuch, Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> was doubtleſs right in ſpeaking of it as <hi>a large diſcretionary power</hi>! For is not a power to make <hi>alterations</hi> in their inſtitution, equivalent to a power to <hi>alter their inſtitution itſelf</hi>;—to depart in a great meaſure from the original plan according to the charter, and to purſue ends different from thoſe which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed therein? And what corporation ever had ſo large a diſcretionary power as this?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:009441_0132_0F748DEE90DDEEA0"/>3. BY laying claim to ſuch an extraordinary power for the Society, and making uſe of this as an argument to juſtify their conduct, Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſeems to allow that they ſtand in <hi>need</hi> or it for that purpoſe. The gentleman ſurely would not have had recourſe to ſuch a ſuppoſed wonderful power veſted in the Society, if their conduct could be reconciled with the moſt plain, obvious ſenſe of the charter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THIS is, in effect, tho' not expreſly, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion that the Society have actually made <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations</hi> in their inſtitution: and have really been purſuing deſigns not expreſly authorized by the charter. That this is fact, I am far from denying. But the gentleman well knows, that the queſtions <hi>de facto</hi> and <hi>de jure,</hi> are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: And if he can clear up that <hi>of right,</hi> as plainly as I flatter myſelf I have and ſhall do that <hi>of fact,</hi> our debate will be half finiſhed. But ſtill it muſt be remembered, that tho' the Society had confeſſedly a power to make <hi>alterations</hi> in their inſtitution, by neglecting ſome ends thereof particularly mentioned in the charter, and purſuing others not mentioned; yet unleſs they are ſuppoſed infallible and impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, <hi>theſe alterations</hi> may be for the <hi>worſe.</hi> That the alterations which they have made, are for the <hi>better,</hi> will not follow, as he ſeems to ſuppoſe, from their having had a <hi>legal</hi> power to make them. Allowing the power, if by altering they mend their inſtitution, they are doubtleſs to be praiſed in that reſpect: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever power they may have, if they pejorate their
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:009441_0133_0F748DEEF7A930F8"/>inſtitution, and purſue comparatively mean and low ends, inſtead of the noble ones expreſſed in the charter, Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> will not deny but that this is an error of judgment at beſt, and a real abuſe of their power. Whoever would fully vindicate the Society, muſt prove, not only that they are actually inveſted with ſuch a power, but that they have uſed it diſcretely and wiſely; ſo as moſt effectually to anſwer the general and excellent end of their inſtitution: To alledge <hi>power only</hi> in their vindication, is not giving reaſonable ſatisfaction to thoſe who may except againſt their conduct: Becauſe even a legal power may be abuſed, or a diſcretionary power miſapplied. But,</p>
               <p n="5">5. THE charter contains no expreſſion equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent or ſimilar to this, of a power left to the Society <hi>to make alterations in their inſtitution.</hi> The ſtrongeſt expreſſions uſed therein, relative to the power given them, are theſe—<q>The ſaid Society ſhall and may conſult, determine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, ordain and make <hi>any conſtitutions, laws, ordinances and ſtatutes</hi> whatſoever; as alſo execute leaſes for years, as aforeſaid, which to them, or the major part of them then preſent, ſhall ſeem reaſonable, profitable or requiſite, for, touching or concerning the good eſtate, rule, order and government of the ſaid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, <hi>and the more effectual promoting the ſaid charitable deſigns.</hi>
                  </q> Now is there any thing here, that is in the leaſt ſimilar to a power of making <hi>alterations in their inſtitution</hi>?—or a right to apply their fund in any manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not expreſſed in their charter? So far from it, that,</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:009441_0134_0F748DEFC1CD6D00"/>6. THE Society are, by this very part of the charter which, it is pretended, gives them ſuch an extraordinary power, limited and confined to thoſe ends or objects, which had before been expreſly mentioned as the ends of the inſtitution. For the power here granted them to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, laws, &amp;c. is, in expreſs terms, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to "the more effectual promoting <hi>the ſaid charitable deſigns.</hi>" And what, in the name of <hi>charity,</hi> are they? Is any one of them, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and increaſing little epiſcopal parties and factions in thoſe colonies, where due and legal proviſion was before made for the public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; and where the people "had the means of religion already, in other <hi>proteſtant communions</hi>?"—and this to the manifeſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of thoſe colonies in which no ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was made for the adminiſtration of God's word and ordinances;—of the Negro ſlaves and Savages! I aſk again, whether this is one of <hi>the ſaid charitable deſigns</hi>? If it is, then the Society have unqueſtionably a right to make conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, laws, &amp;c. in order to <hi>the more effectual promoting it</hi>: But if not, what can be leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and ſatisfactory, than to alledge the large diſcretionary power given them, to juſtify their conduct in this reſpect? And how did this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive</hi> gentleman come to talk of a power <hi>to make alterations in their inſtitution</hi>? What that inſtitution is, and all the ends of it, have been ſufficiently explained before: And whatever they are, the Society are here confined, limited and tied down to them, as much as if they had
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:009441_0135_0F748DF08BA3BC80"/>again been enumerated in the very words of the preamble; to which the reader is referred. The Society muſt indeed, in the nature of the thing, if they act with ſimplicity and integrity in this important affair', act as to them ſhall ſeem moſt <hi>reaſonable, profitable,</hi> &amp;c. in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh <hi>the ſaid deſigns</hi>; as other perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with a diſcretionary power in order to accompliſh <hi>certain ends,</hi> muſt alſo act. But their <hi>inſtitution itſelf is fixed,</hi> immutably <hi>fixed</hi> by the charter; ſo that they have not the leaſt power to make <hi>alterations</hi> in it; but only to proſecute, in the moſt effectual manner, the declared ends of it. And if any incorporated charitable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety whatſoever, under the pretext of a diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary power, neglect the declared ends of their inſtitution; and purſue others, to which their charter is a ſtranger, they cannot but be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as acting contrary to the truſt repoſed in them: But whether wilfully, or thro' miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, is another queſtion; reſpecting which people may have different opinions. But,</p>
               <p n="7">7. HAS not the ingenious Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> a very ſingular way of reaſoning here? He certainly makes uſe of a kind of <hi>logic,</hi> which very few of the <hi>un-orthodox</hi> N. England miniſters learnt at <hi>our</hi> little, young Colleges. For, having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to eſtabliſh this extraordinary diſcretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power of the Society to make <hi>alterations</hi> in their inſtitution, as if all depended upon it; the triumphant concluſion at length comes out in the following words: <q>THUS, with an <hi>evidence
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:009441_0136_0F748DF14D3009A0"/>beyond exception,</hi> it appears, that their conduct in placing churches AMONG US, is <hi>in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects</hi> CONFORMABLE TO THEIR INSTITU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION</q>— i. e. becauſe he had made it ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they had power to make ALTERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS in their inſtitution; therefore they have made NONE, nor in the leaſt deviated from it; but their conduct is in <hi>all reſpects</hi> CONFORMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE thereto! And this, it is ſaid, appears from the premiſes, <hi>with an evidence beyond exception</hi>— But if their conduct is thus conformable to their inſtitution, why did Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> attempt to juſtify it, by aſſerting their power to <hi>alter</hi> their inſtitution? As his argument now ſtands, the premiſes and the concluſion unluckily frown on, and militate againſt each other. I have try'd ſeveral ways to reconcile them; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I have endeavoured to ſuppoſe, that this poſition about the large diſcretionary power of the Society, was bro't in only as Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſays, <hi>Indian converſions are undertaken by the Society,</hi> viz. <q>incidentally, and as it were ex-<hi>abundanti</hi>

                        <hi>Conſideration,</hi> p. 15.</note>
                  </q>. But ſtill, either the concluſion knocks down the premiſes, or the premiſes the concluſion. I have alſo endeavoured to ſuppoſe the ingenious gentleman's meaning was, that the Society's conduct, was conformable to their inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, <hi>after they had made alterations in it,</hi> by virtue of their "large diſcretionary power"; not as it was <hi>originally</hi>: But neither, can I make this bear, in ſeveral reſpects. The war ſtill continues
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:009441_0137_0F748DF21B706DE8"/>between the former and latter branch of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: So that they muſt be left to fight it out betwixt them.</p>

Remarks on Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s curious Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe Words, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own</hi>? &amp;c. to the preſent Controverſy.</head>
               <p>IMMEDIATELY after the paſſage laſt quoted, Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> that he might oblige us with ſome of his <hi>rhetoric</hi> together with his <hi>invincible arguments,</hi> ſubjoins— <q>And to any one who cries out on <hi>imaginary</hi> abuſes or miſapplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Society may reply, like the good <hi>Houſholder</hi> whoſe <hi>ſtewards</hi> they are, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good</hi>?</q>
               </p>
               <p>LET it here be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT whatever the Society might juſtly reply to thoſe who cry out on <hi>imaginary abuſes</hi> or <hi>miſapplications</hi>; the ſame reply would not be valid or pertinent to thoſe who cry out on <hi>real</hi> ones.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE Society are hero very juſtly ſtiled <hi>ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> And they were intruſted with the care of a charitable fund, not only by God, as he ſeems to
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:009441_0138_0F748DF2BA325890"/>intend, but by men; by the King, who granted their charter, and by all who have contributed to the charitable deſigns expreſſed therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A LEARNED clergyman, like him, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs knows, it is "required in <hi>ſtewards</hi> that a man be found <hi>faithful.</hi>" Stewards are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to uſe the goods or money with which they are intruſted, but for thoſe ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which they are committed to them. If they knowingly apply them to any others, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good in themſelves, they are unfaithful in their truſt. For example, if a ſteward is intruſted with money by his lord, to give to particular poor perſons by name, or to the poor of ſuch a pariſh; and he neglects theſe, to relieve other perſons, tho' equally neceſſitous he miſapplies the money, and abuſes his truſt; Much more ſo, if inſtead of beſtowing it on <hi>any</hi> of the poor, he employs it in building and decorating an houſe <hi>for himſelf,</hi> and in adorning his wife, miſſes or children.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT the Society have applied a great part of the money intruſted with them, to other, and to ſay the leaſt, much leſs noble purpoſes than thoſe for which it was committed to them, has, if I miſtake not, been ſufficiently proved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. IN the very ſame ſentence that Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> calls the Society <hi>ſtewards,</hi> he does, in effect, ſuppoſe them to be, not <hi>ſtewards,</hi> but <hi>lords</hi> or <hi>proprietors.</hi> For he ſuppoſes them to have an abſolute, uncontroulable right to apply their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable fund to whatever good uſes they pleaſe.
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:009441_0139_0F748DF4515E7110"/>This he evidently does, by putting that reply of the <hi>good Houſholder,</hi> the <hi>Proprietor</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of all, into their mouths, to ſtop the mouths of thoſe who cry out on abuſes and miſapplications —<q>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with <hi>mine own? is thine eye evil,</hi> becauſe <hi>I am good</hi>?</q> This anſwer could with no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be adopted by a <hi>ſteward,</hi> when accuſed or ſuſpected of abuſing his truſt, and alienating the money committed to him from the particular deſigns of it. The language is ſutable only to a <hi>proprietor,</hi> at abſolute liberty to diſpoſe of <hi>his own goods</hi> as he pleaſes, without being obliged to give an <hi>account</hi> of his conduct; as the Society expreſly are, by their charter—<q>The ſaid Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall yearly, and every year, <hi>give an account</hi> in writing</q>, &amp;c. And is it not a little ſingular, that this argumentative and rhetorical gentleman ſhould thus, in the ſame breath, make the Society both <hi>ſtewards</hi> and ſovereign <hi>proprietors</hi> of the charitable fund in their hands?—characters ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely incompatible with each other in the ſame perſons, and with relation to the ſame thing; as he applies them to the Society, <q>to convince the candid</q>, and all but "the obſtinate" and "malicious"; which, he ſays, <q>is not in the <hi>power of reaſon.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. THO' the members of the Society are themſelves large <hi>contributers</hi> to this fund, it makes no material alteration in the caſe. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſubſcribe or contribute, ceaſes to be <hi>their own,</hi> their private property, as ſoon, as it is
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:009441_0140_0F748DF4F6857178"/>put into this common ſtock. It is then no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>their own,</hi> to uſe as they pleaſe, or to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from the particular charitable ends menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in their charter. This were <hi>ſacrilege</hi> in a much more proper ſenſe than that, in which the epiſcopal clergy have termed ſome <hi>other aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſacrilege. And ſuppoſing ſuch an unjuſt thing to be <hi>deſignedly</hi> done, which I am not willing, to think, the words of the apoſtle to ANANIAS, who kept back part of the price, &amp;c. would be very applicable to this caſe— <q>Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy. Ghoſt, and to keep back part of the price of the land? <hi>Whiles it remained,</hi> was it not <hi>thine own</hi>?—Thou haſt not lied unto men [only] but unto God</q>.—Let me juſt add here, that if the <hi>eye</hi> of any one is <hi>evil</hi> towards the Society, poſſibly ſome better reaſon may be given for it than this, that they are <hi>good</hi>; which were, in divers reſpects, the worſt that could be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—: at leaſt, it may not be, becauſe they are <hi>too good</hi> to the colonies which <hi>moſt need</hi> their charity; or to the Negroes and Savages, who are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects or it. <note n="†" place="bottom">If the <hi>other</hi> London Society, or Scotch Society acted thus; — neglecting the heathens, and heatheniſh places, to ſupport and increaſe little <hi>presbyterian</hi> parties where due proviſion was made for the worſhip of God in the epiſcopal way; epiſcopalians would hardly be ſatisfied with this anſwer, that they <hi>might do what they would with their own.</hi> They would be cenſured as bigots, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the ſpirit of party, and perverting their fund.</note>

Of the Plea, That the epiſcopal Miſſions in the Colonies, to rectify the State of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in them, are a <hi>neceſſary Means</hi> of chriſtianizing the Savages.</head>
               <p>THIS is often mentioned in the <hi>Abſtracts</hi>; and has not ſeldom ſerved as a theme for popular declamation in the anniverſary ſermons. Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> has quoted, or at leaſt pretended to quote, ſeveral of thoſe ſermons to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I have compared but one of theſe quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with the text itſelf; that from the bp. of St. David's ſermon; (<hi>Conſid.</hi> p. 15.) In which ſhort quotation of but eight lines, there are three or four deviations from the uſual way of quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Some of his own words are inſerted as the words of the ſermon; clauſes are left out, and parts of ſentences at the diſtance of 13 pages in quarto are tacked together, and pointed as they ought to have been, if they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous in the ſermon; tho' the pages from whence they are taken, are indeed referred to in the margin. How he has uſed ſome other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors from whom he quotes; and even that great Prelate who "preſides over the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and the Society itſelf,</hi>" I have not thought it worth while to examine. He has not indeed miſrepreſented the ſenſe of the bp. of St. David's ſermon; and perhaps not that of other bps, &amp;c.
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:009441_0142_0F748DF7EDA29E00"/>as to this point. For I know it is a uſual thing for the preachers before the Society to talk in the ſame ſtrain, about <q>remedying in the firſt place, <hi>the ill ſtate of religion in our colonies themſelves</hi>:</q> without which care, it is ſaid, <q>the converſion of the neighbouring Savages can hardly be effected;</q> and the like.</p>
               <p>LET it be here obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT all this kind of reaſoning ſuppoſes, that one principal object of the Society, is, the converſion of the Savages; and ſo does not well harmonize with what Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſays elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, however true in point of fact— <q>
                     <hi>Indian</hi> converſions are undertaken by our Society <hi>incidentally,</hi> and as it were <hi>ex abundanti.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS reaſoning ſeems very juſt, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>moſt</hi> of the Britiſh colonies, and the miſſions in them; <hi>viz.</hi> all thoſe, the religious, or rather irreligious ſtate of which, anſwers to the repreſentations in the charter;—thoſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in which no tolerable proviſion was before made for miniſters;—in which the people ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abandoned to atheiſm and infidelity, or in danger of being perverted to popery, for want of the adminiſtration of God's word and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Sending miſſionaries to ſuch places as theſe, is doubtleſs one proper means of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Chriſtianity among the heathen. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. NOTHING can well be leſs to the purpoſe than this kind of reaſoning, when applied to the far greater part of N. England, where the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip of God was ſo regularly upheld,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:009441_0143_0F748DF7FA3FE938"/>and the people <q>had the means of religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, in other <hi>proteſtant communions.</hi>
                  </q> Such expreſſions as thoſe, of <hi>remedying the ill ſtate of religion in the colonies,</hi> and the like; when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut, can naturally import nothing more than reducing us to an outward <hi>uniformity</hi> of profeſſion, or converting us to epiſcopacy and the liturgy. But ſuppoſing this to be done, it is not eaſy to ſee how it would contribute much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Indians. Nay, if we conſider what has been done hitherto to this end, by episcopalians and preſbyterians, &amp;c. reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; there is great reaſon to think that our converſion to the church of England would rather retard than promote the converſion of the Savages. And it is intimated even in ſome of the anniverſary ſermons before the Society, that the people of New-England had <hi>provoked them to jealouſy</hi> in this reſpect; tho' hitherto, to very little purpoſe. Thus particularly biſhop BURNET ſays, <q>Let thoſe who have a true zeal for the honor of <hi>our church,</hi> contribute to raiſe her glory, which hitherto has been <hi>too little advanced this way,</hi> while thoſe who <hi>divide from us in</hi> NEW-ENGLAND, ſeem to have provok'd us to <hi>jealouſy</hi> on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Sermon before the Soc. p. 27.</note> Similar conceſſions to our honor, might be produced from other anniverſary ſermons.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:009441_0144_0F748DF8D3882AF8"/>4. As the converſion of the heathen was from the firſt one profeſſed aim of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers in ſettling in New-England; ſo almoſt all the royal charters, grants, letters patent, and acts of government in England, relative to this country, have made mention of, and encouraged, yea, enjoined upon us the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this pious deſign; not conſidered as epiſcopalians, but as known diſſenters from the Engliſh church. To which purpoſe is the following paſſage in the charter of this province, granted in the 12th of WILLIAM and MARY; the year before the Society's carter — <q>To diſpoſe of matters and things whereby our ſubjects, inhabitants of our ſaid province, may be religiouſly, peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and civily governed, protected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; ſo as their good life, and orderly converſation may win the <hi>Indians,</hi> natives of the country, to the knowledge and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the only true God and Saviour of mankind, and the Chriſtian faith; which his royal Majeſty our royal Grandfather K. CHARLES the firſt, in his ſaid letters patent, declared was <hi>his royal intention,</hi> and the <hi>adventurers free profeſſion to be the principal end of the ſaid plantation.</hi> And for the better maintaining and ſecuring <hi>liberty of conſcience,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. CAN it be reaſonably ſuppoſed that King WILLIAM, in the Society's charter granted the year after this, had the leaſt thoughts of
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:009441_0145_0F748DF975A57D70"/>impowering them to employ a great part of their fund in converting Us to epiſcopacy, and uniformity in worſhip, either as one <hi>end</hi> of their inſtitution, or as requiſite <hi>means</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Indians;—a pious work all along recommended to, and enjoined upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of New-England themſelves! The royal charters, letters patent, grants, &amp;c. ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſettlers and inhabitants of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, tho' not epiſcopalians, to have been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people, who were diſpoſed and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to ſerve the intereſts of religion, by chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianizing the Indians. But it ſeems Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp,</hi> not to ſay, the Society, think that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of confining their pious care to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh colonies, or applying themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Indians, they are to employ a great part of their fund in converting US to the liturgy, as a <hi>neceſſary means</hi> of converting the Savages. Is this ſuch a method of juſtifying the New-England miſſions, as muſt needs "convince the candid?"—<hi>confute</hi> all but the "obſtinate," and <hi>ſilence</hi> all but the "malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous!"</p>
               <p n="6">6. UPON ſuppoſition that our converſion to epiſcopacy had really ſome <hi>remote tendency</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the converſion of the Indians to the faith of Chriſt; (which is utterly denied) yet it may well be doubted, whether this would juſtify the Society in applying ſo great a part of their fund for the ſupport and increaſe of the epiſcopal party here, in a country whoſe
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:009441_0146_0F748DFA985AB9D8"/>religious ſtate no ways anſwers to the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the charter; to the neglect of other colonies, and the heathen themſelves, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, proper objects of their charity. Colonies whoſe religious ſtate is like that of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets and Connecticut, are implicitly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from any ſhare in this charity, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations given in the charter, of thoſe for which it was deſigned, ſo widely different therefrom. And to bring in theſe New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land miſſions and miſſionaries thus <hi>indirectly,</hi> or <hi>edge-ways,</hi> as a pretended <hi>means</hi> of converting the Savages, when they cannot be juſtified <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,</hi> by the expreſs, obvious deſign of the charter; is no better than an evaſion; and one that naturally brings to mind thoſe words of the CHIEF SHEPHERD, ſo often miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by epiſcopalians—<q>He that entereth not <hi>by the door,</hi> into the ſheepfold, but climbeth up <hi>ſome other way,</hi> the ſame is a thief and a robber.</q>—Tho' I do not mean to call the Society's miſſionaries among us, by thoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious names; or to give them any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affront. But,</p>
               <p n="7">7. IF it ſhould be ſaid, that <hi>any means</hi> which have even a remote tendency to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Indians, may be uſed by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to that <hi>end,</hi> by virtue of their "large diſcretionary power;" and if it is upon this footing that the miſſions here are juſtified, let us conſider how far the ſame way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning might carry them, and where it would
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:009441_0147_0F748DFB1FD3DB90"/>end. They think our converſion to epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a means of converting the Indians. They are therefore, in purſuance of the maxim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, right in maintaining miſſions here at a great annual expence, with the hopes of thruſting in the ſickle, and reaping a mighty Indian harveſt a century or two hence, when it is ripened by means of the benign influences of epiſcopacy upon New-England. Neither I, indeed, nor probably the reader, can ſee how this ſuppoſed means tends to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed end. It ſeems a round-about, aukward way of going to work: But no matter; the Society judge it proper, and that is ſufficient. Let us then proceed one ſtep farther. If the church of Scotland, for which WE have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a great veneration, was but firſt <hi>epiſcopized</hi>; this might poſſibly have ſome remote tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to induce us to conform to the church of England; and therefore a tendency, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſent ſuppoſition, tho' more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, to convert the Indians. NOW, if it ſhould appear thus to the Society, they may, according to the maxim aforeſaid, ſend miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries to convert the kirk, in order to the converſion of New-England; and this in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to convert the Savages on our frontiers. With the ſame pious deſign, they might alſo ſend miſſionaries into Holland, Geneva, the Swiſs Cantons, &amp;c. For though the charter ſays nothing of Scotland, Holland, Geneva, Switzerland, or even of New-England, but

Remarks on a curious Argument of Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> in favor of <hi>the Church of England.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT was by no means my deſign, in this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, to enter into the controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the church of England and us. But as Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> has thought fit to produce an argument in favor of the former, in the margin of the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> pages of the <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> I cannot but take a curſory notice of it. <q>It
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:009441_0150_0F748DFD36A0D918"/>is a <hi>good</hi> preſumption,</q> ſays he, <q>that the church of England is a reaſonable Chriſtian communion, and free from all extremes in its conſtitution; that all the various religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſuaſions, at home and abroad, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in holding it <hi>next</hi> in eſteem to their own. Conſidering the force of prejudice, what in every one's judgment holds the <hi>ſecond place,</hi> may be ſuppoſed to deſerve the <hi>firſt.</hi>
                  </q> The ingenious gentleman adds, that <q>for this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>as far as be can recollect,</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to a <hi>fine writer,</hi> Dr. JOHN BROWN</q>— Be that as it may, I can give a gueſs from whence it came originally; <hi>viz.</hi> from another learned Divine of the church of England; I mean Dr. SWIFT. For in his Dedication of of that curious <hi>theological production,</hi> entitled A TALE OF A TUB, are theſe words; — <q>It is a maxim, that thoſe, to whom every body allows the <hi>ſecond place,</hi> have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted title to the <hi>firſt.</hi>
                  </q> This he applies, in the way of <hi>compliment,</hi> to Lord SOMMERS.</p>
               <p>BUT as to the obſervation itſelf, as applied in a <hi>compliment</hi> to THE CHURCH; where did either of theſe gentlemen get his intelligence, <hi>that</hi> ALL <hi>the various religious perſuaſions, at home and abroad, concur in holding the church of England</hi> NEXT <hi>in eſteem to their own</hi>? Have they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly declared ſo? Have the churches of Scotland, Holland, Geneva, the proteſtant Swiſs Cantons? have the Lutheran and Greek chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp;c, &amp;c. by any ſolemn public act, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:009441_0151_0F748DFE041B4118"/>claimed the church of England <hi>ſecond beſt</hi>? Or has Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> the faculty of diſcerning the ſentiments of all other churches, without their declaring them? Till this fact is well eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the argument which he deduces from it may well be called a <hi>preſumption</hi>; but, that it is a <hi>good</hi> one, as he ſays, is not ſo evident.— There is indeed <hi>one church,</hi> a very <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>extenſive one,</hi> which, it may naturally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, for a reaſon that ſhall be nameleſs, conſiders the communion of the church of England as the <hi>next beſt</hi> to her own. But it may well be doubted, whether one half the <hi>proteſtant</hi> churches in the world concur with her, in holding the church of England in <hi>ſuch high eſteem.</hi> And tho' this unſupported ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were a certain fact; yet it would be no proper evidence that the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is a reaſonable Chriſtian communion, and free from all extremes in its conſtitution,</hi> with thoſe who plainly ſee many unreaſonable, unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and unſcriptural extremes in her conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, worſhip and diſcipline: Which almoſt any man, tolerably free from the prejudices of education, may eaſily ſee; and which have, in effect, been acknowledged and lamented by many of the wiſeſt and beſt men of that communion; who would have been glad of a farther reformation with reſpect to thoſe <hi>extremes.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The judicious, epiſcopalian Authors of the <hi>Free and candid Diſquiſitions relating to the church of England,</hi> ſay, <q>The <hi>reformation of</hi> OUR CHURCH was never brought to that perfection which the firſt undertakers and promoters of it intended; and which <hi>many of the worthieſt</hi> of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have deſired and pleaded for ſince.</q> Third Edit. <hi>Dublin,</hi> 1750. p. 246.

What other new world remains as a ſanctuary for us from their oppreſſions, in caſe of need? Where is the COLUMBUS to explore one for, and pilot us to it, before we are conſumed by the flames, or deluged in a flood of epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? — For my own part, I can hardly ever think of our being purſued thus from Britain into the wilds of America, and from world to world, without calling to mind, tho' without applying, that paſſage in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. JOHN:

                     <p>THE AUTHOR's Father was more than 60 years a preacher of the goſpel to the <hi>Indians</hi>; employed by the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of this Society.</p>

The firſt of them is dated, London, Auguſt 5, 1704. and contains the remarkable words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing— <q>We have lately had a <hi>new</hi> Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration erected here <hi>for propagating the goſpel,</hi>

I envy not their engaging in ſo pious a deſign, but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh them all imaginable ſucceſs.

               <p>THE other letter bears date Auguſt 10, 1714. and contains the following paſſage— <q>It is a great rejoicing to us, to hear from you of the ſucceſs that <hi>our</hi> endeavours have had amongſt thoſe poor people; [i. e. the <hi>Indians</hi>] and I heartily wiſh <hi>the Society you take notice of</hi> had made <hi>greater improvements of the advantages they have over us.</hi> But I am afraid God will not bleſs their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors; they having neither <hi>right ends in their view,</hi> nor employing <hi>proper inſtruments</hi> in the work.

That by the <hi>Ceſſion of Canada,</hi> &amp;c. there is now a noble <hi>Proſpect</hi> of much being done towards chriſtianizing the <hi>Indians,</hi> provided this <hi>good Work</hi> is heartily and diſcretely proſecuted.</head>
               <p>WHAT is paſt cannot be recalled, or undone: But abuſes may be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if the authors ſhould be ſenſible of them, and not <hi>above</hi> altering their meaſures.

It may be naturally expected that the Indians will be more acceſſible and tractable to us and our miſſionaries, by reaſon of the fall of Canada, and the French power in America, than they were before, either to us or to the French; as they will now be rather more dependent upon us. Theſe circumſtances, of ſuch great importance to the proſperity of the Britiſh colonies, and to Great-Britain herſelf, may well be conſidered as a loud <hi>call of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> to her and them, to engage heartily in the buſineſs of chriſtianizing the Natives: And the religious obligation hereto, increaſes in proportion to the proſpect, or probability of ſucceſs in the attempt; as was hinted before.</p>
               <p>THERE is no reaſon to doubt, from any thing that is paſt, but that the Societies referred to before, <hi>excepting one,</hi> will be forward to improve the opportunity, and all advantages which God in his providence affords, for ſpreading the knowledge of his truth, and the <hi>common ſalvation</hi> among the American Savages.

               </head>
               <p>SOME people may perhaps imagine, that ſince the ceſſion of Canada, &amp;c. there are no motives or reaſons beſides merely <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> ones, to attempt the civilizing and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the American Indians. That the <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> ones which before ſubſiſted, are <hi>leſſened</hi> in ſome degree, is not denied; but, that they are wholly <hi>ceaſed,</hi> no one who duly conſiders the matter, can ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>TO ſay nothing of the benefits that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult herefrom to the agriculture, fiſhery and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of the colonies, and to the Britiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, even upon ſuppoſition that there was not a jeſuit, popiſh prieſt, emiſſary, or one Frenchman upon this continent; it is to be remembred, that <hi>human affairs</hi> are ſubject to great changes and revolutions, as we have lately ſeen, particularly in America. We cannot be <hi>certain</hi> that others may not take place hereafter, almoſt as much to our prejudice, as thoſe are to our advantage. At leaſt, human prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that every thing of that ſort ſhould be guarded againſt, as far as human foreſight and power can do it. And one means hereof doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is, uſing the preſent opportunity of ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as far as may be, the Chriſtian, proteſtant religion among the Natives; and thereby engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:009441_0163_0F748E07C71C1D38"/>them <hi>heartily</hi> in the Britiſh intereſt, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the French.</p>
               <p>THE French are a very powerful and politic, ambitious and enterpriſing nation: They do not long ſit down eaſy under <hi>great loſſes</hi>; and they ſoon recover themſelves by peace, after being exhauſted by war. In all probability, they will continue to carry on intrigues with the Indians of Canada, and on the Eaſt of the Miſſiſippi, by means of their emiſſaries, to the prejudice of our colonies; not without hopes of finding their ends in it at leſt—The reverend and learned EDWARD WIGGLESWORTH, D. D. HOLLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAN <note n="†" place="bottom">N. B. This <hi>Profeſſorſhip</hi> was in great part endow'd by the worthy Mr. THOMAS HOLLIS of London, ſome time ſince deceaſed; a very generous benefactor to our College. The preſent worthy THOMAS HOLLIS of London, <hi>Eſq</hi> F. R. S. &amp;c. has alſo, more than once, preſented ſome valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble books to the library of ſaid College.</note> Profeſſor of divinity at Harvard College in Cambridge, who has thought much and long on the affair of the miſſions and the Indians, has obliged me with two or three letters ſince I have been writing on this ſubject. In one of them (which I obtained his leave to make uſe of on this occaſion) he ſpeaks particularly of what has laſt been hinted at. And, I conceive, the beſt uſe I can make of it, is to give the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic the ſubſtance of it in the Doctor's <hi>own words,</hi> as follows.</p>
               <p>—<q>Probably it may now be generally thought, that ſince Canada is reduced, nothing more is to be apprehended from the Indians; but that we ſhall live in perpetual peace and good neighbourhood with them. Tho' it may be thought a weakneſs, I muſt own, that I entertain very different apprehenſions. I
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:009441_0164_0F748E08798259E0"/>believe that the French, in ſpite of all precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that can be taken, will continue miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries among all thoſe tribes of Indians, who have been uſed to have them; and will thruſt them into as many others as they poſſibly can. One great buſineſs of theſe will be, to keep up a ſtrong diſaffection to the Engliſh in the Savages, in hopes of making uſe of them, at ſome future favourable conjuncture, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs our provinces again, and recover their own loſſes. To anſwer ſuch an end, the French miſſionaries will make no difficulty to dreſs and paint like Savages, and paſs for as very Indians as any of them, even in viſits to our ſorts and frontier towns. And I know of nothing that can prevent ſuch miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but our having miſſionaries among the Indians, who ſhall be <hi>men of genius enough to gain their eſteem,</hi> and <hi>the ſame aſcendency over them,</hi> which the French miſſionaries get, wherever they come.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>IF any ſhould be ſo ſanguine as to flatter themſelves, that we ſhall never again have <hi>a weak adminiſtration at home,</hi> which may encourage the French to attempt to recover what they have loſt in America; yet we have found by experience, when Mr. DUMMER commanded in chief, that by jeſuitical influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Indians may be ſpirited to make war upon us, even when the French <hi>dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> to help or abet them. And if that war had not been conducted in a manner very different from the conduct of any other war we have ever had with our Eaſtern tribes of
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:009441_0165_0F748E09C7D89F08"/>Indians, before or ſince; they would have been no more humbled then, than they uſed to be at other times; but might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to haraſs our borders, till we had been much more weary of the war than they. And if any tribes of Indians now ſhould be ſet on, by ſecret French emiſſaries among them, to ravage our new ſettlements, and murder the inhabitants; I ſuſpect they might <hi>live better by it than by hunting</hi>: And they might [perhaps] be better ſupplied with all they want, except money for our ſcalps, <hi>by ſuch Engliſh provinces as they were pleaſed not to moleſt,</hi> than they ever were by the French in Canada.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE preceeding extract is given, not only as very clearly and preciſely expreſſing my own apprehenſions; but becauſe it is naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that coming from an <hi>aged</hi> gentleman, of ſo ſuperior and reſpectable a character as Dr. WIGGLESWORTH, it will have a greater attention paid to it, than the ſame things coming only from myſelf could have claimed. Let me add; It is undoubted fact, that in ſome of our French and Indian wars, the Savages have been ſupplied even with <hi>ammunition</hi> from one or more of the Britiſh colonies: And it has been reported, I believe truly, that the cloaths of ſome of our people, butchered by them, have been very <hi>amicably</hi> ſold at Albany, <hi>with the blood upon them</hi>—In a word, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of having a conſiderable number of miſſionaries among the Indians, is ſo apparent and urgent, in a political, as well as religious
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:009441_0166_0F748E0A39D7A5D0"/>conſideration of things; that one can hardly help entertaining ſome hopes that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either at home or in America, or both, may in their wiſdom ſee cauſe to do ſomething towards ſending and ſupporting them: At leaſt, that the ſeveral corporations erected in part, if not chiefly for that very end, will purſue it with a zeal adequate to the importance of it.</p>

Containing ſome farther Strictures on the Manner of Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s conducting his <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Society.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s defence of the Society is entitled, "CONSIDERATIONS," &amp;c. And tho' it has not been thought needful to follow him ſtep by ſtep; yet, I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, enough has been ſaid to convince the impartial, that thoſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> were both written and publiſhed with far too little <hi>conſideration.</hi> He began his triumph, however, or rather inſult, in the title-page, by a long, ſcornful, moſt contemptuous <hi>motto</hi>; in which he intimates, how much beneath him he thought it to enter the liſts with any perſon, who was ſo hardy as to object againſt the Society; reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all, in effect, as vain, impudent liars— "Vanos continuò ac mendaces eſſe"—This <hi>revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> motto, which ſerves him as an <hi>exordium,</hi> is from the <hi>Evangelical Preparation</hi> of EUSEBIUS:
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:009441_0167_0F748E0AB4BCCF08"/>And on the other ſide of the ſame leaf are adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, "SERMONS on PRAYER, with FORMS of "DEVOTION": which we may charitably ſuppoſe deſigned for <hi>general</hi> uſe;—both for thoſe who had <hi>devotion</hi> before, without much <hi>formality</hi>; and thoſe who had <hi>formality</hi> enough before, without much <hi>devotion.</hi> Next appears his <hi>humble ſubmiſſion</hi> of his defence, to the "judgment and deciſion" of his venerable <hi>Clients,</hi> the Society, of which he is himſelf a <hi>member.</hi> In the firſt page, (numbered 7) he propoſes a queſtion that is hardly intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſpeaks of it as very "intereſting", and <hi>modeſty</hi> expreſſes his intention to determine it "<hi>once for all</hi>"—And this, without <q>the <hi>leaſt</hi> intention of offence or <hi>controverſy</hi>
                  </q>, (p. 8.) He alſo ſays there, <q>The propoſed vindication is deſigned to convince the <hi>candid.</hi> To confute the <hi>obſtinate,</hi> and ſilence the <hi>malicious,</hi> is not in the <hi>power of reaſon.</hi>
                  </q> But, by the way, I have always ſuppoſed that the <hi>obſtinate</hi> were as capable of being <hi>confuted</hi> by the <hi>power of reaſon,</hi> as others; tho' much more hard to be <hi>convinced,</hi> or put to <hi>ſilence</hi>: And I hope that this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will never ſerve as an example, to ſhew the wide difference betwixt theſe things, which he now ſeems to conſider as the ſame. But be that as it may,
<q>"Quid dignum tanto feret hic PROMISSOR hiatu!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT appears that he was put upon this <hi>deſperate</hi> undertaking, by ſomething which, it ſeems, hid offended him in a news-paper, relative to the miſſions. And p. 9. he threatens the unknown author of a ſuppoſed inſult on the <hi>dead,</hi> with
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:009441_0168_0F748E0CEB1E0E30"/>inſtant deſtruction from his powerful quill; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the old Trojan Hero,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Extinxiſſe</hi> nefas —, et ſumpſiſſe merentis</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Laudabor</hi> poenas—</l>
                  </q>
Conſidering the <hi>occaſion,</hi> I wonder he did not adopt the next words alſo—
<q>
                     <l>— Animumg; expleſſe juvabit</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Ultricis</hi> flammae, et <hi>cineres</hi> ſatiaſſe meorum.</l>
                  </q>
And the following line may perhaps be proper for a motto for him, if he ſhould again write on the ſubject: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Talia <hi>jactabam,</hi> et <hi>furiatâ</hi> mente ferebar.</q>
But as he was to determine the matter <hi>once for all,</hi> this is not to be expected.</p>
               <p>FROM the 9th to the 18th p. we find him chiefly employed, firſt in <hi>miſquoting,</hi> and then in <hi>miſrepreſenting</hi> the charter; in putting in an excluſive claim to <hi>orthodoxy</hi> for the clergy of the church of England; making the Society <hi>ſtewards</hi> and ſovereign <hi>proprietors,</hi> in the ſame breath; reproaching others with "great ignorance, or ſomething <hi>worſe</hi>"; reviling the religion of our Forefathers in the moſt opprobrious terms; and ſhewing how <hi>greatly</hi> our reformation in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,—without the improvement of our <hi>morals</hi> or <hi>piety,</hi> is <hi>the work of the Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAVING thus prepared the way, he propoſes (p. 18.) <q>to take leave of this popular objection [againſt the Society] with <hi>ſo full a confutation,</hi> that it will be <hi>diſingenuous</hi> ever to advance it again.</q> How is that to be done?—Why, by <q>
                     <hi>confidently</hi> reſting his <hi>proof</hi> on the unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>teſtimony</hi> of two—<hi>Prelates</hi>
                  </q>—; both of
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:009441_0169_0F748E0D5D66AC20"/>them members of the Society—Let us ſee how many <hi>metamorphoſes</hi> they have already paſt thro'; 1ſt. they were <hi>Clients,</hi> 2dly. <hi>Judges,</hi> 3dly. they are <hi>Witneſſes</hi>; and all in the ſame cauſe, <hi>their own.</hi> But then, they are moſt <hi>unexceptionable</hi> Witneſſes—<q>incapable either of <hi>miſtake</hi> or <hi>miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation</hi> in a matter ſo thoroughly known to them.</q> And (p. 19) he ſpeaks of the "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible reaſons" of one of them. So that Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s fruitful imagination has produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another <hi>metamorphoſis.</hi> It ſeems they are now neither <hi>Clients, Judges,</hi> nor <hi>Witneſſes</hi>; but, 4ly. <hi>Reaſoners,</hi> pleading their own cauſe. What they ſay, whether called their <hi>teſtimony</hi> or their <hi>reaſoning,</hi> has been taken notice of; and others may think for themſelves, whether it is <hi>unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable</hi> and <hi>invincible,</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>PAGE 23. Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> as well he might, makes an <q>apology for his undertaking to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a Society, which is <hi>above cenſure,</hi> as it is <hi>incapable of wrong motives.</hi>
                  </q>—An extraordinary Society indeed! And ſurely ſome <hi>apology</hi> was needed for officiouſly undertaking the defence of a Society ſo <hi>incapable</hi> of erring. So that he has, in effect, infallible Clients, infallible Judges, infallible Witneſſes, and infallible Reaſoners; all on the ſame ſide with his own infallible <hi>Self,</hi> and all in the <hi>ſame perſons</hi>! Did ever any man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a more <hi>needleſs</hi> work! He ſeems indeed to repent; and <q>promiſes, in amends, to employ his <hi>ſtudies,</hi> for the future, <hi>to better purpoſes,</hi>
                  </q> (p. 23.) Upon which <hi>condition,</hi> I think he ought to be <hi>forgiven</hi>; and, all things conſidered, I know
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:009441_0170_0F748E0E797A3008"/>of none ſo <hi>unlikely</hi> to overlook his officious error, <hi>as the Society themſelves</hi>—But it would ſeem hard, not to ſhew ſome lenity to him; eſpecially if, as he there ſays, <q>This buſineſs, in truth, was <hi>forced</hi> upon him</q>—In ſuch a caſe, whoſe <hi>ſtars</hi> could poſſibly <hi>prevent their writing</hi>; if they will but make the ſad caſe their own! This <hi>force,</hi> it ſeems, was chiefly put upon him by a Braintree gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, as he ſuppoſes, had inſulted the memory of a deceaſed miſſionary; and <q>by the honor <hi>done him</hi> of <hi>ſharing</hi> in the inſult</q>; as he has accurately expreſſed it. He is very ſevere on the ſaid Braintree gentleman: Whom, however, I ſhould think almoſt as <hi>inhuman</hi> and <hi>barbarous</hi> as he has been repreſented, if he deſired any ſeverer revenge on Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> than that <hi>he ſhould write more</hi> SUCH CONSIDERATIONS and DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FENCES.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> then paſſes ſome other <hi>compliments</hi> of a pretty <hi>extraordinary nature,</hi> however juſt, on the Society, <q>the honor of our age and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</q> &amp;c. Theſe might poſſibly, however, have come from ſome <hi>other perſon</hi> with as good a grace, as from a <hi>member</hi> of the Society; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that old maxim, <q>Let another praiſe thee, and <hi>not thine own mouth.</hi>
                  </q> He then gives it as his opinion, that the Society <q>cannot better apply their munificence than in providing, <hi>throughout our colonies,</hi> for the <hi>decent</hi> celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of public religion</q>. By which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his whole argument, he muſt mean plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>epiſcopal</hi> churches even in thoſe colonies, where the people <q>have the means of religion
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:009441_0171_0F748E0F374EEB98"/>already, in <hi>other proteſtant communions</hi>
                  </q>. And who can doubt, but that this is a better way of <hi>applying their munificence,</hi> than ſending miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the heathens, or only to the heatheniſh colonies, almoſt <q>abandoned to atheiſm and infidelity!</q>
               </p>
               <p>IN the laſt page, however, he talks in a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous ſtrain about <q>beholding this extenſive country, juſt won to the Britiſh empire, <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually acceding,</hi> AMONG <hi>its numerous inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,</hi> to the empire of JESUS CHRIST, and of conſequence, flouriſhing in ARTS, in SCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE</q>, &amp;c. The arts and ſciences are indeed very valuable in their places; tho' they do not ſeem to be AMONG the primary or principal of thoſe important bleſſings, which flow from the knowledge and obedience of JESUS CHRIST. However, they are not to be deſpiſed. And who can doubt, but that they will be as much improved by the miſſion of ſo accompliſh'd a Scholar as Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> in the confines of our <hi>College,</hi> as the religious ſtate of the country has been amended by the epiſcopal miſſions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? This was perhaps one deſign of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Society therein; that ſo the advancement of <hi>learning</hi> among us, may in time be as <hi>greatly their work,</hi> as the reformation of our religion is at preſent: I would hope, much more ſo—</p>
               <p>AFTER quoting ſomething on this noble oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from VIRGIL, Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> concludes with ſome fine lines from Mr. POPE's MESSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AH: Tho' if he had either mentioned POPE's name, or mark'd them as a quotation, he might
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:009441_0172_0F748E10119F9CA8"/>perhaps at once have been thought leſs a <hi>poet</hi> by the common people, and given ill-natur'd critics leſs occaſion to tax him as a <hi>plagiary.</hi> Not that I myſelf in the leaſt doubt his poetical talents. For even in this <hi>didactic</hi> performance, he has obliged us with many ſpecimens of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular imagination, a florid, rhetorical diction, a briſk, lively way of reaſoning, marvellous turns of argument, ſurpriſing hyperboles, and divers other <hi>licences</hi> even in grammar, truly poetical: Nay, he has altered, not to ſay <hi>corrected</hi> two of theſe lines from POPE!
<q>[Dum malè recitas, incipit eſſe <hi>tuum</hi> —]</q>
               </p>
               <p>NOW, from a gentleman whoſe proſaic, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative compoſitions are ſo agreeably <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed,</hi> what might not be expected, if he were to write poetry <hi>in earneſt</hi>!—But it may be doubted whether he will be able to ſpare time from his more important concerns, to oblige the world in this way; eſpecially if, as ſome of late ſuppoſe,
<q>—his reverend mind Begins to grow <hi>right-rev'rendly</hi> inclin'd</q>—</p>
            </div>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>WHATEVER Any may imagine, the author of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Obſervations</hi> ſeriouſly declares, that he heartily wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> well; happy here and hereafter. And if theſe obſervations ſhould contribute any thing towards <hi>ſhewing him to himſelf,</hi> this will not tend to obſtruct, but to promote that benevolent end—</p>
               <p>BUT the main end which he had in view, was much more extenſive, general and important;—that of ſerving the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs, of pure and undefil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion in America; in diſtinction from all private, party-opinions whatſoever. He is very far from making
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:009441_0173_0F748E10E7D5EBF8"/>any pretenſions to an exemption from miſtakes. But as to his ſincerity, and the uprightneſs of his intentions; if it were expedient to make proteſtations in ſuch caſes, he could very chearfully appeal to that tribunal, at which ALL are finally to appear.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING he is in principle and profeſſion an anti-epiſcopalian; yet he ſincerely loves and honors all virtuous, candid and moderate men of all denominations among Chriſtians; by no means excepting thoſe of the epiſcopal communion; with ſeveral of whom he has a perſonal and agreeable acquaintance, which he would be glad to keep up: Nor would he willingly and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily give offence to any perſons of that perſuaſion.</p>
               <p>THO' he wiſhes the people of New-England to ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith CHRIST hath made them free; and not to return under that yoke of epiſcopal bondage, which ſo miſerably galled the necks of our Forefathers, that they were not able to bear it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took refuge in America; yet he is far from deſiring to inflame the paſſions of any one ſect or party againſt another: So far from it, that he would ſincerely rejoice to be in the leaſt degree inſtrumental of uniting them in the bonds of Chriſtian charity, on the true plan of the goſpel. In order to which, he cannot think an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act uniformity either in <hi>ſentiment,</hi> or in modes of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and <hi>diſcipline,</hi> neceſſary. The former is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in this imperfect ſtate, on divers accounts; and the <hi>latter</hi> not to be expected, unleſs in countries where the invaluable bleſſing of liberty is ſacrificed to a far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior object. Zealous attempts to eſtabliſh an exact uniformity in religion, have generally, if not always proved pernicious to the peace of ſociety, to chriſtian charity and morals, in a very high degree: All eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic hiſtory is a proof of this. Such an uniformity and the advancement of the hierarchy, have too apparently been favourite objects with the SOCIETY all along parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as to New-England; while the heatheniſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the poor Negroes and Indians have been proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:009441_0174_0F748E117A6F2AE0"/>neglected. And to what one valuable purpoſe? —unleſs cauſing alienation of affections, and animoſities among us, can be accounted ſuch!—And theſe are the principal fruits which, conſidering the religious ſtate of this country, can in reaſon be expected from a continued proſecution of this deſign.</p>
               <p>THE author concludes with his humble and earneſt prayers, that GOD would unite all the SOCIETIES for the propagation of TRUE RELIGION, whether in England, Scotland or America, in a ſincere deſire to promote <hi>that alone</hi>; and afford them reſpectively ſuch lights and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as may ſerve to advance this one, ſingle, moſt important end, to his own glory, and the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; till in the revolutions of times and ſeaſons, which He keeps in his own power, <q>the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM ſhall be preached for a witneſs among ALL NATIONS</q>; and that grand event ſhall take place, in praying for which all ſincere Chriſtians are already unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;—even that HIS KINGDOM may come, and HIS WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN. AMEN!</p>
