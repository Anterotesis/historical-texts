            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reverend Mr. James Hervey was born on Friday the 26th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1713-14, at Hardingſtone, a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage about a mile from Northampton; his mother taught him to read, and kept him at home till he was ſeven years old, when he was ſent as a day ſcholar to the free grammar ſchool at Northampton; there he continued under the tuition of a Mr. Clarke, maſter of the ſchool, and vicar of St. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre's in that pariſh, till he was ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, learning the Latin and Greek languag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in which he would have made a much earlier progreſs, had he not been kept back by his maſter, who (out of a blind pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030558_0011_0FE7CA3D0E23BC58"/>affection and partiality) would ſuffer none of his ſcholars to learn faſter than his own ſon.</p>
            <p>In the year 1731 he was ſent by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the univerſity of Oxford, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od a Fellow of Lincoln College, where he reſided ſeven years, and took his degree of Batchelor of Arts <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hervey took his degree of Maſter of arts at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge in 1752 and entered at Clarehall.</note>; during his continuance here, he made himſelf maſter of Dr. Keil's Anatomy, Dr. Derham's Phyſico and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro-Theology, and Spectacle de la Nature, tranſlated by Mr. Humphrey's, which laſt work he read with peculiar pleaſure; nor was he leſs delighted with the Rev. Mr. Spence's Eſſay on Pope's Odyſſey, to which he often acknowledged himſelf greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for his improvement in ſtile and compoſition.</p>
            <p>He entered into holy orders as ſoon as his age and the cannons of the church would allow, and became curate to his father, who was then poſſeſſed of the living of Weſton-Favell and Collingtree, near Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; in the year 1738, he went by invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Stoke Abbey, the ſeat of his valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend, Paul Orchard, Eſq. <note n="†" place="bottom">This gentleman was the father of Paul Orchard, Eſq. for whom Mr. Hervey ſtood ſponſor, and to whom he dedicated the ſecond volume of his Meditations.</note> here he
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030558_0012_0FE7CA3E98E31800"/>continued above two years, greatly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſpected.</p>
            <p>In the year 1740 he undertook the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Biddeford, fourteen miles from Stoke Abbey; here he had a large congregation, though the income, with the aſſiſtance of friends, did not exceed ſixty pounds a year <note n="*" place="bottom">This ſum, though hardly ſufficient to maintain him, he enjoyed with thankfulneſs, and was univerſally beloved for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> piety, humility, and diligent diſcharge of his duty.</note>; in this place, and very probably about this time, he planned his ingenious meditations; the firſt volume of which was publiſhed in February, 1745-6, and the ſecond in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, 1747, which have been ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the public, that the twenty-firſt edition of them appeared laſt year.</p>
            <p>About the year 1743 he returned from Biddeford to Weſton-Favell, leaving behind him many diſconſolate friends <note n="†" place="bottom">The rector dying, and the new one diſmiſſing Mr. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey from the curacy (though againſt the conſent of all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhoners, who would have maintained him at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence) was the occaſion of his leaving Biddeford.</note>; and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued curate to his ſather till June 1750, at which time, being greatly impaired in health occaſioned by his conſtant attention to his duty <note n="‡" place="bottom">This, if it may be ſtiled a fault, few, if any of our clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the preſent day, can be charged with.</note>, he removed to London to try what
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030558_0013_0FE7CA45247782A0"/>effect a change of air and relaxation of mind would have upon him: here he ſtaid from June, 1750, till about May, 1752, in which time he had a very ſevere and dangerous ſit of illneſs; being recovered, and his father dying in this year, he returned to Weſton-Favell, and ſucceeded him in that and the living of Collingtree, worth about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty pounds a year.</p>
            <p>In November following he puoliſhed, in a letter to a lady of quality, his remarks on Lord Bollingbroke's letters on the ſtudy and uſe of hiſtory, ſo far as they relate to the hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the caſe of Noah denouncing a curſe upon Canaan; the next year he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, for the benefit of a poor ſick child, a ſermon which he preached at the viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Archdeacon of Northampton, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of "The Croſs of Chriſt, the Chriſtian's glory;" a few months afterwards he wrote a recommendatory preface to Burnham's pious memorials.</p>
            <p>In 1755 he publiſhed his Theron and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſio, or dialogues and letters on the moſt important and intereſting ſubjects, which met with great approbation from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced and diſcerning, excepting thoſe who differed in religious ſentiments from Mr. Hervey, concerning the imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030558_0014_0FE7CA46B21A9960"/>of Chriſt, of which theſe dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues principally treat; eſpecially the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr. John Weſley, Sandeman, and a few others <note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. John Weſley, Sandeman, and ſeveral other perſons, publiſhed letters in anſwer, or rather oppoſition to Mr. Hervey's Theron and Aſpaſio, ſome little time after the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the latter; endeavouring to prove Mr. Hervey's ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments erroneous and unſcriptural, which Mr. Hervey together with ſeveral friends and eſpouſers of his tenets anſwered. <hi>(See a Deſence of Theren and Aſpaſio, printed for C.

            <p>In Auguſt 1757, Mr. Hervey publiſhed three ſermons which he had preached on public faſt-days, to which have been ſince added, his viſitation ſermon preached in 1753, his poſthumous ſermon on <q>the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Reconciliation,</q> and his <q>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations on the prevailing cuſtom or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of viſiting on Sundays;</q> all which evidently manifeſted his genuine piety, and earneſt deſire to promote the cauſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his great Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>In this year alſo, he publiſhed a new edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his favorite author, Mr. Jenk's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, in two volumes, with a ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendatory preface, ſhewing the uſe and excellency of them; but his conititution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak, and his illneſs (which was of the conſumptive kind, under which he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for ſeveral months, with ſingular pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030558_0015_0FE7CA4B49FED298"/>and ſubmiſſion) increaſing on him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout October, 1758, gave great reaſon to fear his uſefulneſs would ſoon be terminated, as it proved; for on the 2d of December following, in the evening, after praying with his family, he ſeemed to be arreſted by the ſtroke of death, ſo that it was with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty his ſiſter and ſervant got him up ſtairs to his own room: from this time, growing worſe every day, he became ſenſible that his end was near. He had now frequent and violent fits of the cramp, which gave him great pain, and a heſtic cough, which was ſo bad at night, that he could ſeldom lie in bed till four o'clock in the morning, <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hervey, when in health, uſually got up about ſix in the morning in winter, and much earlier in ſummer.</note> and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him often to get up at two.</p>
            <p>On the 15th of this month he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a pain in his ſide, for which he was blooded, at his own deſire, though againſt the conſent of his worthy friend and phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Dr. Stonhouſe; who apprehen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d him too weak to bear it. When the ſurgeon came, he could ſcarcely perceive any pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore took away only four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of blood, intimating to thoſe around, that the caſe was deſperate.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Mr. Abraham Maddocks, his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030558_0016_0FE7CA4D63E1CA80"/>curate, being with him in the afternoon, Mr. Hervey ſpoke to him in very ſtrong and pathetic terms of his aſſurance of faith, and of the love of God in Chriſt. <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe were his expreſſions, <q>O what and how much has Chriſt done for me, and how little have I done for ſo loving a Saviour! If I preached even once a week, it was at laſt a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to me; I have not viſited the people of my pariſh as I ought to have done, and thus have preached as it were from houſe to houſe; I have not taken every opportunity of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſt.</q> Theſe expreſſions were accompanied with fears, which, leſt they ſhould be miſinterpreted, as they had been converſing of his approaching end, and his aſſurance of faith, he proceeded thus:—<q>Don't think that I am afraid to die; I aſſure you I am not. I know what my Saviour has done for me, and I want to be gone; but I wonder and lament to think of the love of Chriſt, in doing ſo much for me, and how little I have done for him.</q>
—In another converſation, diſcourſing likewiſe of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching diſſolution (which he always did with the utmoſt calmneſs and ſerenity,) and of the little which we know of God's word, he ſaid, <q>How many precious texts are there, big with the moſt rich truths of Chriſt, which we cannot comprehend, which we know nothing of; and of thoſe we do know, how few do we remember? A good textuary is a good divine, and that is the armour, the word of God is the ſword. Thoſe texts are the weapons which I muſt uſe, when that ſubtle ſpirit that arch-adverſary of mankind, comes to tempt and ſift me in my laſt conflict. Surely I had need be well provided with theſe weapons; I had need have my qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver full of them, to anſwer Satan with texts out of the word of God when he aſſaults me.</q>
               </note>On the nineteenth the pains of his body abated, and he grew drowſy and lethargic; the next day Dr. Stonhouſe came to ſee him, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in his opinion, Mr. Hervey could not live above four days longer. <note n="†" place="bottom">The Doctor happening, on this viſit, to ſpeak of the many conſolations through Chriſt, which a good man enjoys in the proſpect of death; and diſcourſing on the emptineſs of worldly honour to an immortal, and the unprofitableneſs of riches to the ungodly Mr. Hervey replied, <q>True, Doctor, true; the only valuable treaſures are in heaven; what would it avail me now, to be archbiſhop of Canterbury. Diſeaſe would ſhew no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to my mitre. It is godlineſs and not grandeur that will avail me hereafter. The goſpel is offered to me, a poor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try parſon, the ſame as it is to his Grace. Chriſt makes no difference between us. Oh! why then do miniſters thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the charge of ſo kind a Saviour; fawn upon the great, and hunt after worldly preferments with ſo much eagerneſs, to the diſgrace of our orders? Theſe, theſe are the things, Doctor, and not our poverty or obſcurity which render the clergy ſo juſtly contemptible to the worldlings. No wonder the ſervice of our church, grieved I am to ſay it, is become ſuch a formal lifeleſs thing, ſince it is, alas! too generally exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by perſons dead to godlineſs in all their converſation; whoſe indifferent religion and worldly minded behaviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the little regard they pay to the doctrines of the Lord who bought them.</q>

            <p>The day before his death, Mr. Hervey went a few ſteps acroſs his room, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtrength ſailing him, he ſunk, rather than fell down, his fall being broken by his ſiſter, who obſerving his weakneſs ran and caught him; but he fainted away, and was to all human appearance dead, it being a conſiderable time before any pulſe could be perceived.</p>
            <p>When he came to himſelf, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mr. William Hervey, who was come from London to viſit him, ſaid, we were afraid you was gone; he anſwered, <q>I wiſh I had.</q> And well he might wiſh ſo, conſidering his painful and melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for his ſtrength was exhauſted, his

            <p>On the 25th (Chriſtmas day) on which he died, Mr. Maddocks paying him a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſit, Mr. Hervey lift his head and opened his eyes, as he fat in his eaſy chair (for he could not lie down) to ſee who it was, and ſaid, "Sir, I cannot talk with you now."</p>
            <p>He complained much all the day of a great inward conſlict, which he had, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand upon his breaſt, and ſaying, <q>O! you know not how great a conflict I have.</q> During this time he almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly lift his eyes towards heaven, with his hands claſped together in praying form, and ſaid two or three times,—<q>When this great conflict is over, then—</q> but ſaid
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030558_0019_0FE7CA5B62862280"/>no more; though we may naturally ſuppoſe he meant then he ſhould be at reſt. Dr. Stonhouſe came to ſee him about three hours before he died. Mr. Hervey ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and affectionately urged on him the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and care of his everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, as here is no abiding place; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him not to be over-charged with the cares of this life, but to attend to the one thing needful.</p>

            <p>The doctor ſeeing the great difficulty and pain with which he ſpoke (for he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuffocated with phlegm and frequent vomitings) and finding by his pulſe, that the pangs of death were then coming on; deſired that he would ſpare himſelf: "No," ſaid he, <q>Doctor, no; you tell me I have but a few moments to live, O! let me ſpend them in adoring our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</q> He then repeated the 26th verſe of the lxxiii Pſalm; <q>Though my fleſh and my heart fail me, yet God is the ſtrength of my heart and my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A little while after this he expatiated in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030558_0020_0FE7CA5CF920CD38"/>a moſt ſtriking manner on the 1ſt of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, chap. iii. ver. 22, 23. <q>All things are yours, life and death;—for ye are Chriſt's.</q> "Here," ſays he, <q>is the treaſure of a Chriſtian. Death is reckoned among this inventory, and a noble treaſure it is. How thankful am I for death, as it is the paſſage through which I paſs to the Lord and Giver of eternal life; and as it frees me from all this miſery, you now ſee me endure, and which I am willing to endure as long as God thinks fit; for I know he will by and by, in his own good time, diſmiſs me from the body. Theſe light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but for a moment, and then comes an eternal weight of glory. Oh welcome, welcome death! thou mayeſt well be reckoned among the treaſures of the Chriſtian—To live is Chriſt, but to die is gain <note n="*" place="bottom">Philippians, i. 21.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here he pauſed a little, and then with great ſerenity and ſweetneſs in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, repeated thoſe words: <q>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, according to thy moſt holy and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words, for mine eyes have ſeen thy precious ſalvation <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke ii. 29, 30.</note>.</q> 
               <q>Here, Doctor, is my cordial: what are all the cordials
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030558_0021_0FE7CA62B6164C58"/>given to ſupport the dying in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that, which ariſes from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſalvation by Chriſt? this, this ſupports me.</q>—About three o'clock he ſaid, <q>the great conflict is over, now all is done.</q> After which he ſcarce ſpoke any words intelligibly, except now and then, "precious ſalvation."</p>
            <p>During the laſt hour he ſaid nothing, but leaned his head againſt the ſide of his eaſy chair, and in this poſture, without a ſigh, groan, or ſtruggle, ſhut his eyes eternally on this world, and died in the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four and five o'clock in the afternoon of Chriſtmas day, 1758, and in the forty-fifth year of his age.</p>
            <p>When his body was conveyed to the ſilent chambers of the grave, it was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own expreſs deſire with the poor's pall, and he was buried under the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion table in the chancel of Weſton-Favell church, on Friday, December 28th, in the preſence of a numerous congregation, full of regret for the loſs of ſo excellent a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: his funeral indeed was a moſt awful and very affecting ſight. Mr. Maddocks, his curate, who buried him, was himſelf in tears;—ſome were wringing their hands, others ſobbing; many were ſilently weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030558_0022_0FE7CA6449FC4640"/>but all were inwardly and ſincerely grieved, as their looks ſufficiently teſtified.</p>
            <p>It may truly be ſaid of him, that few lives have ever been more heavenly:—few deaths have ever been more triumphant.— He died in the Lord, and is now at reſt, where even the wicked ceaſe from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: his name is recorded in the annals of eternity, and the honours conferred on him by Chriſt, will for ever continue blooming and incorruptible in the world of glory.</p>
            <p>His character, both in his public and private capacity, was of the moſt exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary kind.</p>
            <p>As a miniſter he performed all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that office with the greateſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. —In the pulpit he was earneſt and fervent, and ſhewed that he felt the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of what he preached. Nor did he think it ſufficient to preach on Sabbaths only, but ſet up a weekly lecture eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wedneſday evening at Weſton-Favell church. The laſt two or three years of his life he could ſcarce do any thing more than preach once on the Sabbath, when people from many miles around flocked to hear him. His Wedneſday evening lecture at ſeven, he diſcontinued for the laſt year. He had not been able for ſome time to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030558_0023_0FE7CA6A02FC1578"/>preach at Collingtree, or to viſit his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners at their own houſes, as his cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom had been; but he encouraged them to come to him, and to converſe freely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubjects relating to their eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and on ſuch occaſions he would ſpeak with a force and propriety peculiar to himſelf.</p>
            <p>He always preached without notes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on ſome very particular occaſions; and his method was judicious, clear, and not encumbered with too many ſubdiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. His weakneſs rendering him for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months before his death incapable of ſpeaking to his congregation as uſual, he ſhortened his diſcourſes, and took a moſt uſeful method of inculcating his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for after he had expounded his text, and divided his ſermon into two heads, (rarely into more, and never exceeding three) he would ſpeak brieſly, and at the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of each head enſorce what he had ſaid, by a pertinent text of ſcripture, deſiring his congregation (which was generally very numerous) to turn to their bibles, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble down the text. "Now", added he, <q>my dear brethren, if you forget my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, you cannot forget God's word in this text, unleſs you wilfully throw your bibles aſide. Shew theſe to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or the abſent part of your family
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030558_0024_0FE7CA6B8E286F78"/>when you return home.</q>—Then he gave a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riking exhortation, at the end of it another text for them to double down, ſo that he had always three texts; in order to their finding of which, he pauſed in the pulpit two or three minutes.</p>
            <p>He endeavoured as much as poſſible to diveſt himſelf in his public diſcourſes of his uſual elegance of ſtile, and to adapt his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the loweſt capacity. In this he followed the example of Luther, who in his table talk ſays, <q>If in my preaching I were to pay a regard to Philip Melancthon, and other learned divines, then I ſhould do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good. I preach in the plaineſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the illiterate, and that gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His method of catechiſing children in church, and of ſpeaking to them in private, was very engaging and uſeful. He would aſk not only ſuch queſtions as were ſuitable to the words of the catechiſm, but alſo ſuch as would ſtrike at the capital vices of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, yet without giving perſonal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>Some of his pariſhioners having lain in bed on the Sabbath morning longer than he approved, and others having been buſy in foddering their cattle when he was coming
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030558_0025_0FE7CA715FD33F50"/>to church, and ſeveral having frequented the alehouſe, he thus catechiſed one of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before the congregation:—Repeat me the fourth commandment. Now, little man, do you underſtand the meaning of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? Yes ſir.—Then if you do, you will be able to anſwer me theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. —Do they keep holy the Sabbath-day who lie in bed till eight or nine o'clock in the morning inſtead of riſing to ſay their prayers and read the Bible? No ſir.—Do thoſe keep the Sabbath who fodder their cattle when other people are going to church? No ſir.—Does God Almighty bleſs ſuch people as go to alehouſes, and do not mind the inſtructions of their miniſter? No ſir?—Do not thoſe that love God read the bible to their ſamilies, particularly on Sabbath-day evening, and have prayers eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning and night in their houſes? Yes ſir.</p>
            <p>He uſually breakfaſted at nine, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called his family together, and required each of his ſervants to repeat by heart the text which he had explained the preceding evening, and then he would recapitulate his expoſition; by which method both his text and commentary were imprinted on their memories: after this he had prayers.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon when he was called down
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030558_0026_0FE7CA72ECA22D90"/>to tea, he uſually brought his Hebrew Bible or Greek Teſtament with him, and would ſpeak either upon one or more verſes, as occaſion offered; and in the ſummer ſeaſon he would now and then drink tea, when his health would permit him, with ſome of his moſt ſerious pariſhioners; and then five or ſix of the neighbours were invited; and Mr. Hervey's converſation was remarkably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, as he had a happy talent at ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alizing almoſt every incident, and was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a moſt obliging and cheerful diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In the exerciſe of his charity, he choſe to clothe the poor rather than to give them money: and he would get ſome judicious perſon to buy linen, coarſe cloth, ſtockings, ſhoes, &amp;c. for them at the beſt hand: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that the poor could not purchaſe on ſuch good terms what they wanted at the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhops, and with ſmall ſums of money. "I am, ſaid he, God's ſteward for the poor, and I muſt huſband the little pittance I have to beſtow upon them, and make it go as far as poſſible." But when money would be really ſerviceable to a family, as to a prudent houſe-keeper, diſtreſſed by ſickneſ or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, he would give five or more guineas at a time; taking care that it ſhould not be known whence the money came. He was particularly deſirous of getting the advice of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030558_0027_0FE7CA78A6D02C28"/>a phyſician (or at leaſt of ſome judicious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary) for the ſick poor; and was ever ready to procure them the very beſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. He would frequently petition ſuch phyſicians of his acquaintance in different parts of the kingdom, as he apprehended to be charitably diſpoſed, to give their advice occaſionally when they rode through a town, to ſuch poor creatures, as the clergyman of the place, or ſome ſubſtantial inhabitant, ſhould recommend, as real objects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. He greatly diſapproved of the clergy's attempting to give medicine to their pariſhioners; as he thought it impoſſible for them to do it with the requiſite judgment. "Let my brethren," he would ſay "give them wine, bread, or beer, and get good ſpoon-meats made for them; but medicines are of too important a nature to be given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately." He obſerved that by his own method the ſick poor had the very beſt medicines, as the phyſician ſaw them himſelf, and bought them very cheap; becauſe the apothecary, knowing they were for charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſes, charged the phyſician no more than prime coſt, with ſome little allowance mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his trouble in compounding them; and as the phyſician knew what diſeaſes were curable, there was no waſte of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in fruitleſs attempts to cure caſes, which, though actually incurable, perſons of leſs judgment could not pronounce to be ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:030558_0028_0FE7CA7A34D5B220"/>
He gave away a great number of good books, with ſuitable inſtructions for their uſe, and eſpecially Bibles. In the blank leaf he frequently wrote ſomething ſtriking, or elſe ſtuck in a printed paper, relating to the promiſes of God in and through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>His income was but ſmall, and it may be wondered how he managed it ſo well, as to have ſuch large ſums to ſpare for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable uſes. He ſold the copy of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, after it had paſſed through ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral editions; which ſale of the copy, and the profits of the former impreſſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to about £.700, all which he gave away in charity. He made of it a bank for the poor. "This," ſaid he, <q>I have devoted to God, I will on no account apply it to any worldly uſes: I write not for profit or for fame, but to ſerve the cauſe of God; and as he has bleſſed my attempt, I think myſelf bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the diſtreſſes of my fellow creatures with the profit that comes from this quarter.</q> He has likewiſe left all the future profits of his works to ſome of the charitable uſes above ſpecified.</p>
            <p>In any expence relating to himſelf, he was extremely frugal, that he might be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral to others; and it was always his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030558_0029_0FE7CA8000EF9408"/>to die juſt even with the world. <q>I will be my own executor,</q> ſaid he. And as he died on Chriſtmas day, his fund ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired almoſt with his life. What little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, he deſired might be given in warm clothing to the poor in that ſevere ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>To the inſtances of his charity we may properly add an incident which affords a very ſtrong proof, not only of the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his heart, but of his regard to practical religion, and to the doing of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work within his power.</p>
            <p>A day or two before his death, when he was reduced to ſuch extreme weakneſs as to be unable to read, and could with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſpeak, a little account being ſettled with him by a friend, on the balance of which he received eighteen ſhillings, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the money with great indifference, he expreſſed himſelf to this effect, "I would gladly diſpoſe of this ſmall ſum in ſuch a manner as may do the moſt good; it is the only act which I now am, and probably the laſt that I ſhall be able to perſorm. Give yourſelf the trouble of looking amongſt theſe books, and you will find Mr. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's pamphlet, at the latter end of which are, I remember, ſome hints concerning the means of promoting religion in ourſelves and others, which (even with ſome additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030558_0030_0FE7CA818CC02518"/>and improvements, which you might eaſily make) will not fill more than a ſheet of paper; and if ſtuck up or framed, might be particularly uſeful in that form; let then ſuch a number of them be printed and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away as this money will admit of." His orders were properly executed, and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of ſuch an angelic temper were equally matter of edification and comfort to his friends, as this charitable legacy (if we may ſo call it) will be to all who receive and rightly uſe it.</p>
            <p>This incident, it is to be hoped, will be candidly conſidered by thoſe who draw ſuch inferences from his favourite doctrine, and ſtrong expreſſions of the all-ſufficient righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, as his whole life did in the moſt exemplary manner confute. No man had ever a greater diſregard for money, which he eſteemed unworthy of his notice, upon any other account than as it furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the means of doing good. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may here borrow the ſentiment and expreſſion of our celebrated poet, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that,
<q>"He felt his ruling paſſion ſtrong in death."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In learning he was inferior to few. Greek was almoſt as familiar to him as his native language. He was a great maſter of the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030558_0031_0FE7CA873B326758"/>claſſics; and in the younger part of his life had written ſome verſes, which ſhewed no contemptible genius for poetry. He had a critical knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, and delighted in it.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to his private capacity, he was never known to be in a paſſion. No worldly concerns (though he ſometimes met with very trying ones) ever effected him. His humility rendered him invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. When he was miſrepreſented and calumniated, he would ſay, "Our enemies are ſometimes our beſt friends, and tell us truths; and then we ſhould amend our faults, and be thankful for ſuch informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if what they ſay be not true, and only ſpoke through malice, then ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be conſidered as diſeaſed in their minds, and we ought to pray for them. They are to be pitied," ſays he, "and I might as juſtly be angry with a man that is diſeaſed in his body." In his ordinary tranſactions, with others, he was ever cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, punctual, juſt, and candid, to perſons of every denomination.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding theſe irrefragable proofs, that Mr. Hervey's opinions (even ſuppoſing ſome of them in their remote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, were not altogether defenſible) had no pernicious influence on ſo excellent
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030558_0032_0FE7CA88CCA97868"/>a mind; it is but juſtice to add, that he guards againſt the abuſes of the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, though he has himſelf been branded with that odious name.—Nay, ſome of his enemies have not ſcrupled to aſſert, "That his tenets were diſhonourable to God, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of all goſpel-holineſs, and deſtructive even of common morality, and very injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſociety itſelf, by making men melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and regardleſs of buſineſs".</p>
            <p>Theſe were the very words of an abuſive and anonymous letter, ſent to him by the poſt; on which that meek and excellent man obſerved to an intimate friend, with all his uſual mildneſs, "Indeed this gentleman may be ſaid, I think, to write at random.— Surely he has never read my works; if I knew where to direct to him, I ſhould deſire him to turn to what I have advanced, page 124, in the ſecond volume of my Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſuch a reply, I would hope, might convince him of his miſtake."</p>
            <p>Whatever vein of Calvaniſm runs through his writings, yet the weakening the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to purity and holineſs of life, were the fartheſt imaginable, from his view: and when perſons of judgment have pointed out to him ſuch expreſſions as were liable to be miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in that reſpect, he always diſavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſuch meaning, affirmed, that the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030558_0033_0FE7CA8E842C2550"/>fault was not in the evangelical doctrines, ſo much inſiſted on by him, but in the miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prchenſion, ignorance, or inattention of thoſe who abuſed them to licentiouſneſs.—He would then add, he was ready to alter or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any ſentiment or expreſſion, which he apprehended to be really objectionable; but that to make things equally clear to every one's apprehenſion, or to have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon every one's mind, was an imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable attempt: for as the poet very juſtly obſerves,

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>C BOTH HIS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPACITY.</head>
            <p>FROM the foregoing account of Mr. Hervey, it evidently appears he was a truly good man in life, as well as by <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>; indeed I do not remember ever to have read, or converſed with any one concerning him, but what joined in acknowledging his title to the character and appellation of <hi>a real Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who differed from him in religious ſentiments, could not but acknowledge that he wrote as became a man of true piety; and greatly eſteemed him for that candour,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030558_0035_0FE7CA95D4C54A90"/>liberality of ſpirit, humility, and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to mankind in general, which ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared in his publications. But as I find him portrayed in a late treatiſe, <note n="*" place="bottom">The Triumphs of Faith.</note> in far more lively colours, and characterized in much better language than I would flatter myſelf maſter of, permit me to extract it, for the entertainment, ſatisfaction, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of my ſerious readers.</p>
            <p>"A more diligent, diſtinguiſhed and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful labourer in the church of Chriſt, has perhaps ſeldom appeared; and in few characters was there ever a more happy conjunction of the gentleman, the ſcholar, and the Chriſtian. The upright heart, the deep humility, under all his attainments, the warmeſt love to mankind in endeavours to promote their beſt intereſts, the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous attachments to truth, the nobleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as well as the daily practice of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical holineſs, the utmoſt ſerenity of mind under the moſt grievous afflictions, and a perfect reſignation to the will of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, are a few of the outlines of his character, and juſtly repreſent him to have been a burning and ſhining light to the world. As a <hi>burning</hi> light, he warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many by his example, and as a <hi>ſhining</hi> light, he inſtructed many by his doctrine;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030558_0036_0FE7CA975FCDB170"/>he was a ſtrenuous aſſerter of the free grace of God, taught men to be rich in good works, without placing the leaſt dependance upon them; the Saviour was all in all to him, and a Redeemer's unſearchable riches it was his buſineſs and delight to publiſh. To bring ſinners to Chriſt, as needy beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars to buy wine and milk, without money and without price, was the conſtant aim of all his public miniſtrations as well as elegant writings; and it hath pleaſed God to make both remarkably ſucceſsful, and him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of turning many from the ſervice of Satan to the living God. Oh, that they may become more and more ſo; and that many may be led by the ſpirit of all grace, to follow his ſteps, and go and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe! <note n="*" place="bottom">The writer of this account appears to be not only a great admirer of Mr. Hervey, but a zealous advocate for his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentiments, as well as a ſincere well wiſher to the cauſe, and no indifferent ſcholar in the ſchool of Chriſt, himſelf.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When at ſchool, Mr. Hervey was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remarked for genius and parts: and he there laid the foundation of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which has ſince gained him ſuch uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal eſteem. Until the year 1733, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when he became acquainted with ſome perſons diſtinguiſhed for their ſerious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of religion and zeal for its promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſeems to have been (as in the phraſe)
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030558_0037_0FE7CA9D11741FD8"/>a <hi>moral</hi> man only. Some of his letters that are written from college, when he was not more than twenty, either ſpeak a language very different from free grace, for which he was afterwards ſo powerful an advocate, or at leaſt treat very confuſedly of it. But be this as it may, the obſcurity did not long continue: the Holy ſpirit ſoon opened his eyes to ſee the ſalvation of God. By the eye of faith he obtained and enjoyed clear views of it. He was able to act faith upon it: for his faith worked by love. The love of God was the glorious theme on which he dwelt; and the love of Chriſt his delightful ſong in this the houſe of his pilgrimage. This heart-felt love to God and Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in every part of his after conduct; as a miniſter, his faith wrought by love to the ſouls of men <note n="*" place="bottom">Though the term <hi>faith</hi> is frequently mentioned here, the tautology, it is hoped, will not be diſguſting, as it could not properly be avoided.</note>; watching over his flock with peculiar care and aſſiduity; privately exhorting, and publicly calling and inviting them, with all the earneſtneſs of a faithful ambaſſador of Jeſus Chriſt, that they would turn and live:—as the maſter of a family, in the care of the ſouls of his domeſtics; in their reproof, inſtruction, and government; as a member of ſociety, in good works to his neighbour: in charities to the poor, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030558_0038_0FE7CA9E9B671360"/>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">His charity and benevolence to the poor and needy was truly exemplary, and deſerving univerſal imitation, wherever God has given abilities and opportunity to exert it; a friend of Mr. Hervey's obſerves, his liberality was ſo diffuſive, that at his death he left no more than 185. beſides what would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the expence of his funeral.</note> clothing the naked and feeding the hungry; informing the young, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the aged; in zeal for the ſalvation of all, fervent; deſirous to be of ſome good to every perſon, and in every company, and of great good in many; a proof of which was the exemplary lives of ſuch perſons, their circumſpect behaviour, and, in ſeveral inſtances, eminent piety:—as a private Chriſtian, he was under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſame faith working by love to the will of God. He walked cloſe after Chriſt, and was himſelf a ſtriking proof, that the belief of Chriſt's righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imputed to him for his juſtification, was ſo far from a licentious doctrine, that it inſpired him with the nobleſt motives to a grateful obedience; <note n="†" place="bottom">Where true grace reigns in the heart, it will be evidenced by good works, in the life; ſaving faith, without works, is as impoſſible as the ſun to ſhine without giving light.</note> and his holy life was, in truth, the ſtrongeſt recommendation of his principles. God had enriched him with great humility, as well as great gifts and graces. He was humbled by the power of grace. He had been a very vain, proud young man; but this emptied him of pride
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030558_0039_0FE7CAA45A8FBE60"/>and ſelf; and this clothed him with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. —In his ſtudies, the ſame principles of faith, working by love, was manifeſt: all was directed to the glory of God; all aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom: "Nulla dies ſine linea; nulla epiſtola ſine Chriſto," was his motto. <note n="*" place="bottom">Not a day without a line, or an epiſtle without ſomething of Chriſt in it.</note> 
               <hi>Claſſical</hi> learning, for which he had a reſined taſte, and <hi>heathen</hi> authors, were in his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter years dropped, to make way for the more important ſtudy of the <hi>ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>

            <p>From theſe particulars, then, a judgment may be formed of this eminent character; but ſtill more from the laſt ſcenes of life, and the glorious triumphs of his faith, in the hour of death. Its preciouſneſs, indeed, never more appeared than at that time, by it he ſaw and apprehended the ſalvation of God, and rejoiced in the cleareſt views of his own intereſt in it. At this ſeaſon,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030558_0040_0FE7CAA5E651AD58"/>when, as he himſelf writes, "little bodily reſt could be got, and medicines gave no relief, the never failing cordial of the love of Chriſt was felt:
<q>
                  <l>"Religion bears my ſpirits up:</l>

"I think then, dear ſir, that we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely miſtaken, and ſuſtain a mighty loſs in our moſt important intereſts, by reading ſo much, and praying ſo little.

I have read of a perſon who would often retire to his clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and was remarkable for his frequency and fervency in devotion; being aſked the reaſon of this ſo ſingular a behaviour, he replied, becauſe I am ſenſible I muſt die.

            <p>"A miniſter is a perſon of the greateſt importance imagirable; his office is of the moſt univerſal concernment, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour therein of the moſt beneficial and prejudicial tendency; <hi>beneficial,</hi> if he be able,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030558_0046_0FE7CABBE6128560"/>faithful, and watches for the ſouls commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his care, as one that muſt give an account; <hi>prejudicial,</hi> if he be unſkilful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, and unconcerned about the ſpiritual welfare of his people. The things that pertain to ſalvation, and the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining everlaſting life, are lodged in his hands. He is the ſteward of the myſteries of Chriſt, and ſo the guardian (under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace) of your beſt and moſt abiding intereſts. If through ignorance he miſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, or through idleneſ neglect this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty truſt, it may be the ruin of immortal ſouls: whereas, if he be both diſcreet and diligent in his holy vocation, he may be the inſtrument of the richeſt benefits to thoſe committed to his charge. His pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and his preaching to them, may be attended with ſuch a bleſſing from on high, as will fill them with heavenly wiſdom, form them to true holineſs, and fit them for the future glory. Benefits theſe not inconſiderable or momentary, but ſuch as are great beyond all expreſſion, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eternity.—A faithful miniſter of the everlaſting goſpel has a tolerable ſtock of knowledge. Though not enough to explain all myſteries, or to anſwer every perplexing queſtion; yet ſufficient to make himſelf and his hearers wiſe unto ſalvation. He may be ignorant of many things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much diſparagement to himſelf, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030558_0047_0FE7CAC112A34550"/>to his people; but he muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and able to teach others all that is neceſſary for them to know.—Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He has not only ſome underſtanding, but ſome experience alſo in the ways of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. He has learnt to ſubdue, in ſome meaſure, the pride of his nature, and to be humble in his own eyes, and not fond of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe from others. He has broke the impetuoſity of his paſſion, and generally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes his ſoul in patience; or if upon ſome very ungrateful and provoking uſage, he cannot calm his temper, yet he can curb his tongue; and though his ſpirit be ruſſled, yet his words will be gentle. He is moſt commonly meek, after the manner of his bleſſed Maſter, and will always return bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for curſing, according to his holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. He has often looked into the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, and the length of eternity; he has weighed the greatneſs and richneſs of heaven, with the inſignificant and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanneſs of earth; and diſcovers ſuch a mighty difference, as helps him to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world, even while he is in it. So that he is no lover of filthy lucre, no hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of carnal pleaſures; but his hopes, his deſires, and all his views of happineſs are hid with Chriſt in God. He is courteous and condeſcending, and will ſtoop with the utmoſt cheerfulneſs to the loweſt perſon in his pariſh. He will be affable and kind,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030558_0048_0FE7CAC409DF05F8"/>and ſeek to pleaſe, not himſelf, but his neighbours, for their good to edification. But you muſt not expect to find him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling or ludicrous; he will not preach to you on the Sunday, and play with you on the week-days, but carry the ſpirit of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons into his ordinary converſation. He will maintain an uniform gravity of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, without ſuffering it to be frozen into moroſeneſs, or thawed into levity. He will love his pariſhioners, not for their agreeable perſons or amiable qualities, but becauſe they are redeemed by the blood of Chriſt. It will be his buſineſs and conſtant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I had almoſt ſaid his meat and drink, to ſet forward their ſalvation. That by thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being made meet for the inheritance of the ſaints in light, his crucified Lord may ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. He will never forget the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate requeſt of his Saviour, but thoſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and commanding words, "Feed my ſheep, feed my lambs" will be engraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tables of his heart. To fulfil this earneſt requeſt and execute this laſt charge of his deareſt Redeemer, will be the fixed and invariable ſcope of all his deſigns. If at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time he hits this deſirable mark, by bringing home to the fold any that have gone aſtray, he will be as glad as one that findeth great ſpoils.—To ſee the people of his care preſiſting in profaneneſs, ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030558_0049_0FE7CAC9F3B457E8"/>and an unconverted ſtate, will be the greateſt grief that he feels: but to ſee his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren walking in the truth, mortifying their evil affections, and growing up in goodneſs as the calves of the ſtall, this will be his joy, and crown of rejoicing, better to him than thouſands of ſilver and gold. It is his work to win ſouls, and by the former of theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, he is fitted for it, by the latter he is wholly devoted to it. And in order to proſecute it with the greater ſucceſs, he will, firſt, take heed to himſelf, that his life be a fair and beautiful tranſcript of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſuch as may remind men of, and be daily reinforcing his inſtructions. He will not bind the yoke upon your ſhoulders till he has wore it himſelf; and ſhould the paths of religion prove ever ſo thorny, he will go firſt and beat the way. As far as human infirmities permit, he will ſtrive to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable and unreprovable, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the apoſtle's challenge, Be ye followers of me, even as I am of Chriſt. Secondly, his preaching will be plain; full of ſuch uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe as may be edifying to the better learned, and yet delivered in ſo eaſy a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as may be intelligible to the ignorant. It will not only be plain, but powerful alſo, if preceding prayers and tears, if words coming warm from the heart, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an ardent deſire of being attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; if to feel himſelf what he ſpeaks, and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030558_0050_0FE7CACB83B003F8"/>ſo long that it may be felt by others, can make it ſuch, he will declare the whole will of God, without withholding or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any. Be the truth ever ſo diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, contrary to your profits, or contrary to your pleaſures, you will be ſure to hear it. He will indeed ſhow it in as lovely a light, and make it as palatable as he can, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will prevail upon him to conceal or diſguiſe it. Thirdly, he will not confine his teaching to God's day or houſe, but will exerciſe his care of you every day, and will bring it home to your own houſes, whether you invite him or no. He will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſit you, and for the ſame end as he meets you at church. Now, ſhall you like this part of his duty, or bid him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when he comes on ſuch an errand? nay, he will think himſelf bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed farther, and to enquire into the ſtate of your ſouls, and your proceedings in your families; whether you are competently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſaving knowledge? and are careful to increaſe it daily, by allowing a daily portion of your time for reading the ſcriptures? what virtues you are deficient in, what vices you are ſubject to? what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil tempers, what vile affections, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly paſſions, are predominant in you, and want to be ſuppreſſed? whether your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are catechiſed, and your ſervants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed? whether you are conſtant in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030558_0051_0FE7CAD0E5763D90"/>worſhip, and at your cloſet devotions? how you ſpend the Sabbath? whether you ſquander it away in impertinent viſits, idle chat, or fooliſh jeſting; or in holy diſcourſe, reading and meditation? Theſe, and other points of the like nature, he will examine into, and exhort you to amend what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, no leſs than encourage you to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in that which is good. Nor will he exhort you once or twice only, but again and again, and hardly leave off till he has won your conſent. In things that relate to himſelf, he will be eaſily ſaid nay; but when the great God inſiſts upon obedience, and a bleſſed immortality will be loſt by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, he will be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, he will ſolicit with unwearied applications the important cauſe, and preſs you to perform your duty, as the poor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow importuned the unjuſt judge to avenge her of her adverſary; he will add to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, reproofs: his eyes will be open, and his ears attentive to what paſſes in his pariſh; and when any one walks diſorderly, he will meet with him as Elijah did Ahab, <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Kings xxi. 20.</note> with a rebuke in his mouth. This I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he will not rail at, nor accoſt you with reproachful words; but he will certainly ſet before you the things that you have done. He will not defame you behind your backs,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030558_0052_0FE7CAD31388C738"/>but whether you be rich or poor, whether you be pleaſed with it or not, he will bear in mind the commandment of the Lord, and "ſhew his people their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins. <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah lviii. 1.</note>" He will tell you with tenderneſs, but yet with plainneſs, that ſuch courſes are a ſad and too ſure a proof, that grace has not had its proper work on your ſouls, that ye are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and have not the ſpirit of Chriſt. So that a true miniſter of the goſpel will be a conſtant inſpector of your actions, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful monitor of your duty, and an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reprover of your offences. He will guide you by his council, animate you by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and bleſs you by his prayers."</p>
            <p>In another letter, entitled "the Hope of Glory, a ſtrong incitement to duty," Mr. Hervey breaks out in the following expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, which ſeem to be the real language of his heart, and the pious breathings of a ſoul filled with love to God, and fervent zeal to promote his cauſe, intereſt and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the world.</p>
            <p>"Oh that miniſters may work for their dying Lord, while they have health; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that ſickneſs may confine them to their chamber, and death will impriſon
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030558_0053_0FE7CAD8D73577A0"/>them in the grave. God Almighty give us courage that we may fight the good fight of faith and prudence, that we may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour our high calling; 'ere long eternity will receive us, and then we ſhall reſt from our labours, and forget our tranſient toils, amidſt innumerable ages of perfection, glory, and joy."</p>
            <p>The high eſteem he had for, and the pleaſure he experienced in the work of the miniſtry, may be gathered from the enſuing paſſages in a letter he wrote to one of his friends, on his taking up the ſacred charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Ambaſſor of the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>"I heartily congratulate you, my dear friend, my dear <hi>brother,</hi> I muſt call you now, on this change. And I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, that he hath counted you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, putting you into the miniſtry.—How honourable is your new office, to be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy from the King of Heaven! how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful your province, to be continually converſant in the glorious truths of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the unſearchable riches of Chriſt! how truly gainful your buſineſs, to win ſouls! This is indeed an everlaſting poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. —And how illuſtrious the reward, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to your faithful ſervice! when the chief ſhepherd ſhall appear, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a crown of glory, that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030558_0054_0FE7CADA60F69940"/>May we clearly diſcern, and never forget what a maſter we ſerve; ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that all the angels of light adore him: ſo gracious that he ſpilt his blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his enemies: ſo mighty that he has all power in heaven and earth, ſo faithful, that heaven and earth may paſs away, much ſooner than one jot or tittle of his word fail. And what is his word, what his engagement to his miniſters? LO I AM WITH YOU AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAYS. I write it in capitals, becauſe I wiſh it may be written in your heart.—Go forth my dear friend, in the ſtrength of this word: and verily you ſhall not be confounded. Plead with your great Lord, plead for the accompliſhment of this word, and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhall proſper in your hand. In every exerciſe of your miniſterial duty, act an humble faith on this wonderful word, and the heart of ſtone ſhall feel the powers of hell fall —Remember you are now a miniſter of God, that your tongue is to be a well of life: you are to believe in Chriſt, daily to cheriſh your faith in Jeſus, that out of your heart may flow rivers of living waters. Such tides of heavenly and healing truths as may refreſh the fainting ſoul, and animate its feeble gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hervey's zeal in publiſhing the glad tidings of ſalvation, and maintaining the doctrine of an "imputed righteouſneſs," by

<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030558_0057_0FE7CAE764BB9080"/>with our natural apprehenſions; nor fall in with the method which we might have deviſed for the ſalvation of mankind.

            </p>
            <p>This notion, you ſay, is abſurd even to common ſenſe.—A ſaying upon which I muſt beg leave to put a queery.

            <p>To this judge I refer the cauſe.</p>

How elſe could the immaculate Jeſus be puniſhed as the moſt inexcuſable tranſgreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or?

            <p>If Chriſt, then, was our ſubſtitute, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to penal ſuffering, why may he not ſtand in the ſame relation, with regard to juſtifying obedience? there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the one, as for the other.

            <p>
               <hi>Theron.</hi> I freely grant, that Chriſt was puniſhed in our ſtead; that his death is the expiation of our ſin, and our ſecurity from penal ſuffering. But this—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſpaſio.</hi>—Will undeniably prove, that ſin was imputed to him, otherwiſe he could not truly ſuffer in our ſtead, nor be juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at all. "And imputation is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and juſtifiable in one caſe, as in the other; for they both ſtand upon one and the ſame foot, and for that reaſon, he who

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſpaſio.</hi> I was in hopes you would pay the greater regard to his opinion, becauſe he is not in the number of the whimſical fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natics. —However, "ſay I theſe things as a man," or on man's authority alone? "ſaith not the law the ſame alſo?" ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the peace-offering, the Holy Ghoſt has declared; "if any of the fleſh of the ſacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it ſhall not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither ſhall it be imputed unto him that offereth it." Hence we learn, that ſacriſices and offerings, when duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, were imputed to the offerer; imputed
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030558_0060_0FE7CAF143F8AD88"/>to him for reconcilation and peace with God. And wherefore? becauſe they were figures of Chriſt, of his attonement and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which, in like manner, are imputed to ſinners for their pardon and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Leſt you ſhould think this proof being deduced from <hi>typical</hi> uſages, not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluſive—I would farther obſerve, that the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs bears an evident analogy to another great and acknowledged truth of religion. We did not perſonally commit Adam's ſin, yet are we chargeable with guilt, and liable to condemnation <note n="*" place="bottom">Romans, v. 12, 13.</note>, on that—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theron.</hi> How! we chargeable with guilt, and liable to condemnation, on account of Adam's tranſgreſſion! this an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth? No; it is a poſition I muſt deny, I had almoſt ſaid, which I cannot but abhor. None other could, in the eye of juſtice and equity, be blamable for any offence of our firſt parents, but they only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſpaſio.</hi> So ſays Theron; but what ſays St. Paul? Your's may be the voice of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon, but what is the language of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation? in whom, that is in "Adam all have ſinned." <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. v. 12.</note>

               <hi>Theron.</hi> The words, if I remember right, are— "for all that have ſinned." Is it poſſible that <hi>Aſpaſio</hi> ſhould forge the hand, or counterfeit the ſeal of the Holy Ghoſt, in order to eſtabliſh a favourite notion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſpaſio.</hi> Impoſſible I hope.—In the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, the words are tranſlated as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
            <p>In theſe words, the apoſtle aſſigns a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the preceding aſſertion, "by one man's ſin, death came upon all."—It might be replied, is not this ſtrange? is not this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable?

               <hi>Theron.</hi> It really ſeems to me a thing <hi>impoſſible,</hi> that one man's righteouſneſs ſhould be made anothers. Can one man live by the ſoul of another? or be learned by the learning of another? Good Aſpaſio, never attempt to maintain ſuch palpable abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

            <p>My friend's objection inſinurates what we never aſſert: that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is <hi>transfuſed</hi> into believers, which would, doubtleſs, be in fact, impoſſible, as it is in theory abſurd. But this we diſavow, as ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly as you can oppoſe. The Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's righteouſneſs is made ours, not by <hi>infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> but by <hi>imputation.</hi> The very terms we uſe may acquit us from ſuch a ridiculous charge; as imputation ſignifies, "a placing to the account of one what is done or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another," Accordingly we believe, that the righteouſneſs which juſtifies abides
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030558_0064_0FE7CB002C93B288"/>in Chriſt, but is placed to our account: that Chriſt, and Chriſt alone, actually perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it: that Chriſt, and Chriſt alone, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally poſſeſſes it: but that performing it in our ſtead, and poſſeſſing it as our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-head, God imputes it to us. God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts us for it—accepts us as much, as if we had, on our own behalf, and in our perſons, ſeverely fulfilled it.</p>
            <p>Though one man cannot live, be actuated with a principle of life; <hi>by the ſoul</hi> of another; yet you muſt allow, that one man, nay, that many men may live, be continued in the poſſeſſion of life, for the righteouſneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or elſe you muſt do what I am ſure you abhor.—You muſt charge with abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impoſſibility, even the declaration of Jehovah himſelf; "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then will I ſpare all the place for their ſakes <note n="*" place="bottom">Geneſis, xviii. 26.</note>" When your worthy miniſter was diſabled, by a rheumatic diſorder, from attending on the buſineſs of his function, ſeveral of the neighbouring cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy gave him their aſſiſtance: was he not by this <hi>vicarious</hi> performance of his office, <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled</hi> to all the profits of his living?

            <p>"Every man is that only (and can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe) which he is in himſelf."—if I had never ſeen the Bible, I ſhould have yielded my ready aſſent to his propoſition. But when I open the Old Teſtament, and find it written by the prophet; "In the Lord ſhall all the houſe of Iſrael be juſtified. <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah, xlv. 25.</note>" When I turn to the New Teſtament, and hear the apoſtle ſaying," ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <note n="†" place="bottom">Coloſſians, ii. 10.</note>:" I cannot concur with Theron, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradicting the revelation. Iſrael, or the true believer, is ſaid to be juſtified; and the foundation of this bleſſing is declared to be, not in <hi>himſelf,</hi> but in the Lord. The Coloſſians are ſaid to be complete, which,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030558_0068_0FE7CB0EDE636370"/>we are very certain they were not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and are expreſsly aſſured they were ſo in Chriſt. Hence it appears quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my friend's aſſertion, that ſinners both <hi>have</hi> and <hi>are</hi> that in Chriſt, which they neither have nor are in themſelves.

            <p>I believe your miſtake proceeds from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting to diſtinguiſh between inherent and imputed.—We never ſuppoſe that a proſane perſon is devout, or an intemperate perſon ſober.

            <p>Neither is this a precarious or unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinion, but the clear and poſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of ſcripture. <hi>He juſtifieth,</hi> he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves from guilt, he treats us as righteous.

            <p>God the father is well pleaſed with this righreouſneſs of our Redeemer. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his complacency by the moſt empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical words: behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth, viz. in Chriſt and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. God is not only pleaſed, but delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: his very ſoul, every perfection of the godhead, with ineffable ſatisfaction, reſts and acquieſces in them. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is well pleaſed. He eſteems it his honour to ſhine forth as the everlaſting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his people. It is the brighteſt jewel of his mediatorial crown.</p>
            <p>In this he ſees the travel of his ſoul, and is ſatisfied <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſaiah, liii. 11.</note>; accounting himſelf fully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed

            <p>The holy Spirit is equally pleaſed with this great tranſaction, and its matchleſs ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; it is his peculiar office and favourite employ to convince the world of the fullneſs and efficacy of their Saviour's righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Since then this method of acceptance and ſalvation is excellent and glorious in the eyes of the adorable Trinity—ſince it magnifies the law, and yields the moſt exalted hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to its divine Author—ſince it makes ample proviſion for the holineſs of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and the happineſs of a ruined world, why ſhould my friend any longer diſlike it, oppoſe it, or treat it with a cold indifference?</p>
            <p>Surely all theſe grand recommendations are enough to over-rule any little objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may criſe from the ſuſpicions of timidity, or be ſtarted by the artifices of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry and cunning.</p>
            <p>It is very probable I may meet with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; death in my family, or diſeaſe in my perſon; diſappointments may fruſtrate my deſigns; Providence may wear a frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſpect; as though the Lord had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy

            <p>Nothing is ſovereign to clam our fears, and remove all apprehenſions of the Divine wrath, or to draw the curtains of horror from around our ſick beds, and throw our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing eye-lids off the gloom of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, as a believing improvement of the imputed righteouſneſs of our dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: this clears up the mournful ſcene, and takes away the ſting of tribulation and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Attending to this great propitiation, the ſufferer ſees his ſins forgiven, and his God reconciled; from whence he concludes, that the ſevereſt afflictions are only fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and ſhall not exceed his ability to bear, and ſhall aſſuredly obtain a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iſſue.

            <p>To believe in this righteouſneſs, is to meet death at our Saviour's ſide, or rather, like good old Simeon, with the Saviour in our arms.—They overcame, ſays the belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſciple, they overcame the laſt enerny, not by natural fortitude, or philoſophic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, but by the blood of the Lamb <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xii. ii.</note>.

This is a method to which we ſhould never ſubmit; this is a propoſal which we ſhould always ſpurn, were not our natural ſentiments rectified, and our high imaginations abaſed by the power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace.</p>
            <p>Let me remind you of a little incident which you muſt have read in the Grecian hiſtory: a certain ſtranger came one day to dine with ſome Lacedemonians, who always ſat down at a public table, and were content

            <p>
               <hi>Theron.</hi> What preparative? Did you not juſt now ſay that all was free, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing needful, but only to receive the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſpaſio.</hi> True; nothing is needful, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining God to give, but only as inclining us to receive.—Would you ſeek, would you ſolicit, would you ſo much as accept a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from your ſovereign, unleſs you ſtood convicted of ſome capital crime, or was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently liable to condemnation? neither will ſinful man ſeek, no, nor <hi>accept</hi> the great attonement, till he is made ſenſible that the wrath of God and the damnation of hell are what he juſtly deſerves, and what, without the propitiation of Chriſt, he muſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuffer</p>

This, then, is the preparative.—A ſenſe of the horrible ſilthineſs of the leaſt ſin in the ſight of God; of the innumerable ſins of our heart and life, and our undone damnable ſtate on this account.—While <hi>deſtitute</hi> of theſe convictions, our ſouls will be like the full ſtomach, that loathes even the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb.

               <hi>Aſpaſio.</hi> "By the law is the knowledge of ſin." Conſequently, by the law is the conviction of our undone ſtate.

It is the bleſſed ſpirit alone who can remove the veil of ignorance from our minds; and ſhew us either "the wonderful things of God's law," or the glorious myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, of his goſpel. In this ſenſe, our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite poet ſpeeks a truth, as ſingularly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant as it is elegantly expreſſed:

Compile a ſecret hiſtory of your heart and conduct.—Take notice of the manner in which your <hi>time</hi> is ſpent, and of the ſtrain which runs through your <hi>diſcourſe.</hi> How often the former is loſt in trifles, how often the latter evaporates in vanity. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the <hi>principle</hi> from which your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flow; whether from the ſteady habitual love of God, or from ſome rambling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, 02 and a cuſtomary propenſity to pleaſe yourſelf.—Minute down your ſins of <hi>omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; how frequently you neglect to glorify your Creator, to edify your fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and to improve yourſelf in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and holineſs. Obſerve the frame of your ſpirit in <hi>religious</hi> duties; with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance they are undertaken, and with what indevotion performed; with how many wanderings of thought, and with how much dullneſs of deſire. How often, in tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>commen</hi> affairs, you feel the inordinate ſallies of paſſion, the workings of evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, or the intruſion of fooliſh ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
            <p>Regiſter thoſe <hi>ſecret</hi> faults, to which none but your own conſcience is privy, and which none but the all-ſeeing eye diſcerns. Often review theſe intereſting memoirs; frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemplate yourſelf in this faithful mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and do not be afraid to ſee your wants and weakneſſes, the depravity of your heart,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030558_0081_0FE7CB406C6CB9F8"/>and the iniquity of your life.—An artiſt, ſome time ago, took a ſurvey of your eſtate; drew the form, and meaſured the dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of each encloſure; pictured out every hedge, and ſcarce omitted a ſingle tree which grew upon the premiſes.—Act this with your will, your underſtanding, and your affections.</p>
            <p>By this means we ſhall diſcover the ſins which moſt eaſily beſet us, which moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently elude our vigilance, and baffle our reſolution. We ſhall learn <hi>how</hi> to poſt our guard, <hi>when</hi> to exerciſe the ſtricteſt watch, and <hi>where</hi> to direct the artillery of prayer. —In a word, we ſhall learn better than from ten thouſand volumes, to know ourſelves. A knowledge which was ſuppoſed, by the ancient philoſophers, to deſcend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and which, I believe, our chriſtian divines will allow, has a happy tendency to lead people thither; becauſe, of all other preparatives, it beſt diſpoſes them for that bleſſed Redeemer, who is the way, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to thoſe bliſsful manſions.</p>
            <p>Now I have mentioned a <hi>way,</hi> let me ſuppoſe you travelling through an unknown country: you came to a place where the road divides itſelf into two equally inviting parts. You are at a loſs which track to purſue. Whoſe direction will you chooſe

            <p>Oh, my Theron! what is the drop of a bucket to the unfathomable waves of the ocean? what is a grain of ſand to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſureable dimenſions of the univerſe? what is an hour or a moment to the endleſs revolutions of eternity? ſuch are all human endowments and temporary attainments, compared with his righteouſneſs, who "thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet took on him the form of a ſervant?

How great indeed! ſince all that the Lord Jeſus <hi>did and ſuffered,</hi> was done and ſuffered for us men, and for our ſalvation, "is imputed unto us for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs," and is the cauſe, the ſole but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſufficient cauſe of our juſtification.</p>
            <p>Is not your heart enamoured, my dear Theron, with a view of this incomprehenſibly rich grace? what ſo excellent, what ſo comfortable, what ſo deſirable as the giſt of a Saviour's righteouſneſs? though delineat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this <hi>feeble</hi> pen, methinks it has glory and dignity enough to captivate our hearts, and fire our affections; fire them with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and diſtinguiſhable deſires after a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal intereſt and propriety in it.—O! may
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030558_0086_0FE7CB509A8DF940"/>the eternal Spirit reveal our Redeemer's righteouſneſs, in all its heavenly beauty and divine luſtre! then, I am perſuaded, we ſhall eſteem it above <hi>every thing</hi>; we ſhall regard it as the <hi>one thing</hi> needful; we ſhall count <hi>all things</hi> in compariſon of it, worthleſs as the chaff, and empty as the wind.</p>
            <p>But here ſinners may "ſuck and be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this breaſt of conſolation;" yea, millions and thouſands of millions "may milk out and be delighted with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of its glory."—Here we ſhall find the doctrine of ſupererogation, no longer a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera, but a delightful reality. Here, indeed, is an immenſe ſurpluſage, an inexhauſtible fund of merit, ſufficient to enrich a whole world of indigent and miſerable creatures; ſufficient to make their cup run over with a ſuperabundant fulneſs of peace and joy, ſo long as time ſhall laſt, and when time ſhall be no more. For to uſe the apoſtle's weighty argument, "if by one man's offence, death reigned by one; much more they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs ſhall reign in life by me", Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Is it reaſonable that we ſhould aſcribe more power to Adam, a mere man, in making us ſinners, than in Chriſt, the GOD-MAN, in making us righteous? No verily. If <hi>one</hi> offence, committed by one man, made all his poſterity chargeable with
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030558_0087_0FE7CB5655A47378"/>guilt, and liable to death, MUCH MORE ſhall the <hi>manifold</hi> inſtances of our <hi>divine</hi> Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's obedience abſolve all his people from condemnation and puniſhment, and intitle them to the honours and joys immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Think not that what I have written is the language of rant; it is a paraphraſe, though I muſt confeſs, but a ſcanty paraphraſe, on David's practice, and David's faith; "My mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy righteouſneſs and thy ſalvation all the day, for I know not the numbers thereof." The ſupereminent righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obtained thereby, he declares, ſhall be the choſen, the principal ſubject of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; not on a ſabbath only, but on <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day</hi> of the week, of the year, of his life: not barely at the ſtated returns of ſolemn devotion; but on every common occaſion, in every ſocial interview, <hi>all the day long.</hi> Why will he thus dwell, perpetually and invariably dwell, on this darling theme? becauſe, "he knew not the numbers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of." It is impoſſible to meaſure the value, or exhauſt the fullneſs of theſe bleſſings. The righteouſneſs is unſpeakable, the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is everlaſting.

And, for my part, I will not ceaſe to pray, that a ſenſe of this ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently grand and precious righteouſneſs may be written on my Theoron's heart.— On thoſe living tables, may it be like figures cut on a rock of ſolid marble, or inſcribed on the bark of a ſolid tree; be <hi>laſting</hi> in its duration as the former, and <hi>ſpreading</hi> in its influence as the latter; and it will then be a ſure proof that his name is written in the book of life.</p>
            <p>You give a moſt aſtoniſhing account of the <hi>preſſure</hi> of-the atmoſphere. Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed! that we ſhould be continually ſurrounded, continually overwhelmed with ſuch a load of air; quite dreadful to think upon! yet not be cruſhed to death; no, nor be ſenſible of the leaſt weight.—This, I think, may ſerve to repreſent the ſtate of ſinners, <hi>unawakened</hi> from carnal ſecurity. Loads, more than <hi>mountainous</hi> loads of guilt, are upon his ſoul, and he perceives not the burden. For this reaſon, he is under no apprehenſions of the vengeance and fiery indignation which he deſerves; he has no
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030558_0089_0FE7CB5DA74BAD58"/>ſuperlative eſteem for the attonement and merits of the Redeemer, which alone can deliver him from the wrath to come; but if once his conſcience <hi>feels</hi> what his lips, perhaps, have often repeated, "we do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly repent us of theſe our miſdoings; the remembrance of them is grievous unto us, the burden of them intolerable;" then how will he prize ſuch a text; "The Lord laid on Chriſt the iniquity of us all:" how will he long for an intereſt in the Lamb of God, "which taketh away the ſin of the world!" then that Jeſus, who has finiſhed the tranſgreſſion, and brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs, will be all his ſalvation, and all his deſire.</p>
            <p>That Mr. Hervey was a great admirer of the charms of rural nature, and cloſely ſtudied the beauties of her ſylvan retreats, may be readily proved by his choice of, and attachment to the ſilent receſſes of the country, and his pictureſque deſcriptions of them in various parts of his admired writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: the beginnings of his Meditations, Contemplations and Dialogues, plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his taſte and genius, eſpecially for rural and luxuriant paintings; the following extracts from the aforementioned dialogues will, I doubt not, be very acceptable to all who are fond of romantic and ſequeſtered ſcenes.</p>

Cauliflowers ſheltered their fair complexion under a green umbrella, while the borage diſhevelled her locks, and braided them with native jewels of a finer than the fineſt ſapphires.—On the <hi>ſunny ſtopes,</hi> the cucumber and melon lay baſking in the collected beams. On the <hi>raiſed beds</hi> the artichoke ſeemed to be erecting a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, while the aſparagus ſhot into ranks of ſpears. The <hi>level ground</hi> produced all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cooling ſallads and nouriſhing eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; which, like the brows of the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic</hi> conquerors, were bound with a fillet of unfading parſley; or, like the pictures of the mountain nymphs, were graced with a chaplet of fragrant marjoram.—In ſhort, nothing was wanting to furniſh out the wholeſome luxury of an <hi>antediluvean</hi> ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</p>
               <p>Soon a high wall intervenes, through which a wicket opens, and tranſmits them into the regular and equidiſtant rows of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030558_0092_0FE7CB6677B19180"/>that it looks like an arrangement of rural piazzas, or a collection of diverſified viſtas. The eye is every where entertained with the exacteſt uniformity, and darts, with unobſtructed eaſe, from one end of the branching files to the other. On all the boughs lay a lovely evolution of <hi>bloſſoms,</hi> arrayed in milky white, or tinged with the ſofteſtred; crouding into one general cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without relinquiſhing a vacant ſpace for leaves, they formed the faireſt, the gayeſt, the grandeſt alcove that fancy itſelf can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.—It is really like the Court of Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; none can approach it, without ſinding his ideas brightened, and feeling his temper exhilirated.</p>
               <p>Contiguous to this correct diſpoſition of things, nature has thrown a <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, groteſque, and magnificently confuſed. It ſtretched itſelf with a large circular ſweep to the north, and ſecured both the olitory and the orchard from incommoding winds. Copſes of hazel and flowering ſhrubs filled the lower ſpaces, while poplars quivered aloft in the air, and pines pierced the clouds with their leafy ſpires. Here grew clumps of fir, clad in everlaſting green; there ſtood groves of oak, which had weathered for ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the wintry ſtorm.—This woody theatre was interſected by a <hi>winding walk,</hi> lined with elms of an inſuperable height, whoſe
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030558_0093_0FE7CB6C4BC91AE8"/>branches, uniting at the top, reared a majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic arch, and projected a ſolemn ſhade. It was impoſſible to enter this loſty labyrinth, without being ſtruck with a pleaſing dread. As they proceed, every inflexion diffuſes a deeper gloom, and awakens a more penſive attention.</p>
               <p>Having ſtrolled in this darkſome avenue, without a ſpeck of ſunſhine, without a glimpſe of the heavens; on a ſudden, they ſtep into open day.—Surpriſing! cries Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſio, what a change is this! what a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enchantment is here!—One inſtant whelmed in Trophonius's cave, where darkneſs lours, and horror frowns, tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the next into the romantic ſcenes of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia, where all is lightſome, and all is gay.

Thoſe lawns, green with freſheſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, thoſe fields, rich with undulating corn, where were they all a moment ago?

—Surveyed all with thoſe eyes, which for forty tedious years had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to dry ſands, ragged rocks, and the irkſome waſtes of a deſolate howling wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>On the firſt <hi>moſſy hillock,</hi> which offered its couch, our gentlemen ſeated themſelves. The riſing ſun had viſited the ſpot to dry up the dews and exhale the damps that might endanger health, to open the violets, and expand the primroſes that decked the green.

               <p>Theron, according to his uſual manner, made many improving remarks on the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and its furniture.

               <p>The bloſſoms that array the branches, the ſtowers that embroider the mead, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and entertain <hi>our</hi> eyes with every charm of beauty; whereas, to <hi>other</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they are deſtitute of all thoſe attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which reſult from a combination of the lovelieſt colours, and moſt alluring forms. Yonder ſtreams that glide with ſmooth ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity along the vallies, glittering to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant view like ſheets of poliſhed ſilver, or ſoothing the attentive ear with the ſoftneſs of aquatic murmurs, are no leſs <hi>exbilirating</hi> to the fancy, than to the ſoil through which they paſs.

Can any of the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures formed in the looms, or extended in the palaces of Perſia, vie with the covering of this ample area? vie with it in grandeur of ſize, or delicacy of decoration?</p>
               <p>What a profuſion of the gayeſt ſlowers, fringing the banks, and embroidering the plain!—Nothing can be brighter than the luſtre of theſe ſilver <hi>daiſies</hi>: nothing deeper than the tinge of thoſe golden <hi>crowfoots.</hi> Yet both ſeem to acquire additional liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by ſucceeding to the deformity of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by flouriſhing amidſt the freſheſt verdure.</p>

They ſee the great <hi>Ruler</hi> of the <hi>day,</hi> or rather the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy from day's eternal SOVEREIGN, making his entry amidſt the ſpaces of the ſky. The heavens are ſtrewed with colours which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie the pinks and carnations. The graſs is decked with dew drops, and every plant is ſtrung, as it were, with pearls. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the darkneſs retires, and ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſreſhing gales ariſe. At length the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent luminary appears. And what is all the oſtentatious pomp of kings? what is all the glitter of the moſt brilliant courts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with his tranſcendent luſtre?—This ſpectacle we may behold, without loſs of time, or prejudice to health. Nay, we cannot behold it, without <hi>improving</hi> one and <hi>redeeming</hi> the other. So beneficial are even the pleaſures which nature yields! ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable the diverſions to which ſhe invites!</p>
               <p>Talking in this manner, they arrive at the <hi>Park.</hi> Which, the moment you enter, fills
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030558_0101_0FE7CB7C6725E960"/>the view with its bold, enlarged, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ſweep.—It was diverſified with level and riſing ground. Here, ſcooped into mimic Amphitheatres; with the <hi>Deer</hi> pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the little ſummit, or ſhooting down the precipice. There, raiſed into gentle hillocks; ſome of which were canopied with a large, ſolitary oak; others were tuft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a cluſter of tapering and verdent elms. Two or three <hi>Caſcades,</hi> gleaming from afar, as they poured along the ſlanting rock, or the graſſy ſlope, gave a pleaſing variation to the proſpect.

               <p>In the centre of all, roſe a curious <hi>roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic mount.</hi>—Its form was exactly round, ſomewhat like a ſugar-loaf whoſe cone is lopt off a little below the top—Not coeval with nature, but the work of human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Thrown up, 'tis ſuppoſed, in thoſe perilous times, when Britain was alarmed by foreign invaſions, or bled with inteſtine wounds.—It was covered all around with elder ſhrubs, whoſe ranks, gradually riſing and ſpreading ſhade above ſhade, compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a kind of woody theatre, through which were ſtruck two or three <hi>ſpiral walks,</hi> lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               </p>
               <p>How agreeable as they climb and wind themſelves round the hill, to reflect on the <hi>happy change,</hi> which has now taken place! Where ſteely helmets gleamed, or brazen ſhields claſhed, the <hi>Goldfinches</hi> twitter their loves, and diſplay their painted plumes. The dens of rapine, or the horrid haunts of bloodſhed, are become the retreats of calm contemplation, and friendly converſe.—In yonder lower ſpaces, where the armed troops were wont to patrole; from whence they made excurſions to ravage the villages, or terrify the ſwains; the <hi>Fallow-Deers</hi> trip lightly, or the full-headed Stags ſtand at bay.</p>
               <p>From a ſmall eminence, but at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030558_0103_0FE7CB83E1338300"/>diſtance, guſhed a couple of ſprings, which, rambling through a grove, loſt one another in the ſhady labyrinth. Emerging at length from the gloom, they approached nearer and neater, and ſell into embraces at the foot of this hill. They rolled in amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjunction along the pebbly channel, which incircles its baſis, and added their <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber melody</hi> to the <hi>ſprightly warbling</hi> of the birds. Flowing off in one common ſtream, they formed the fine pieces of water which beautified the Park. From thence, they ſtole into the meadow, and widened into a <hi>River</hi>: there, enamoured as it were with each other, they glide by wealthy towns, and ſweep through flowery vales, regardleſs of the blooming toys which deck the one, and of the noiſy crowds which throng the other.</p>
               <p>So ſaid <hi>Aſpaſio,</hi> may Theron and his Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma pleaſing and pleaſed with each other, paſs through the buſy and the amuſing ſcenes of life: neither captivated by the one, nor anxious for the other.

A ſuperior order of <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunculuſes,</hi> each reſmebling the cap of an earl's coronet, repleniſhed the third ſtory, with full-blown tufts of gloſſy ſcarlet.—Beyond this, a more elevated line of <hi>tulips</hi> raiſed their flouriſhed heads, and opened their enameled cups; not bedecked with a ſingle tint only, but glowing with an intermingled variety of radiant hues.

               <p>The whole, viewed from the arbour, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a <hi>rainbow</hi> painted upon the ground, and wanted nothing to rival that reſplendent arch, only the boldneſs of its ſweep, and the advantage of its ornamental curve.</p>

               <p>THERON and Aſpaſio enter a ſpacious <hi>lawn,</hi> which lay oppoſite to the houſe, and opened itſelf in the form of an expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fan. The mounds, on either ſide, were dreſſed in verdure, and ran out in a ſtanting direction. The whole, to an eye placed at a diſtance, bore the reſemblance of a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent <hi>viſta,</hi> contracting, by ſlow degrees, its dimenſions, and leſſening, at laſt, into a point, which the regular and graceful ſeat, with all imaginable dignity, ſupplied.</p>
               <p>Nature had ſunk the lawn into a gentle <hi>decline,</hi> on whoſe ample ſides were oxen brov, zing, and lambs friſking. The luſty droves lowed as they paſſed, and the thriving flocks bleated welcome muſic in their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's ear. Along the midſt of this verdant ſlope was ſtretched a ſpacious and extenſive <hi>walk</hi>; which, coated with gravel, and fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with palliſadoes, looked like a plain ſtripe of brown, interſecting a carpet of the brighteſt green.

               <p>Correſponding, and on the margin of the other canal, was erected a <hi>ſummer-bouſe,</hi> of a vey ſingular kind.—The lower part had an opening towards the north; it was cool, it was gloomy, and had never ſeen the ſun.

A ſcanty iron grate, with certain narrow ſlits in the wall, tranſmit a glimmering light, juſt ſufficient to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the inner ſtructure, which appears like one continued piece of rock-work, a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern cut from the ſurrounding quarry.—<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> hung an irregular arch with an aſpect that ſeemed to preſage the fall, and more than ſeemed to alarm the ſtranger. <hi>Below</hi> lay a paving of homely pebbles, in ſome places a little furrowed, as though it had

The redundant waters of the canal rolled off in a ſpreading <hi>caſcade</hi>; which, tumbling from many a little precipice, ſoothed the air with a ſymphony of ſoft and gurgling ſounds; for ever intermitted the obliging office.</p>

               <p>The ſun was fiercely bright, and the ſky without a cloud.

The avenue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a ſerpentine walk, which, after having preſented you with ſeveral ſpecies of plants, and ſeveral degrees of verdure, ends in a large circular area; not covered with a Grecian or Roman temple, unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imitation of Pagan idolatry, but ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with aged and princely oaks, the coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whoſe branches, threw over the graſſy plot a majeſtic rural dome, and their unpierced foliage "imbrowned the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide hours."</p>
               <p>In the midſt, and elevated on a ſquare baſe, was a ſtatue repreſenting the venerable Elijah, in a poſture of worſhip, with his hands ſtretched out, and eyes liſted up to Heaven. His attitude, his air, his every ſeature, were a moſt lively comment on thoſe ſtrong, energetic expreſſions of ſcripture; "take hold on GOD; wreſtle with the AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY; pour out your hearts before HIM."—On one ſide of the pedeſtal were engraven the prieſts of Baal, in frantic

               <p>A remote caſcade tumbled from a crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy rock. The very ſtream, like its maſter ſeemed in haſte to eſcape from the intenſe and raging heat.

As ſome <hi>heedleſs</hi> trifler who bolts unawares into the royal preſence, ſtands ſtruck with reverence and awe, or retires with precipitance and confuſion.</p>

At noon the rain ceaſed, but the heavens ſtill continued gloomy.—Towards evening a gentle eaſtern gale ſprung up, which diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dead calm, and cleared the face of the ſky.—The ſun, which had been muffled in clouds, dropped the veil. Diſengaged from the duſky ſhroud, he ſhone forth with <hi>ſuperior ſplendor.</hi> His beams, endeared by their late ſuſpenſion, were doubly welcome, and produced unuſual gaiety.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030558_0115_0FE7CBAFC6A2B718"/>walked abroad. They walked alternately on the terraces, one of which was oppoſite to the country, the other contiguous to the parterre, where the gales, impregnated with the freſheſt exhalations of nature, breathed the ſmells of meads, and fields, and groves; or elſe, ſhaking the cluſters of roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſweeping the beds of fragrance, they flung balm and odours through the air.</p>
               <p>At a diſtance were heard the bleatings of the flock, mingled with the lowings of the milky mothers, while more melodious muſic warbled from the neighbouring boughs, &amp; ſpoke aloud the joy of their feathered inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; and not only ſpoke their joy, but ſpread an <hi>additional</hi> charm over all the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.

               <head>A DESCRIPTION OF CAMILLUS'S GARDENS, AND THE BEAUTIFUL PROSPECT FROM HIS SUMMER-HOUSE.</head>
               <p>THERON and Aſpaſio walked ſeveral times along a cloſe ſhady alley, arched with the foliage of <hi>filberts.</hi> Here, hid from every eye, and the whole world withdrawn from our view, we ſeemed like <hi>monks</hi> ſtroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their cloiſters.—Turning ſhort at the and, we enter a parallel range of majeſtic and uniformly ſpreading <hi>walnut-trees.</hi> This tranſition was ſomewhat like advancing through a low porch into the aiſles of a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent cathedral. The broad leaf and large trunk of thoſe lordly trees, their very diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpread, added to their prodigious height, give them an air of uncommon dignity. It
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030558_0122_0FE7CBCB843DD0C0"/>ſwells the imagination with vaſt ideas, and entertains us with a romantic kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to expatiate amidſt ſuch huge columns, and under ſuch ſuperb elevations of living architecture.</p>
               <p>Quitting our cathedral, we turn once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again, and paſs into a grand colonade of <hi>oaks</hi>; ſo regular in their ſituation, ſo ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in their ſize, and ſo remarkably correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent in every circumſtance, that they looked like the <hi>twins</hi> of nature, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſame family, but produced at the ſame birth.—Through theſe lay a walk, ſtraight, ſpacious, and gracefully long; far exceeding the laſt in the extent of its area, though much inferior in the ſtatelineſs of its ceiling. It put me in mind of that divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, which has allowed us the ſpace of <hi>ſix</hi> days for the proſecution of our own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively low affairs, and ſet apart but <hi>one</hi> in ſeven for the more immediate attendance on the ſublime duty of worſhipping our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</p>
               <p>This walk was covered with the neateſt <hi>gravel,</hi> and not a weed to be ſeen, nor one blade of graſs, through the whole extended ſurface. It ſtole into a continual aſcent; yet ſo very gradually, that the riſe was ſcarce diſcernable, either by the ſearching eye, the toiling feet, or the panting breath.—At
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030558_0123_0FE7CBCD19CE1FF8"/>the extremity, a handſome <hi>ſummer-houſe</hi> ſhewed a flight of ſteps, and half a <hi>Venetian</hi> door. The reſt of the building was hid by the low hung cluſtering branches.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as we enter the apartment, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus throws open the left hand ſaſh, and with it a moſt enlarged and amuſive <hi>proſpect.</hi> —The ſtructure appeared ſituate on the brow of a conſiderable eminence, whoſe ſides were partly confuſed and wild with broken rocks, partly ſhagged and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thorny ſhrubs.

               <p>Through the midſt of this extenſive vale, which was decked with the fineſt verdure, and repleniſhed with the richeſt herbage, a <hi>river</hi> rolled its copious flood; rolled, in a thouſand ſerpentine <hi>meanders,</hi> as though it was loth to leave the flowry ſcene, and made repeated efforts to prolong its ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſuch lovely objects.—Till, at laſt, having loitered in its own labyrinths, and wandered more than twice the length of the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030558_0124_0FE7CBD24BEA00C8"/>meadows, having held a mirror to the aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring poplars and bending willows, having paid a welcome ſalute to ſeveral ornamental <hi>villas,</hi> and paſſed through the arches of two or three curiouſly pendent bridges; it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet the ſky, and mingle with the horizon.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite to the front window, a <hi>caſcade</hi> fell from the adjacent ſtream. It flaſhed and foamed along the broad ſlope, indented with ſmall pits, and jagged with protuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſtones. The current, vexed and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, ſeemed to <hi>rave</hi> at the intervening ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, and forcing its rapid, indignant, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norous way, ſtruck the ear with a peal of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid thunder. Theſe fretful waters, let our <hi>angry</hi> paſſions obſerve the admonition, and follow the example, ſoon forgot their rage, ſoon recovered their temper: collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little rivulet, they ran off in calm and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lapſe, till they loſt themſelves amongſt beds of oſier, and plantations of alder.</p>
               <p>The river, widening as it flowed, was parted here and there by ſeveral little iſlands. Scattered as it were, by the hand of chance, and raiſing their green heads in the midſt of the lucid ſtream, they preſented a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, and moſt pleaſing ſpectacle. Some were tuſted with reeds, and ſurrounded with rocks and ſhoals, the unmoleſted reſort of

One, larger than the reſt, ſeemed to be furniſhed with cool em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowering walks, fitted for ſtudious retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſedate contemplation.—On either ſide of the charming valley, towns and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages lay thick, and looked gay, adding or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and variety to the ſcene, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innumerable advantages from the paſſing wave.</p>

               <p>THE laſt evening was one of the fineſt I ever ſaw. According to cuſtom I made an excurſion into the open fields, and wanted nothing to complete the ſatisfaction, but my friend's company. I could not but obſerve how much your improving conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation heightened the charms of nature. When religion applied <hi>philoſophy,</hi> every thing was <hi>inſtructive,</hi> as well as <hi>pleaſing.</hi>—Not a breeze ſwept over the plains to clear the ſky, and cool the air; but it tended alſo to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030558_0127_0FE7CBDBC1071790"/>diſperſe our doubts, and enliven our faith in the Supreme All-ſufficient <hi>Good.</hi>—Not a cloud tinged the firmament with radiant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or amuſed the ſight with romantic ſhapes, but we beheld a picture of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world. Its <hi>fading</hi> acquiſitions and <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic</hi> joys were pourtrayed in the mimic forms and tranſitory ſcene.—Even the weakeſt of the inſect tribe, that ſkim the air in ſportive ſilence, addreſſed us with the ſtrongeſt incitements, and gave us the loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt calls to be <hi>active</hi> in our day, and <hi>uſeful</hi> in our generation.

               <p>How often, at the approach of ſober eve, have we ſauntered through the duſky glade, obſerving the laſt remains of light, now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpling the weſtern clouds, now faintly gleaming on the mountain's brow, now creeping inſenſibly from all the ſhady land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape. —How often have we ſtole along the cloyſters of ſome leafy bower, attentive to the tale of a <hi>querulcus</hi> current, that ſeemed to be ſtruck with horror at the awful gloom, and complained with heavier murmurs as it paſſed under the blackening ſhades, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the root-obſtructed channel.—Or elſe,

Impatient, as it were, to get free from ſuch rugged paths, and mingle itſelf with the adjacent mead.—There, ſlackening its headlong carcor, and ſoothing its eddies into a glaſſy ſurface, and a gentle flow.

               <head>AN INTERESTING DESCRIPTION OF A GOOD MAN IN THE VIEWS OF DEATH.</head>
               <p>THE ſufferer, all patient and adoring, ſubmits to the divine will; and, by ſubmiſſion, becomes ſuperior to his affliction. He is ſenſibly touched with the diſconſolate ſtate of his attendants; and pierced with an anxious concern for his wife and his children. His wiſe who will ſoon be a deſtitute widow; his children, who will ſoon be helpleſs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans. <q>Yet, though caſt down, not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</q> He is greatly refreſhed, by his truſt in the everlaſting covenant, and his hope of approaching glory. Religion gives
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030558_0136_0FE7CBFE597F9680"/>a dignity to diſtreſs. At each interval of eaſe, he comforts his very comforters, and ſuffers with all the majeſty of woe.</p>
               <p>The ſoul, juſt going to abandon the tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering clay, collects all her force, and exerts her laſt efforts. The good man raiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his pillow; extends a kind hand to his ſervants, which is bathed in tears; takes an affecting farewell of his friends; claſps his wife in a feeble embrace; kiſſes the dear pledges of their mutual love; and then pours out all that remains of life and of ſtrength, in the following words;— <q>I die my dear children: but GOD, the everlaſting GOD, will be with you.—Though you loſe an <hi>earthly</hi> parent, you have a Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven who lives for evermore.—Nothing, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> but an unbelieving heart, and irreligi ous life, can ever ſeparate you from the regards of his providence—from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments of his love.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He could proceed no farther. His heart was full; but utterance failed.—After a ſhort pauſe, with difficulty, great difficulty, he added;— <q>You the dear partner of my ſoul, you are now the only protector of our orphans.—I leave you under a weight of cares.—But GOD, who defendeth the cauſe of the widow—GOD, whoſe promiſe is faithfulneſs and truth—God hath ſaid <hi>I
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030558_0137_0FE7CC009B1A5AC0"/>will never leave thee, nor forſake thee</hi>—This revives my drooping ſpirits—Let this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the wife of my boſom—And now, O Father of compaſſions, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit—encouraged by thy promiſed goodneſs, <hi>I leavemy fatherleſs.</hi>

More than once he eſſayed; but the organs of his ſpeech were become like a broken veſſel, and nothing but the obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phlegm rattled in his throat. His aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, however, ſpoke aſfection inexpreſſible. With all the ſather, all the huſband ſtill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his looks; he takes one more view of thoſe dear children, whom he had ſo often beheld with a parental triumph. He turns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his dying eyes on that beloved woman, whom he never beheld but with a glow of delight.

Dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the robe of innocency, ſhe ſteps forth, fearleſs of danger, long before the trees have ventured to unfold their leaves, even while the iciles are pendent on our houſes. Next peeps out the crocus, but cautiouſly, and with an air of timidity. She hears the howling blaſts, and ſkulks cloſe to her low ſituation. Afraid ſhe ſeems, to make large excurſions from her root, while ſo many ruffian winds are abroad, and ſcouring along the aether.—Nor is the violet laſt in this ſhining embaſſy of the year. Which, with all the embelliſhments that would grace a royal garden, condeſcends to line our hedges and grow at the feet of briars. Freely, and without any ſolicitation, ſhe diſtributes the bounty of her emiſſive ſweets; while herſelf, with an exemplary humility, retires from ſight, ſeeking rather to adminiſter pleaſure, than to win admiration.

               <p>The poor polyanthus, that lately adorned the border with their ſparkling beauties, and tranſplanted into our windows, gave us a freſh entertainment, is now more; I ſaw her complexion fade; I perceived her breath decay; till at length ſhe expired, and dropt into her grave.—Scarce have we ſuſtained this loſs, but in comes the auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, and more than retrieves it. Arrayed ſhe comes, in a ſplendid variety of amiable forms, with an eye of chryſtal, and garments of the moſt gloſſy ſattin, exhaling perfume, and powdered with ſilver. Scarce one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them but is dignified with the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of renown, or has the honour to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſome celebrated toaſt. But theſe alſo, notwithſtanding their illuſtrious titles, have exhauſted their whole ſtock of fragrance, and are mingled with the meaneſt duſt.— Who could forbear grieving at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did not the tulips begin to raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on their fine wands, or ſtately ſtalks? they ſluſh the paterre with one of the gayeſt
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030558_0153_0FE7CC40A7FF6910"/>dreſſes that blooming nature wears. Here one may behold the innocent wantonneſs of beauty. Here ſhe indulges a thouſand freaks, and ſports herſelf in the moſt charming di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of colours. Yet I ſhould wrong her, were I to call her a coquette; becauſe ſhe plays her lovely changes, not to enkindle diſſolute affections, but to diſplay her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's glory.—Soon ariſes the anemone, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled at the bottom with a ſpreading robe, and rounded at the top into a beautiful dome, In its looſely flowing mantle you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a noble negligence; in its gently bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tufts, the niceſt ſymmetry. I would term it the fine gentleman of the garden; becauſe it ſeems to have learnt the ſingular addreſs of uniting ſimplicity with refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of reconciling art and eaſe.—The ſame month has the merit of producing the renunculus. All bold and graceful it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands the riches of its foliage, and acquires by degrees, the lovelieſt enamel in the world. Methinks nature improves in her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Her lateſt ſtrokes are moſt maſterly.

May we not alſo regard them as the great watering-pots of the globe? which, wafted on the wings of the wind, diſpenſe their moiſture evenly through the univerſal garden; and fructify, with their ſhowers, whatever our hand plants.—The fields are our exhauſtleſs gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. —The ocean is our vaſt reſervoir.—

On either ſide, the boughs, rounded into a ſet of regular arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, opened a view into the diſtant fields, and preſented me with a proſpect of the bending ſkies. The little birds, all joyous and grateful for the favours of the light, were paying their acknowledgments in a tribute of harmony, and ſoothing themſelves to reſt with ſongs.

               <p>THE generality of our modern roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, novels and theatrical entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are commonly calculated to inflame a wanton fancy. Or, if conducted with ſo much modeſty, as not to debauch the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; they pervert the judgment, and bewilder the taſte.

               <p>WELCOME, thrice welcome, this auſpicious gift of Providence, to enliven the nocturnal gloom, and line with ſilver the raven-coloured mantle of night! How deſirable to have our ſummer evenings illuminated! that we may be able to tread the dewy meads, and breathe the delicious fragrance of our gardens; eſpecially when the ſultry heats render it irkſome and fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, to walk a broad by day.—How cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſhepherd, the uſe of this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal lantern; as he tends his fleecy charge, or late conſigns them to their hurdled cots! How comfortable and how advantageous to the mariner, as he ploughs the midnight main, to adjuſt the tackling, to explore his way, and, under the influence of this beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſconce, to avoid the fatal rock! This ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial attendant is moſt <hi>exactly punctual,</hi> at all the ſtated periods of her miniſtration. If we chooſe to prolong our journey, after the ſun is gone down, the moon, during her whole increaſe, is always ready to act in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a guide. If we are inclined to ſet out very early in the morning; the moon in her decreaſe prevents the dawn, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to offer her aſſiſtance.

               <p>IT has long been a prevailing report, that, among perſons of education and diſtinction, true religon is very rare. This, I would hope, is an invidious rumour, rather than a true repreſentation of the caſe. May it not be an attifice of the grand enemy? calculated to bring the beſt and nobleſt of cauſes into diſrepute: as though politeneſs and piety were inconſiſtent: as though grace and good-breeding were irreconcileable.— Is then the faith of Chriſt quite fatal to refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

No; it is rather like the influence of the ſanctuary on the rod of Aaron: which, while it remained at a diſtance from the tabernacle, was a dry, ſapleſs and barren ſtick; but, when depoſited before the ark, was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened into vegetable light, was adorned with a milk-white bloom, and enriched with full grown fruit; or as the ſacred hiſtorian expreſſes this ſurpriſing fact, "It brought forth buds, and bloomed bloſſoms, and yielded almonds." <hi>Numb.</hi> xxii. 6.</p>

                  <pb n="207" facs="unknown:030558_0204_0FE7CCF20248BF50"/>
I myſelf have known various perſons, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for their accompliſhed behaviour, and revered for their exalted ſtation, who have thought it their higheſt honour to be ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. My excellent friend Camillus, at whoſe houſe I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, is one of the number. I cannot refrain from giving a portrait of Camillus; or rather of a few of his moſt diſtinguiſhing features: for, to paint him in full proportion, as he daily appears, in all the mild, the benign majeſty of domeſtic authority, parental go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Chriſtian zeal—To do this, would require a much abler hand than mine.</p>
               <p>Camillus, not long ago, entertained in his houſe a young clergyman, who was always treated with a reſpect ſuitable to the dignity of his office, and the piety of his behaviour. I having larely preſented the worthy eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic to a living, and always requiring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence on the benefice, he is now deſtitute of a chaplain. Remembering, however, that all Chriſtians are ſpiritual prieſts; he thinks it no diſhonour to have an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and perſonal audience with the King of Heaven; not acting at all out of character to repeſent the wants of his houſhold, with his own mouth, at the throne of grace.</p>
               <p>Before ſupper is introduced, the evening
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030558_0205_0FE7CCF7B7914BC8"/>incenſe aſcends. This rather than a later hour, is pitched upon, that the little congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation may join in the ſacred ſervice, with a lively devotion. After a plentiful meal, when the limbs are weary, people, even though kneeling, and in the preſence of God, are more inclined to nod, than to pour out their ſouls; are very apt to miſtake the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion for a pillow.—No ſervant is allowed to be abſent, one only excepted, whoſe preſence in the kitchen is abſolutely neceſſary. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their maſter's reſolution, they are careful, ſo to manage their affairs, and diſpatch their buſineſs, that no unavoidable obſtacle may intervene to detain them from the ſtated worſhip.</p>
               <p>When all are aſſembled, without either tumultuous diſorder in their approach, or a ſlovenly negligence in their apparel, a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is read. Camillus makes the choice.— He imagines it not ſo uſeful for his family, whoſe momories are weak, and their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſcanty, to read the leſſon for the day.— He has, therefore, ſelected ſome of the moſt inſtructive and animating portions of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and judges it adviſeable to peruſe theſe again and again, rather than to go regularly through the whole inſpired writings.—The ſervants take it by turns to read, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them in the practice, and keeps them awake. If any of them diſcovers a diſpoſi|
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030558_0206_0FE7CCF947CA9548"/>of ſleep, to him the office is ſure to be aſſigned.</p>
               <p>When the chapter is finiſhed, Camillus ſingles out ſome one verſe, of very weighty and edifying import, which, for the ſpace of five or ſix minutes, he explains, applies, and affectionately urges upon their conſciences. This done, with great ſeriouſneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence, he offers up evening pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. His prayers conſiſts of ſhort ſentences, and the whole is performed in a little time. Every part is pronounced with that deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſlowneſs and ſolemn accent, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand attention and create awe. He makes a very perceivable pauſe at the cloſe of each petition that every one may have leiſure to add, in ſilence, a hearty amen; and to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the merits of that bleſſed Redeemer, which render every thankſgiving acceptable, and every ſupplication ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>In the morning, before breakfaſt, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the living God is renewed. At this juncture Camillus omits the chapter, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires one of his domeſtics to repeat the verſe on which he enlarged the proceeding night. None knows which ſhall be called to this taſk, therefore every one is obilged to be properly prepared. He throws the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his exhortation into a few ſcaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intereſting queſtions, which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030558_0207_0FE7CCFEF6201440"/>to one of his children or ſervants— for, in this preſpect, no difference is made.— All are equally enjoined to remember. Some times he encourages thoſe whoſe anſwers ſhew that they have given diligent heed to his inſtructions. Sometimes he puts on an air of ſeverity, mixed with tenderneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the notoricuſly negligent. Always he re-inculcates the principal points, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to retain the doctrines in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and revolve them in their thoughts, while they are purſuing their reſpective buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs —Theſe doctrines are the ſeed of faith, the root of godlineſs. Unleſs theſe be lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the mind, and operate on the heart, he never expects to have his domeſtics com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence true believers, or real Chriſtians. No more than the huſbandman can reaſonably expect a crop in harveſt without ſowing his field, or the floriſt promiſe himſelf a blow of tulips, without planting his parterre.</p>
               <p>I have given a glimpſe of Camillus at the head of his family; let me now ſhew my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite in another attitude.—Camillus is convinced that no truſt is of ſuperior or of equal importance to the tuitionary cultivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an immortal ſoul. As providence has bleſſed him with two fine daughters, their preſent and future happineſs is the reigning object of his care. He has no intereſt ſo much at heart as to give them a truly refined education, ſuch as may render them an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030558_0208_0FE7CD008C4CCDC0"/>and a bleſſiing to ſociety, while they paſs the time of thier ſojourning here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and may train them up for a ſtate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting bliſs, when the world and its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory ſcenes ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>Camillus never could perſuade himſelf to admire the maxims of prudence ſaid to be gathered from the extravagant rant of our tragedies; and leſs is his eſteem for thoſe modeſt diſpoſitions, which people pretend to imbibe from the lucious gallantries of comedy; for which reaſon he has no impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent deſire to ſecure for Miſs Metiſſa and Miſs Serena a place in the front box.—Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as we are apt immoderately to covet what is abſolutely forbidden, he has himſelf attended them, once or twice, to the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical entertainments and public diverſions; thinking it much the ſafeſt method, that their curioſity ſhould be gratified under his own inſpection and hoping to make them ſenſible how much they endanger their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, who too often frequent them; how ſhamefully they debaſe their affections, who are paſſionately fond of them; and what mere phantoms they follow, who ſeek for ſatisfaction in ſuch deluſory delights.</p>
               <p>They learn to dance, in order to require a genteel air, and a graceful demeanor; not to ſhine at a ball, or win the worthleſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030558_0209_0FE7CD0520B11078"/>of fops.—He is content to have them unacquainted with the wild and roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fables of heathen poetry. Nor is under any painful apprehenſions of damping the ſprightlineſs of their temper, though they have no taſte for the chimerical adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of our romances, and are ſtrangers to the looſe intrigues of our novels; being fully perſuaded, that there is as much ſound ſenſe as ſmartneſs of thought in that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated ſaying,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Retire, and read your bible to be gay:</l>

               </q>
               <p>He has introduced them to the knowledge of hiſtory, and its inſtructive facts. They have atolerable idea of the four univerſal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, ſo eminent for their great evenst, and ſo circumſtantially foretold in ſcripture. They have been led through the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable tranſactions of our own country, and are pretty well acquainted with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Europe. They have all along been taught to obſerve the wonderful revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of empires, and the adorable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of Providence; that they may diſcern how <hi>the faſhion of this world paſſeth away; and</hi> and how <hi>happy are the people,</hi> how happy are the perſons <hi>who have the</hi> LORD for their GOD. They have been taught to obſerve the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable ſucceſs that has uſually attended the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030558_0210_0FE7CD07DA9EAAB0"/>practice of integrity, guided by prudence; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſcandal and ruin which have always purſued folly in her ſenſeleſs ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and dogged vice to her horrid haunts. That they may ſee the rocks on which ſome have ſplit, and avoid the deſtructive tract; ſee the road which has conducted others to the haven of happineſs, and ſteer the ſame auſpicious courſe.</p>
               <p>They have been initiated in geography, and underſtand the ſeveral diviſions of the globe; the extent of its principal kingdoms, and the manners of their various inhabitants. They will tell you the peculiar commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which each climate produces; whence comes the tea that furniſhes their breakfaſt, and whence the ſugar that renders it pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: what mountains ſupply them with wines, and what iſlands ſend them their ſpices; in what groves the ſilk-worms ſpin the materials for their cloaths, and what mines ſupply them with the dimonds that ſparkle in their earrings.—A ſcreen covered with a ſet of coloured maps, and a cuſtom of referring from the public papers to thoſe beautiful draughts, has rendered the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this knowledge a diverſion rather than a taſk, has enticed them into a valuable branch of ſcience, under the inviting diſguiſe of amuſement. This ſerves to enlarge their apprehenſion of things, gives them magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030558_0211_0FE7A772CA1E6C70"/>cent thoughts of the great Greater, and may help to ſuppreſs that ſilly ſelf-admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They ſpell to perfection, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this art by a ſort of play, rather than by laborious application. Whenever they aſked any little gratification, it has been their papa's cuſtom to make them ſpell the word, which if they performed aright, they ſeldom ſailed to ſucceed in their requeſt.— They are miſtreſſes of the needle; and the youngeſt, whoſe genius inclines that way, is expert in uſing the pencil. Muſic is their recreation, not their buſineſs. The eldeſt to a ſkilful finger, adds a melodious and well regulated voice. She often entertains me with ſinging an anthem to her harpſichord. Entertains did I ſay?—ſhe really ediſies me. Theſe truly excellent performances exalt the deſires, and compoſe the affections; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire 02 ſuch a ſerenity of delight, as leaves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſting on the conſcience, nor a ſtain on the imagination. Methinks they bring us a little antepaſt of heaven, and tune curſouls for its harmonious joys.</p>
               <p>Thoroughly verſed in the moſt practical parts of arithmetic, they have each her week, wherein to be intruſted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Of this they keep an exact account, and make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular entry of each particular in their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book.— Not long ago a tenant of inferior rank came to Camillus with his rent: inſtead of receiving it himſelf, he referred him to Miſs Serena. You would have been delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obſerve the behaviour of our little land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady on this occaſion; the engaging conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion with which ſhe addreſſed the honeſt ruſtic; the tender good-nature with which ſhe enquired after his dame and the family at home; the ready dexterity with which ſhe wrote and ſubſcribed a proper receipt; and, above all, her amiable generoſity in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half a crown to buy a copy-book for his eldeſt ſon, who he ſaid, "was juſt going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to joining hand, but the feared would never come to ſpell or write half ſo well as her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip."</p>
               <p>Though Camillus is careful to ground them betimes in the rules of oeconomy, he is equally careful to cultivate a ſpirit of diſcreet beneficence. A few days ago, when my friend and his lady were abroad, Miſs Metiſſa was informed of a poor woman in the pariſh, juſt brought to bed, after a long and hard labour; who, being unhappily married to a ſot of a fellow, was, at a time when the choiceſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030558_0213_0FE7CD1485777D88"/>were ſcarcely ſufficient, deſtitute of the meaneſt conveniences. Upon hearing the calamitous caſe, ſhe immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a ſervant with a crown from her weekly ſtock; part to buy for the afflicted creature ſome preſent accomodations, and part to defray the expences at ſuch a juncture unavoidable; but gave a ſtrict charge, that the whole ſhould be employed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the diſtreſſed mother and her helpleſs infant, none of it fingered or enjoyed by the worthleſs drone her huſband. When Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus returned, he was ſo pleaſed with this ſeaſonable and well judged charity, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his commendation and careſſes, he far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rewarded our conſiderate and matron like benefactreſs, by making her a preſent of Clariſſa; for he always contrives to make what tends to their improvement, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their reward. If they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a fault, they are forbid the priveledge of uſing their maps. If they have behaved in a becoming manner, their recompence is, not a peice of money, or a paper of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, but ſome new inſtruction on the globe, ſome new leſſon on the harpſichord, which may at once delight and improve them.</p>
               <p>To prevent a haughty carriage, and to worm out all inordinate ſelf-love, he teaches them to conſider their neighbours as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame univerſal family, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:030558_0214_0FE7CD16DB47EAD0"/>of the ſame Almighty Father. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever poor in their circumſtances, or mean in their aſpect, they are the objects of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiciely tender regards.—Of that God, who has given his own Son to ſuffer death for their pardon, and has prepared a heaven of endleſs bliſs for their final reception; for which reaſon they ſhould deſpiſe none, but honour all; ſhould be as ready to do them good, as the hand is ready to ſooth the eye when if ſmarts, or eaſe the head when it aches. One afternoon, when he was going to treat them with an orange, he bid each of them bring a fine toy, lately received for a preſent. It was made in the ſhape of a knife, the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of ivory and inlaid with the gayeſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; the blade of glaſs moſt dazzlingly bright, but without an edge. "Cut the orange in two," ſaid their papa. When they both tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their pretty knives, and, to their no ſmall mortification, both failed. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with another of more ordinary appearance, but tolerably ſharp. With this they eaſily pierced the rhind, and came at the delicious juice. "Who now," ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus, "would not prefer one ſuch ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though plainutenſil, toa hundred of thoſe glittering but worthleſs trifles? and you, my dear children, if you have no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations than a ſhewy perſon, and the trappings of dreſs, you will be as contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in your generation as that inſignificant

               <p>With equal watchfulneſs he diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances all thoſe acts of petulant barbarity, which children are ſo apt to exerciſe on the reptile creation. He will allow no court of inquiſition to be erected within his houſe; no, not upon the moſt deſpicable, or even the noxious animals. The very nuiſances that are endued with life, he thinks ſhould be diſpatched, not with a lingering butchery but with a merciful expedition. To rend in pieces a poor fly, and feaſt their eyes with the mangled limbs, ſhivering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed in the pangs of death; to impale a wretched infect on the needle or bodkin; and, what is ſtill more ſhocking, to take pleaſure in hearing its paſſionate moan, and ſeeing its agonizing ſtruggles: ſuch practices he abſolutely forbids, as inſufferable viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature's law. Such as tend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the ſoft emotions of pity, and inure the mind to a habit of inhumanity.—He often informs his lovely pupils, that every living creature is ſenſible of pain; that none can be abuſed in this cruel manner, without ſuffering very exquiſite mitery. To turn their torments into paſtime, and make ſport
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030558_0216_0FE7CD1E55D4A750"/>with their anguiſh, is a rigour more than tyrannical, worſe than brutal; is the very reverſe of that benign Providence, whoſe <hi>tender mercies are over</hi> ALL <hi>his works.</hi>

               <p>He propoſes to give them a taſte of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural philoſophy, and to accomodate them with the beſt microſcopes; that the uſe of <hi>theſe</hi> inſtruments, and a ſpice of <hi>that</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, may inſpire them with an early ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of nature's works, and with the deepeſt veneration of nature's almighty Author. Camillus has no deſign to fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh a couple of ſemale philoſophers, or to divert their attention from thoſe domeſtic arts, which are the trueſt accompliſhments of the ſex; yet neither would he have his daughters debarred from that rational and exalted delight, which is to be found in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the curioſities of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's cabinet. Why may they not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing from their <hi>own,</hi> or encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>maſculine</hi> character, why may they not be acquainted with the accurately nice ſtructure of an animal; or with the proceſs and effects of vegetation? why may they not learn the admirable operations of the air, or the wonderfnl properties of the water? have ſome general notion of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe magnitudes, the prodigious diſtances, and the ſtill more amazing revolutions of the heavenly orbs? he apprehends it very

The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of birds, and the murmur of ſountains; the humming inſect, and the ſighing gale, will be a higher gratiſication then the fineſt airs of an opera. A field covered with corn or a meadow beſprinkled with daiſies; a marſh planted with oſiers, or a mountain ſhaded with oaks, will yield a far more agrecable proſpect than the moſt pompous ſcenes that decorate the ſtage.

               <p>Above all, Camillus is moſt earneſtly deſirous to have his tender charge ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the principles, and actuated with the ſpirit of Chriſtianity. No ſcheme, he is thoroughly perſuaded, was ever ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calculated to ſweeten their tempers, to exalt their affections, and form them to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, either in this world, or another. It is therefore his daily endeavour, by the moſt eaſy and endearing methods of inſtruction, to fill their minds with the knowledge of thoſe heavenly doctrines, and win their hearts to the love of that invaluable book in which they are delineated.—He longs to have a ſenſe of God Almighty's goodneſs impreſſed on their ſouls, From this ſource, under the influences of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nothing is more diſpleaſing to Camillus than the fond flatteries which their injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous admirers beſtow on their ſhape and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, the gracefulneſs of their carriage, and the vivacity of their wit. He would fain make them ſenſible that theſe embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments are of the loweſt value, and moſt fading nature;—that, if they render their poſſeſſors vain and ſelf-conceited, they are far greater blemiſhes than a hump on the back, a wen in the neck, or ſtuttering in the ſpeech.—He would have them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced, that, notwithſtanding all their ſilks, diamonds, and other marks of their ſuperior circumſtances, they are ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, guilty, impotent creatures; blind to truths of the laſt importance; deſerving the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030558_0221_0FE7CD31CEC5C0E8"/>vengcance of etetnal fire, and unable of themſelves to think a good thought. That, from ſuch conviction, they may perceive their abſolute need of a Saviour: a Saviour in all his offices—as a prophet, to teach them heavenly wiſdom—as a prieſt, to atone for all their many, many ſins—as a king, to ſubdue their iniquities, write his laws in their hearts, and make them, in all their converſation, holy.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the point he chiefly labours, is to work in their hearts a deep, an abiding ſenſe, that God is their ſupreme, their only good; that the bleſſed Jeſus is the rock of their hopes, and the fountain of their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that all their dependence for acquiring the beauties of holineſs, and taſting the joys of the ſublimeſt virtue, is to be placed on the Holy Ghoſt the comforter.—Amidſt all theſe efforts of his own, he never fails to to plead that precious promiſe of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Jehovah; <hi>I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thy offspring; and they ſhall grow up</hi> in knowledge and grace, <hi>as willows by the water-co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
