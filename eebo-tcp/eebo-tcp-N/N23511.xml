            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE are aſſembled this day upon a mournful occaſion. Death has made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road upon our Society. Our illuſtrious and beloved PRESIDENT, is no more. RITTEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOUSE, the ingenious, the modeſt, and the wiſe—RITTENHOUSE, the friend of God and man, is now no more!—For this, the temple of Science is hung in mourning,—for this, our eyes now drop a tributary tear. Nor do we weep alone.—The United States of America ſympathize in our grief, for his name gave a ſplendor to the American character, and the friends of humanity in diſtant parts of the world, unite with us in lamenting our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon loſs,—for he belonged to the whole human race.</p>
            <p>By your vote to perpetuate the memory of this great and good man, you have made a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

attempt to reſcue philoſophers from their humble rank in the hiſtory of mankind. It is to them we owe our knowledge and poſſeſſion of moſt of the neceſſaries and conveniences of life. To procure theſe bleſſings for us, "they trim their midnight lamp, and hang o'er the ſickly taper." For us, they traverſe diſtant regions, expoſe themſelves to the inclemencies of the weather, mingle with ſavages and beaſts of prey, and in ſome inſtances, evince their love of ſcience and humanity by the ſacrifice of their lives.</p>
            <p>The amiable philoſopher whoſe talents and virtues are to be the ſubject of the following eulogium, is entitled to an uncommon portion of our gratitude and praiſe. He acquired his knowledge at the expence of uncommon exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he performed ſervices of uncommon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and finally he impaired his health, and probably ſhortened his life, by the ardor of his ſtudies and labors for the benefit of mankind.</p>
            <p>In attempting to diſcharge the difficult and painful duty you have aſſigned me, it will be neceſſary to give a ſhort account of the life of Mr. Rittenhouſe, inaſmuch as ſeveral of the moſt intereſting parts of his character are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:031143_0006_0FEAC74A5A2B6AC8"/>The village of Germantown in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of this city, had the honor of giving birth to this diſtinguiſhed philoſopher on the 8th day of April, in the year 1732. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors migrated from Holland about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the preſent century. They were diſtinguiſhed, together with his parents, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, induſtry, and ſimple manners. It is from ſources thus pure and retired, that thoſe talents and virtues have been chiefly derived, which have in all ages enlightened the world. They prove by their humble origin, that the Supreme Being has not ſurrendered up the direction of human affairs to the advantages acquired by accident or vice, and they bear a conſtant and faithful teſtimony of his impartial goodneſs, by their neceſſary and regular influence in equaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of mankind. This is the divine order of things, and every attempt to invert it, is a weak and unavailing effort to wreſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world from the hands of God.</p>
            <p>The early part of the life of Mr. Rittenhouſe was ſpent in agricultural employments under the eye of his father, in the county of Montgomery, twenty miles from Philadelphia, to which place he removed during the childhood of his Son. It was at this place his peculiar genius firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031143_0007_0FEAC74C00CA58C8"/>
itſelf. His plough, the fences, and even the ſtones of the field in which he worked, were frequently marked with figures which denoted a talent for mathematical ſtudies. Upon find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the native delicacy of his conſtitution unfitted him for the labors of huſbandry, his parents conſented to his learning the trade of a clock and mathematical inſtrument maker. In acquiring the knowledge of theſe uſeful arts, he was his own inſtructor.—They afforded him great delight, inaſmuch as they favoured his diſpoſition to inquire into the principles of natural philoſophy.—Conſtant employment of any kind, even in the practice of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical arts, has been found, in many inſtances, to adminiſter vigor to human genius. Franklin ſtudied the laws of nature, while he handled his printing types. The father of Rouſſeau, a jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller at Geneva, became acquainted with the principles of national juriſprudence, by liſtening to his ſon while he read to him in his ſhop, the works of Grotius and Puffendorf; and Herſchel conceived the great idea of a new planet, while he exerciſed the humble office of a muſician to a marching regiment.</p>
            <p>It was during the reſidence of our ingenious philoſopher with his father in the country, that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031143_0008_0FEAC74EF7095330"/>
he made himſelf maſter of Sir Iſaac Newton's Principia, which he read in the Engliſh tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Mott. It was here likewiſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with the ſcience of Fluxions, of which ſublime invention he believed himſelf for a while to be the author, nor did he know for ſome years afterwards, that a conteſt had been carried on between Sir Iſaac Newton and Leibnitz, for the honor of that great and uſeful diſcovery. What a mind was here!— Without literary friends or ſociety, and with but two or three books, he became, before he had reached his four and twentieth year, the rival of the two greateſt mathematicians in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope!</p>
            <p>It was in this retired ſituation, and while employed in working at his trade, that he plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and executed an orrery, in which he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the revolutions of the heavenly bodies in a manner more extenſive and complete, than had been done by any former aſtronomers. A correct deſcription of this orrery drawn up by the Rev. Dr. Smith, is publiſhed in the firſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of our Tranſactions. This maſter-piece of ingenious mechaniſm was purchaſed by the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of New-Jerſey. A ſecond was made by him, after the ſame model, for the uſe of the college
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031143_0009_0FEAC75302084768"/>
of Philadelphia. It now forms part of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical apparatus of the Univerſity of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, where it has for many years command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the admiration of the ingenious and the learned, from every part of the world.</p>
            <p>The reputation he derived from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this orrery, as well as his general character for mathematical knowledge, attracted the notice of his fellow-citizens in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and in ſeveral of the neighbouring ſtates, but the diſcovery of his uncommon merit belonged chiefly to his brother-in-law, the Rev. Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Dr. Smith, and the late Mr. John Lukens, an ingenious mathematician of this city. Theſe gentlemen fully appreciated his talents, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in urging him to remove to Philadelphia, in order to enlarge his opportunities of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and uſefulneſs. He yielded with reluctance to their advice, and exchanged his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved retirement in the country for this city, in the year 1770. Here he continued for ſeveral years, to follow his occupation of a clock and mathematical inſtrument maker. He excelled in both branches of that buſineſs. His mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical inſtruments have been eſteemed by good judges to be ſuperior in accuracy and workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to any of the ſame kind that have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Europe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:031143_0010_0FEAC75486769250"/>About the time he ſettled in Philadelphia he became a member of our Society. His firſt communication to the Society was a calculation of the tranſit of Venus as it was to happen on the 3d of June, 1769, in 40° north latitude, and 5 hours weſt longitude from Greenwich. He was one of a committee appointed by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to obſerve in the townſhip of Norriton, this rare occurrence in the revolution of that planet, and bore an active part in the preparations which were made for that purpoſe. Of this Dr. Smith who was likewiſe of the committee, has left an honourable record in the hiſtory of that event which is publiſhed in the firſt volume of the tranſactions of our Society. "As Mr. Ritten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe's dwelling (ſays the Doctor) is about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles north-weſt from Philadelphia; our other engagements did not permit Mr. Lukens or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to pay much attention to the neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations; but we knew that we had intruſted them to a gentleman on the ſpot [meaning Mr. Rittenhouſe] who had, joined to a complete ſkill in mechanics, ſo extenſive an aſtronomical, and mathematical knowledge, that the uſe, manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and even conſtruction of the apparatus, were perfectly familiar to him. The laudable pains he had taken in theſe material articles will
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031143_0011_0FEAC757D94CD268"/>
beſt appear from the work itſelf, which he hath committed into my hands, with a modeſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, giving me a liberty with them, which his own accuracy, taſte and abilities leave no room to exerciſe."</p>
            <p>We are naturally led here to take a view of our philoſopher with his aſſociates in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to obſerve a phaenomenon which had never been ſeen but twice before by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of our earth, which would never be ſeen again by any perſon then living, and on which depended very important aſtronomical conſequences. The night before the long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected day, was probably paſſed in a degree of ſolicitude which precluded ſleep. How great muſt have been their joy when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the morning ſun, "and the whole horizon without a cloud;" for ſuch is the deſcription of the day given by Mr. Rittenhouſe in the report referred to by Dr. Smith. In penſive ſilence, and trembling anxiety, they waited for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted moment of obſervation; it came, and brought with it all that had been wiſhed for and expected by thoſe who ſaw it. In our philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, it excited in the inſtant of one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacts of the planet with the ſun, an emotion of delight ſo exquiſite and powerful, as to induce
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031143_0012_0FEAC75C69B51BD8"/>
fainting. This will readily be believed by thoſe who have known the extent of that pleaſure which attends the diſcovery, or firſt perception of truth. Soon after this event, we find him acting as one of a committee appointed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the tranſit of Mercury on the 9th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember in the ſame year. This was likewiſe done at Norriton. An account of it was drawn up, and publiſhed at the requeſt of the committee by Dr. Smith. A minute hiſtory of the whole of theſe events, in which Mr. Rittenhouſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to act a diſtinguiſhed part, is given in our tranſactions. It was received with great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by the aſtronomers of Europe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to raiſe the character of our then infant country for aſtronomical knowledge.</p>
            <p>In the year 1775, he was appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and deliver the annual oration before our ſociety. The ſubject of it, was the hiſtory of aſtronomy. The language of this oration is ſimple, but the ſentiments contained in it are ingenious, original, and in ſome inſtances ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime. It was delivered in a feeble voice, and without any of the advantages of oratory, but it commanded notwithſtanding, the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found attention, and was followed by univerſal admiration and applauſe from a crouded and reſpectable audience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:031143_0013_0FEAC75DED7807A8"/>From the contents of this oration, it appears that Aſtronomy was the favourite object of his ſtudies. Attempts have been made to depreciate this branch of natural philoſophy, by denying its utility, and application to human affairs.— The opinion is an unjuſt one, and as it tends to convey a limited idea of the talents of Mr. Rittenhouſe, I hope I ſhall be excuſed in ſaying a few words in ſavour of this ſcience.</p>
            <p>It is to aſtronomy we are indebted for our knowledge of navigation, by which means the different parts of our globe have been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterwards cemented together by the mutual wants and obligations of commerce.</p>
            <p>It was aſtronomy that taught mankind the art of predicting and explaining eclipſes of the Sun and Moon, and thereby delivered them from the ſuperſtition which in the early ages of the world, was connected with thoſe phaenomena of nature.</p>
            <p>We are taught by aſtronomy to correct our ideas of the viſible heavens, and thus by diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering the fallacy of the ſimple evidence of our ſenſes, to call to their aid, the uſe of our reaſon, in deciding upon all the material objects of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knowledge.</p>
            <p>Aſtronomy delivers the mind from a gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling attachment to the purſuits and pleaſures
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031143_0014_0FEAC7609B07B938"/>
of this world. "Take the miſer (ſays our phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in his oration) from the earth, if it be poſſible to diſengage him—he whoſe nightly reſt has been long broken by the loſs of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle foot of it, uſeleſs perhaps to him; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him to the planet Mars, one of the leaſt diſtant from us—Perſuade the ambitious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch to accompany him, who has ſacrificed the lives of thouſands of his ſubjects to an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary property in certain ſmall portions of the earth, and point out this earth to them, with all its kingdoms and wealth, a glittering ſtar, cloſe by the moon, the latter ſcarce viſible, and the former, leſs bright than our evening ſtar.— They would turn away their diſguſted ſight from it, not thinking it worth their ſmalleſt attention, and ſeek for conſolation, in the gloomy regions of Mars."</p>
            <p>Once more—the ſtudy of aſtronomy has the moſt friendly influence upon morals, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. "Yes, (ſays our philoſopher in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his oration) the direct tendency of this ſcience is to dilate the heart with univerſal benevolence, and to enlarge its views. It flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters no princely vice, nor national depravity. It encourages not the libertine by relaxing any of the precepts of morality, nor does it attempt to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031143_0015_0FEAC763662F8EF8"/>
undermine the foundations of religion. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies none of thoſe attributes, which the wiſeſt, and beſt of mankind have in all ages aſcribed to the Deity. Nor does it degrade the human mind from that dignity which is ever neceſſary to make it contemplate <hi>itſelf</hi> with complacency. None of theſe things does aſtronomy pretend to, and if theſe things merit the name of philoſophy, and the encouragement of a people, then let ſcepticiſm flouriſh, and aſtronomy lie neglected. —Let the names of Berkley and Hume become immortal, and that of Newton be loſt in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion."—</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:031143_0018_0FEAC76D8DA61C30"/>Beſides theſe publications, our ſociety is in poſſeſſion of the following communications from Mr. Rittenhouſe, which are now in the preſs, and will be ſpeedily publiſhed in the fourth vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of our tranſactions.</p>
            <p>A method of determining the true plane of a planet in an eliptical form, by converging ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, directly from the mean anomaly.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, experiments on the expanſion of wood by heat.</p>
            <p>Talents ſo ſplendid, and knowledge ſo prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical in mathematicks, are like mines of precious metals. They become public property by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent. The State of Pennſylvania was not inſenſible of the wealth ſhe poſſeſſed in the mind of Mr. Rittenhouſe. She claimed him as her own, and employed him in buſineſs of the moſt important nature.</p>
            <p>In the year 1779 he was appointed by the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, one of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031143_0019_0FEAC770B35138E8"/>
for adjuſting a territorial diſpute between Pennſylvania and Virginia, and to his talents, moderation and firmneſs, were aſcribed in a great degree, the ſatisfactory termination, of that once alarming controverſy in the year 1785.</p>
            <p>In 1784 he aſſiſted in determining the length of five degrees of longitude from a point on the Delaware, in order to fix the weſtern limits of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>In 1786, he was employed in fixing the northern line which divides Pennſylvania from New-York.</p>
            <p>But the application of his talents and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the ſettlement of territorial diſputes, was not confined to his native ſtate. In the year 1769, he was employed in ſettling the limits between New Jerſey and New York, and in 1787 he was called upon to aſſiſt in fixing the boundary line between the States of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts and New York. This laſt buſineſs which was executed with his uſual preciſion and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, was his farewel peace offering to the union and happineſs of his country.</p>
            <p>In his excurſions through the wilderneſs, he carried with him his habits of inquiry and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Nothing in our mountains, ſoils, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſprings eſcaped his notice. It is to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031143_0020_0FEAC772372E9E10"/>
be lamented that his private letters, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of his friends, are the only records of what he collected upon theſe occaſions. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, or naturaliſt, whoſoever thou art! that ſhalt hereafter traverſe the unfrequented woods of our ſtate, forget not to reſpect the paths, firſt mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the feet of this ingenious, and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the public. Honour the fountains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to ſcience by his ſkilful hand, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale with double pleaſure the pure atmoſphere of the mountains, on which he renewed his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the canopy of heaven, after paſſing whole weeks in foreſts ſo ſhady, as to conceal from him the rays of the ſun. And ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of Pennſylvania, friends and patrons of literature, be grateful for his ſervices. Let the remembrance of them be dear to the preſent generation, and let a part of the ſtate, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a more eſpecial manner for its reſources in natural knowledge, bear his name with honor to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>In the year 1791 he was choſen ſucceſſor to Dr. Franklin in the chair of our ſociety. In this elevated ſtation, the higheſt that philoſophy can confer in our country, his conduct was marked by its uſual line of propriety and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Never did the artificial pomp of ſtation
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031143_0021_0FEAC77698D043B0"/>
command half the reſpect, which followed his unaſſuming manners in the diſcharge of the public duties of this office. You will often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, gentlemen, with a mixture of pleaſure and pain, the delightful evenings you paſſed in the ſociety, every time he preſided in your meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They were uniformly characterized by ardor in the purſuits of ſcience, urbanity and brotherly kindneſs. His attachment to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the ſociety was evinced ſoon after he accepted of the Preſident's chair, by a donation of three hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>But his talents and knowledge were not limited to mathematical or material ſubjects; his mind was a repoſitory of the knowledge of all ages and countries. He had early and deeply ſtudied moſt of the different ſyſtems of theology. He was well acquainted with practical metaphyſicks. In reading travels he took great delight. From them, he drew a large fund or his knowledge of the natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of our globe. He poſſeſſed talents for muſic and poetry, but the more ſerious and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary purſuits of his life, prevented his devoting much time to the cultivation of them. He read the Engliſh poets with great pleaſure. The <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Thomſon charmed him moſt. He
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031143_0022_0FEAC7781E83B8C8"/>
admired his elegant combination of philoſophy and poetry. However oppoſed theſe ſtudies may appear, they alike derive their perfection from extenſive and accurate obſervations of the works of nature. He was intimately acquainted with the French, German, and Dutch languages, the two former of which he acquired without the aſſiſtance of a maſter. They ſerved the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable purpoſe of conveying to him the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of foreign nations, and thereby enabled him to proſecute his ſtudies with more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, in his native language.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking of Mr. Rittenhouſe, it has been common to lament his want of what is called a liberal education.—Were education what it ſhould be, in our public ſeminaries, this would have been a misfortune, but conducted as it is at preſent, agreeably to the ſyſtems adopted in Europe in the fifteenth century, I am diſpoſed to believe that his extenſive knowledge, and ſplendid character are to be aſcribed chiefly to his having eſcaped the pernicious influence of monkiſh learning upon his mind in early life. Had the uſual forms of a public education in the United States been impoſed upon him; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of revolving through life in a planetary orbit, he would probably have conſumed the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031143_0023_0FEAC77B51719768"/>
force of his genius by fluttering around the blaze of an evening taper. Rittenhouſe the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and one of the luminaries of the eighteenth century, might have ſpent his hours of ſtudy in compoſing ſyllogiſms, or in meaſuring the feet of Greek and Latin poetry.</p>
            <p>It will be honourable to the citizens of the United States, to add, that they were not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the merit of our philoſopher. Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and improvements in every art and ſcience, were frequently ſubmitted to his examination, and were afterwards patroniſed by the public, according as they were approved of by him. Wherever he went, he met with public reſpect, and private attentions. But his reputation was not confined to his native country. His name was known and admired in every region of the earth, where ſcience and genius are cultivated and reſpected.<note n="*" place="bottom">The degree of Maſter of Arts was conferred upon him by the College of Philadelphia, in 1768. The ſame degree was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him by the College of William and Mary, in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, in 1784. In the year 1789, he received the degree of Doctor of Laws from the College of New-Jerſey. He was elected a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at Boſton in 1782, and of the Royal Society in London in 1795.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such were the talents and knowledge, and ſuch the fame, of our departed Preſident! His
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031143_0024_0FEAC77FC939F040"/>
virtues now demand our tribute of praiſe.—And here, I am leſs at a loſs to know what to ſay, than what to leave unſaid. We have hitherto beheld him as a philoſopher, ſoaring like the eagle, until our eyes have been dazzled by his near approaches to the ſun. We ſhall now contemplate him at a leſs diſtance, and behold him in the familiar character of a man, fulfilling his various duties, in their utmoſt extent. If any thing has been ſaid of his talents and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that has excited attention, or kindled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in the younger members of our ſociety, to purſue him in his path of honor, let me requeſt them not to forſake me here. Come, and learn by his example, to be good, as well as great.— His virtues furniſh the moſt ſhining models for your imitation, for they were never obſcured in any ſituation or ſtage of his life, by a ſingle cloud of weakneſs or vice. As the ſource of theſe virtues, whether of a public or private na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſhall firſt mention his exalted ſenſe of moral obligation founded upon the revelation of the perfections of the Supreme Being. This appears from many paſſages in his oration, and from his private letters to his friends. In his oration we find the following pious ſentiment. "Should it pleaſe that Almighty Power who hath
<pb facs="unknown:031143_0025_0FEAC7814CF39CE0"/>
placed us in a world in which we are only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted "to look about us and to die," to indulge us with exiſtence throughout that half of eternity which ſtill remains unſpent, and to conduct us through the ſeveral ſtages of his works, <hi>here</hi> [meaning in the ſtudy of aſtronomy] is ample proviſion made for employing every faculty of the mind, even allowing its powers to be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through an endleſs repetition of ages. Let us not complain of the vanity of this world, and that there is nothing in it capable of ſatisfying us. Happy in thoſe wants,—happy in thoſe deſires, forever in ſucceſſion to be gratified,—happy in a continual approach to the Deity."</p>
            <p>"I muſt confeſs that I am not one of thoſe ſanguine ſpirits who ſeem to think that when the withered hand of death has drawn up the curtain of eternity, all diſtance between the creature and the Creator, and between finite and infinite, will be annihilated. Every enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our faculties,—every new happineſs conferred upon us, every ſtep we advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Divinity, will very probably render us more and more ſenſible of his inexhauſtible ſtores of communicable bliſs, and of his inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible perfections."</p>
            <p>There appears to be a natural connection between a knowledge of the works of nature and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031143_0026_0FEAC78550CC7210"/>
juſt ideas of the divine perfections; and if phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have not in all ages been equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout with our Preſident, it becomes us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how far the beneficial influence of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy upon religion, may have been prevented by their minds being pre-occupied in early life with the fictions of ancient poets, and the vices of the heathen gods. It remains yet to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, whether all the moral as well as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral attributes of the Deity may not be diſcovered in the form, and oeconomy of the material world, and whether that righteouſneſs which deſcended from heaven near eighteen hundred years ago, may not wait for philoſophical truth to ſpring up from the earth, in order by uniting with it, to command univerſal belief and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This opinion, as far as it relates to one of the moral attributes of the Deity, ſeems to have been admitted by our philoſopher in the following elegant and pious extract from a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to one of his friends, "give me leave (ſays he) to mention two or three proofs of infinite goodneſs in the works of creation. The firſt is, poſſeſſing goodneſs in ourſelves. Now it is inconſiſtent with all juſt reaſoning to ſuppoſe, that there is any thing good, lovely or praiſe-worthy in us, which is not poſſeſſed in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031143_0027_0FEAC7885DF12558"/>
higher degree by that Being who firſt called us into exiſtence. In the next place, I reckon the exquiſite and innocent delight that many things around us are calculated to afford us. In this light the beauty and fragrance of a ſingle roſe is a better argument for divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than a luxuriant field of wheat. For if we can ſuppoſe that we were created by a malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Being with a deſign to torment us for his amuſement, he muſt have furniſhed us with the means of ſubſiſtence, and either have made our condition tolerable, or not have leſt the means of quitting it at pleaſure, in our own power. Such being my opinions, you will not wonder at my fondneſs for what Mr. Addiſon calls the pleaſures of the imagination. They are all to me, ſo many demonſtrations of infinite goodneſs."</p>
            <p>If ſuch be the pious fruits of an attentive examination of the works of the Creator, ceaſe ye miniſters of the goſpel to defeat the deſign of your benevolent labors, by interpoſing the common ſtudies of the ſchools, between our globe, and the minds of young people. Let their firſt ideas be thoſe which are obtruded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſenſes, by the hand of nature. Permit the firmament of heaven, and the animal, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, and mineral productions of the earth,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031143_0028_0FEAC789E3CCEAC0"/>
to inſtruct them in the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Creator, and let the effects of phyſical evil upon general happineſs, vindicate the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in permitting the exiſtence of moral evil in our world. Thus the perverſe paſſions of man, may be made to unite with ſtorms and tempeſts, in furniſhing proofs of the goodneſs of the Creator of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>But the religion of Mr. Rittenhouſe, was not derived wholly from his knowledge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the material world. He believed in the Chriſtian revelation. Of this, he gave many proofs, not only in the conformity of his life, to the precepts of the goſpel, but in his letters and converſation. I well recollect in ſpeaking to me of the truth and excellency of the Chriſtian religion, he mentioned as a proof of its divine origin, that the miracles of our Saviour differed from all other miracles, in being entirely of a kind and benevolent nature. It is no ſmall triumph to the friends of Revelation to obſerve, in this age of infidelity, that our religion has been admitted and even defended by men of the moſt exalted underſtanding, and of the ſtrongeſt reaſoning powers. The ſingle teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of David Rittenhouſe in its favor, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs the declamations of whole nations againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:031143_0029_0FEAC78E36786D70"/>As the natural effect of his belief in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the whole human race to each other in a common Father and Redeemer, he embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole family of mankind in the arms of his benevolence. The force and extent of this virtue in his heart, will appeal from my reading one more extract from his oration. I am aware how much I ſuffer by introducing quotations from that eloquent performance, for they will caſt a ſhade upon all I have ſaid, or ſhall ſay upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>"How far, (ſays our philoſopher) the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the other planets may reſemble man, we cannot pretend to ſay. If like them they were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated liable to fall, yet ſome, if not all of them may ſtill retain their original rectitude. We will hope they do; The thought is comfortable.— Ceaſe then Gallileo to improve thy optic tube, and thou great Newton, forbear thy ardent ſearch into the myſteries of nature, leſt ye make unwelcome diſcoveries. Deprive us not of the pleaſure of believing that yonder orbs, traverſing in ſilent majeſty the etherial regions, are the peaceful ſeats of innocence and bliſs, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural or moral evil has ever intruded, and where to enjoy with gratitude and adoration the Creator's bounty, is the buſineſs of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

If their Inhabitants reſemble man in their faculties and affections, let us ſuppoſe that they are wiſe enough to govern themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dictates of that reaſon God has given in ſuch a manner, as to conſult their own, and each other's happineſs upon all occaſions. But if on the contrary, they have found it neceſſary to erect artificial fabrics of government, let us not ſuppoſe they have done it with ſo little ſkill, and at ſuch an enormous expenſe, as to render them a misfortune, inſtead of a bleſſing.—We will hope that their ſtateſmen are patriots, and that their kings (if that order of beings has found admittance there) have the feelings of humanity. Happy people!—and perhaps more happy ſtill, that all communication with us is denied. We have neither corrupted you with our vices, nor injured you by violence. None of your ſons and daughters have been degraded from their native dignity, and doomed to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſlavery in America, merely becauſe their bodies may be diſpoſed to reflect, or abſorb the rays of light different from ours. Even you, inhabitants of the Moon, ſituated in our very neighbourhood, are effectually ſecured from the rapacious hands of the oppreſſors of our globe.

            <p>"Pardon theſe reflections. They ariſe not from the gloomy ſpirit of miſanthropy. That Being, before whoſe piercing eye all the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate foldings of the human heart, become expanded, and illuminated, is my witneſs with what ſincerity, with what ardor—I wiſh for the happineſs of the whole race of mankind. —how much I admire that diſpoſition of lands and ſeas which affords a communication between diſtant regions, and a mutual exchange of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits—how ſincerely I approve of thoſe ſocial refinements, which add to our happineſs, and induce us with gratitude to acknowledge our Creator's goodneſs, and how much I delight in a participation of the diſcoveries made from time to time in nature's works, by our phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical brethren in Europe. But (adds our philoſopher) when I conſider that luxury, and her conſtant follower tyranny, which have long ſince laid the glories of Aſia in the duſt, are now advancing like a torrent irreſiſtible, and have nearly completed their conqueſt over Europe,— I am ready to wiſh—vain wiſh! that nature would raiſe her everlaſting bars between the new

and the old world, and make a voyage to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope as impracticable as one to the moon."</p>
            <p>As when a traveller in paſſing through a wilderneſs, ſlackens his pace to prolong the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a ſudden and unexpected proſpect of a majeſtic river pouring its waters down the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity of a cloud-cap't mountain, and ſpreading fertility and verdure throughout the adjacent vallies, ſo we feel diſpoſed to pauſe, and feaſt upon the ſublime ſentiments contained in the paſſage which I have read. Citizens of the United States, receive and cheriſh them as a legacy from a friend, or a brother. Be juſt, and looſe the bands of the African ſlave. Be wiſe, and render war odious in our country. Be free, by aſſuming a national character and name, and be greatly happy, by erecting a barrier againſt the corruptions in morals, government, and religion, which now pervade all the nations of Europe.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Mr. William Barton, nephew to Mr. Rittenhouſe, has favoured me with the following extract of a letter dated in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1755, to his brother-in-law, the Rev. Mr. Barton, who was the friend and correſpondent of his youth, which ſhews how early and deeply the principles of univerſal benevolence were fixed in his mind.</p>
                  <p>"I would ſooner give up my intereſt in a future ſtate, than be diveſted of humanity;—I mean that good will I have to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, although one half of them are ſaid to be fools, and almoſt the other half knaves. Indeed I am firmly perſuaded, that we are not at the diſpoſal of a Being who has the leaſt tincture of ill-nature, or requires any in us.—You will laugh at this grave phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, or my writing to you on a ſubject which you have thought of a thouſand times: but, can any thing that is ſerious, be ridiculous?—Shall we ſuppoſe Gabriel ſmiling at Newton, for labouring to demonſtrate whether the earth be at reſt or not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the former plainly ſees it move?</p>

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:031143_0033_0FEAC79AEFE24918"/>But the philanthropy of Mr. Rittenhouſe did not conſiſt ſimply in wiſhes for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind. He reduced this divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to practice by a ſeries of faithful and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted ſervices to that part of his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to which the uſefulneſs of good men is chiefly confined. His country, his beloved country, was the object of the ſtrongeſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his heart. For her, he thought,—for her, he laboured,—and for her, in the hours of her difficulties and danger, he wept,—in every ſtage of the American revolution. Patriots of 1776, you will acquit me of exaggeration here, for you feel in the recollection of what paſſed in your own boſoms, a witneſs of the truth of each of theſe aſſertions. The year of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Independance, which changed our royal governments into Republics, produced no change in his political principles, for he had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb facs="unknown:031143_0034_0FEAC79C89C17790"/>
a Republican by his father. I can never forget the pleaſure with which he avowed his early but ſecret attachment to an elective and repreſentative form of government. Often have I heard him above twenty years ago, predict the immenſe encreaſe of talents and knowledge which has been produced by the ſtrength and activity that have been infuſed into the American mind, by our republican conſtitutions. Often, likewiſe, at the ſame remote period of time, have I heard him anticipate with delight, the effects of our revolution in ſowing the ſeeds of a new order of things in other parts of the world. He believed political, as well as moral evil to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders into the ſociety of men,—that general happineſs was the original deſign, and ultimate end of the divine government, and that a time would come, when every part of our globe, would echo back the heavenly proclamation of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal peace on earth, and good will to man.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid, that he departed from the duties of a Philoſopher, by devoting a part of his time and talents to the ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his country. It belongs to monarchies, to limit the buſineſs of government to a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged order of men, and it is from the remains of a monarchical ſpirit in our country, that we
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031143_0035_0FEAC79F25573058"/>
complain when clergymen, phyſicians, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and mechanics, take an active part in civil affairs. The obligations of patriotiſm are as univerſal and binding, as thoſe of juſtice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, and the virtuous propenſities of the human heart are as much reſiſted by every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual who neglects the buſineſs of his country, as they are by the extinction of the domeſtic affections in a cell. Man was made for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, and a republic was made for man, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Divine Power and goodneſs have been waſted, in the creation and gift of his public affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—Our philoſopher adopted this truth from the evidence of his feelings, in common with the reſt of mankind, but it was ſtrongly rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced in his mind by numerous analogies of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. How was it poſſible for him to contemplate light and air as the common and equal portions of every man, and not acknowledge that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven intended liberty to be diſtributed in the ſame manner among the whole human race! Or how could he behold the beauty and harmony of the univerſe, as the reſult of univerſal and mutual dependance, and not admit that heaven intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rulers to be dependant upon thoſe, for whoſe benefit alone, all government ſhould exiſt. To
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031143_0036_0FEAC7A396F643F0"/>
ſuppoſe the contrary, would be to deny unity and ſyſtem in the plans of the great creator of all things.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make no apology for theſe ſentiments. They are not foreign to the ſolemnity of this diſcourſe. Had I ſaid leſs of the political prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and conduct of our enlightened Preſident, hundreds and thouſands of my fellow-citizens would have accuſed me, of an act of treachery to his memory. May the time never come, in which the praiſes of our republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhall not be acceptable to the ears of an American audience!</p>
            <p>In the more limited circles of private life, Mr. Rittenhouſe commanded eſteem and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As a neighbour he was kind and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. His ſympathy extended in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to diſtreſs of every kind, but it was excited with the moſt force, and the kindeſt effects, to the weakneſs, pain and poverty of old age.— As a friend he was ſincere, ardent, and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted. As a companion, he inſtructed upon all ſubjects. To his happy communicative diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, I beg leave to expreſs my obligations in this public manner. I can truly ſay, after an acquaintance with him for ſix-and-twenty years,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031143_0037_0FEAC7A518885D70"/>
that I never went into his company, without learning ſomething. With pleaſure have I looked beyond my preſent labors to a time, when his ſociety ſhould conſtitute one of the principal enjoyments of the evening of my life.—But alas! that time, ſo often anticipated, and ſo delightful in proſpect—will never— come!</p>
            <p>I hope it will not be thought that I tread too cloſely upon his footſteps, when I preſume to lift the latch of his door, and to exhibit him in the domeſtic relations of a huſband and father. It was the practice of the philoſophers of former ages, to paſs their lives in their cloſets, and to maintain a formal and diſtant intercourſe with their families; but our philoſopher was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to pride and impoſture in every thing. His family conſtituted his chief ſociety, and the moſt intimate circle of his friends. When the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ſtate of his health, rendered the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his ſtudy, leſs agreeable than in former years, he paſſed whole evenings in reading or converſing, with his wife and daughters. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py family! ſo much and ſo long bleſſed with ſuch a head! and happier ſtill, to have poſſeſſed diſpoſitions and knowledge to diſcern and love his exalted character, and to enjoy his inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="unknown:031143_0038_0FEAC7A8E3F62958"/>
converſation!—Thus ſir Thomas Moore lived with his accompliſhed wife and daughters; —Thus Cicero educated his beloved Tullia; and in this way only, can the female ſex be el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evated to that dignity, and uſefulneſs in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for which they were formed, and by which, from their influence upon manners, a new aera would be created in the hiſtory of mankind.</p>
            <p>The houſe, and manner of living, of our preſident, exhibited the taſte of a philoſopher, the ſimplicity of a republican, and the temper of a Chriſtian. He was independent, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an eſtate, ſmall in the eſtimation of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and avarice, but amply ſuited to all his wants and deſires. He held the office of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of Pennſylvania, by an annual and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vote of the legiſlature, between the years 1777, and 1789. During this period, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined purchaſing the ſmalleſt portion of the public debt of the ſtate, thereby manifeſting a delicacy of integrity, which is known and felt only by pure and elevated minds.</p>
            <p>In the year 1792, he was perſuaded to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the office of Director of the mint of the United States. His want of health, obliged him to reſign it in 1795. Here his conduct was likewiſe above ſuſpicion, for I have been inform<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031143_0039_0FEAC7AA669A2BF0"/>
by his colleague in office,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Way.</note> that in ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he paid for work done at the mint out of his ſalary, where he thought the charges for it, would be deemed extravagant by the United States.</p>
            <p>His oeconomy extended to a wiſe and profitable uſe of his time. No man ever found him unemployed. As an apology for detaining a friend a few minutes, while he arranged ſome papers he had been examining, he ſaid, "that he had once thought health, the greateſt bleſſing in the world, but that he now thought there was one thing of much greater value, and that was time." The propriety of this remark will appear when we conſider, that Providence, ſo liberal in other gifts, beſtows this, in a ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. He never gives a ſecond moment, until he has withdrawn the firſt, and ſtill reſerves the third in his own hand.</p>
            <p>The countenance of Mr. Rittenhouſe, was too remarkable to be unnoticed upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It diſplayed ſuch a mixture of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, benignity, and innocence, that it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to diſtinguiſh his perſon in the largeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by a previous knowledge of his character. His manners were civil, and engaging to ſuch a
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031143_0040_0FEAC7AD63DC2D00"/>
degree, that he ſeldom paſſed an hour, even in a public houſe, in travelling through our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without being followed by the good wiſhes of all who attended upon him. There was no affectation of ſingularity, in any thing he ſaid, or did. Even his hand writing, in which this weakneſs ſo frequently diſcovers itſelf, was ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and intelligible at firſt ſight, to all who ſaw it.</p>
            <p>Here I expected to have finiſhed the detail of his virtues, but in the neighbourhood of that galaxy created by their connected luſtre, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a virtue of ineſtimable value, twinkling like a rare, and ſolitary ſtar. It is his ſuperlative modeſty. This heaven born virtue was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in every part of his conduct, that he appeared not ſo much to conceal, as to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his ſuperiority as a philoſopher and a man, over the greateſt part of his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>In reviewing the intellectual endowments and moral excellency of Mr. Rittenhouſe, and our late intimate connection with him, we are led to rejoice in being men.</p>
            <p>We proceed now to the cloſing ſcenes of his life.</p>
            <p>His conſtitution was naturally feeble, but it was rendered ſtill more ſo, by ſedentary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031143_0041_0FEAC7B1EA952368"/>
and midnight ſtudies. He was afflicted for many years with a weak breaſt, which, upon unuſual exertions of body or mind, or ſudden changes in the weather, became the ſeat of a painful and harraſſing diſorder. This conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional infirmity was not without its uſes. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to the perfection of his virtue, by producing habitual patience and reſignation to the will of heaven, and a conſtant eye to the hour of his diſſolution. It was a window through which he often looked with pleaſure towards a place of exiſtence, where from the encreaſe and perfection of his intuitive faculties, he would probably acquire more knowledge in an hour, than he had acquired in his whole life, by the ſlow operations of reaſon; and where, from the greater magnitude and extent of the objects of his contemplation, his native globe, would appear like his cradle, and all the events of time, like the amuſements of his infant years.</p>
            <p>On the 26th of June, of the preſent year, the long expected meſſenger of death, diſcloſed his commiſſion. In his laſt illneſs, which was acute, and ſhort, he retained the uſual patience and benevolence of his temper. Upon being told that ſome of his friends had called at his door to inquire how he was; he
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031143_0042_0FEAC7B36DEE3978"/>
aſked why they were not invited into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſee him. "Becauſe (ſaid his wife) you are too weak to ſpeak to them." "Yes (ſaid he) that is true, but I could ſtill have ſqueezed their hands."—Thus with a heart overflowing with love to his family, friends, country, and to the whole world, he peacefully reſigned his ſpirit into the hands of his God. Let the day of his death be recorded in the annals of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and let its annual return be marked by ſome public act, which ſhall characteriſe his ſervices and our grief, and thereby animate us and our ſucceſſors, to imitate his illuſtrious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample!</p>
            <p>It has been the faſhion of late years, to ſay of perſons who had been diſtinguiſhed in life, when they left the world in a ſtate of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to every thing, and believing, and hoping in nothing, that they died like philoſophers. Very different was the latter end of our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preſident. He died like a chriſtian, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the welfare of all around him—believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the reſurrection, and the life to come, and hoping for happineſs from every attribute of the Deity.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to his requeſt, his body was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in his obſervatory near his dwelling
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031143_0043_0FEAC7B6C63E4828"/>
houſe, in the preſence of a numerous concourſe of his fellow-citizens. It was natural for him in the near proſpect of appearing in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Maker, to feel an attachment to that ſpot in which he had cultivated a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his perfections, and held communion with him through the medium of his works. Hereafter it ſhall become one of the objects of curioſity in our city. Thither ſhall the pliloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of future ages reſort to do homage to his tomb, and children yet unborn, ſhall point to the dome which covers it, and exultlngly ſay, "there lies our Rittenhouſe."</p>
            <p>Let us my reſpected colleagues, repair for a few minutes to that awful ſpot.—In entering it, —we behold the teleſcope, dear inſtrument of his diſcoveries, turned upon its axis, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the earth, which has cloſed its maſter's eyes.—How artleſs—the inſcription upon his tombſtone!—It contains nothing but his name, and the ſimple record of the days and years of his birth and death.—Very different would have been the monument of his worth and fame, had not the gratitude and affection of his friends been controuled by his dying requeſt. His head would have reclined in marble, upon the lap of religion. At his feet, ſcience would have ſat—
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031143_0044_0FEAC7C11CF423D0"/>
bathed in tears; while the genius of republican liberty, in the figure of a venerable hermit, bending over his grave, would have deplored the loſs of his favorite ſon.—Alas!—too—too ſoon has our beloved preſident been torn from the chair of our ſociety!—Too ſoon has he laid aſide his robes of office, and ceaſed to miniſter for us day and night at the altar of ſcience!— Ah!—who now will elevate his teleſcope, and again direct it towards yonder heavens? Who now will obſerve the tranſit of the planets? Who now will awaken our nation to view the trackleſs and ſtupendous comet? Who now will meaſure the courſes of our rivers, in order to convey their ſtreams into our city, for the purpoſes of health and commerce?—Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is dumb;—for the voice of her chief interpreter is huſhed in death.—In this hour of our bereavement, to whom ſhall we look?—but to THEE, FATHER of life and light:—thou author of great and good gifts to man. O! let not thy Sun, thy Moon, and thy Stars now ſhine unobſerved among us! may the genius of our departed preſident, like the mantle of thy prophet of old, deſcend upon ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031143_0045_0FEAC7BE1B3D30B8"/>
of our ſociety, who ſhall, as he did, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to us the myſteries of thy works, and lead us ſtep by ſtep, to THYSELF, the great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing fountain of wiſdom, goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to the children of men!</p>
