            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <l>YE Alps audacious, thro' the Heavens that rise,</l>
                  <l>To cramp the day and hide me from the skies;</l>
                  <l>Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurl'd,</l>
                  <l>Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world,</l>
                  <l>I sing not you. A softer theme I choose,</l>
                  <l>A virgin theme, unconscious of the Muse,</l>
                  <l>But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire</l>
                  <l>The purest phrenzy of poetic fire.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Despise it not, ye Bards to terror steel'd,</l>
                  <l>Who hurl'd your thunders round the epic field;</l>
                  <l>Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing</l>
                  <l>Joys that the vineyard and the still-house bring:</l>
                  <l>Or on some distant fair your notes employ,</l>
                  <l>And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy.</l>
                  <l>I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel,</l>
                  <l>My morning incense, and my evening meal,</l>
                  <l>The sweets of Hasty-Pudding Come, dear bowl,</l>
                  <l>Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul.</l>
                  <l>The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine.</l>
                  <l>Its substance mingled, married in with thine,</l>
                  <l>Shall cool and temper thy superior heat,</l>
                  <l>And save the pains of blowing while I eat.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song</l>
                  <l>Flow like thy genial juices o'er my tongue,</l>
                  <l>Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime,</l>
                  <l>And as they roll in substance, roll in rhyme,</l>
                  <l>No more thy awkward, unpoetic name,</l>
                  <l>Should shun the Muse, or prejudice thy fame;</l>
                  <l>But rising grateful to th' accustom'd ear,</l>
                  <l>All Bards should catch it, and all realms revere!</l>

                  <l>To stir it well demands a stronger hand;</l>
                  <l>The husband takes his turn; and round and round</l>
                  <l>The ladle flies; at last the toil is crown'd;</l>
                  <l>When to the board the thronging huskers pour,</l>
                  <l>And take their seats as at the corn before.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I leave them to their feast. There still belong</l>
                  <l>More copious matters to my faithful song.</l>
                  <l>For rules there are, tho' ne'er unfolded yet,</l>
                  <l>Nice rules and wise, how pudding should be ate.</l>
                  <l>Some with molasses line the luscious treat,</l>
                  <l>And mix, like Bards, the useful with the sweet.</l>
                  <l>A wholesome dish and well deserving praise,</l>
                  <l>A great resource in those bleak wintry days,</l>
                  <l>When the chill'd earth lies buried deep in snow,</l>
                  <l>And raging Boreas drives the shivering cow.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Blest cow! thy praise shall still my notes employ,</l>
                  <l>Great source of health, the only source of joy;</l>
                  <l>Mother of Egypt's god, but sure for me</l>
                  <l>Were I to leave <hi>my</hi> God, I'd worship thee:</l>
                  <l>How oft thy teats these pious hands have prest!</l>
                  <l>How oft thy bounties prove my only feast!</l>
                  <l>How oft I've fed thee with my fav'rite grain!</l>
                  <l>And roar'd, like thee, to find thy children slain!</l>

                  <l>Ye swains who know her various worth to prize,</l>

                  <l>To this in future I confine my Muse,</l>
                  <l>Till she in haste some further hints unfold,</l>
                  <l>Well for the young, nor useless to the old.</l>
                  <l>First in your bowl the milk abundant take,</l>
                  <l>Then drop with care along the silver lake</l>
                  <l>Your ſlakes of pudding; these at first will hide</l>
                  <l>Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide;</l>
                  <l>But when their growing mass no more can sink,</l>
                  <l>When the soft island looms above the brink,</l>
                  <l>Then check your hand; you've got the portion's due,</l>
                  <l>So taught our sires, and what they taught is true.</l>

                  <l>There is a choice in spoons. Tho' small appear</l>
                  <l>The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>The deep bowl'd Gallic spoon, contriv'd to scoop</l>
                  <l>In ample draughts the thin diluted soup,</l>
                  <l>Performs not well in those substantial things,</l>
                  <l>Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings;</l>
                  <l>Where the strong labial muscles must embrace,</l>
                  <l>The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space.</l>
                  <l>With ease to enter and discharge the freight,</l>
                  <l>A bowl less concave but still more dilate,</l>
                  <l>Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size,</l>
                  <l>A secret rests unknown to vulgar eyes,</l>
                  <l>Experienc'd feeders can alone impart</l>
                  <l>A rule so much above the lore of art.</l>
                  <l>These tuneful lips, that thousand spoons have tried,</l>
                  <l>With just decision could the point decide,</l>
                  <l>Tho' not in song; the muse but poorly shines</l>
                  <l>In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines.</l>
                  <l>Yet the true form, as near as she can tell,</l>
                  <l>Is that small section of a goose-egg-shell,</l>
                  <l>Which in two equal portions shall divide</l>
                  <l>The distance from the centre to the side.</l>

                  <l>Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin,</l>
                  <l>Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin</l>
                  <l>Suspend the ready napkin; or, like me,</l>
                  <l>Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee;</l>
                  <l>Just in the zenith your wise head project,</l>
                  <l>Your full spoon rising in a line direct.</l>
                  <l>Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall,</l>
                  <l>The wide mouth'd, bowl will surely catch them all.</l>
