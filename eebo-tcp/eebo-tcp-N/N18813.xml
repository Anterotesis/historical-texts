            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Memoirs and Letters of the late Major General Lee, have been in the poſſeſſion of the Editor ſince the year 1786. They were tranſmitted from America to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by the gentleman whoſe name is ſubſcribed to the Memoirs, and who was a member of Congreſs for the ſtate of Georgia, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of publication. In their manuſcript ſtate they have been ſeen by ſeveral perſons in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who expreſſed a ſtrong deſire of putting them to the preſs, which the avocations of the perſon to whom they were entruſted, and his not being acquainted with ſuch undertakings, had cauſed him to neglect.</p>
            <p>As the ſubject of Revolutions is again renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what has occurred in France, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that whatever relates to the Mother-Revolution, that of America will, at leaſt, afford entertainment to the curious, and contribute to encreaſe the general ſtock of hiſtorical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>The reader may expect to find, in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that relates to General Lee, a great deal of the ſtrong republican character. His attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to principles of liberty, without regard to place, made him the citizen of the world rather than of any country; and from his earlieſt youth to the end of his career, this general trait in his character may be traced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:024456_0003_0FC7347C03E92CC8"/>So little of the courtier had he about him, that he never deſcended to intimate any thing. Whatever he ſpoke or wrote was in the fulleſt ſtyle of expreſſion, or ſtrong figure. He uſed to ſay of Mr. Paine, the author of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> in America, and ſince of <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (of whoſe writings he was a great admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) that <hi>"he burſt forth upon the world like Jove in thunder;"</hi> and this ſtrength of conception, ſo natural to General Lee, had it not been mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a turn equally as ſtrong for ſatire, and too much eccentricity of temper, would have rendered his converſation perpetually entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Though the Memoirs and every Letter in this publication are moſt faithfully printed from the copy tranſmitted from America, the Editor has omitted many whole letters, and alſo his trial before the Court Martial, as not ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to balance the expence to which they would have extended the work. But if any of the particular friends or relations of General Lee ſhould be deſirous of ſeeing them, they may be indulged with the opportunity, by leaving a line at the publiſhers, directed to the</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS OF <hi>Major General Lee.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE family of the Lees is both ancient and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, many of them having had connections and intermarriages with the principal families in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh nation; and, from a pedigree done for Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lee,<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1723.</note> diſtributor and collector of the ſtamp-duties for the county and city of Cheſter, North Wales, we learn, that the General's father was John Lee of Dern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, in the ſaid county, who was ſome time a Captain of Dragoons, afterwards Lieutenant Colonel of General Barrel's regiment from 1717 to 1742, at which time he was promoted to a Regiment of Foot. He married Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, ſecond daughter of Sir Henry Bunbury, of Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in the county of Cheſter, Baronet: by this lady he had three ſons, Thomas, Harry, and Charles, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, who is the ſubject of theſe memoirs.</p>
            <p>From his early youth he was ardent in the purſuit of knowledge; and being an officer at eleven years of age, may be conſidered as born in the army; which, though it deprived him of ſome regularity with reſpect to the mode of his education, yet his genius led him aſſiduouſly to cultivate the fields of ſcience, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a competent ſkill in the Greek and Latin; while his fondneſs for travelling gave him alſo an opportunity of attaining the Italian, Spaniſh, German, and French languages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:024456_0009_0FC734926E324B40"/>Having laid a good foundation, tactics became his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſtudy, in which he ſpent much time and pains, deſiring nothing more than to diſtinguiſh himſelf in the profeſſion of arms. We find him very early in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, commanding a Company of Grenadiers of the 44th regiment; and he was at the battle of Ticonderoga, where General Abercrombie was defeated. Here, it is ſaid, he was ſhot through the body; but fortunately his wound did not prove mortal.</p>
            <p>When he returned to England from America, after the reduction of Montreal, he found a general peace was in contemplation. The ceſſion of Canada was talked of, which gave great uneaſineſs to every Americ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared prejudicial to their intereſt and ſafety. On this occaſion he exerted himſelf, and publiſhed a pamphlet ſhewing the importance of this country, which was much approved of by all the friends to America. The cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Dr. Franklin, in particular, was pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment him, and ſaid "that it could not fail of making a ſalutary impreſſion." In the year 1762, he bore a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel's commiſſion, and ſerved under General Burgoyne in Portugal; and in this ſervice he handſomely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards had formed a deſign of invading that kingdom, and had aſſembled an army on the frontiers of Eſtremadura, with an intention of penetrating into the province of Alentejo. Count La Lippe was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of the Portugueſe army, who formed a deſign of attacking an advanced body of the Spaniards, which lay on their frontiers, in a town called Valentia de Alcantara.</p>
            <p>This enterpriſe was committed to Brigadier General Burgoyne, who effected a complete ſurprize on the town, took the general who was to have commanded in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended invaſion, with a number of other officers, and one of the beſt regiments in the Spaniſh ſervice was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtroyed. But notwithſtanding this, and ſeveral ſubſequent ſkirmiſhes, the Spaniſh army continued maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the country, and nothing remained but the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:024456_0010_0FC73493A83E1020"/>
of the Tagus, to enable them to take up their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Alentejo.</p>
            <p>General Burgoyne, who was poſted with an intention to obſtruct them in their paſſage, lay in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and within view of a detached camp, compoſed of a conſiderable body of the enemy's cavalry, which lay near a village called Villa Velha. As he obſerved that the enemy kept no very ſoldierly guard in this poſt, and were uncovered both in their rear and their flanks, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a deſign of falling on them by ſurprize. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his deſign was entruſted to his friend Colonel Lee, who, in the night of October 8th, fell upon their rear, turned their camp, made a conſiderable ſlaughter, diſperſed the whole party, deſtroyed their magazines, and returned with ſcarce any loſs.</p>
            <p>When a general concluſion was at length put to the war, he returned to England from Portugal, after having received the thanks of his Portugueſe Majeſty for his ſervices; and Count La Lippe recommended him in the ſtrongeſt terms to the Engliſh Court. He had, at this period, a friend and patron in high office, one of the principal Secretaries <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> State; ſo that there was every reaſon for him to have expected promotion in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh army. But here his attachment, his enthuſiaſm for America, interfered, and prevented. The great Indian, or what we called Pondiacks War, broke out, which the miniſterial agents thought their intereſt to repreſent as a matter of no conſequence. The friends of America thought the reverſe, and aſſerted it would be attended with dreadful waſte, ravage, and deſolation. This brought him once more to publiſh for the defence and protection of this country, by which he loſt the favour of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſhut the door to all hopes of preferment in the Engliſh army. But he could not live in idleneſs and inactivity: he left his native country, and entered into the Poliſh ſervice, and was of courſe abſent when the ſtamp act paſſed; but although abſent, he did not ceaſe labouring in the cauſe of America, as may be learned from many of his letters. He uſed every argument, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024456_0011_0FC7349945CE0DB0"/>
exerted all the abilities he was maſter of, with every correſpondent he had, in either Houſe of Parliament, of any weight or influence; and at the ſame time, he had not an inconſiderable number in both.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved, that this famous act had divided almoſt every court in Europe into two different parties: the one, aſſertors of the prerogative of the Britiſh Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; the other, of the rights and privileges of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. General Lee, on this occaſion, pleaded the cauſe of the Colonies with ſuch earneſtneſs as almoſt to break off all intercourſe with the King's miniſters at the Court of Vienna, men that he perſonally loved and eſteemed; but, at the ſame time, it was thought that he pleaded with ſo much ſucceſs as to add not a few friends and partizans to America. Theſe circumſtances are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. as they ſerve to demonſtrate that a zeal for the welfare of the Colonies, from the General's earlieſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them, had been a ruling principle of his life. The preſent volumes will teſtify what he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, what he did, and what he hazarded, in the laſt and moſt important conteſt which ſeparated the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from their parent ſtate:—but there is one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that ſeems to claim a particular attention; which is, that of all the officers who embarked in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſervice, he was the only man who could acquire no additional rank, and perhaps the only one whoſe fortune could not have been impaired, or at leaſt the tenure by which it was held, changed from its former condition into a precarious and arbitrary one, by the ſucceſs of the Britiſh miniſtry's ſchemes; for, had they been complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the full extent of their wiſhes, the condition of his fortune had not been altered for the worſe: his fortune, though not great, was eaſy, and, it may be ſaid, affluent, for a private gentleman; a detail of which the editor is enabled to collect from his papers.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The General had four hundred and eighty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> on a mortgage in Jamaica, paid punctually.</p>
            <p n="1">2dly. An eſtate of two hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> in Middleſex, for another gentleman's life; but whoſe life he had inſured againſt his own.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:024456_0012_0FC7349AC05B1468"/>3dly. A thouſand pounds on a turnpike in England, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> four <hi>per cent.</hi> intereſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. One thouſand five hundred pounds, at five <hi>per cent..</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. His half-pay, one hundred and thirty-ſix pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> in all, nine hundred and thirty-one pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> clear income: beſides this, about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, pounds in his agent's hands, and different debts.— He had, likewiſe, ten thouſand acres of land in the iſland of St. John, which had been located and ſettled at the expence of ſeven hundred pounds; and a mandamus for twenty thouſand acres in Eaſt Florida.</p>
            <p>This is the ſtate of the General's fortune when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the late American conteſt; and this fortune would have been totally unaffected though the prerogative of taxing America without her conſent had been eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and confirmed: the full poſſeſſion of it was ſecure, and independent of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>te. But theſe conſiderations did not influence his mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he gave up ſecurity for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecurity, certainty for uncertainty; he threw into the lap of America, without any chance of winning; he ſtaked all on the die of her fortune: if ſhe ſucceeded, he could not be bettered; if ſhe miſcarried, his whole was loſt. His rank, as before obſerved, acquired no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the contrary, for a ſtop was put to its progreſs in the two other ſervices, the Poliſh and the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>The General, who could never ſtay long in one place, during the years 1771, 1772, to the fall pf 1773, had rambled all over Europe; but we can collect nothing material relative to the adventures of his travels, as his memorandum-books only mention the names of the towns and cities through which he paſſed. That he was a moſt rapid and very active traveller, is evident: it appears alſo, that he was engaged with an officer in Italy in an affair of honour, by which he loſt the uſe of two of his fingers; but having recourſe to piſtols, the Italian was ſlain, and he immediately obliged to fly for his life. His warmth of temper drew him into many rencounters of this kind; in all which he acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted himſelf with ſingular courage,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024456_0013_0FC7349CAE3E8810"/>
ſpringhtlineſs of imagination, and great preſence of mind.</p>
            <p>Much diſſatisfied with the appearance of the political horizen at London, on the 16th of Auguſt 1773, he embarked on board the packet for New-York, where he arrived on the 10th of November following, and had a very ſevere fit of the gout. At this period, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between Great Britain and her Colonies began to be ſerious; and the General concerted a deſign of taking a part in favour of America, in caſe it came to an open rupture.</p>
            <p>The deſtruction of the Britiſh Eaſt-India company's tea at Boſton, the 16th of December, was a prelude to the calamities that afterwards enſued. At this criſis, General Lee's mind was not inobſervant or inactive his converſation, his pen, animated die coloniſts to a great degree, and perſuaded them to make a perſevering reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>During this winter, he viſited Philadelphia, Williamſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and ſeveral other places in Virginia and Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and returned to Philadelphia, a few months before the firſt Congreſs met in that city, on the 5th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. Encouraging and obſerving what was going forward here, he then paid a viſit to New-York, Rhode-Iſland, and Boſton, where he arrived on the 1ſt of Auguſt 1774. The moſt active political characters on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican theatre, now hailed him, and were happy in his acquaintance, not a little pleaſed with his ſanguine, lively temper; conſidering his preſence among them at this criſis, as a moſt fortunate and propitious omen. General Gage had now iſſued his proclamation; and though Lee was on half-pay in the Britiſh ſervice, it did not prevent him from expreſſing his ſentiments in terms of the moſt pointed ſeverity againſt the miniſtry. In ſhort, he blazed forth a Whig of the firſt magnitude, and communicated a portion of his ſpirit to all with whom he converſed.— As he continued travelling, or rather flying from place to place, he became known to all who diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this important oppoſition: his company and correſpondence were co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ed, and many occaſional poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024456_0014_0FC734A268CC2720"/>
pieces, the production of his pen, were eagerly read, and much admired; and from this popularity, there is no reaſon to doubt but he expected he ſhould ſoon become the firſt in military rank on this Continent.</p>
            <p>General Gates was ſettled on a plantation in Berkley county, Virginia; and having a great friendſhip for Lee, perſuaded him to purchaſe front a Mr. Hite, a very fine valuable tract of land in his neighbourhood, of about two thouſand ſeven hundred acres, on which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good improvements.</p>
            <p>On this buſineſs, he left his friends, in the Northern States, and returned to Virginia, where he remained till the month of May 1775, when he again preſented himſelf at Philadelphia. The American Congreſs were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and he became daily a greater enthuſiaſt in the cauſe of liberty. The battle of Lexington, and ſome other matters, had now ripened the conteſt; and Lee's active and interpriſing diſpoſition was ready for the moſt arduous purpoſes. He therefore accepted a commiſſion from the Congreſs, which was offered to him by ſome of its principal members; but he found it neceſſary previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to reſign that which he held in the Britiſh ſervice. This he did without delay, in a letter tranſmitted to the Right Honourable Lord Viſcount Barrington, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Secretary at war; aſſuring his Lordſhip, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had renounced his half-pay, yet, whenever it ſhould pleaſe his Majeſty to call him forth to any honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice againſt the natural hereditary enemies of his country, or in defence of his moſt juſt rights and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no man would obey the righteous ſummons with more zeal and alacrity than himſelf: at the ſame time, the General expreſſed his diſapprobation of the preſent meaſures, in the moſt direct terms; declaring them to be "ſo abſolutely ſubverſive of the rights and liberties of every individual ſubject, ſo deſtructive to the whole empire at large, and ultimately ſo ruinous to his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's own perſon, dignity, and family, that he thought himſelf obliged in conſcience, as a citizen, Engliſhman; and a ſoldier of a free State, to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t his utmoſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat them."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024456_0015_0FC734A498A55F38"/>Profeſſing theſe ſentiments, he received a Continental commiſſion of the rank of Major General. As he had made war his ſtudy from his youth, ſeen a variety of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf for his courage and abilities, one might have imagined he would have immediately been appointed ſecond in command in the American ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: this was not the caſe; in all countries, kiſſing goes by favour; and men will be tenacious of any rank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them. General Ward, of Maſſachuſetts Bay, by ſome means or other, had received a commiſſion of prior date; and on this account, perhaps to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſervice, he took rank of General Lee, who was at preſent content to act under him. Whatever his feelings were on this head, he took care to diſguiſe them; and General Ward, on the evacuation of Boſton, grew weary or military honour and ſervice, retired to private life, and ſent his reſignation to Congreſs.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt of June, General Waſhington and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lee, having received their orders from Congreſs, left Philadelphia, in order to join the troops aſſembled near Boſton. They were accompanied out of the city, for ſome miles, by a troop of light horſe, and by all the officers of the city militia, on horſeback; and at this time General Lee was accounted, and really was, a great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition to the American cauſe. On the road they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the news of the affair at Bunker's-hill, and arrived at the camp at Cambridge the 2d of July 1775. The people of Maſſachuſetts received them with every teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of eſteem; and the Congreſs of that Colony not only preſented an addreſs to his Excellency General Waſhington, as commander in chief, but, from a ſenſe of the military abilities of General Lee, preſented one to him alſo, couched in terms of the higheſt reſpect. The General remained with this army till the year 1776, when General Waſhington, having obtained intelligence of the fitting out of a fleet at Boſton, and of the embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of troops from thence, which, from the ſeaſon of the year, and other circumſtances, he judged muſt be deſtined for a Southern expedition, gave orders to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024456_0016_0FC734A84582D7C8"/>
Lee, to repair, with ſuch volunteers as were willing to join him, and could be expeditiouſly raiſed, to the city of New-York, with a deſign to prevent the Engliſh from taking poſſeſſion of New-York and the North-River, as they would thereby command the country, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with Canada. The General, on his arrival, began with putting the city in the beſt poſture of defence the ſeaſon of the year and circumſtances would admit of; diſarming all ſuch perſons upon Long-Iſland, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, whoſe conduct and declarations had rendered them ſuſpected of deſigns unfriendly to the views of Congreſs. Colonel Ward was ordered to ſecure the whole body of profeſſed Tories in Long-Iſland. This gave an univerſal alarm, that even the Congreſs of New-York endeavoured to check the General in this buſineſs, by informing him, in a letter, that the trial and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of citizens belonged to the Provincial Congreſs, and not to any military character, however exalted. To this the General anſwered, that when the enemy was at the doors, forms muſt be diſpenſed with—that his duty to them, to the Continental Congreſs, and to his own conſcience, had dictated the neceſſity of the meaſure— that if he had done wrong, he would ſubmit himſelf to the ſhame of being reputed raſh and precipitate, and undergo the cenſure of the public; but he ſhould have the conſciouſneſs of his own breaſt, that the pure motives of ſerving the community, uncontaminated by pique or reſentment to individuals, urged him to the ſtep. The General alſo remonſtrated againſt ſupplying th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> men of war and Governor Tryon with proviſions, as the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ats coming to the city muſt open the means of their receiving every ſort of intelligence. "I ſhould," ſays the General in one of his letters, "be in the higheſt degree culpable to God, my conſcience, and the Continental Congreſs, in whoſe ſervice I am engaged, ſhould I ſuffer, at ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a criſis, a banditti of profeſſed foes of liberty and their country to remain at liberty to co-operate with, and ſtrengthen the miniſterial troops openly in arms, or covertly, and conſequently more dangerouſly furniſh them
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024456_0017_0FC734AACF646248"/>
with intelligence." He alſo drew up a <hi>Teſt,</hi> which he ordered his officers to offer to thoſe who were reputed inimical to the American cauſe: a refuſal to take this, was to be conſtrued as no more or leſs than an avowal of their hoſtile intentions: upon which, their perſons were to be ſecured, and ſent to Connecticut, were it was judged they could not be ſo dangerous. Thus the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral excited the people to every ſpirited meaſure, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated by every means the friends to the Engliſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. At this time, Captain Vandeput, of the Aſia, ſeized a Lieutenant Tiley, and kept him on board his ſhip in irons. On the principles of retaliation, Lee took into cuſtody Mr. Stephens, an officer of Government, and informed the Captain what he had done, and that this gentleman ſhould not be releaſed until Lieut. Tiley was returned. This had the deſired effect. His determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deciſive diſpoſition had an amazing influence both on the army and people; and the ſteps he propoſed for the management of thoſe who diſapproved of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican reſiſtance, ſtruck a terror wherever he appeared.</p>
            <p>Congreſs had now received the account of General Montgomery's unſucceſsful expedition againſt Quebec. As flattering expectations were entertained of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this officer, the event threw a gloom on American affairs. To remedy this diſaſter, they turned their eyes to General Lee, and Congreſs reſolved that he ſhould forthwith repair to Canada, and take upon him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army of the United Colonies in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. This, though he was juſt recovered from a fit of the gout, he accepted; but while preparations were making for the important undertaking, Congreſs changed their determination, and appointed him to the command of the Southern department; in which he became very conſpicuous, as a vigilant, brave and active officer. His extenſive correſpondence, his addreſs under every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and his unwearied attention to the duties of his ſtation, all evinced his great military capacity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme uſeful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him by the people of the Northern Colonies, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a ſimilar treatment in his journey to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. On his arrival at Williamſburgh, every one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their high ſatisfaction at his preſence among them; and the troops of that city embraced the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of preſenting him with an addreſs, expreſſive of their ſanguine hopes and firm reſolutions of uniting with him in the common cauſe. This example was followed at Newbern, North-Carolina; and a committee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the inhabitants of that town, to wait upon him in their name, and, in an addreſs, to thank him for his generous and manly exertions in defence of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can rights and liberties; and to offer him their cordial congratulations for his appearance among them, at a time when their province was actually invaded by a powerful fleet and army; and to expreſs their happineſs to find the command of the troops deſtined for their protection, placed in the hands of a gentleman of his diſtinguiſhed character.</p>
            <p>Great too was the joy in South Carolina, were his preſence was ſeaſonable and abſolutely neceſſary, as Sir Henry Clinton was actually preparing for an invaſion of that province. The minds of all ranks of people were conſiderably elevated at the ſight of him; it diffuſed an ardour among the military, attended with the moſt ſalutary conſequences; and his diligence and activity at Charleſton, previous to the attack upon Sullivan's iſland, will be long remembered. From a peruſal of his letters and directions to the officers commanding at that poſt, we may juſtly infer, that America was under no ſmall obligations to him for the ſignal ſucceſs there obtained.—And here it may be mentioned, as ſomewhat remarkable, that when General Lee received orders, at Cambridge, to repair to New-York, to watch the motions of the Britiſh, he met General Clinton the very day he arrived there;—when he came to Virginia, he found him in Hampton Road—and juſt after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in North Carolina, General Clinton left Cape Fear —Their next meeting was at Fort Sullivan, which muſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024456_0019_0FC734B20FF714F8"/>
have made Lee appear to Clinton as his evil genius, haunting him for more than eleven hundred miles, along a coaſt of vaſt extent, and meeting him at Philippi.</p>
            <p>The affair of Sullivan's iſland was a moſt extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deliverance; for if the Engliſh had ſucceeded, it is more than probable the Southern Colonies would at that time have been compelled to have ſubmitted to the Engliſh government. Dreadful was the cannonade, but without effect. Porto Bello, Boccochico, and the other caſtle at Carthagena, were obliged to ſtrike to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; Fort Lewis in Saint Domingo yielded to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of Admiral Knowles; but in this inſtance, an unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed battery, conſtructed with Palmeto logs, reſiſted, for a whole day, the twelve and eighteen-pounders of the Britiſh fleet, to the aſtoniſhment and admiration of every ſpectator.</p>
            <p>The fleet and army under Sir Henry Clinton and Sir Peter Parker being repulſed, General Lee then flew to the aſſiſtance of Georgia, where he continued for ſome weeks, planning ſchemes to put that province in a ſtate of defence, and to make an excurſion into Eaſt Florida, as their Southern frontiers were ſuffering conſiderably by the incurſions of Indians and others from that quarter.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Congreſs were informed by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington, that Clinton, with the troops under his command, had returned, and joined General Howe at Staten-iſland. In conſequence of this intelligence, the Congreſs were convinced that the Engliſh, by collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their whole force into a point, were determined to make a moſt vigorous exertion at New-York; and in order to enſure ſucceſs there, were diſpoſed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to overlook every other object. The getting poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that city, and the junction of the two armies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der General Howe and Burgoyne, it was the Congreſs's opinion, were the grand objects they had in view, and for the attainment of which they would give up every inferior conſideration. Lee's ſucceſs in the Southern department had increaſed the good opinion they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him: his reputation was in its zenith; and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024456_0020_0FC734B3ACFA9278"/>
they now applied to him for aſſiſtance, in the preſent important ſituation of their affairs. An expreſs was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to Georgia, directing him to repair as ſoon as poſſible to Philadelphia, there to receive ſuch orders as they might judge expedient. He returned with great expedition, the beginning of October, and waited on Congreſs immediately on his arrival, who, after conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, reſolved that he ſhould without delay repair to the camp at Haerlem, with leave, if he ſhould judge proper, to viſit the poſts in New-Jerſey.</p>
            <p>He arrived at General Waſhington's army juſt time enough to prevent it from being blockaded in York-iſland, the circumſtance of which had been thus related. General Waſhington was at that time under a neceſſity of conſulting his council of officers, before he could take any ſtep of conſequence; and they, contrary to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, were for waiting an attack in their own lines on York-iſland—Extenſive barracks had been erected, and large preparations made for ſuch a ſtep. Sir William Howe, finding the Americans too ſtrong to be attacked with ſafety from the ſide of New-York, leaving Lord Piercy with a body of troops oppoſite the river, embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſt in his flat boats, paſſed ſafely the dangerous paſſage of Hell-Gate, and landed on Frog's Neck, an iſland ſeparated by a ſmall creek from Weſt Cheſter. Here he remained a week, under a pretence of waiting for ſtores and proviſions; while the Americans, in conſequence of their reſolutions, continued on the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The very evening before General Howe made a movement, General Lee arrived at General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's camp; <hi>his opinion</hi> of their dangerous ſituation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the council of war; and, that night, a precipitate movement extricated them from the danger. The next morning, General Howe landed on Pell's Manor, a point ſeparated from Frog's Neck by a channel of ſcarce 200 yards: he then extended his army acroſs to Hudſon's-river; but there was then no enemy to intercept. Had he, inſtead of trifling away his time, crammed up on Frog's Neck, landed only on Pell's Point, not a ſoul of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024456_0021_0FC734B5B95D8048"/>
the American army would have eſcaped. Hitherto Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lee had been ſucceſsful, and was univerſally eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but fortune now began to reverſe the ſcene. On the 13th of December 1776, at the head of all the men he could collect, he was marching to join General Waſhington, who had aſſembled the Pennſylvania militia, to ſecure the banks of the Delaware.—From the diſtance of the Britiſh cantonment, he was betrayed into a fatal ſecurity, by which, in croſſing the upper part of New-Jerſey from the North river, he fixed his quarters, and by careleſsly guarded at ſome diſtance from the main body. This circumſtance being communicated to Colonel Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, who commanded the Britiſh light horſe, and had then made a deſultory excurſion at the head of a ſmall detachment, he conducted his meaſures with ſuch addreſs and activity, that Lee was carried off, though ſeveral guarded poſts and armed patroles lay in the way. Great was the joy of the Britiſh, and equal the conſternation of the Americans, at this unexpected event. The mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſingle officer priſoner, in other circumſtances, would have been a matter of little moment; but in the preſent ſtate of the continental forces, where a general deficiency of the military ſkill prevailed, and the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the officers was even a greater grievance, the loſs of a commander whoſe ſpirit of enterprize was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by great knowledge in his profeſſion, acquire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by actual ſervice, was indeed of the utmoſt importance. The Congreſs, on hearing this news, ordered their Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to write to General Waſhington, deſiring him to ſend a flag to General Howe, for the purpoſe of enquiring in what manner General Lee was treated; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

particularly obnoxious to Government, it was ſaid that General Howe was tied down by his inſtructions, from parting with him upon any terms, if the fortune of war ſhould throw him into his power. General Waſhington not having at this time any priſoners of equal rank with Lee, propoſed to exchange ſix field officers for him, the number being intended to balance that diſparity; or if this was not accepted, he required that he ſhould be treated ſuitably to his ſtation, according to the practice eſtabliſhed among poliſhed nations, till an opportunity offered for a direct and equal exchange. To this it was anſwered, that as Mr. Lee was a deſerter from his Majeſty's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he was not to be conſidered as a priſoner of war; that he did not at all come within the conditions of the cartel, nor could he receive any of its benefits. This brought on a fruitleſs diſcuſſion, whether General Lee, who had reſigned his half-pay at the beginning of the troubles, could be conſidered as a deſerter; or whether he could with juſtice be excluded from the general bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of a cartel, in which no particular exception of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been made. In the mean time, General Lee was guarded with all the ſtrictneſs which a State crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the firſt magnitude could have experienced in the moſt dangerous political conjuncture. This conduct not only ſuſpended the operation of the cartel, but induced retaliation on the American ſide; and Colonel Campbell, who had hitherto been treated with great humanity by the people of Boſton, was now thrown into a dungeon.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Britiſh officers who were priſoners in the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Colonies, though not treated with equal rigour, were, however, abridged of their parole liberty. It was at the ſame time declared, that their future treatment ſhould in every degree be regulated by that which General Lee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, and that their perſons ſhould be anſwerable, in the utmoſt extent, for any violence that was offered to him. Thus m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tters continued till the capture of the Britiſh army under General Burgoyne at Saratoga, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 17th, 1777. A change of conduct towards him then took place; he was allowed his parole in New-York,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024456_0023_0FC734BB0360E9F8"/>
lodged in the ſame houſe with Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Butler of the 38th, dined with General Robertſon commandant of the town, and with many principal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and families, and a ſhort time after was exchanged.</p>
            <p>The firſt military ſcene in which General Lee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared after his liberation, was the battle of Monmouth, which determined his career in the American army. Before this affair, his character in general was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable; many of the warm friends of America, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued the important ſervices he had rendered to the United States.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of the conteſt, he had excited and directed the military ſpirit which pervaded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; his converſation raiſed an emulation among the officers, and he taught them to pay a proper attention to the health, cloathing, and comfortable ſubſiſtence of their men: add to this, his zeal was unwearied in incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the principles of liberty among all ranks of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; hence it is ſaid, that a ſtrong party was formed in Congreſs, and by ſome diſcontented officers in the army, to raiſe Lee to the firſt command; and it hath been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by many, that General Lee's conduct at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Monmouth, was intended to effect this plan; for, could the odium of the defeat have been at that time thrown on General Waſhington, and his attack of the Britiſh army made to appear raſh and imprudent, there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe he would have been deprived of his command. It hath been obſerved by ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on this ſubject, that when General Lee was taken priſoner, the American army was on no par with the Royal forces; but the caſe was much changed on his return from his captivity. He found them improved, and daring enough to attack even the Britiſh grenadiers with firmneſs and reſolution. Had not this been the caſe, and General Lee, when ordered to attack the rear of the Royal army, ſeen his men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> back with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, unwilling to rally, and acting with fear and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidation, his retreat would have been neceſſary, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct crowned with applauſe, and his purpoſes effected;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024456_0024_0FC734BF5548A390"/>
but, diſappointed in this view, the retreat hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to himſelf, as he could not alledge the want of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in his troops for the juſtification of his conduct.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh army, early on Thurſday the 25th of June, compleated their evacuation of Philadelphia, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before tranſported their ſtores and moſt of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery into the Jerſies, where they had thrown up ſome works, and ſeveral regiments were encamped;—they manned the lines the preceding night, and retreated over the commons, croſſing at Glouceſter Point. A party of the American horſe purſued them very cloſe; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever nothing very material happened till the 28th, when, about three o'clock in the morning, the Britiſh army moved on their way to Middletown Point. About eleven o'clock, the American van, commanded by General Lee, overtook them; but he ſoon retreated, and was met by General Waſhington, who formed on the firſt proper piece of ground near Monmouth Court-Houſe. While this was doing, two pieces of cannon, ſupported by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Livingſton and Colonel Stewart, with a picked corps of 300 men, kept off the main body of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and made a great ſlaughter. Very ſevere ſkirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enſued; and the American army advancing, the Britiſh made their laſt efforts upon a ſmall body of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania troops at and about Mr. Tennant's houſe; they then gave way, leaving the field covered with dead and wounded. General Waſhington's troops purſued for about a mile, when, night coming on, and the men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fatigued with marching, and the hot weather, they halted about half a mile beyond the ground of the principal action.—The Britiſh took a ſtrong poſt in their front, ſecured on both flanks by moraſſes and thick woods, where they remained until about twelve at night, and then retreated. In conſequence of this action, General Lee was put under arreſt, and tried by a Court Martial at Brunſwick, the 4th July following. The charges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited againſt him were,</p>

                  <p>FROM the knowledge I have of your Excellency's character, I muſt conclude, that nothing but the miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſome very ſtupid, or miſrepreſentation of ſome very wicked perſon, could have occaſioned your making uſe of ſuch very ſingular expreſſions as you did, on my coming up to the ground where you had taken poſt: they implied, that I was guilty either of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of orders, want of conduct, or want of courage. Your excellency will therefore infinitely oblige me, by letting me know, on which of theſe three articles you ground your charge, that I may prepare for my juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which I have the happineſs to be confident I can do, to the Army, to the Congreſs, to America, and to the World in general. Your Excellency muſt give me leave to obſerve, that neither yourſelf, nor thoſe about your perſon, could, from your ſituation, be in the leaſt judges of the merits or demerits of our manoeuvres; and to ſpeak with a becoming pride, I can aſſert, that to theſe manoeuvres the ſucceſs of the day was entirely owing. I can boldly ſay, that had we remained on the firſt ground, or had we advanced, or had the retreat been conducted in a manner different from what it was, this whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the intereſts of America, would have riſked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrificed. I ever had, and I hope ever ſhall have, the greateſt reſpect and veneration for General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington; I think him endued with many great and good qualities: But in this inſtance, I muſt pronounce, that he has been guilty of an act of cruel injuſtice, towards a man who had certainly ſome pretenſions to the regard

                  <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing my letter by Colonel Fitzgerald to your Excellency, I have reflected on both your ſituation and mine; and beg leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it will be for our mutual convenience, that a Court of Inquiry ſhould be immediately ordered; but I could wiſh it might be a Court Martial: for, if the affair

is drawn into length, it may be difficult to collect the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary evidences, and perhaps might bring on a paper-war betwixt the adherents to both parties, which may occaſion ſome diſagreeable feuds on the Continent; for all are not my friends, nor your admirers.</p>
                  <p>I muſt entreat, therefore, from your love of juſtice, that you will immediately exhibit your charge; and that on the firſt halt, I may be brought to a trial.</p>

            <p>THE Court met, by ſeveral adjournments, till the 12th of Auguſt, when they found the unfortunate Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral guilty of the ſeveral charges brought againſt him, and ſentenced him to be ſuſpended from any commiſſion in the armies of the United States of North America for the term of twelve months. But it was uſual in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, and thought neceſſary, that the ſentence of every Court Martial ſhould be ratified or confirmed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; the proceedings, therefore, of the Court, were accordingly tranſmitted to them, and the General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Philadelphia to await their deciſion. During his ſtay there on this buſineſs, he was involved in ſeveral diſputes; and though his affair might be conſidered as yet <hi>ſub judice,</hi> yet the converſation of the city was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt him, which induced him to publiſh, as it were, a ſecond defence; and as this may not be ſo well known to the public as the elegant and maſterly defence in his trial, which hath been republiſhed in Europe, I ſhall inſert it in this place.</p>

                        <p>THE different commentators on the orders I received from General Waſhington, on the 28th of June, have, I think, conſtrued them into no more than three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſenſes. I ſhall, therefore, for argument's ſake, give the world leave to ſuppoſe them to have been any one of theſe three:<note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt appear ſomewhat extraordinary, that when the principal and heavieſt charge brought againſt me, was the diſobedience of orders, theſe orders, that it ſeems I diſobeyed, ſhould never have been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be aſcertained to the Court by the proper authority, but were left to the conjecture and wild conſtructions of thoſe who might take the trouble to gueſs, and to the hardineſs of thoſe who might chuſe to invent.</note>—1ſt. To attack the enemy in whatever ſituation, and in whatever force I found them, without conſidering conſequences.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To contrive the means of bringing on a general engagement.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To annoy them as much as poſſible, without riſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of great importance; that is, in fact, to act with a great degree of latitude, according to my own diſcretion.</p>
                        <p>Now, I ſay, granting any one of thoſe three to have been the orders I received, it is manifeſt, that I did li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally and effectually comply, as far as depended on myſelf, and on human means. As to the firſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the attempt, by a low evaſion, to prove that the orders I gave were only to <hi>advance</hi> on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it is clear from Captain Mercer's evidence, that General Wayne and Colonel Butler were ordered, not only to advance, but in preciſe terms to attack;—it is clear, that I did, with the three brigadiers on the right, make the only movement poſſible to accompliſh this end; it is clear that I did not wiſh, or give any orders for a retrograde manoeuvre from the firſt point of action, and that, even when I was informed of our left being abandoned, the retreat, however neceſſary, was, I am aſhamed to own it, done contrary to my orders, and contrary to my intentions. I ſay I am aſhamed to own it; for if the Britiſh cavalry had vigorouſly puſhed on
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024456_0030_0FC734D17900CDD0"/>
our right, they might have turned our flank, taken us in reverſe, and we had been loſt. There is one ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and indeed only one (and that, for the General's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is too monſtrous to be admitted) that would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me criminal; it is, that he had poſitively command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that after the attack commenced, whatever were my circumſtances, or whatever were my numbers, from thence I ſhould not, from any conſideration, recede an inch. Now, if ſuch I had conceived to have been his intention, ſo great is my opinion of the valour, zeal, and obedience of the troops, and ſo well I think I know my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that I do really believe we ſhould all have periſhed on the firſt ſpot; but I never had, and it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible I ſhould have an idea that ſuch was his plan; and it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I muſt here beg leave to obſerve, that thoſe gentlemen who talk ſo familiarly of bringing on a general engagement, muſt underſtand themſelves as little as they can be underſtood by others: —to bring on a general engagement, is not always in our power. An enemy of any capacity will take ſuch meaſures as not to be under the neceſſity of fighting againſt his inclinations; and, however it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, I cannot help being perſuaded, that ſome of the Britiſh generals are not deficient in this great eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential. Clinton, Grey, and Erſkine, were bred up, and conſidered no deſpicable officers in one of the beſt ſchools in Europe. Prince Ferdinand and his nephew, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riditary prince, think, it is ſaid, and do moſt certainly
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024456_0031_0FC734D81751F0B0"/>
ſpeak very honourably of them. Now, although it muſt be ſuppoſed that men of this ſtamp will make it a rule to retain the power of refuſing a general engagement, there are ſtrong grounds for believing, that on this day (whether from our manoeuvres, or from the often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable impetuoſity of the Britiſh troops) they would have been put under the neceſſity of committing the moſt conſiderable part of their army to the deciſion of arms, if the opportunity on our ſide had been availed of. They were tempted to paſs three of the great ravines winch traverſe the plain; and there is room to flatter ourſelves they would have paſſed the laſt, if they had been wiſely ſuffered. They would then have been actually in our power; that is, they would have been under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of fighting againſt unequal force; for they had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the poſſibility of retreating, and it was at our option to engage whatever part of the army we thought proper, whether the whole, one half, or only a third, as they had immediately emerged from the ravine, and before they could have had time to develop and form; our rear was, on the contrary, quite clear and unembarraſſed, and were, in fact, entire maſters of our manoeuvres; at the ſame time, Colonel Morgan, and the militia on the flanks, by this ſeparation of the major part of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's army to ſo great a diſtance from their baggage, and the body covering the baggage, would have had a much fairer apportunity of making their reſpective attacks, than if they had remained more compact: thus, if any thing is meant by finding the means of bringing on a general engagement, it was done, and in the moſt ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary manner, to the utmoſt extent of human poſſibility.</p>
                        <p>We come now to the laſt ſuppoſition, viz. That the orders I received (which in fact is the truth, unleſs they they had no meaning at all) were to annoy the enemy, ſtrike a partial blow, but without riſking any thing of great importance; or in other terms, to act in a great meaſure diſcretionally.<note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt be remarked, that diſobedience to diſcretionary orders is, <hi>prima facie,</hi> a glaring abſurdity; it is an impoſſibility; and yet it has been endeavoured to prove me guilty of this impoſſibility,</note> And here I defy the moſt acute
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024456_0032_0FC734D9C0F61FD0"/>
military critic of the world, to point out a more effectual method than what was purſued; for, had we taken poſt on the hither or weſtern margin of the firſt ravine, as General Wayne ſeems to think we ought to have done, (and admitting that in this poſition our flanks could have been ſecure, which they certainly were not) or on the margin of any of the other ravines in our rear, the laſt not excepted, if the laſt had been tenable, how could we poſſibly have annoyed the enemy, or ſtruck a partial blow? The conſequence would at moſt have been this, that we might have remained gazing on and cannonad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other for ſome time, and the moment they choſe to retire, they could have done it at their leiſure, and with impunity; for, by all the rules of war, and what is more, by all the rules of common ſenſe, we could not have ventured to purſue them, becauſe we ſhould have put, if not impracticable, at leaſt very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, defiles in our rear; and if they had turned back upon us, we ſhould have been effectually in their power, unleſs we could have inſured victory to ourſelves with very unequal numbers; but by drawing them over all the ravines, they were as much in our power; beſides, it muſt occur to every man who is not deſtitute of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, that the further they were from their ſhips and the heights of Middletown, the point of their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the more they were (to uſe the military language) in the air.</p>
                        <p>To theſe conſiderations may be added, that the ground we found them on, was extremely favourable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their troops; and that we drew them into, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to ours. The ground we found them on, was calculated for cavalry, in which they comparatively abounded; and that which we drew them into, as much the reverſe. In fine, admitting that the order I received was any one of the three referred to, and ſuppoſing we had been as perfectly acquainted with every yard of the country as we were utterly ignorant of it, I am happy to be able conſciouſly to pronounce, that were the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that day to paſs over again, there is no one ſtep

I took which I would not again take. There is no one thing I did which does not demonſtrate that I conducted myſelf as an obedient, prudent, and, let me add, ſpirited officer;<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſtyle, on ordinary occaſions, would appear a moſt intolerable and diſguſting gaſconade; but when a man's conduct has been ſo groſsly miſrepreſented and calumniated, as mine has been, the ſtrongeſt language is juſtifiable in his defence.</note> and I do from my ſoul ſincerely wiſh that a court of inquiry, compoſed of the ableſt ſoldiers in the world, were to ſit in judgment, and enjoined to canvas with the utmoſt rigour every circumſtance of my conduct on this day, and on their deciſion my reputation or infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be for ever eſtabliſhed. There is, however, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe (but for this omiſſion I am no ways reſponſible) that, had a proper knowledge of the theatre of action been obtained, as it might, and ought to have been, its nature and different ſituations, with there references ſtudied, and, in conſequence, a general plan of action wiſely concerted and digeſted, a moſt important, perhaps a deciſive blow might have been ſtruck, but not by adopting any one meaſure that any one of my cenſurers has been fortunate enough to think of. I have already ſaid, that had we remained on the ground where the attack commenced, or on the margin of the firſt ravine, which General Wayne ſeems to think was a good poſition, we ſhould probably have been loſt; and I believe I may ſafely aſſert that had we attached our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſecond poſition, in front of Carr's houſe, reconnoitred by Monſ. Du Portail, on the hill which Colonel Hamilton was ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favour of, and allowing our flanks to be ſecure in any of theſe poſitions, which it is evident they were not, ſecurity is the only thing we could have had to boaſt of. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the enemy would have been equally great; but any poſſibility of annoying them we certainly had not I aſſert, then, that if we had acted wiſely, it was our buſineſs to let one, two, or three thouſand paſs the laſt ravine, in the rear of which, and on the eminence pointed out to me by Mr. Wikoff, and to General Waſhington by

Colonel Ray,<note n="*" place="bottom">To theſe two gentlemen not a little credit for the ſucceſs of the 28th of June is due.</note> the main body of our army was poſted, freſh and unfatigued; whereas thoſe of the enemy were extremely haraſſed, or, indeed, worn down to ſo low a degree of debility, that had they once paſſed, they had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle chance of repaſſing; the ground was commanding, and, to us, in all reſpects advantageous. A fort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural glacis, extending itſelf in our front, from the creſt of the eminence quite down to the ravine, over which there was only one narrowed paſs, the plain ſo narrowed as to give no play to the manoeuvres of their cavalry; and at two or three hundred yards diſtance in the rear, a ſpace of ground moſt happily adapted to the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſecond line.<note n="‡" place="bottom">It may be objected, that a part of my detachment there, under Scott and Maxwell, had already filed off in the rear, but they might eaſily have been brought up. It is evident they might, as not long afterwards a part of them were ordered, and did march up. It muſt be obſerved, that I myſelf was totally ignorant that any part of them had filed off; but thoſe I had with me would have formed a very reſpectable line of reſerve.</note> This ground, from the nature of its front, is almoſt entirely protected from the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the enemy's cannon; and, of courſe, well calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the reſpiration of a body of troops, ſuch as my detachment was, fatigued, but not diſpirited by action, and the exceſſive heat of the weather; here they might have taken breath; here they might have been refreſhed, and, in a very ſhort time, refitted at leaſt to act as a line of ſupport, which was all that in theſe circumſtances, could be neceſſary. I propoſed to the General to form them as ſuch, but was precipitately ordered, and, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, in a manner that extremely ruffled me, to three miles diſtance in the rear.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in my opinion, was a moſt glorious opportunity loſt; for what followed on both ſides was only a diſtant, unmeaning, inefficacious canonnade; and what has been ſo magnificently ſtiled a purſuit, was no more than tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the ground which the Britiſh troops could not poſſibly, and were not (their principle being retreat) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted to maintain.</p>

                              <label>P. S.</label> A thouſand wicked and low artifices, during my tryal, were uſed to render me unpopular. One of the principal was, to throw out that I had endeavoured, on every occaſion, to depreciate the American valour, and the character of their troops. There never was a more impudent falſehood; I appeal to my letters addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Mr. Burgoyne—to the whole tenor of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, both previous and ſubſequent to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the preſent war, and to all my publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is true, I have often heavily lamented, as to me it appears, the defective conſtitution of the army; but I have ever had the higheſt opinion of the courage and other good qualities of the Americans as ſoldiers; and the proofs that my opinion was juſt, are numerous and ſubſtantial.</p>
                           <p>To begin with the affair of Bunker's hill, I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to pronounce that there never was a more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a more execrable ſituation, than theſe brave and unfortunate men (if thoſe who die in the glorious cauſe of Liberty can be termed unfortunate) were placed in; they had to encounter with a body of troops, both in point of ſpirit and diſcipline, not to be ſurpaſſed in the whole world, headed by an officer of experience, intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, coolneſs, and deciſion. The Americans were compoſed, in part, of raw lads and old men, half armed, with no practice or diſcipline, commanded without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and God knows by whom. Yet what was the event? It is known to the world, that the Britiſh troops, notwithſtanding their addreſs and gallantry, were moſt ſeverely handled, and almoſt defeated.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Colonels Stark, Preſcot, Little, Gardner, Read, Nixon, and the two Brewers, were entitled to immortal honour for their action on that day; but, according to the uſual juſtice of the writers of news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers and Gazettes, their names have ſcarcely been mentioned on this occaſion.</note>

                           <p>The troops under the command of General Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery, in his expedition againſt St. John's, Chambly, and into Canada, who were chiefly compoſed of native Americans, as they were from the Eaſtern States, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024456_0036_0FC734E4383C9B40"/>
by his own account, in a letter I received from that illuſtrious young man, not only great courage, but zeal and enterprize.</p>
                           <p>The aſſault under Arnold, on the lower town of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec, was an attempt that would have ſtartled the moſt approved veterans; and, if they miſcarried, it cannot be attributed to a deficiency of valour, but to want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per information of the circumſtances of the place.</p>
                           <p>The defence of Sullivan's-Iſland, by Colonel Moultrie, might be termed an ordeal. The garriſon, both men and officers, entirely raw; the fire furious, and of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration almoſt beyond example; their ſituation extremely critical and dangerous, for the rear was in a manner open; and if General Clinton could, as it was expected, have landed on the iſland, there were no reſources but in the laſt deſperate reſolutions.</p>
                           <p>With reſpect to the tranſactions on York and Long-Iſland, I muſt be ſilent, as I am ignorant of them; but, from ſome obſervations after I joined the army, I have reaſon to think the fault could not have been in the men, or in the common bulk of officers.</p>
                           <p>Even the unhappy buſineſs of Fort Waſhington, which was attended with ſuch abominable conſequences, and which brought the affairs of America to the brink of ruin, when the circumſtances are well conſidered, did honour to the officers and men, devoted to the defence of this worthleſs and ridiculous favourite.</p>
                           <p>The defence of Red-Bank, by Colonel Green, and Mud-Iſland, by Colonel Smith, forced a confeſſion, even from the moſt determined infidels on this point, of the Britiſh officers, to the honour of American valour. I have often heard them allow, that the defence of theſe two places <hi>were really handſome things—that no men could have done better;</hi> which, from unwilling mouths, is no ſmall panegyric.</p>
                           <p>The victory gained by Stark, at Bennington, and the capture of Mr. Burgoyne's whole army, by Gates and Arnold, are, above all, convincing arguments of what
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024456_0037_0FC734E902CB1298"/>
excellent ingredients, in all reſpects, the force of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is compoſed.</p>
                           <p>The detail of what paſſed lately on Rhode-Iſland is not yet come to my knowledge; but, from all I have been able to collect, the men and officers exhibited great valour and facility, as did their General, diſcretion, calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and good conduct. Upon the whole, I am war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to ſay, what I always thought, that no diſgrace or calamity has fallen on the arms of America through the whole courſe of the war, but what muſt be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſome other cauſe than to the want of valour, of diſpoſition to obedience, or to any other military defect in the men, or the general maſs of their officers in their different ranks; and I ſolemnly declare, that was it at my choice to ſelect from all the nations of the earth to form an excellent and perfect army, I would, without heſitation, give the preference to the Americans. By publiſhing this opinion, I cannot incur the ſuſpicion of paying my court to their vanity, as it is notoriouſly the language I have ever held.</p>
                           <p>I have been told, that one of the crimes imputed to me, is by entertaining a high opinion of the Britiſh troops. If this is a crime, I am ready to acknowledge it. There were times, I confeſs, when the promulgation of ſuch an opinion would have been impolitic, and even criminal; but in theſe times, it is notorious to the world that my conduct was the reverſe. Every thing I wrote, every thing I ſaid, tended to inſpire that confidence in their own ſtrength, which it was thought the Americans wanted; and it is believed, that what I ſaid, and what I wrote, had no inconſiderable effect; but now, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as we are, I cannot conceive the danger, or even impropriety, in ſpeaking of them as they deſerve, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as their excellence redounds to the honour of America. I could not help, whilſt I was priſoner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtoniſhed at the bad policy and ſtupidity of ſome of the Britiſh officers, who made it their conſtant buſineſs to depreciate the character of the Americans in point of courage and ſenſe.

The dangers that now threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, are from other quarters; from the want of temper, moderation, oeconomy, wiſdom, and deciſion amongſt ourſelves; from a childiſh credulity; and, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, a promptneſs to commit acts of the higheſt injuſtice on thoſe who have deſerved beſt at the hands of the community; but above all, from the direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites to thoſe qualities, virtues, and principles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impoſſible that the mode of government eſtabliſhed ſhould be ſupported for the tenth part of a century.

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:024456_0039_0FC734EC81DB8660"/>IT was a conſiderable time before Congreſs took the General's trial under their conſideration, during which our unfortunate hero continued ſmarting under the frowns of fortune and the malignant tongues of men; and to add to his ſufferings in this ſtate of ſuſpenſe, he received a letter from Colonel Laurens, one of General Waſhington's aids, informing him, "that, in contempt of decency and truth, he had publicly abuſed General Waſhington in the groſſeſt terms;" that, "the relation in which he ſtood to him, forbade him to paſs ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct unnoticed; he therefore demanded the ſatisfaction which he was entitled to; and deſired, that as ſoon as General Lee ſhould think himſelf at liberty, he would appoint time and place, and name his weapons." With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation this was accepted; and the General made choice of a brace of piſtols, declining the ſmall ſword, becauſe he was rather in a weak ſtate of body, having lately received a fall from a horſe, and alſo taken a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of medicine to baffle a fit of the gout, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. They met according to appointment, and diſcharged their piſtols, when General Lee received a ſlight wound in his ſide; and it hath been ſaid, that on this occaſion, he diſplayed the greateſt fortitude and courage.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, the proceedings of the Court Martial on his trial came under conſideration in Congreſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced debates for ſeveral evenings; but, finally, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was confirmed. The General was much diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it, and his mind extremely embittered againſt one of the members, Mr. William Henry Drayton, of South Carolina. This gentleman's conduct was vitupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Lee in the ſevereſt language, becauſe he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Congreſs a diviſion of the ſeveral charges brought againſt him, but argued and inſiſted upon lumping them all together, to be decided by one queſtion. In this he was ingeniouſly and warmly oppoſed by a very amiable and worthy gentleman, Mr. William Paca, a late go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Maryland. Here we muſt obſerve, that prior to this, Mr. Drayton was by no means one of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's

favourites; he had taken ſome unneceſſary liberties with his character, in a charge which he delivered as chief juſtice to a grand jury in Charleſton, South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina. His temper thus exaſperated, he could no longer refrain from emphatically expreſſing his ſenſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries he had received from Mr. Drayton. Theſe were delivered, intermixed with threatening language, to Mr. Hutſon, his colleague and friend, who communicated the ſame. A correſpondence enſued, ſo remarkable for its poignancy of reply, as may be worth preſerving in theſe memoirs.</p>

                  <p>MY colleague, Mr Hutſon, hath this day mentioned to me, a converſation you had with him, in which you expreſſed your ſelf as injured by a miſrepreſentation of your conduct immediately preceding your captivity by the enemy, in a charge I had the honour to deliver, as Chief Juſtice, to the Grand Jury of Charleſton, South Carolina.</p>
                  <p>I muſt inform you, Sir, that, on the one hand, I have been repeatedly aſſured the repreſentation I then made was a true one; and that, on the other hand, I have alſo been aſſured, that it was not founded on fact; and that, immediately upon this latter aſſurance in South Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, I took that ſtep which was moſt likely to lead me to a certainty on the ſubject, with the avowed deſign, that if I had injured your reputation, I might be enabled to make the moſt ample reparation; but I did not receive the neceſſary materials. Thoſe ſentiments of propriety which dictated the firſt advance on my part then, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them now dictate a like conduct when another opportunity ſeems to open itſelf for my arriving at truth, and to do that juſtice which the caſe may require. And I do aſſure you, that if I can be enabled to declare, that you did not violate the orders of the commander in

chief, reſpecting your junction with him, when he had retreated to the Delaware in 1776, I ſhall not only do ſo in the moſt pointed terms, but beg your pardon for having, through error and miſrepreſentation, publiſhed the contrary.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe, I wrote to Major Euſtace on the 6th of January 1778, when I was in Charleſton, and had no proſpect of coming to this part of the Continent; and a copy of the correſpondence between him and myſelf on the occaſion I will lay before you, if you deſire to ſee it.</p>

                  <p>I SHOULD have done myſelf the honour of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your letter yeſterday, but was prevented by a variety of buſineſs. If I have violated any orders of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, to him, and the Congreſs only, am I reſponſible; but certainly am not amenable to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Mr. William Henry Drayton. I ſhall therefore remain entirely indifferent whether you are pleaſed to think or dream that I deſignedly threw myſelf into the hands of the enemy, or whether I was not taken by 2 concurrence of unfortunate circumſtances, ſuch as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the courſe of all wars. The only remark I ſhall make on your extraordinary requiſition, that I ſhould clear myſelf on this point to you ſimply, Mr. William Henry Drayton, whom I conſider but as a mere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon member of Congreſs, is, that you pay a very ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to the General. You muſt ſuppoſe him either miſerably deficient in underſtanding, or in integrity as a

ſervant of the public, when you ſuppoſe that he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a man, for a ſingle day, to act as his ſecond in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whom he knows to be guilty of ſuch abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble military treaſon. This ingenious ſuppoſition, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is, in my opinion, a greater affront to the General than to myſelf.</p>
                  <p>I am ſincerely concerned that my friend Euſtace ſhould have degraded himſelf ſo far as to enter into any diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this matter with Mr. William Henry Drayton; and I ſhall reprimand him for not underſtanding his own dignity better, I ſhall now only take the trouble of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that if you can reconcile your conduct in ſtepping out of the road (as I am informed you did in your charge to the grand jury) to aggravate the calamities of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man, who had ſacrificed every thing to the cauſe of your country, and, as he then conceived, to the rights of mankind; who had ſacrificed an ample, at leaſt an eaſy and independent fortune, the moſt honourable connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, great military pretentions, his friends and relations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay if you can reconcile your ſtepping out of the road to aggravate the calamities of a man who had notoriouſly made theſe ſacrifices, and who, at the very time you was diſplaying your generous eloquence, had no leſs than five centinels on his perſon, and was ſuffering extremely in body and mind—If you can, I repeat, reconcile ſuch a procedure to common humanity, common ſenſe, or common decency, you muſt ſtill be a more ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage than the public at preſent conſider you.</p>

                  <p>AS I have now ſettled all my affairs, and as I am given to underſtand that you probably may ſoon ſet out for South Carolina, I take the liberty of addreſſing this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you, which is to cloſe our correſpondence for ever. Until very lately, I was taught to conſider you only as a fantaſtic, pompous <hi>dramatis perſona,</hi> a <hi>mere malvolio,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be ſpoke or thought of but for the ſake of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and when the humour for laughter ſubſided, never to be ſpoke or thought of more. But I find I was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024456_0044_0FC734FDC3C170E8"/>
I find that you are as malignant a ſcoundrel as you are univerſally allowed to be a ridiculous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting coxcomb.</p>
                  <p>You are pleaſed to ſay, that I am legally diſgraced; all that I ſhall ſay in reply is, that I am able confidently to pronounce, that every man of rank in the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, every man on the Continent, who had read the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Court Martial (perhaps, indeed, I might except Mr. Penn of North Carolina, and Dr. Scudder of the Jerſies, with a few others about their ſize in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) is of the opinion, that the ſtigma is not on him on whom the ſentence was paſſed, but on thoſe who paſſed this abſurd, iniquitous, and prepoſterous ſentence; for, to be juſt, I do not believe you quite blockhead enough to think the charge had a ſhadow of report; and if, by ſome wonderful metamorphoſis, you ſhould become an honeſt man, you will confeſs it. As to the confirmation of this curious ſentence, I do not conceive myſelf at liberty to make any comments on it, as it is an affair of Congreſs, for which body I ever had, and ought to have a profound reſpect. I ſhall only lament that they are diſgraced by ſo foul a member as Mr. William Henry Drayton. You tell me the Americans are the moſt merciful people on the face of the earth: I think ſo too; and the ſtrongeſt inſtance of it is, that they did not long ago hang up you, and every advocate for the ſtamp-act; and do not flatter yourſelf, that the preſent virtuous airs of patriotiſm you may give yourſelf, and your hard laboured letters to the Commiſſioners and the King, will ever waſh away the ſtain. If you think the terms I make uſe of harſhor unmerited, my friend Major Edwards is commiſſioned to point out your remedy.</p>

with the ſcurrilous attacks he had met with from ſeveral writers and others in Philadelphia, he could not forbear giving vent to the bitterneſs of his feelings; and in this miſanthropic diſpoſition, compoſed a ſet of queries, which he ſtyled Political and Military.

The queries no ſooner made their appearance, but a conſiderable diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance took place among the citizens of Baltimore: the printer was called upon for the author, and obliged to give up his name.

                        <p>THE aſperſions which have been thrown on my own character from the preſs, I have ever deſpiſed too much to take the leaſt notice of them; but when a moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and amiable character is attacked through me, I think it in my duty to remark it, and guard the public from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, even in opinion.</p>
                        <p>In a ſet of queries, deſigned to leſſen the character of General Waſhington, in a late paper, I am alluded to ſo particularly as not to be miſtaken, and quoted, as having furniſhed evidences under my own hand, that General Waſhington was not the diſtinguiſhed character the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of the Council of this State had repreſented; from which an inference is to be drawn prejudicial to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in point of ability, and the Council in conſiſtency, ſo far as I had any ſhare in thoſe addreſſes. This inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation I therefore think it my duty to contradict; and, though the ſanctity of private and confidential correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has been groſsly violated on this occaſion, I ſhould have paſſed it by, if the fact had not been as groſsly miſ-ſtated.</p>

Knowing that General Lee's opinion would be a great ſupport to mine, I wrote to him from Hackinſack, ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe, and my reaſons, and, I think, urging him to join me in ſentiment at the cloſe of my letter; and, alluding to the particular ſubject then before me, to the beſt of my recollection, I added this ſentence: "With a thouſand good and great qualities, there is a want of deciſion to complete the perfect military character."</p>
                        <p>Upon this ſentence, or one to this effect, wrote in haſte, in full confidence, and in great anxiety for the event, is this ungenerous ſentiment introduced into the world. The event but too fully juſtified my anxiety; for the fort was ſummoned that very day, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the next. I abſolutely deny that there is any other ground but this letter; and if there is, let it be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. I have now only to add, that though General Waſhington ſoon after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by an accident, knew of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, it never leſſened the friendſhip which ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between us. He had too much greatneſs of mind to ſuppoſe himſelf incapable of miſtakes, or to diſlike a faithful friend, who ſhould note an error with ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of reſpect, and on ſuch an occaſion. I have ſince been with this great and good man, for ſuch he is, at very critical moments; and I hope I ſhall not be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of unbecoming adulation, when I aſſure my countrymen, (ſo far as my opinion is thought of any conſequence) that they may repoſe themſelves in perfect confidence on his prudence and judgment, which are equal to any circumſtances;— and that repeated experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the value of his opinions, have inſpired him with more dependance on them than his modeſty and diffidence would in ſome caſes formerly admit.

            <p>TO judge of the propriety of General Reed's perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it will be neceſſary to refer the reader to his letter in page 277, which is a true copy from the original, in his own hand writing.</p>
            <p>Lee remained at his retreat, living in a ſtyle peculiar to himſelf, in a houſe more like a barn than a palace. Glaſs windows and plaiſtering would have been luxurious extravagance, and his furniture conſiſted of a very few neceſſary articles; indeed he was now ſo ruſticated, that he could have lived in a tub with Diogenes: however he had got a few ſelect valuable authors, and theſe ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to paſs away his time in this obſcurity. In the fall, 1782, he began to be weary with the ſameneſs of his ſituation; and experiencing his unfitneſs for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of country buſineſs, he came to a determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſell his eſtate, and procure a little ſettlement near ſome ſea-port town, where he might learn what the world was doing, and enjoy the converſation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>His farm, though an excellent tract of land, rather brought him in debt at the end of the year, and added to the difficulties he laboured under. It is no wonder, then, he was inclined to relinquiſh his preſent ſyſtem of life. He left Berkley, and came to Baltimore, where he ſtaid near a week with ſome old friends, and then took his leave for Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>It is preſumed he now found a difference between a <hi>General in command,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> deſtitute of every thing but the name; for we do not find him entertained at the houſe of any private citizen. He took lodgings at an inn
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024456_0048_0FC7350C5EF36A88"/>
the ſign of the Conveſtigoe waggon, in Market-ſtreet. After being three or four days in the city, he was taken with a ſhivering, the forerunner of a fever, which put a period to his exiſtence, October 2d, 1782.</p>
            <p>A friend of the Editor's was at the inn when he took his departure from this world. The ſervants informed him that General Lee was dying: upon which he went into the room; he was then ſtruggling with the king of terrors, and ſeemed to have loſt his ſenſes; the laſt words he heard him ſpeak were, "Stand by me, my brave grenadiers!"</p>
            <p>The citizens of Philadelphia, calling to remembrance his former ſervices, appeared to be much affected at his death. His funeral was attended with a very large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people, the clergy of different denominations, his excellency the preſident of Congreſs, the preſident, and ſome members of the council of the commonwealth of Pennſylvania, his excellency the miniſter plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary of France, M. Marbois ſecretary to the embaſſy, the miniſter of finance, General baron de Viominil, duke de Lauſam, the miniſter of war, and ſeveral other officers of diſtinction both in the French and American army.</p>
            <p>From what hath been obſerved in theſe memoirs, we may with juſtice affirm, that General Lee was a great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere friend to the rights and liberties of mankind, and that it was this grand principle which led him to take part on the ſide of America. It appears, that, from his youth, he was bred up with the higheſt regard for the noble ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of freedom; his education and reading ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened them; the hiſtorians and orators of Greece and Rome, with whom he was conſiderably converſant, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the ſacred flame; and his travels in many parts of the world did not tend to diminiſh it.</p>
            <p>When a boy, he was ſent to an academy in Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and he has frequently ſaid to his friends, that he was there ſtruck with the general happineſs, affluence and eaſe diffuſed throughout that country, notwithſtanding its natural diſadvantages of ſoil and climate. In one of his letters, he expreſſes himſelf in this manner: "When
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024456_0049_0FC7350D80ECBD78"/>
I was quite young in Switzerland, I could not help com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the robuſt well clothed commonalty of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with their miſerable neighbours of France, a ſpot upon wich nature ſeems to have taken pains to confer her favours. To France, Nature has given the moſt fruitful ſoil, which produceth not only every neceſſary, but every luxury of life. She has given to its people a lively, active, enterpriſing genius, a climate upon the whole the beſt of the world—To the Swiſs, ſhe bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rocks, mountains, and, as it is thought, very inferior mental faculties; and yet the Swiſs are rich, happy and reſpectable; the French, ſtarving and contemptible. In Italy, the contraſt betwixt the free, and thoſe who are not free, is ſtill more remarkable; I know very well, that the republics of Genoa and Venice are not in general al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be free ſtates. Monſieur Monteſquieu has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that they are not free; but there is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſome excellence in them, which has eſcaped this wiſe man—ſhall I beg leave to hazard a conjecture? They have no king: They have no court."</p>
            <p>The General had read both men and books; his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and travels were extenſive, and of courſe his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners eaſy and free of embarraſſment; ſo that he was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently accuſtomed to deliver his ſentiments and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings without diſguiſe, from the firſt impreſſions, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the objects which preſented.</p>
            <p>This liberality of conduct, and openneſs of diſpoſition, in a young country, cauſed many to doubt of his belief in revealed religion; the common people, at laſt, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him as an atheiſt; while thoſe of a higher claſs were more indulgent to his principles. If we were to form a judgment on this ſubject, from his private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, we ſhould not accuſe him as totally deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of religious notions, for it appears that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome grand and ſublime ideas of the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was ſtrongly perſuaded that no ſociety could exiſt without religion.</p>
            <p>He has often aſſerted, that he thought the Chriſtian religion, unincumbered of its ſophiſtications, the moſt
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024456_0050_0FC7350F576F9688"/>
excellent, as comprehending the moſt divine ſyſtem of ethics, conſequently of a divine nature; but at the ſame time he diſapproved of the length and tediouſneſs of the liturgies of the various ſects. As to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he dogmas, he conſidered many of them abſurd, if not impious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to the honour, dignity and wiſdom of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or omniſcient ruler and moderator of the infinity of worlds that ſurround us.</p>
            <p>The General, in his perſon, was of a genteel make, and rather above the middle ſize; his remarkable aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line noſe rendered his face ſomewhat diſagreeable. He was maſter of a moſt genteel addreſs; but, in the latter part of his life, became exceſſively negligent of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both in garb and behaviour. A talent for repartee, united with a quickneſs of penetration, created him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies. A character ſo eccentric and ſingular, could not fail of attracting the popular attention. His <hi>ſmall friends</hi> frequently paſſed ſevere criticiſms on his words and actions. Narrowly watched, every little ſlip or fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure was noticed, and repreſented to his diſadvantage. The objections to his moral conduct were numerous, and his great fondneſs for dogs brought on him the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and frowns of the fair ſex: for the general would permit his canine adherents to follow him to the parlour, the bed-room, and ſometimes they might be ſeen on a chair next his elbow at table.</p>
            <p>As the ladies are commonly againſt any tranſgreſſions of the laws of decency and cleanlineſs, it is no wonder a ſhyneſs commenced between them and the General. This hath given ſome perſons an idea of his being averſe to women, which in reality was not the caſe; for his life and poſthumous papers will furniſh ſeveral exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his early attachment to them; and a letter to him, from a Britiſh officer in Montreal, in 1774, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the Editor of his having been ſuſceptible of the ſame feelings with other men, and of his having fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently indulged himſelf in gallantry with the ladies. "During the winter," ſays this officer, who was the General's intimate friend, "I took a trip to Quebec,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024456_0051_0FC73514F7EBE330"/>
where I paſſed ſeveral agreeable days with <hi>your queen.</hi> I delivered your compliments to her, and ſhe enquired particularly about you, deſiring me to return them moſt ſincerely whenever I wrote—She is the ſame amiable creature, whoſe diſpoſition neither climate nor country can alter, and as ſtrongly attached to you as ever." And his letter from Warſaw to Louiſa, demonſtrates the ſame fact.</p>
            <p>There is great probability the General was the firſt perſon who ſuggeſted the idea that America ought to declare herſelf independent. When he was ſent by the commander in chief to New-York, he behaved with ſuch activity and ſpirit, infuſing the ſame into the minds of his troops and the people, that Mr. John Adams ſaid, "a happier expedition never was projected; and that the whole Whig world were bleſſing him for it." About this time Doctor Franklin gave Mr. Thomas Paine, the celebrated author of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> an introductory let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, in which were theſe words: "The bearer, Mr. Paine, has requeſted a line of introduction to you, which I give the more willingly, as I know his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not very different from yours." A few days after, the Doctor writes again, "There is a kind of ſuſpenſe in men's minds here at preſent, waiting to ſee what terms will be offered from England—I expect none that we can accept; and when that is generally ſeen, we ſhall be more unanimous and more deciſive. Then your propoſed ſolemn league and covenant will go better down, and perhaps moſt of <hi>your other ſtrong meaſures</hi> adopted." In a letter to Edward Rutlege, Eſq. in the ſpring of 1776, then a member of the Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Congreſs, the General thus expreſſes himſelf. "As your affairs proſper, the timidity of the ſenatorial part of the continent, great and ſmall, grows and extends itſelf. By the Eternal G—d, unleſs you <hi>declare yourſelves inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,</hi> eſtabliſh a more certain and fixed legiſlature than that of a temporary courteſy of the people, you richly deſerve to be enſlaved, and I think far from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that it ſhould be your lot; as, without a more
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024456_0052_0FC7351880B22960"/>
ſyſtematic intercourſe with France and Holland, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, we have not the means of carrying on the war." There are other epiſtles of his, of a ſimilar ſpirit and diction.</p>
            <p>The more we inveſtigate the General's character and conduct, the more conſpicuous his ſervices will appear. In the infancy of the American diſpute, we all find him continually ſuggeſting and forwarding plans for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the country; and though he was a profeſſed enemy to a ſtanding army, he was always recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a well regulated militia. This he conſidered as the natural ſtrength of a country, and abſolutely neceſſary for its ſafety and preſervation.</p>
            <p>He has frequently aſſerted, that a more pernicious idea could not enter into the heads of the citizens, than that rigid diſcipline, and a ſtrict ſubjection to military rules, were incompatible with civil liberty; and he was of opinion, that when the bulk of a community would not ſubmit to the ordinances neceſſary for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of military diſcipline, their liberty could not be of long continuance.</p>
            <p>The liberty of every commonwealth muſt be protected ultimately by military force. Military force depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on order and diſcipline: without order and diſcipline, the greateſt number of armed men are only a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible mob; a handful of regulars muſt diſperſe them. It follows then, that the citizens at large muſt ſubmit to the means of becoming ſoldiers, or that they muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the protection of their lives and property to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct body of men, who will naturally, in a ſhort time, ſet up a profeſſional intereſt, ſeparate from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at large. To this cauſe we may attribute the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of every free State that hiſtory preſents to us. The Romans were certainly the firſt and moſt glorious people that have figured on the face of the globe; they continued free longeſt. Every citizen was a ſoldier, and a ſoldier not in name, but in fact; by which is meant, that they were the moſt rigid obſervers of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary inſtitutions. The General therefore thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024456_0053_0FC73519829FFF40"/>
that every State in America ſhould be extremely careful to perfect the laws relative to their militia; and that, where they were glaringly defective, they ſhould be made more efficient; and that it ſhould be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a point of honour, and the criterion of a virtuous citizen, to pay the greateſt deference to the common ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary laws of a camp.</p>
            <p>The moſt difficult taſk the Editor met with in collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and arranging theſe Poſthumous Papers, aroſe from his deſire of not giving offence to ſuch characters as had been the object of the General's averſion and reſentment. Unhappily his diſappointments had ſoured his temper; the affair of Monmouth, ſeveral pieces of ſcurrility from the preſs, and numerous inſtances of private ſlander and defamation, ſo far got the better of his philoſophy, as to provoke him in the higheſt degree, and he became, as it were, angry with all mankind.</p>
            <p>To this exaſperated diſpoſition we may impute the origin of his political queries, and a number of ſatirical hints thrown out both in his converſation and writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt the Commander in Chief. Humanity will draw a veil over the involuntary errors of ſenſibility, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the ſallies of a ſuffering mind, as its preſages did not meet with an accompliſhment. General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, by his retirement, demonſtrated to the world, that power was not his object; that America had nothing to fear from his ambition; but that ſhe was honoured with a ſpecimen of ſuch exalted patriotiſm as could not fail to attract the attention and admiration of the moſt diſtant nations.</p>
            <p>The reader will not wonder that General Lee, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his career of glory, ſhould be continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating an idea of the extreme danger of truſting too much to the wiſdom of <hi>one,</hi> for the ſafety of the <hi>whole;</hi> that he ſhould conſider it as repugnant to the principles of freedom and republicaniſm, to continue for years, one man as commander in chief; that there ſhould be a rotation of office, military as well as civil; and though the commander of an army poſſeſſed all the virtues of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024456_0054_0FC7351C0F79D678"/>
Cato, and the talents of Julius Caeſar, it could not alter the nature of the thing; ſince by habituating the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to look up to one man, all true republican ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came enervated, and a viſible propenſity to monarchial government was created and foſtered; that there was a charm in the long poſſeſſion of high office, and in the pomp and influence that attended it, which might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the beſt diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>Indeed it was the opinion of Marcus Aurelius, whoſe virtues not only honoured the throne, but human nature, that to have the power of doing much, and to confine that power to doing good, was a prodigy in nature. Such ſentiments of this divine prince, who was not only train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the ſchools of auſtere philoſophy, but whoſe elevated ſituation rendered him the moſt able judge of the difficulty there is in not abuſing extenſive power, when we have it in our hands, furniſh ſubſtantial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for not entruſting it to any mortal whatſoever. But while we are convinced of the juſtneſs of theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, we are led the more to reſpect and reverence our moſt diſintereſted Commander in Chief, who ſtands conſpicuous, with unrivalled glory, ſuperior to the faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinations which have overthrown many a great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind.</p>
            <p>The editor conceives his preſent labours, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation of this work, will be uſeful, and throw ſome light on the hiſtory of the late revolution—a monument of the arduous ſtruggle, exhibiting a faithful and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble collection of military and political correſpondence.</p>

               <p>I WILL ſuppoſe the number to conſiſt of ten thouſand men, with their full proportion of officers of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ranks, and children. There ſhall be no diſtinction made in the diſtribution of lands, betwixt the general officers and colonels; but as it appears that there ſhould, for the ſake of order, be ſome difference of property in the different claſſes of men, I would propoſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plan of diſtribution.—When the capital is once fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, immediately round it by lot—Every colonel to have two thouſand five hundred acres; every lieutenant-colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, two thouſand; major, fifteen hundred; captain, one thouſand; lieutenants and enſigns, ſeven hundred each; each ſerjeant three hundred; every rank and file two hundred. Another circle drawn round it, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame number of acres, ſhall be in common, for the uſe of the whole community; where cattle ſhall have the liberty of ranging. Beyond this circle another ſhall be drawn, of an equal number of acres, with the ſame proportion of acres for every member of the community. So that every colonel will, in fact, be maſter of five thouſand acres, every lieutenant-colonel of four, every major of three, every captain of two thouſand, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rank and file of four hundred; one half within the capital precinct, and the other half in what I call the

pomoerium of the State; the intermediate ſhall be allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the rearing of horſes for the public ſervice, and cattle, to form magazines for w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The lots in the pomoerium are intended for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the State, when they are of an age to ſettle and marry. As the colony is military, (as every colony ought to be, if they intend to be free) a conſtant exerciſed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia ſhall be kept up, but by annual rotation: for which purpoſe, the fifth part of the men fit to bear arms, from ſeventeen to forty-five, ſhall be embodied for two months of the year, their manoeuvres as ſimple as can be deviſed: but no ſubſtitutes are to be allowed, on any pretence, but abſolute infirmity; and even thoſe who are not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied, ſhall, in their certain diſtricts, be obliged to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble every week, practice ſome ſimple evolutions, ſuch as marching in front, retreating and rallying by their colours, and all firing at marks.</p>
               <p>A ſtanding ſmall body of horſe, and of artillery, ſhall be conſtantly kept up at the public expence, as theſe ſpecies of troops are not to be formed in an inſtant.— An Agrarian law ſhall be paſſed, and rigidly obſerved, reſtraining abſolutely every member of the community from poſſeſſing more than five thouſand acres of land, not only within the precincts of the community, but any where elſe. No member of the community, unleſs he comes into the world deformed, or too weak to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the manly labours, ſhall be suffered to exerciſe seden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary trades, ſuch as taylors, barbers, ſhoemakers, weavers, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe effeminate and vile occupations ſhall be alloted to women, to the weak, deformed, and to ſlaves. Agriculture, hunting, and war, to be the only profeſſions of the men; to which may be added, the trade of ſmiths, carpenters, and thoſe which do not emaſculate.</p>
               <p>But as there is reaſon to apprehend, that a nation merely of warriors, hunters, and agricultures, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extremely ferocious in their manners, ſome method ſhould be deviſed, of ſoftening, or counteracting this conſequential ferocity: I know of none equally efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with a general cultivation and ſtudy of muſic and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024456_0057_0FC7352835A761D0"/>
poetry; on which principle, I would propoſe, that muſic and poetry ſhould be the great regimen of the two moſt important articles of government, religion and war; all other good qualities might follow of courſe: for, without religion, no warlike community can exiſt; and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if it is pure and unſophiſticated, all immoralities are incompatible. Muſic and poetry, therefore, which ought to be inſeparably blended, are the grand pivots of a real, brave, active, warlike and virtuous ſociety. The doctrine I am conſcious may ſhock quakers, puritans, and rigid ſectariſts of every kind; but I do not ſpeak to quakers, puritans, and rigid ſectariſts.

any ſort whatever ſhall be admitted in the community. But ſtill I am of opinion, that a ſacred order, or hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, ſhould be eſtabliſhed, and in the following manner: that this hierarchy are not to be expoſitors of the divine law, which ought to be underſtood by every member of common capacity; but as the ſervitors, or adminiſtrators of the ſolemn ceremonies to be obſerved in the worſhip of the Supreme Being, of his Son, or miſſionary.</p>
               <p>The grand hierophant, pontifex maximus, or ſupreme ſervitor of the ceremonies of divine worſhip, is to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the community, and to be not under the age of fifty; the principal qualification requiſite in him, to be ſanctity of manners, a reverend aſpect, but above all, a diſtinct and melodious voice. A body, or rather cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of under prieſts, is to be ſelected likewiſe, for their integrity of manners, and ſkill in muſic; for as all dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and of courſe all expoſitions, are baniſhed, ſuperior learning, or what is improperly underſtood to be learning amongſt the theologians of the modern world, will be ſo far from a qualification, that it will rather be a diſquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, particularly as the ceremonies are to conſiſt in poetical hymns of praiſe and thankſgiving, ſet to muſic; ſuch for inſtance as Pope's Univerſal Prayer, part of the Common Prayer, and many pieces ſelected from the Pſalms of David; for theſe long prayers with which all the churches of the different ſects are infeſted, entering into ſuch minute details with God Almighty, as if he was your factor in a foreign country, have been juſtly deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many wiſe men, not only tireſome, but impious impertinencies.</p>
               <p>Ablutions, ſuch as are practiſed in the religions of the Eaſt, ſeems to me to be really a divine inſtitution. Theſe Eaſterns wiſely ſay, that a pure ſoul cannot inhabit a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy body; that a purified body is the beſt ſymbol of a clean ſpirit; that it is indecent and wicked to preſent yourſelf before your Creator in a dirtier condition than you ought to appear in before an earthly ſuperior. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting theſe figures to be hyperbolical, the inſtitution certainly is extremely wiſe, as it contributes ſo eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Baths, or little fountains, at leaſt ſuch as are in uſe amongſt the Turks, to be eſtabliſhed near the temples of worſhip; and every communicant to waſh his hands, face, feet and teeth, before he enters the ſacred abode. The temples to be as magnificent as the circumſtances of the ſociety will admit. A grand religious concert of thankſgivings to be performed every Sunday; and two other days in the week, we will ſuppoſe Tueſdays and Fridays, but ſhorter, and with leſs pomp; for there is nothing ſo impolitic, as to make pomp and ceremony too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent—they entirely loſe their effect. The thankſgivings or hymns, therefore, on theſe common days, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſhort, but ſenſible and energetic: long prayers, ſuch as the morning ſervices of the church of England, with the addition of a long unmeaning ſermon, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med through the noſe perhaps of a crop-ſick perſon, who can ſcarcely read his own writing, or the ſtill more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable cant of the puritan preachers, muſt be the bane of all religion; and I verily believe there is ſcarcely any one perſon, if they had the honeſty to confeſs to, man, woman, or child, who would not rather ſuffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable inconvenience than go either to a church, or a preſbyterian meeting-houſe. In ſhort, the ceremonies of divine worſhip muſt be made ſolemn, pompous and elevating—but we will quit the ſubject of religion, and paſs to the law.</p>
               <p>As an Agrarian law is to be eſtabliſhed, and rigidly obſerved, reſtraining every member of the community to the poſſeſſion of five thouſand acres; and as the children of both ſexes are to inherit an equal portion (for this is to be a fundamental maxim) the moſt ſimple code may be extracted, for civil caſes, from the common laws of England, or from thoſe of Denmark, which appears to be excellent.

He put a ſtop to all capital puniſhments, even for the greateſt crimes; and the conſequences have convinced the world of its wholeſomneſs. The galleys, ſlavery for a certain term of years, or for life, in proportion to the crime, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed what an army of hangmen, with their hooks, wheels and gibbets, could not. In ſhort, Tuſcany, from being a theatre of the greateſt crimes, and villanies of every ſpecies, is become the ſafeſt and beſt ordered State of Europe.</p>
               <p>It is a known fact, that ſince the adoption of this plan, there have been but two murders committed: one by a little boy of eleven years old, in a ſtroke of paſſion; and the other, not by a native Italian ſubject, but by an Iriſh Officer. But if we had not this example, and that of the Empreſs Elizabeth, (who adopted the ſame plan, which had the ſame good effect) before our eyes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating an idea in a military people that death is the moſt terrible of all puniſhments, is certainly the moſt abſurd of ſoleciſms. Nothing great can be expected from a community which is taught to conſider it as ſuch. On the contrary, death ought, as far as human nature will admit, to be made a matter of indifference; or, if poſſible, (and I think it very poſſible) of comfort.</p>
               <p>I have often laughed at the glaring contradiction in the proceedings, in this article, in the Britiſh armies, and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024456_0061_0FC735354AB19068"/>
others in which I have ſerved. I have ſeen two or three wretches, who had the misfortune to be detected in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauding, or attempting to deſert, taken out with awful form, encircled by a multitude who had been guilty of, or had intended to have committed the ſame crimes, but happily had not been diſcovered; the chaplain, in his canonicals, telling them how dreadful a thing it was for their ſouls to be divorced from their bodies, and to be urged on to the tribunal of their Maker, with theſe horrid ſins on their heads. A few hours afterwards, ſome deſperate expedition ordered to be executed by the very men who had been preſent at the execution, who had committed, or had intended to commit, the very ſame horrid crimes; and the officer appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the expedition, as uſual, harangues the ſoldiers; aſſures them that death is not a ſerious affair; that, as all men muſt ſooner or later die, it is of little moment when it happens. Thus it may be ſaid, we blow hot and cold with the ſame breath. I am therefore abſolutely and totally againſt capital puniſhments, at leaſt in our military community. Let the loſs of liberty, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, be inculcated as the extreme of all puniſhments: common culprits therefore are, in proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their delinquency, to be condemned to ſlavery, for a longer or ſhorter term of years; to public works, ſuch as repairing highways, and public buildings, with ſome ignominious diſtinction of habit, denoting their condition. As to thoſe who have been guilty of crimes of a very deep dye, ſuch as wanton murder, perjury, and the like, let them be mutilated, their ears cut off, their faces ſtamped with the marks of infamy, and whipped out of the State.</p>
               <p>I paſs now to trade.—The perſuaſion that extenſive trade is the ſource of riches, ſtrength, happineſs and glory, is perhaps one of the greateſt miſtakes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which modern ſocieties labour under. Without doubt certain cities, both of antiquity and the preſent world, from their peculiar ſituation and circumſtances, owed their exiſtence entirely to their commerce; ſuch
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024456_0062_0FC73536C1C6F4C0"/>
as Tyre, Venice, and Holland: but I cannot conceive how a community of ſoldiers and agriculturers, who have lands enough to cultivate, not only for their own ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but in a great meaſure for others, ſhould have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for what is called great and extenſive commerce. I think, on the contrary that it muſt emaſculate the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, narrow the mind, and in fact corrupt every true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican and manly principle; nay, I think it muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all ſenſibility for real pleaſure and happineſs. Let any man of taſte or ſenſibility aſſociate only for a few months with commercial men, or reſide in a commerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al city, he will find their converſation dull, languid, and ſtupid; their pleaſures confined to groſs eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; their only idea of mirth, to the roaring of ſome vile hoarſe ſinger; and of wit, to the ſtory-teller of the club, or ſome wretched punſter, who lives on catches and crotchets. True muſic, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is abſolutely requiſite to qualify every man of a liberal community for ſocial converſation. But although I object to profeſſional merchants being permitted to reſide in our government, it is certain that ſome degree of commerce or barter muſt be carried on, or agriculture and hunting ſtand ſtill, and of courſe idleneſs and all its attendant evils enſue.</p>
               <p>I would therefore propoſe, that on the frontiers of the State, at leaſt once in the year, a <hi>great fair</hi> ſhould be eſtabliſhed, to which merchants and pedlars of all ſorts and nations ſhould be encouraged to reſort. This fair to continue three weeks or a month.</p>

that we muſt bring it into the world with us, without which, the moſt piercing eyes ſee nothing, and we muſt grope about in utter darkneſs.

               <p>Before I enter into the explication of the method that ſhould be purſued to acquire this talent, falſely thought to be a gift of Nature, it is neceſſary to define it.—The military <hi>coup d'oeil,</hi> then, is nothing elſe than the art of knowing the nature and different ſituations of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where we make and intend to carry the war; the advantages and diſadvantages of the camp and poſts that we mean to occupy; as likewiſe thoſe which may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable or diſadvantageous to the enemy. By the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our army, and the conſequences drawn from it, we may not only form with preciſion our deſigns for the preſent, but judge of thoſe we may afterwards have. It is alone by this knowledge of the country into which we carry the war, that a great Captain can foreſee the events of the whole campaign, and, if it may be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, render himſelf maſter of them; becauſe, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what he himſelf has done, of what the enemy muſt neceſſarily do, forced as they are, by the nature of the places, to regulate their movements to oppoſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, he conducts them from poſt to poſt, from camp to camp, to the very point he has propoſed to himſelf to inſure victory. Such, in a few words, is the military <hi>coup d'oeil,</hi> without which it is impoſſible that a General ſhould avoid falling into a number of faults of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſequence. In a word, there are little hopes of victory if we are deſtitute of what is called the <hi>coup
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024456_0064_0FC7353FC9672290"/>
d'oeil</hi> of war; and as the military ſcience is of the ſame nature with all others that require practice to poſſeſs them in all the different parts that compoſe them, this which I treat of, is, of all others, that which requires the greateſt practice.</p>
               <p>Philopoemen, one of the greateſt Captains that Greece produced, and whom an illuſtrious Roman has called the laſt of the Grecians, had the <hi>coup d'oeil</hi> in an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree; but we ought not to confides it as a gift of Nature, but as the fruit of ſtudy, application, and his extreme paſſion for war. Plutarch informs us of the method he uſed to enable himſelf to ſee with his own eyes, rather than thoſe of other people, when he was at the head of armies. The paſſage deſerves to be quoted.</p>
               <p>"He willingly liſtened," ſays the Greek author," to the diſcourſes, and read the treatiſes of the philoſophers; not all, but only thoſe which could aid him in his purſuit of virtue; and of all the great ideas of Home<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, called the Tactics, that is, the art of ranging troops in order of battle; and the hiſtories of the life of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander; for he thought that language was of no further uſe than its reference to action, and that the only and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>"When he had read the precepts and rules of the tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, he did not trouble his head about ſeeing the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of them by plans on paper, but made the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them in the very ſcenes of action, and in open field; for, in his marches, he accurately obſerved the eminences and low places, the breaks and irregularities of the ground, and all the forms and figures which bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions and ſquadrons are obliged to take in conſequence of rivulets, ravines, and defiles, which force them to cloſe or extend themſelves. In general, it appears, that
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024456_0065_0FC73542DFCF6AD8"/>
Philopoemen had a very ſtrong paſſion for arms; that he embraced war as a profeſſion that gave greater play to his virtues; in a word, he deſpiſed all thoſe as idle and uſeleſs members of the community, who did not apply themſelves to it."</p>
               <p>Theſe, in abridgment, are the moſt excellent precepts that can be given to a prince, the general of an army, and every officer who wiſhes to arrive at the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of military rank. This is the only method; and, as the tranſlator has very judiciouſly obſerved, renders the putting the precepts into practice, on occaſion, more eaſy than by ſtudying the plans on paper. Plutarch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and even ſeverely cenſures Philopoemen for having carried his paſſion for arms beyond the bounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Monſ.

               <p>There is no doubt but that tactics, or the art of rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies in the order of battle, of encamping and fighting them, is a moſt royal attainment. What could be the reaſon that Hannibal ranked Pyrrhus king of the Epirots, before Scipio, and immediately after Alexander,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024456_0066_0FC7354443ED7288"/>
although the latter was certainly the ableſt man? It was, doubtleſs, becauſe the firſt excelled all mankind in this great part of war, although Scipio did not yield to him in this point, as he made appear at the battle of Lama. Hannibal was leſs practiſed in this branch than the two others. Philopoemen ſaw that the ſtudy of tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and the treatiſes of Evangelus, were of no uſe to him, unleſs he joined to them the <hi>coup d'oeil,</hi> ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the general of an army. His method always pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and it is what I have ever practiſed in my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and in the camp; for we ought not to wait for the opportunity of war to acquire the <hi>caup d'oeil,</hi> but it may be learnt and obtained by the exerciſe of hunting.</p>
               <p>To attain this ſcience, many things are neceſſary. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere application to our profeſſion is the baſis; then a certain method is to be adopted: Although that of this Grecian Captain is good, I think I have improved upon it, or at leaſt diſcovered that which the Greek author has omitted to teach us more particularly. We are not always at war, nor is it to be ſuppoſed that we can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ourſelves able by experience alone, on which indeed the capacity of the greater part of military men in theſe ages is founded: it ſerves to perfect us, but is ſcarcely of any uſe unleſs the ſtudy of the principles accompany it; becauſe war being a ſcience, it is impoſſible to make any progreſs without beginning with the ſtudy of the principles. Two ages of perpetual war would ſcarcely ſuffice to furniſh lights for our conduct: from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of facts, this ought to be left to ſouls of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtamp, and more compendious methods be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for great Captains to mount to the ſummit of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without being indebted for it to the capacity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is not always to be met with. It is, then, neceſſary to ſtudy war before we engage in it, and to apply ourſelves inceſſantly after we are engaged in it. I have before ſaid, that we are not always at war; and I may add, that armies are not always drawn together in a body, or in motion. They are for ſix months at leaſt quiet in winter quarters; and ſix months are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024456_0067_0FC73545EA2AC8D8"/>
to form the <hi>coup d'oeil</hi> of war. It is true, that a great deal more is to be learnt in marches, in forages, and in the different camps and poſts which armies occupy: the ideas become more clear and capable to judge of, and reflect on, the country we ſee; but this does not prevent us from making uſe of it, by the aſſiſtance of good ſenſe, on other occaſions than when in armies; or from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining our jugdment and eye, either by hunting, or on our journeys:—this I can ſpeak of from experience.</p>
               <p>Nothing contributes more to form the <hi>coup d'oeil,</hi> than the exerciſe of hunting; for, beſides giving us a thorough knowledge of the country, and of the different ſituations; which are infinite, and never the ſame, it teaches us a thouſand ſtratagems and other things relative to war. But the principle is the knowledge of the objects that form the <hi>coup d'oeil,</hi> without our being ſenſible of it; and if we practice it with this intention, we may with the addition of a very few reflections, acquire the greateſt and moſt important qualification of a general of an army.</p>
               <p>The great Cyrus, in giving himſelf entirely up to hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his younger years, had the pleaſure of it leſs in view than the deſign of qualifying himſelf for war and the command of armies. Xenophon, who wrote his life, does not leave us in the leaſt doubt on this head. He ſays, that this great man, on his preparing for war with the king of Armenia, reaſoned upon this expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as if the queſtion had been of a party of hunting in a mountainous country. He explained himſelf thus to Chryſantes, one of his general officers, whom he had detached into the rougheſt parts, and the moſt difficult vallies, in order to gain the entrances and iſſues, and to cut off all retreat to the enemy. "Imagine," ſays he, "that it is a chace we are engaged in, and that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to thee to watch at the toils, whilſt I beat the country. Above all, remember not to begin the chace before all the paſſages are occupied, and that thoſe who are placed in ambuſcade be not ſeen, leſt they ſhould frighten the game. Take care not to engage thyſelf too
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024456_0068_0FC735484E3CD238"/>
far in the woods, from whence thou mighteſt find it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to extricate thyſelf; and command your guides, unleſs they could indeed ſhorten the diſtances, to conduct you by the beſt roads, which, with reſpect to armies, are always the ſhorteſt."</p>
               <p>Whether or not Xenophon, in his hiſtory of Cyrus, has run into romance in order to give us an abridgment of the military ſcience treated hiſtorically, is a matter of no great importance, provided that all it contains relative to this ſcience be juſt and ſolid. His intention is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that hunting leads us to the knowledge of many things neceſſary to be known—that it is a becoming amuſement, and extremely neceſſary to thoſe who are either born to command or to obey; becauſe it enures us to bear the fatigue of war, ſtrengthens the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and forms the <hi>coup d'oeil;</hi> for an exact knowledge of a certain extent of country, facilitates that of others, if he but ſees it in the ſlighteſt manner. It is impoſſible, although they are widely different, that there ſhould not be ſome conformity betwixt them; and the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of one (ſays Machiavel in his political diſcourſes) leads to that of another. On the contrary, thoſe who are not trained in this practice, have the greateſt difficulty to acquire it; whilſt the others, by a ſingle glance of the eye, can aſcertain the extent of a plain, the height of a mountain, the depth, breadth, and termination of a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and all the circumſtances of the nature of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grounds to which they are accuſtomed by habit and experience. I do not believe that any other author, than this I have quoted, has treated of this matter. The remainder is excellent; I ſhall beg leave to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it.</p>
               <p>"Nothing is more true," continues he, "than what I here advance, if we may give credit to Titus Livius, and the example he preſents to our eyes in the perſon of Publius Decius, who was Tribune in the Roman army, commanded by the Conſul Cornelius, againſt the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites. It happened that this General ſuffered himſelf to be puſhed into a valley, where the enemy might have
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024456_0069_0FC7354DB9C08FA8"/>
pent him up. In this extremity, Decius ſays to the Conſul, "Don't you perceive yonder eminence, which commands the enemy? This is the poſt that alone can extricate us, if we do not loſe a ſingle moment in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ourſelves maſter of it, as the Samnites have been ſo blind as to abandon it." But before Decius addreſſed himſelf in this manner to the Conſul, he had diſcovered through the wood, a hill which commanded the camp of the enemy; that it was ſteep, and of a pretty difficult acceſs for heavy armed troops, but practicable enough to the light infantry. That the Conſul ordered the Tribune to take poſſeſſion of it with three thouſand men, that he had conſigned to him; which having happily executed, the whole army retreated in order to put themſelves in a place of ſafety. That he ordered ſome few of his people to follow, whilſt there was yet ſome remains of day-light, in order to diſcover the paſſes guarded by the enemy, and thoſe by which a retreat might be made; and he went to reconnoitre, diſguiſed in the habit of a common ſoldier, that the Samnites might not perceive taht it was a general officer who was on the ſcout."</p>
               <p>"If we reflect," continues Machiavel, "upon what Titus Livius here ſays, we ſhall ſee how neceſſary it is for a good General to be able to judge of the nature of a country; for if Decius had not poſſeſſed this talent, he would not have known how advantageous the poſſeſſion of this hill muſt have been to the Romans; and he would have been incapable of diſcovering, at a diſtance, whether it was of eaſy or difficult acceſs. When, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he had made himſelf maſter of it, and when the point was to rejoin the Conſul, he would not have been able, at a diſtance, to diſcover which poſts were guarded by the enemy, and thoſe by which a retreat was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. Decius, therefore, muſt certainly have been very intelligent in theſe ſort of matters; for otherwiſe he could not have ſaved the Roman army by poſſeſſing himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of this hill, and afterwards extricated himſelf from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who had ſurrounded him."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:024456_0070_0FC73552A778EB60"/>There are very few military men who are capable of drawing, from an hiſtorical fact, ſuch obſervations as theſe I have cited from Machiavel: the moſt conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate maſter in the profeſſion could do no more. I am not at all ſurprized at it; a profound and well digeſted ſtudy of hiſtory neceſſarily leads us to the knowledge of an infinity of things, which enable us to judge ſoundly and ſolidly of all. The ſtudy of politics, of which hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the baſis, is a powerful means of perfecting our underſtanding and judgment.</p>
               <p>The political and military diſcourſes of this author, on the Decades of Livy, are an immortal work. I think them worthy the curioſity of all military men——of being attentively read and well digeſted. His life of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He lived at a time when Italy was ſo agitated with trouble, inteſtine and foreign wars, that we muſt not be ſurpriſed if a man of ſenſe and judgment, and learned beſides, was equal to ſo noble a performance; becauſe, as he was on the ſcene of action, he had the means of obtaining the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent materials, and of converſing with officers who had ſerved in theſe wars.</p>

She is tall, and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely ſhaped. She is of an amiable and commanding aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Her eyes are of the languiſhing Engliſh blue, but
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024456_0071_0FC7355406848C70"/>
of the Grecian largeneſs and contour. Her forehead is of a poliſh and formation not to be matched. Her lips are full and ripe, from which iſſues a breath which would create deſires in age and coldneſs. Her neck is of ſuch a colour and ſymmetry as to make us curſe invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cuſtom for preventing us gazing on the whole of ſo amiable a piece of workmanſhip. Her ſkin is of a ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the ſlighteſt contact of it thrills through every pore, and beats alarm to a thouſand wiſhes. Her perſon is rather ample; but we could not conſent to its dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, leſt ſome grace or beauty ſhould be loſt.</p>
               <p>No man has ſeen her laugh; but ſhe ſmiles frequently. Her ſmiles ſeem rather to be the reſult of an inclination to make thoſe about her cheerful and happy, than of any inherent gaiety of diſpoſition in herſelf. She has, at times, a daſh of melancholy in her countenance, which is more becoming than her ſmiles. Theſe ſhort ſymptoms of melancholy I ſhould attribute to her vacancy of heart, to her want of ſome one object upon which ſhe may for her affections; a neceſſity which Nature has impoſed upon Woman for a wiſe purpoſe—the perpetuation of the human race.</p>
               <p>She has faults; but her faults ſeem to be acquired— her virtues a native inheritance. She is ſo general, that it almoſt amounts to coquetry. She makes too little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt the men of merit and ſenſe, and the fooliſh and undeſerving. She can cruelly ſuffer the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reſpectful lover to languiſh without a glimmer of hope, and give encouragement to the aſſured, indifferent coxcomb, who would boaſt of favours which ſhe is, perhaps, determined to confer on no man. She has the appearance of being ſo ſatisfied with theſe reptiles, that you would ſuſpect her underſtanding, did not every ſentence which ſhe utters correct this miſtake. She may be accuſed in this, of ingratitude towards her benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, Nature, who beſtowed on her ſuch uncommon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, not to be hebetated by the galimatias of fools, but, by a proper application of her time, to be perfected into mental endowments proportionable to her perſonal

charms. She acts wiſely in being cautious of a ſecond marriage, as the great fortune which ſhe is poſſeſſed of, muſt render it difficult for her to diſtinguiſh who courts her riches, who herſelf. But the man who ſhall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py enough to obtain her, will do well to hurry his prize to ſome retreat from the great world, as the facility which I complain of might create him much uneaſineſs; for it is an eternal truth, that great love, and ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of jealouſy, are inſeparable.

               </head>
               <p>SOME time ago, I made one of a company of officers, whoſe converſation was not confined, as is too much the cuſtom of gentlemen of our profeſſion, to <hi>buckles, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, garters, grenadier-caps,</hi> or, what is little better, <hi>the figure that ſuch or ſuch a regiment made in their puerile reviews for the amuſement of royal maſters and miſſes, great and ſmall, in Hyde Park, or on Wimbleton Common;</hi> our diſcourſe fell upon the hiſtory of England, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective merits of the different hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>A young ſubaltern, who ſeemed to have great fire and ſentiment, and with more reading than young ſubalterns are generally maſters of, was extremely bitter on Mr. Hume: he loaded him with a thouſand opprobriums; he ſtiled him a ſophiſt, a jeſuit, a theiſtical champion of deſpotiſm, who had dethroned the God of Heaven, and deified the ſceptered monſters of the earth. The young man was taken up by a grey-headed field-officer, who was ſo warm a partizan of Mr. Hume's, that he leaned not only towards abſolute (or in his favourite author's terms) pure unmixed monarchy, but viſibly towards jacc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiſm. He ſpoke of Charles the Firſt with an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous reverence, and of all his opponents with the greateſt
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024456_0073_0FC7355725CD8D20"/>
horror and indignation: this led him to a great deal of abuſe on Mrs. M'Cawley; he lamented that a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this nature was ſuffered to be publiſhed, which muſt inſtil the moſt damnable republican principles into the minds of our youth; that it already had diminiſhed that reſpect to royalty ſo neceſſary to be kept up: and that the young gentleman who ſpoke laſt had furniſhed us with an inſtance, that the army had not eſcaped the contagion—a moſt alarming conſideration! as their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect to crowned heads was not manifeſted alone by opinions injurious to the royal martyr, but that ſeveral of them had frequently in their converſations declared their diſapprobation of ſome part of the preſent reign; that ſuch ſentiments, and ſuch language, were not only repugnant to the ſpirit of our military laws, but indecent and ungrateful in thoſe who <hi>eat his Majeſty's bread.</hi>— This he uttered with ſo much emphaſis, that the greateſt part of the company was terrified into ſilence; and the young ſubaltern began to think he had been guilty in ſome meaſure of treaſon, and, I believe, would have prevaricated himſelf into other ſentiments than thoſe he had profeſſed, had I not taken up his cauſe, juſtified all he had advanced, and encouraged him to foſter the noble principles he had imbibed. I demanded of our veteran to explain his meaning in ſaying that <hi>we eat his Majeſty's bread;</hi> whence had his Majeſty drawn funds to feed ſo many mouths? Were coffers of gold tranſported from his perſonal eſtates in Germany? or, had he diſcovered in his gardens at Kew, treaſures ſufficient for ſuch prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious munificence? Were the officers of the army for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn and ſtarving in the ſtreets, without patrimony, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and friends; cut off, by their country, from all means of ſupporting themſelves; in a word, precluded from all poſſibilities, preſented to other members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, of procuring a livelihood? Had his Majeſty found the whole body of us in this wretched, deſperate ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and out of the vaſt benevolence of his ſoul, and at his own individual expence, without the leaſt incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to the nation, redeemed us from hunger and nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024456_0074_0FC7355EC82FB400"/>
fed us comfortably, clothed us in ſmart red coats, put ſwords by our ſides, and erected us into the condition of gentlemen? I ſaid, if theſe things could be proved, but on no other terms, I would agree with the gentleman who ſpoke laſt, that <hi>we really did eat the king's bread,</hi> and that we were perhaps in duty bound to approve all his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and all thoſe of his miniſters, whether right or wrong, glorious or inglorious, ſalutary or pernicious.—But on the other hand, if we conſidered ourſelves, as we really were, only as a claſs of one great free people, ſegregated from the reſt into this diſtinct claſs, and ſubjected to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar laws neceſſary for the maintenance of military order and diſcipline, without which we could not anſwer the ends of our inſtitution, that is, <hi>the immediate defence of our mother country againſt foreign invaders, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our colonies and external poſſeſſions, the great baſis and ſupport of our commerce, wealth, and marine, conſequently our national importance and independence:</hi> I ſaid the King might be conſidered, partly in the ſame predicament with the officers of the army, or the fleet, viz. <hi>a great ſervant of the community, or maſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ordained and ſubſiſted for the public ſervice;</hi> with this difference, that each individual of the army, or fleet, contributed as a citizen, and one of the people, to his ſubſiſtence, as a ſoldier, or ſervant of the great aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, of which he himſelf, in another ſenſe, formed a part; whereas the king was ſimply a receiver; in no reſpect a contributor; ſo that it might in fact be ſaid with more propriety, that the king eat the officers of the army's bread, than that the officers of the army eat the king's. I confeſſed that his Majeſty, as one branch of the legiſlature, and executive magiſtrate, was entitled to a very high degree of reverence from ſoldiers as well as other citizens, as long as he fulfilled the duties of his ſtation; but that ſtill a higher degree of reverence and attachment was due to the freedom, laws, proſperity and glory of our country, than perſonally to the firſt magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, let him fill his office ever ſo worthily. When it was remembered, I added, that the preſent reigning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily

In this again I totally differed from the old gentleman. I aſſerted it was the reverſe: that the army had been treated through the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reign, both individually and collectively, with more contempt and ingratitude than in any reign of any age or any country; that the ill uſage of the army had not been confined to the living, it had extended to the dead. To begin with Mr. Wolfe, to whoſe valour and conduct we owed the acquiſition of a mighty empire, how irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently had his aſhes been treated by government! The nation had indeed gratefully and generouſly voted a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to their hero; the nation had paid the money, but unfortunately his majeſty's miniſters were the truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees: to this day therefore we ſee no monument erected; the money raiſed on the people for this purpoſe, having probably been converted to the uſe of ſome living wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, not very far diſtant from Weſtminſter Abbey. But they were not ſatisfied with depriving the hero of theſe trophies; they had piqued themſelves in adding every inſult to his memory. The man who had ſerved, or rather diſſerved, under him; who had ſhewn activity

only in embarraſſing his counſels, impeding his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and labouring to defeat his purpoſes; who had ſtrained his hardbound wit to throw a ridicule on his conduct; who, whenever he could find an audience paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and baſe enough to his mind, had poured forth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of abuſe, and endeavoured to raiſe a ſpirit of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mutiny in others, equal to that ſtirred up in his own breaſt, by the daemon of envy; who, after his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious death, had not paid the ſlighteſt tribute of reſpect to his memory, or of ceremony to his remains; who had attempted to filch <hi>his laurels off the ſhelf, and put them in his pocket:</hi> This man, I ſaid, had been loaded with the higheſt preferments, and the greateſt honours, (if any thing which flows from ſuch a court can be deemed honours) which our court has to beſtow.—Let us next obſerve how the brave Band, who conquered under him, and indeed the whole American army, had been recompenſed, <hi>officers and ſoldiers.</hi> The firſt inſtance of gratitude exhibited by our government, was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of their proviſion, without which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible that an American ſoldier ſhould ſubſiſt: the vaſt conſumption of neceſſaries occaſioned by the nature of that hard ſervice, from clearing communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, building bridges and forts, but above all from tranſporting proviſions, ammunition and artillery up the rivers, and the enhanced price of theſe neceſſaries, as they all come from England, by the freight and profit of the merchants, put an American ſoldier, although allowed proviſion, in a worſe condition than an Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an without it; particularly when we conſider, that an European ſoldier is paid for all king's or public works, which in America was not the caſe. But the cruelty of this meaſure was not all: it was flagitious; it was a breach of compact, at leaſt with reſpect to a great part of the army—the volunteer drafts from England, the whole body of royal Americans, and every man recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in America, were engaged on abſolute expreſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of being allowed proviſion. Travelling from North America to the Weſt Indies, the tenderneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

reign diſplayed towards the ſoldiery is ſtill more ſtriking; the diſtribution of the plunder of the Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah is ſo notorious that it would be impertinent to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it; but the motives of this diſtribution are ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that it is difficult not frequently to recur to them. They were theſe: The Earl of Bute and his great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct lived in perpetual apprehenſions of the late Duke of Cumberland; the firmneſs of the man, his known courage, his good ſenſe, but above all his principles and attachment to the welfare and honour of his country, rendered him an object of terror to thoſe who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſacrifice every thing to the maintenance of their own power and authority—after having revolved in their minds what was the moſt probable method of ſoftening this bar to their ſchemes into ſome complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it was concluded, that to win this favourite, was the plan of the moſt promiſing aſpect.</p>
               <p>The expedition againſt the Havannah was at this time reſolved upon; the troops and fleet were in readineſs; my lord of Albemarle was on this principle appointed to the command, and on this principle ſo enormouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched at the expence of the labour, health and blood of the moſt noble deſerving army that this, or perhaps any other country, has been ever ſerved by. His lordſhip and his family were indeed aggrandized; but the great views of the diſtributers were happily diſappointed. The Duke of Cumberland perſiſted in his integrity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued an honeſt zealous citizen until the fatal moment when he was ſnatched away from his country. I think, without rant or exaggeration, it may be termed a fatal moment:—he was indiſputably a valuable true Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: he had, in the early parts of his life, through an over zeal for reforming the army from the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which he found them, projected ſchemes not unexceptionable; but this muſt be aſcribed to a defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he paid to the opinion of men infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to himſelf, both in virtue and talents: but in his latter years, his great and good qualities demonſtrated themſelves ſo fully, that we may fairly conclude, had

fate ſpared him, he might at leaſt have checked the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of thoſe bitter waters broke in upon us from their accurſed ſource of Carleton-Houſe.—But before I take leave of America, I cannot help obſerving the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary attention paid to the officers and ſoldiers in the allotment of lands; it would be endleſs to enter into the detail of the royal or miniſterial (for theſe terms have been of late ſo confounded together that it is puzzling to diſtinguiſh them) bounty in this particular; I ſhall inſtance one or two which may ſuffice for the whole.</p>
               <p>It had long been ſuppoſed that the iſland of St. John's in the gulph of St. Lawrence, would have been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable poſſeſſion. A ſet of officers of the land and ſea ſervice, laid out a plan for the ſettlement of it. They preſented it to Government, and petitioned a grant of it. The grant was promiſed. The officers dangled from day to day for the fulfilling of this promiſe. They were ſhuffled from the Admiralty to the Board of Trade, from the Board of Trade to the Admiralty, from an Egmont to an Hillſborough, from an Hillſborough to an Egmont, for the ſpace, I believe, of three years. Egmont accuſes Hillſborough as the cauſe of this delay; Hillſborough accuſes Egmont; his Majeſty ſtands neuter betwixt theſe two righteous perſonages.</p>
               <p>The Officers danced attendance until they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the threſhold of a jail; but at length it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided: The officers who were the original petitioners, got half a lot. Mr. Touchit, or Touchat (for I have not the honour of knowing how he ſpells his name) ſome court ſurgeons, and every kind of court retainer, who thinks it worth his while to hint that he has no objection to an American poſſeſſion, is gratified with a whole lot.</p>
               <p>Another ſociety of officers had ſolicited a grant of lands on the river St. Lawrence, which they undertook to ſettle; this was flatly refuſed.</p>
               <p>Another ſociety ſolicited for lands on the lower parts of the Illinois, Ohio, or on the Miſſiſſippi: that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rejected; but from what motives it is impoſſible to define, unleſs they ſuppoſe that ſoldiers inveſted with
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:024456_0079_0FC7356F47FB4A08"/>
a little landed property, would not be ſo readily induced to act as the inſtruments of the oppreſſion of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects, as thoſe whoſe views are ſolely turned, if not reduced, to farther promotion; and if reduced, to full pay. And here I am afraid the underſtandings of our profeſſion muſt appear dreadfully low, when they can be dupes to the hopes of promotion.</p>
               <p>Let them reflect for a moment on the mode of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſince the peace, the only commiſſions which by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary men can be eſteemed objects; I mean regiments, and lieutenant colonelcies; and I will venture to affirm, that not four of each have been beſtowed on men who, in the opinion of thoſe who have ſerved with them, have the ſemblance of a title. That the army on the Engliſh and on the Iriſh eſtabliſhment, and the fleet on the home and foreign ſtations, have been conſidered by our court as the precious means of corrupting us from our duty as citizens; that a plea of merit in general, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action, of wounds, loſs of health or limbs by a courſe of hard ſervices, has been conſidered as a ſymptom of lunacy. And I have heard ſay, our incomparable Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary at War values himſelf not a little for his humanity, in not ſuing for ſtatutes to confine the wretches who can puſh their extravagance to ſuch a height as to make theſe pleas. It will perhaps be ſaid, that jobs are not the growth of this reign; that jobs ever were, and ever will be, in a government like ours. But allowing jobs to have been, I cannot think iniquity is to be juſtifyed by precedent, and ſurely iniquitous precedents are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully quoted in a reign which was announced from its commencement to be that of virtue, purity, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
               <p>As to the army that ſerved in Germany, it is true they have not been ſo very groſsly treated as the American. There were moments when Lord Granby would not cede to our gracious Secretary at War. There were moments when, as our ingenious court termed it, he was obſtinate and impracticable; that is, there were moments when he inſiſted on ſome regard being paid to
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024456_0080_0FC735707999D1B0"/>
thoſe who had deſerved of their country; but theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unfortunately occurred but too ſeldom. His faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and complacence to the wickedneſs of the Court, preponderated over his natural love of juſtice. In ſhort, the patronage of the army was left to a Barrington, by whom valour, ſenſe and integrity muſt naturally be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as he muſt ſuſpect that no man can poſſeſs them without being an enemy to their contraries, which are the undiſputed attributes of his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>From this long digreſſion on the obligations of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the preſent Court, on the extraordinary eſteem in which the military has been held through the whole courſe of the preſent reign, we returned to our original topic, the merit of the different hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>I joined the young ſubaltern in his encomiums on Mrs. M'Cawley. I challenged the old field-officer to point out a ſuſpicious authority that ſhe had quoted; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſingle comment which did not correſpond with the facts. I aſſerted, that her inferences were fairly drawn from her premiſes; and that there could not be traced the ſhadow of partiality in the long ſeries of her hiſtory, unleſs a zeal for true liberty, and the rights of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and of mankind, may be termed partiality. I aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Hume was the reverſe in all reſpects; that he produced little, and that very ſuſpicious, authority; that his comments did not agree whith his facts, the effects not deducible from the cauſe. Upon the whole, what I ſaid on the ſubject of James's hiſtory, and of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his favourite Charles, was ſo ſatisfactory to the company, that they requeſted me to digeſt what I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to preſent it to the public.</p>

               <p>IN reading hiſtory, nothing has ſo frequently ſhocked me as the diſreſpectful and irreverent manner in which divers writers have ſpoke of crowned heads. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny princes, it muſt be owned, have acted, in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

not altogether as we could wiſh; but it is the duty of every honeſt man, and friend to royalty, the great ſource of human happineſs, to draw a veil over their weakneſs; and if not able entirely to juſtify ſome parts of their conduct, he may at leaſt, by the aid of certain <hi>managed terms,</hi> and <hi>decent ſoftenings,</hi> in a great meaſure prevent the evil effects which a coarſe, and I may ſay barbarous relation of facts is apt to have on weak and vulgar minds. The paſſion, prejudice, and party heat of ſeveral who ſtyle themſelves hiſtorians, have, I make no doubt, been the principal cauſes of the numberleſs mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs, inſurrections, rebellions, dethronements, expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, regicides, which have diſgraced the hiſtory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and more particularly of this infatuated country.</p>
               <p>On this principle, Sir, you will readily believe, that the ſatisfaction I have received from your incomparable Hiſtory of the Houſe of the Stuarts, is of the higheſt kind; that I have peruſed it, and re-peruſed it a thouſand times, and always with freſh pleaſure; and that I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wiſh the youth of our country were never ſuffered to read any other; a rule which I am charmed to hear is obſerved by the moſt exalted perſonage in the kingdom, as well in virtue as in rank, whenever he condeſcends to unbend his mind from his ſevere ſtudies and occupations by dipping into the annals of his predeceſſors; and it is to this rule, perhaps, that we are indebted for the prodigious enlargement of his mind, in ſo tender an age that all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope ſtands aſtoniſhed at it.</p>
               <p>How complaiſant, how gentle, how guarded, how humane, how polite are your phraſes, in laying before us the tranſactions of thoſe good, though perhaps miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided, princes! How calculated are your comments to mitigate the ſeditious ſpirit of the mad multitude! Had you written an hundred years ago, I am perſuaded you would not only have prevented the growth of thoſe horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinions, (alas! too prevalent) That kings are not only reſponſible, but puniſhable for their delinquencies toward their people; that Charles the Firſt met with no harder fate than he deſerved, and that his two ſons
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:024456_0082_0FC7357BD4F2A008"/>
ought, in juſtice, to have made the ſame exit. I ſay, Sir, had you written an hundred years ago, you might not only have prevented the growth of ſuch monſtrous notions, but, probably, have checked thoſe furious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which ended in driving from the throne of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, to the indelible diſgrace of theſe nations, a prince replete with every royal virtue.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Sir, I am ſo much in love with the ſcheme of your hiſtory, I am ſo convinced that no taſk can be equally laudable in a philoſopher, an hiſtorian, and a gentleman, as to endeavour to eradicate from the minds of our youth all prejudices and prepoſſeſſions againſt the memory of deceaſed, and the character of living princes; and, by obviating the cavils and malice of republican writers, to inſpire mankind with more candour in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the actions and government of ſovereigns, that I am determined to follow ſo bright an example, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert the utmoſt of my zeal, ſkill, and abilities (indeed far ſhort of yours) to reſcue from the unmerited odium under which they lie, two much injured characters in hiſtory; I mean the Emperor Claudius Caeſar, and his immediate ſucceſſor Nero, whoſe foibles and indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been ſwelled up into vices, by the auſterity and malevolence of Tacitus, Suetonius, and others (the Rapins, Ludlows, and M'Cawleys of thoſe days) who wrote under ſucceeding monarchs of a different family; but as the motives for ſuch virulent proceedings are now ceaſed, and as men's minds ought to be a little cooler, we may venture to pronounce the diſpoſition of theſe princes (though I do not think they were faultleſs, or altogether well-adviſed) to have been good.</p>
               <p>Should the ungenerous and bigots in party raiſe a cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſhould they exclaim that its being a pander to deſpotiſm, and an enemy to the rights of humanity, the endeavouring to gloſs over vices and enormities ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, as they pretend, by a concurrence of facts, vouched by the moſt authentic records, I ſhall conſole myſelf, Sir, with your approbation, and that of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous few who think with you, and ſhall flatter myſelf

               <head>A POLITICAL ESSAY.</head>
               <p>ON leaving ſchool, I thought it right to get ſome acquaintance with the hiſtory of England; for the ſchool where I was brought up was guilty, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with all other ſchools, of the ſhameful neglect of ſuffering the boys to remain in utter ignorance of the laws, conſtitution, and tranſactions of their own country; ſome knowledge of which is certainly of more import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, at leaſt in a government like ours, than the being able to ſcan the flattering verſifyers of Auguſtus's age.</p>

Notwithſtanding his length, I read him through with great attention, which was more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly engaged when I came to thoſe parts which treat of our ſeveral civil wars; but the great one of the year 1640, intereſted me more ſenſibly than the antecedent. And I cannot expreſs how much I was amazed in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the character of Charles the Firſt ſo little agree with the notions I had conceived of him, from his being ſtyled a Martyr; from the ſolemn obſervance of the 30th of January, in order to avert the wrath of the Almighty for that horrible parricide; from the epithets of good, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, pious, bleſſed, which were perpetually beſtowed on him, not only by the old houſe-keeper, the maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but by the maſter, uſher, and all the clergy who happened to diſcourſe on this ſubject in my hearing. In the holidays, when we went home, my mother, grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and all their female acquaintance, rung the ſame in my ears.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:024456_0084_0FC7357EB82DD218"/>On the peruſal of Rapin I was, therefore, ſtrangely puzzled and confounded to find this virtuous, pious, bleſſed, holy martyr, metamorphoſed into an obſtinate, diſſembling, perfidious tyrant; and that the men whom I had been taught to execrate as rebels, traytors, parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, ſhould, for the greater part, appear the champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the laws of their country and the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, fraught with truth, valour, integrity, and every attribute which can render mortal men the objects of veneration.</p>
               <p>I had no method of accounting for this, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding my hiſtorian guilty of the moſt egregious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, that he muſt have miſtated, or diſguiſed the facts to an enormous degree; for as to his comments, they appeared judicious, natural and fair, allowing the facts to be juſtly ſtated. I deſired all thoſe whom I thought more knowing and wiſe than myſelf, to ſolve theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Some few of them averred that Charles was not at all better than what he was repreſented by Rapin; but far the greater number aſſured me, that Rapin was a lying French Preſbyterian, partial, unjuſt, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that no credit was given to him by men of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and knowledge, and that he was never ſpoke of with common patience by thoſe who have any generous ſentiments. They adviſed me, by all means, to go to the fountain-head of information on this ſubject, the <hi>great Clarendon;</hi> that <hi>there</hi> I ſhould ſee the facts related clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honeſtly, the comments ſenſible and candid, the cauſes and effects congruous, the ſpring of every action laid open, the views and characters of the actors pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their proper colours, by one who had himſelf played a principal part, or, at leaſt, ſeen every thing that had paſſed behind the ſcenes; one, whoſe authority was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtible from his character for truth and integrity.</p>
               <p>I accordingly procured a Clarendon, not only read him with attention, but ſtudied him with accuracy: and, behold the reſult! it was an entire, complete diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in every circumſtance: inſtead of carrying the conviction which I expected, it appeared to me one
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024456_0085_0FC735874BB14940"/>
eternal periphraſis ſubdivided into aſſertions without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, childiſh ifs without probable ſuppoſitions, and tortured inferences from miſtated or defalcated facts, with endleſs begging the queſtions. The epithets can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, ſincere, virtuous, pious, were very liberally beſtowed on him, whoſe cauſe he intends to plead; and not a ſingle inſtance of candor, ſincerity, or virtue is given through the whole courſe of his hiſtory, unleſs exceſſive bigotry to epiſcopacy, and a ſpirit of perſecuting all other proteſtant ſects, is to be conſtrued piety. In ſhort, my averſion to Charles was rather confirmed than transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the other party by the peruſal of Lord Clarendon. I here diſcerned very plainly, why the epiſcopal clergy ſhould have made a Saint and a Martyr of him. His exceſſive attachment to their order, and the great ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he made to them, are undoubtedly very ſubſtantial titles to canonization, and the crown of martyrdom; but the zeal and reverence with which a multitude of others, who are quite indifferent to modes of worſhip, and ſome who ſeem deſirous there ſhould be none at all, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſpeak of this prince, and the indignation and horror with which they ſpeak of his opponents, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs is with me a matter of wonder. I know very well, that the impreſſions we receive in our childhood ſink deep, and that theſe impreſſions, whether we receive them from our nurſes, grandmother, or the parſon of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; whether they concern ghoſts, or hobgoblins, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or a ſaint, a tyrant, or a martyr, are with difficulty effaced; but that thoſe who have got rid of thoſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſuperſtitious prejudices, ſhould ſtill retain, in their utmoſt force, their prepoſſeſſions with reſpect to their royal maſter, is ſomething ſupernatural. I have long endeavoured to account for this, and am apt to conclude, that it muſt be aſcribed to the ſingularity of his fate.— A king tried and condemned by his own ſubjects is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a ſingular caſe, the ſingularity of his fate has cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated pity, and pity ever generates love and affection.— The Marquis of Beccaria, in his incomparable treatiſe on Crimes and Puniſhments, is of opinion, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024456_0086_0FC73589427ECB40"/>
ought to puniſh with death ſuch criminals only whoſe exiſtence is abſolutely pernicious to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if his reaſoning is juſt, a criminal king is almoſt the only criminal on whom death ought to be inflicted, as his exiſtence (if not always abſolutely deſtructive) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly highly dangerous to ſociety. Tarquin was only expelled; Tarquin's exiſtence was nearly deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Rome; an eternal war and conſpiracies within the walls, which brought Rome into the extremeſt peril, were the conſequences of the tyrant's exiſtence; and the death of the tyrant <hi>ſimply,</hi> unleſs it hath been accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with that of his ſons, would not have injured the tranquillity and ſecurity of Rome.</p>
               <p>On this principle, ſome of the Grecian States had laws levelled, not only againſt the lives of thoſe who ſhould erect themſelves into the tyrans of their country, but enjoining the extirpation of their whole race; and theſe were wiſe and humane laws, becauſe they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the good of the whole, for the ſacrifice of a ſingle family for the preſervation of millions is indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly humanity. James the ſecond was expelled like Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin, but he and his ſons were ſuffered to eſcape with their lives; the conſequences of their being ſuffered to eſcape were three rebellions, which not only threatened immediate deſtruction to theſe nations, but endangered the liberties of Europe. It is true, theſe rebellions were defeated in their immediate purpoſes, but the exiſtence of the Stuart race hath laid, too certainly, I am afraid, the ſeeds of our deſtruction. Their exiſtence has furniſhed the miniſters of the family, which was called in for our preſervation, with pretexts for arming the family of <hi>our preſervers,</hi> with the means of deſtroying us; for it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe that the nation could have been brought to acquieſce in mortgaging the national proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without any viſible national purpoſes, unleſs they had imagined that national debts were a ſecurity againſt the return of the <hi>dreaded Stuarts</hi>; and it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe, that the people could have been ſo far impoſed upon, as to ſuffer their repreſentatives to vote
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024456_0087_0FC7358B0E5C9320"/>
themſelves ſeptennial from triennial, unleſs they had been perſuaded, that a ſeptennial parliament formed a ſtronger barrier againſt the return of the Stuarts than a triennial; and it is ſtill a greater abſurdity to ſuppoſe, that a majority of landed gentlemen, of really well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honeſt Engliſhmen, could be infatuated, to ſo great a degree, as to ſit down contentedly under the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſtanding army, the gradual augmentation of it to an enormous bulk, the interweaving of it (as it may be ſaid) into our conſtitution, had not the ſpectre of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts return continually danced before their eyes. Hence, I think, without ſtraining, it may be inferred, that the pecuniary influence of the crown, ſeptennial parliaments and a ſtanding army, (which unleſs ſome great national calamity falls out to draw us back to our firſt principles, before the minds of our ſoldiery are totally debauched) muſt inevitably end in the deſtruction of our liberties; and perhaps national independence, have been the fruits of our miſtaken cruel moderation, in ſuffering a ſingle individual of the expelled family to remain in exiſtence. But to return from this long digreſſion to the queſtion, whether the ſingularity of Charles the Firſt's fate, tryed and condemned by his own ſubjects, is not one of the principal cauſes of his memory's being treated with ſuch tenderneſs and reverence. We will ſuppoſe a caſe; but firſt admitting Beccaria's poſition to be juſt, <hi>that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ought not to puniſh with death any criminal whoſe exiſtence is not abſolutely pernicious, or highly dangerous to the community;</hi> and further, admitting <hi>that a criminal king is the only criminal whoſe exiſtence can be pernicious or highly dangerous.</hi> We will ſuppoſe, then, that there ſhould hereafter be formed a community, one of whoſe fundamental laws ſhould be, That capital puniſhments ſhould be confined to delinquent kings alone; that all other delinquents, let their crimes be what they will, ſhould be ſent into exile; their eſtates, money, and goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated to the uſe of the community. I will venture to affirm, that an hundred kings, leſs guilty than Charles the Firſt, put to death on the ſcaffold, would not ſhock the humanity of the tendereſt nature.</p>

                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:024456_0088_0FC7358D4C552290"/>We will farther ſuppoſe, that after a ſeries of years adherence to this law, they ſhould at length, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of accidents, on ſome very great emergency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from it, and inflict the puniſhment levelled againſt royal delinquents alone, on delinquents of an inferior order, I will venture to affirm that the ſpectacle, from its novelty, of a Jonathan Wild, a S—h, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But although the ſingularity of Charles's deſtiny, the prejudices foſtered by the pious care of our nurſes and the clergy, have greatly contributed to the falſe light in which his conduct, morals, and general character are ſeen, it could not have operated ſo wonderfully alone: the addreſs and ſophiſtry of a ſucceſſion of our corrupt citizens have been ſet at work, to co-operate in miſlead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our judgment and blinding our underſtandings; and of this tribe the pre-eminence muſt indiſputably be given to Mr. David Hume; for the pompous anility (as I think it may be termed) of Clarendon, the more than prieſtly fury of Carte, much leſs the pert patch work of Smollet, or the drivelling of poor Goldſmith, could not have brought any mighty miracles; but with Hume, the caſe is different; the philoſophical, or rather ſceptical charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the man antecedent to his appearance as an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, and a ſpeciouſneſs of ſtyle render him ſo infinitely more dangerous than his fellow labourers, that it is much to be lamented that ſome perſon (for inſtance, a Lord Littelton) eminent for parts and learning, has not thought it worth his while profeſſedly (but I would have it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly, for a reaſon I ſhall hereafter give) to expoſe to public view the incongruities, artifices, and pernicious intention of this ſophiſt. But when I lament that no man of a ſuperior ſtamp has ſet himſelf the taſk, I do not mean that extraordinary learning or talents are abſolutely

neceſſary: on the contrary, I think an attentive peruſal muſt qualify every man of common ſenſe full as well for the purpoſe, if we could ſuppoſe that an equal degree of regard would be paid to him; but it is certain, that the name and ſignature of a perſon in high repute gives, to manifeſt eternal truths, greater force than when uttered by a common or unknown writer, although the eſſence of truth cannot be altered by the greater or leſſer reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him who utters it.</p>
               <p>It is true, a more effectual antidote to the poiſon of Hume's hiſtory cannot be deſired than Mrs. M'Cawley's, if they are but read and compared together with their reſpective authorities; but the misfortue is, the peruſal and comparing of two ſo bulky writers cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the lazineſs of modern readers; and it is on the notions and principles of the lazy claſs of readers that the preſent welfare of our country and the fate of poſterity, in a great meaſure, depend. In fact, of what importance would it be to the community, if thoſe very few, who have inclination and perſeverance to work through volumes, ſhould enlarge their minds to even the ſtandard of an ancient Roman, when the young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, gentry, and men of property, who compoſe the lazy claſs, ſtill remain perverted, uncorrected, an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed?</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons, I think that ſome works ſo compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious as not to terrify by its bulk, confined ſimply, and bearing the import of ſuch in its title, to a refutation of Hume's tenets, and demonſtration of his partiality and pernicious principles, would be more beneficial than a full, complete body of hiſtory, digeſted methodically, ſupported by the beſt authority, and animated by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſentiments. But until ſome eminent perſon will be perſuaded to take up the employment, it is the duty of every common citizen to exert whatever force he has in the common cauſe.</p>
               <p>A jealous ſpirit in the people, of thoſe who govern, and the principles of reſiſtance, from the palladium of liberty, particularly in a limited monarchy. An abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

of tyrants, or even of thoſe who have a ſemblance of tyrants, (and it will ſcarcely be diſputed that Charles had a ſemblance) is inſeparable from this jealous ſpirit and principle of reſiſtance: whoever would extinguiſh the one, would extinguiſh the other. When we ſee therefore, a junto of notorious court-retainers, clubbing their labours to reconcile us to the deſpotic adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Charles, to his duplicity, to his breach of faith, and violation of the moſt ſolemn compacts, we may ſafely conclude, that a deſign is lodged to extinguiſh the <hi>neceſſary jealous ſpirit of liberty,</hi> and inculcate the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of non-reſiſtance. It may be ſaid, that a too great jealouſy of liberty is equally dangerous with a too great confidence; that as the latter may plunge us into ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the former may into anarchy: I ſhould allow ſome weight to this objection, if in the whole courſe of our hiſtory, a refutation, in a ſingle inſtance, could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of theſe poſitions; <hi>That the ſpirit of liberty is ſlow to act, even againſt the worſe princes, and exerts itſelf in favour of the beſt with more effect than any other ſpirit whatſoever.</hi> I muſt therefore repeat, that the keeping alive the jealous ſpirit of liberty is a common cauſe; That a deteſtation of tyrants, or even of thoſe who lean to tyranny, is inſeparable from this ſpirit; That Charles the Firſt was a tyrant in principle and in action; That thoſe who labour to reconcile us to his conduct and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, would deſtroy the ſpirit of liberty, and ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſh the principle of non-reſiſtance; That a jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of mercenaries and court retainers do labour to theſe purpoſes; That it is, therefore, the duty of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon citizen, who has the intereſt of his country at heart, to exert continually whatever force he has to defeat their purpoſes; or, at leaſt, weaken their influence; for, in mechanics, the ſmalleſt force continually applied will overcome the moſt violent motions communicated to bodies.</p>
               <p>From theſe conſiderations, I purpoſe to offer to the public, hereafter, ſome curſory remarks on Mr. Hume's Hiſtory of the two firſt Stuarts: if they are well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

I ſhall continue them through the reigns of the two laſt. If they have, in any degree, the effect which I could wiſh, I ſhall think myſelf amply recompenſed, the only recompence which I can promiſe myſelf. I cannot hope for any glory from the compoſition; the little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which a ſoldier can ſnatch up at intervals will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualify him to reap laurels in the field of literature; and it will eaſily be believed, that the ſentiments which I avow, will not procure a place or a penſion.</p>

By perſiſting in this practice he was very near loſing his eyes, and that you may obſerve they are ſtill extremely weak from its effects. At this, Sir, I own my blood boiled. I ſaid, they muſt be driven to great ſtraits indeed, if they could object nothing worſe to a gentleman's character than his having been bred at a charity-ſchool; for that it had been the caſe of ſome of the moſt illuſtrious men the nation had produced; the late Lord Hardwicke, and Mr. Prior, had been educated in the ſame manner. As to the ſtory of the weakneſs of his eyes, proceeding from ſweeping the duſt againſt the wind, I know it to be a falſhood; for that it had been contracted, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by poring into a Johnſon's dictionary of his own printing, late at nights, to find out decent polyſyllables, of ſufficient ſound and dignity, to dreſs up an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scotch herrings, lumber, and pickled oyſters.</p>
               <p>I aſſerted, that his compoſitions were incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fine, his language ſonorious and muſical; although, perhaps, he did not always apply words to their legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate meaning; as who does in ſuch an immenſity of buſineſs; and that he ſhould round a period with any bookſeller in Chriſtendom: That he was a Latin ſcholar, I thought muſt be allowed by all unprejudiced men, when they conſidered his numberleſs and apt quotations from Horace. Upon my mentioning his knowledge of Latin, the whole company burſt out into a horſe-laugh, which I thought was very indecent, and, when the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar ſubſided, demanded the explanation. They inſiſted
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024456_0093_0FC735A21EEDDCA8"/>
upon it, that he was ſo totally ignorant of it, that he did not know the meaning, nor could he conjugate the verbs <hi>mentior,</hi> nor <hi>vapulo,</hi> though he ſo generally practiſed the former, and has ſo often experienced the latter:—that his patches of Horace were always furniſhed by his friend the Doctor—that when he had finiſhed one of his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he always applied to the Doctor for a motto to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his performance; that, for inſtance, the four lines from Horace, prefixed to his late Epiſtle to Mr. Sears, (which I really think one of the ſmarteſt things I ever read) were pointed out by the Doctor; and that a blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whimſical enough happened on this occaſion, though it was fortunately rectified in time for the preſs. They related, that when he went as uſual for his motto to the Doctor, the Doctor wrote him down theſe lines:
<q>
                     <l>While you alone ſuſtain the weighty cares</l>
                     <l>Of all the world, and manage peace and wars;</l>
                     <l>The Roman State by virtue's rules amend,</l>
                     <l>Adorn with manners, and with arms defend;</l>
                     <l>To write a long diſcourſe, and waſte your time,</l>

                  </q>
ſaying, "R— you may tranſcribe the Latin at your leiſure, as you have Horace in your ſhop; remember, it is the firſt epiſtle." R— went home vaſtly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but unluckily miſtook the firſt ſatire for the firſt epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. When the Doctor went to reviſe it the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he found theſe lines very fairly written—<hi>Qui fit Maecenas ut nemo quam,</hi> &amp;c. and under, the above tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. They added, that though the Doctor was that morning in an horrible ill humour (as he had juſt been reading the Biſhop of St. Aſaph's ſpeech) he could not refrain from laughing; but, however, after having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſome anathemas on the ſkull of his friend, he, for the honour of the common cauſe, took the pains to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the lines with his own hand, to prevent any further blunders. They then proceeded to fall foul upon his Engliſh; they ſaid that when he firſt ſet up his preſs, and before he was under the correction of the Doctor, he uſed always to write muſketeers, muſk-cat-ears—dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:024456_0094_0FC735A37A9D0140"/>
dragons—battalions, battle lions; and that he really thought theſe ſtrange things were made uſe of in war; that all the words ending in <hi>tion,</hi> as <hi>flaggellation, caſtigation, ſalivation,</hi> words he is beſt acquainted with, he ſpelt with an <hi>ſh.</hi> I hate the ſtory they told of him, which, although I was curſedly enraged, I confeſs made me ſmile; that writing to his niece, who was going to be married to an eminent pawnbroker in St. Martin's Lane, he began his letter thus: "My dear Kitty, as you are going to be married, and are ſo very young a girl, I would adviſe you by all means, at leaſt, at firſt, to act with a little <hi>cuſhion,"</hi> meaning it for <hi>caution.</hi> Now I would appeal to all mankind, who are not totally blinded by party and faction, whether it is credible, whether it is poſſible, that a gentleman, who has from his cradle been in ſome ſort a retainer of the Muſes, ſhould be guilty of ſuch groſs, ſuch ridiculous blunders. When I ſay Mr. R— has been a retainer of the Muſes, I do not mean, Sir, in your paltry ſphere, a mere dealer in indexes and title pages. No, Sir, his ſphere has been more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. It is notorious, that when he had finiſhed his ſtudies, he was invited into a ſociety of eminent intinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comedians; I know very well, that his enemies give out, that he only amputated the luminaries betwixt the acts; but I could bring authentic proofs of his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing himſelf in ſome important characters.</p>

               <p>A PAMPHLET, entitled, <hi>A friendly Addreſs to all reaſonable Americans,</hi> advertiſed and ſold by Mr. James Rivington, of New-York, is of ſo extraordinary a nature, that it is difficult for any man who is intereſted in the welfare of the community (whatever contempt he may have for the performance) to remain ſilent. I know not whether the author is a layman or eccleſiaſtic, but he bears ſtrongly the characters of the latter: he has the want of candour and truth, the apparent ſpirit of perſecution, the unforgiveneſs, the deadly hatred to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and the zeal for arbitrary <hi>power</hi> which has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed churchmen in all ages, and more particularly the high part of the Church of England. I cannot help, therefore, conſidering him as one of this order.</p>
               <p>The deſign of his Reverence's pamphlet, is manifeſtly to diſſolve the ſpirit of union, and check the noble ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, prevailing through the continent; but his zeal ſo far outruns his abilities, that there is the greateſt reaſon
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024456_0096_0FC735A68965A3C0"/>
to think that he has laboured to little effect. His diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to be ſtill leſs than his genius; a man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judgment would not ſo wantonly have attacked the general reigning principle and opinions of the people, whom he intends to intimidate or ſeduce out of their rights and privileges. For inſtance, I believe there are at leaſt ninety-nine Americans in a hundred, who think that Charles the Firſt was an execrable tyrant; that he met with no harder fate than he deſerved; and that his two ſons ought, in juſtice, to have made the ſame exit.</p>
               <p>To deſcant, therefore, on the criminality of the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made to that tyrant; to affect, on every occaſion, giving the title of rebellion to the civil war which brought him to juſtice, is a degree of weakneſs which no man who is not blinded by the daemon of Jacobitiſm could poſſibly be guilty of. But to preach up in this enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened age, as he does in almoſt expreſs terms, paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is a mark of lunacy, or at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaſt it proves that the moment a head begins to itch for a mitre, it loſes the faculty of reaſoning; for if the principle of paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is admitted, the gracious prince, for whom his Reverence profeſſes ſo great a devotion, is a downright uſurper, and the parliament, of which he ſpeaks ſo reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectfully, Lords and Commons, are rebels and traitors.</p>
               <p>The doctrines he aims to inculcate are as follows: "That the parliament has a right to tax you without your conſent; that the duty upon tea is no tax; that this duty is your only grievance; that the cauſe of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is their own concern; that it is not your cauſe; that the puniſhment of Boſton is a juſt puniſhment; that it is lenient; that it is not equal to their crimes; that the Boſtonians are rebels, traitors, and pampered fanatics; that the Congreſs are little better; that no miſconduct of adminiſtration can juſtify or excuſe open diſreſpect; that ſubmiſſion is to be paid to the higher powers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever character they be; that an apoſtle enjoined ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the tyrant Nero; that of all people under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the king's American ſubjects have the leaſt cauſe for complaint; that the preſent confuſion of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:024456_0097_0FC735AF79015688"/>
have been occaſioned by falſe alarms; that none of your legal rights have been invaded; no injury has been done you; and, conſequently, that you can never be juſtified in reſenting that of which you have no reaſon to complain; that you are no judges of the rights of Parliament; that the Parliament ought to act according to their own judgment, not according to yours, even in things which concern you principally or ſolely; that they aſſert they have the right in queſtion; that you have never proved they have not; that you have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or allowed they have, until the preſent occaſion; that the Quebec Bill is a juſt and conſtitutional bill; that the Canadians are likely to prove the beſt and moſt loyal ſubjects in his Majeſty's American dominions; that there is too much reaſon to believe, that the minds of the Americans are unprincipled, and their hearts diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for rebellion; that, ſince the reduction of Canada, they have been bloated with a vain opinion of their own power and importance; that the iſland of Great Britain is able to govern (that is, to dragoon) ten Americans; that the moment it is known that America is no longer under the protection of Great Britain, all the maritime powers of Europe would join to ravage your ſea-ports, plunder and ſeize your ſhips, merely for the pleaſure of ravaging; <note n="*" place="bottom">This is perhaps the moſt prepoſterous idea that ever was hatched in a diſtempered brain. America (more particularly ſince the diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Poland have taken place) has been the great granary, or <hi>cella penaria</hi> of Europe. Is it poſſible to conceive, that the different mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time powers ſhould unite to deprive themſelves of the chief means of ſubſiſtence, merely for the fun's ſake? Is it not more natural to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they would outbid each other for your friendſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, on which ſo much depends? When the Low Countries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themſelves from the dominion of Spain, did England, France, and the other powers, immediately ſet about ravaging their ſea-ports and ſeizing their ſhips? Did they not, on the contrary, exert themſelves, directly and indirectly, to aſſiſt them? The caſe is ſimilar; the event would be ſimilar, and that Great Britain would not be powerful enough at ſea, when ſeparated from her colonies, to prevent this aſſiſtance, I ſhall refer my readers to Maſſie's Eſtimates, the authority of which has never been diſputed, and which demonſtrate that more than half the naval power of Great Britain ſtands on her American foundation.</note> that all the maritime powers of the world
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024456_0098_0FC735B10273E248"/>
would not diſpoſſeſs Great Britain of the empire of the ſea, even when America is ſeparated from her." Now I challenge the world to produce ſo many wicked ſentiments, ſtupid principles, audaciouſly falſe aſſertions, and monſtrous abſurdities, crouded together into ſo ſmall a compaſs. All his poſitions, indeed, are ſo ſelf-evidently abſurd and falſe, that it would be an inſult to American underſtanding, ſeriouſly to attempt refuting them. I ſhall only beg leave to take notice of the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous argument he uſes to prove the duty on tea to be no tax: it is, that <hi>unleſs we conſent to the tax, we are not to pay the duty; we may refuſe purchaſing it if we pleaſe.</hi> The ſame logic would demonſtrate that a duty on beer, candles, or ſoap, would be no tax: as we are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely obliged to drink beer, we may drink water; we may go to bed before it is dark, and we are not forced to waſh our ſhirts. His aſſertion that Great Britain, when divorced from her colonies, will ſtill hold the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the ſeas, in ſpite of all the powers of the world, is ſtill more ingenious. It amounts to this, <hi>that without the poſſible means of procuring timber, iron, planks, maſts, pitch, tar, or hemp, to furniſh out a ſingle frigate, they may build more ſhips than all the world put together; that when her nurſery for ſeamen is deſtroyed, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce on which the exiſtence of ſeamen depends is annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they will then be able to man more fleets than the whole univerſe put together.</hi> But I am aſhamed of treſpaſſing on the public patience, in making ſtrictures on ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous articles; I ſhall therefore paſs to ſome queſtions which have not been ſo much agitated, and on which, if I miſtake not, his Reverence lays the greateſt ſtreſs; for, as he modeſtly declares, that he has no opinion of your courage, it was natural for him to conſider intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and terror, as the moſt powerful figures of rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric. <hi>Regular armies from Great Britain, Heſſians, Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verians, royal ſtandards erected, ſkilful generals, legions of Canadians, and unnumbered tribes of ſavages, ſwords fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the front and rear, peſtilence, deſolation, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> are all marſhalled in a moſt dreadful order by this
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:024456_0099_0FC7709936920050"/>
church militant author. But let us ſomewhat minutely examine the picture, and ſee whether, ſtripped of its falſe colouring, it has any thing really terrifying. His Reverence begins with aſſuring us, that there is no room to doubt but that ſuch an army as was employed in the reduction of Canada (that is, an army of 7000 men) would be more than ſufficient for the conqueſt of all the diſaffected American colonies, which are, in fact, all the colonies, ſhould <hi>ſuch</hi> a reſolution become neceſſary in order to reduce them to obedience. For my own part, I think there is a very great reaſon to doubt that 7000, even of the beſt troops, are able to conquer 200,000 of the moſt diſorderly peaſantry upon earth, if they are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in defence of every thing they hold moſt dear and ſacred; and there is ſtill greater reaſon to doubt that 7000 very indifferent troops, compoſed of the refuſe of an exhauſted nation, few of whom have ſeen action of any kind, ſhould be able to conquer 200,000 active, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous yeomanry, ſired with the noble ardour we ſee prevalent through the continent, all armed, all expert in the uſe of arms, almoſt from their cradles. The ſucceſs of Quebec, it is true, does infinite honour to the Engliſh arms; the army was, I believe, only 7000; the enemy were perhaps more than double, but 16,000 men are not 200,000. The fate of Canada depended upon one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive action, but it is impoſſible to calculate how many victories muſt be gained before the Colonies could be ſubdued; whereas a ſingle victory gained by the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies muſt decide the conteſt in their favour. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of Quebec, there is another circumſtance to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; it was a Wolfe who commanded, a man of the moſt wonderful talents, formed to level all difficulties, to render the moſt deſpicable ſoldiery almoſt inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly an army of heroes. In ſhort, the genius of the man was ſo extraordinary, the event was ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that no inferences can be drawn from it; but this, without preſumption, may be aſſerted, that no general, now exiſting in the Britiſh ſervice, would, with double or treble his number, have ſucceeded in the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:024456_0100_0FC770A117FC6568"/>One thing more I muſt add in honour of that illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſonage, that the ſame greatneſs of ſoul which qualified him to conquer the natural hereditary enemies of this country, would have made him reject with horror the hangman's office; which others, who are not endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with conquering attributes, will, with readineſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>

It is, on the other hand, remarkable, that all the advocates for ſtanding armies, all thoſe who are the fondeſt of the faddling and parade of war, are the moſt active in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing real ſervice.</p>
               <p>This tremendous ſoothſayer, on the ſuppoſition, that ſo great a miracle ſhould happen in our favour, as that the trifling body of 500,000 men, though firmly united (for every man in America, firmly united, would not amount to leſs) ſhould be able to withſtand his 7000, goes on to rattle in our ears armies of Heſſians and Hanoverians. I wiſh to Heaven he had for once deviated into probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth: I wiſh 10,000 of them could poſſibly be tranſported to-morrow. The purpoſe they would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, is a purpoſe devoutly to be wiſhed for, they would be an addition to this continent of juſt ſo many uſeful and excellent citizens; for I will venture to affirm, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming is infectious, that in leſs than four months not two of theſe 10,000 would remain with their colours. But does not this reverend Gentleman know, that in the year 1764, a convention was formed by moſt of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the empire, at the head of which convention were the emperor himſelf and the king of Pruſſia, to prevent the alarming emigrations which threatened depopulation to Germany? Does he not know, that no troops can march out of the empire without the conſent of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror? Does he not know, that the Elector of Hanover and the Emperor are upon exceeding ill terms? Does
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024456_0101_0FC770A3203898A0"/>
he not know, that the Elector of Hanover and the King of Pruſſia are ſtill upon worſe? Is he ſure that the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of Heſſe would ſell his troops? For, as not one man would return back to their country, he muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as for ever ſold. Is he ſure that, as the finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Great Britain ſtand, the vaſt ſum neceſſary for this purchaſe would be conveniently found? Is he ſure that the ſtate of Hanover would conſent to ſuch a draining of their country? I know not how it is; but his moſt excellent Majeſty George the Third, who in England is juſtly eſteemed the moſt gracious of ſovereigns, the wiſeſt, greateſt, and beſt of kings, is not very popular in the Electorate of Hanover. Theſe people ſeem to think it hard, that 270,000l. ſhould annually be drawn from them, for the purpoſes, as they conceive it, of corrupting the members of St. Stephen's Chapel, in order to ſupport the power and authority of a ſet of men, who, from the beginning, have been enemies to the ſucceſſion of the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over line, and who ſhewed a particular animoſity to their laſt and favourite prince George the Second. But theſe difficulties (great and unſurmountable as to a common mortal they appear) our divine exorciſt has, in an inſtant, conjured down; and by a ſingle motion of his enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wand, has tranſported whole armies in ſpite of their reſpective princes, and without the conſent of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſtates, from the interior parts of Germany, acroſs the Atlantic into the plains of New England and Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania; but he does not confine himſelf to the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of his Germans. He proceeds next to erect the royal ſtandard, to which he tells us, that all who have the courage to declare themſelves now friends to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will undoubtedly reſort; and theſe, he ſays, in a good cauſe, will be of themſelves formidable to their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers. Dreadfully formidable they muſt be indeed! There would reſort to it; let me ſee, for the reſpectable town of Rye, have declared themſelves a kind of neutrals. <hi>rather than friends to government;</hi> there would reſort to it, Mr. Juſtice Sewell, the honourable Mr. Paxton, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier Kuggles, and about eight or ten more <hi>mandamus</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:024456_0102_0FC770A4A2AA67A8"/>
council-men, with perhaps twice their number of expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and not leſs than twenty of the unrecanted Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſonian addreſſers; theſe the four provinces of New England alone would ſend forth. New York would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſix, ſeven, or probably eight volunteers, from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knot, who are in poſſeſſion or expectation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and the fourth part of a dozen of high-flying Church of England Romaniſed prieſts. I repreſent to myſelf the formidable countenance they will make, when arranged under the royal or miniſterial ſtandard; but what will add to the terror of the appearance will be their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Pontifex himſelf, whom I conceive marching in the front, an inquiſitorial frown upon his brow, his bands and canonicals floating to the air, bearing a croſs in his hands, with the tremendous motto, <hi>in hoc ſigno vinces,</hi> flaming upon it in capital letters of blood, leading them on and exciting them to victory. It is impoſſible that men, who are not under an infatuation by the judgment of Heaven, ſhould flatter themſelves, that forty thouſand American yeomanry; for we are aſſured by the ſame great authority, that more than forty thouſand cannot be brought to action, ſhould ſtand the ſhock of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful phalanx.</p>
               <p>But I ſhould beg pardon for attempting to be ludicrous, upon a ſubject which demands our utmoſt indignation. I ſhall now, therefore, on the preſumption that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England ſhould be ſo loſt to ſenſe, virtue and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as to ſuffer their profligate miſ-rulers to perſevere in their preſent meaſures, endeavour to ſtate to you what is their force, and what is yours. I ſhall endeavour to remove the falſe terrors which this writer would hold out in order to intimidate you from the defence of your liberties and thoſe of poſterity, that he and his ſimilars may wallow in ſinecures and benefices, heaped up from the fruits of your labour and induſtry. Great Britain has, I believe, of infantry at home, comprehending Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and excluſive of the guards, fifteen thouſand men. They find the greateſt difficulty in keeping the regiments up to any thing near their eſtabliſhment: What they
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:024456_0103_0FC770A61B2F1758"/>
are able to procure are of the worſt ſort. They are compoſed of the moſt debauched weavers, apprentices, the ſcum of the Iriſh Roman Catholics, who deſert upon every occaſion, and a few Scotch, who are not ſtrong enough to carry packs. This is no exaggeration; thoſe who have been lately at Boſton, repreſent the ſoldiers there (one or two regiments excepted) as very defective in ſize, and apparently in ſtrength. But we ſhall be told they are ſtill regulars, and regulars have an irreſiſtible advantage. There is, perhaps, more impoſition in the term regular troops, than in any of the jargon which iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues from the mouth of a quack doctor. I do not mean to inſinuate, that a diſorderly mob are equal to a trained diſciplined body of men; but I mean, that all the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, neceſſary to form infantry for real ſervice, may be acquired in a few months.<note n="*" place="margin">There cannot be a ſtronger illuſtration of the truth here advanced, than the Pruſſian army. They are compoſed of about one-third of the King's ſubjects, two-thirds foreigners. The third conſiſting of his own ſubjects, are, when the exerciſing ſeaſon is over, which laſts ſix or ſeven weeks, ſuffered to return to their families, and attend to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of huſbandry. Half of the other two-thirds, conſiſting of foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are not only permitted, but encouraged to work at their trades in the garriſon towns, and never touch a muſquet for the reſt of the year. So that, in fact, only one-third are, in the modern language, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led regular ſoldiers: theſe generally make their eſcape the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. It may be ſaid, therefore, that the King of Pruſſia has gained all his victories with a ſort of militia.</note> I mean, that it is very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for men to be cloathed in red, to be expert in all the tricks of the parade, to call themſelves regular troops, and yet, by attaching themſelves principally or ſolely to the tinſel and ſhow of war, be totally unfit for real ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This, I am told, is a good deal the eaſe of the preſent Britiſh infantry. If they can acquit themſelves tolerably in the puerile reviews, exhibited for the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of royal maſters and miſſes in Hyde Park, or Wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleton Common, it is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the late war, ſome of the moſt eſteemed regular regiments were ſent over to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; they were well dreſſed, they were well powdered, they were perfect maſters of their manual exerciſe, they
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:024456_0104_0FC770A7B448B848"/>
fired together in platoons; but fatal experience taught us that they knew not how to fight. While your militia were frequently crowned with ſucceſs, theſe regulars were defeated or baffled for three years ſucceſſively, in every part of the Continent. At length, indeed, after repeated loſſes and diſgraces, they became excellent troops, but not until they had abſolutely forgotten every thing which, we are aſſured, muſt render regulars quite irreſiſtible. The corps ſent from this country, under General Monkton, was, I believe, for its number, one of the beſt armies that ever was led to conqueſt; and yet, if I have been rightly informed, there was not a ſingle regiment of them that could go through the manual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, or, at beſt, they performed it moſt wretchedly. It is likewiſe ſaid, that when, after their glorious and rapid conqueſt of Martinico, they were joined by the ſpruce regiments from Europe, ſuch was their uncooth appearance, that they were ſcarce honoured with the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ſoldiers by thoſe gentlemen. Upon the whole, it is moſt certain that men may be ſmartly dreſſed, keep their arms bright, be called regulars, be expert in all the anticks of a review, and yet be very unfit for real action. It is equally certain, that a militia, by confining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to eſſentials, by a ſimplification of the neceſſary manoeuvres, may become, in a very few months, a moſt formidable infantry. The yeomanry of America have, beſides, infinite advantages over the peaſantry of other countries, they are accuſtomed from their infancy to fire arms; they are expert in the uſe of them; whereas the lower and middle people of England, are, by the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of certain laws, almoſt as ignorant in the uſe of a muſquet, as they are of the ancient catapulta. The Americans are likewiſe, to a man, ſkilful in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inſtruments neceſſary for all military works, ſuch as ſpades, pick-axes, hatchets, &amp;c. Taking, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all circumſtances into conſideration, there will be no raſhneſs in affirming, that this continent may have formed in action, in three or four months, one hundred thouſand infantry; for as to the aſſertion of our friendly
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:024456_0105_0FC770AF006F01F8"/>
adviſer, that <hi>no more than forty thouſand could act to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> I confeſs I do not underſtand it, nor does he, I believe, underſtand it himſelf. If he means, that ſixty thouſand men cannot be ranged in a field, capable of containing only forty thouſand, we ſhall all agree with him; but how, in the operation of a war, upon a vaſt continent, double this number ſhould be a diſadvantage, I can have no conception.</p>
               <p>Let one ſimple general plan be adopted for the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſubdiviſion of your battalions; let them be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed only in ſo much of the manual exerciſe as to prevent confuſion, and accidents in loading and firing; let them be taught to form, to retreat, to advance, to change their front, to rally by their colours; let them be taught to reduce themſelves from a line of fire to a line of impreſſion, that is, from two deep to four, ſix, or eight. This is all ſo eaſy and ſimple, that it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in three months. Let ſome plan of this ſort be adopted, I ſay, and there is no doubt but that, in the time I have aſcribed, you may have an army on foot of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eighty, or an hundred thouſand men, equal to all the ſervices of war.</p>
               <p>Should this be admitted, it will be ſtill objected that you have no able officers to conduct you. I do not know that you have, but is it certain that thoſe ſent to dragoon you have better? I have taken ſome pains to inform myſelf what methods theſe gentlemen, ſaid to be bred to arms, take to qualify themſelves in a ſuperior degree for the profeſſion. What is their rotine of inſtruction? Do they read much? I am aſſured that they do not. From books alone the theory of war can be acquired, and the Engliſh ſervice, in times of peace, affords them no prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical leſſons! for mounting guard once or twice a week, or the preparation for the review of a ſingle regiment, can never be eſteemed as ſuch<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>It is much to be lamented, that the gentlemen of the army do not apply more of the many leiſure hours they have upon their hands, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The majority of them are of a generous diſpoſition, which did they cultivate, by converſing with the great hiſtorians and orators of antiquity, and the more liberal political writers of our own country, a handing army would be ſomething leſs an object of jealouſy to all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous citizens. We might perhaps ſee them, inſtead of being advocates and partizans of the preſent miniſtry, a check upon their wickedneſs. I am inclined to think that few, or none, of the officers have conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to inform themſelves of the merit of the preſent conteſt. Let me conjure them, for once, to read coolly and candidly the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; afterwards to lay their hands upon their hearts, and anſwer, whether the people of America in general, and of Boſton in particular, are moſt ſinneſt againſt, or ſinning?</p>
                     <p>Now I am upon the ſubject of the officers of the army, I take the opportunity of mentioning, with the reſpect due to him, one gentleman of high rank among them. His general conduct while in command was ſo liberal, and his letters quoted in the Houſe of Commons, were ſo fair, candid and friendly to the Continent, that he is entitled to the thanks of America. He is indeed of a country that owes not only its proſperity, but its exiſtence, to the ſame principles, which actuate America.</p>

But the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the civil war in the year 1641, furniſhes us with the ſtrongeſt inſtances, that excellent officers may be ſoon formed from country gentlemen, citizens, lawyers, and farmers. The parliament's army, or as our prieſtly writer would call them, the rebellious republicans, were chiefly compoſed of this claſs of men. In the beginning of this war, they were treated with the ſame affected contempt, and almoſt in the ſame opprobrious terms as you, the people of America, are by your friendly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent adviſer.</p>
               <p>Whoever would infer from the tenor of theſe papers, that the writer is deſirous of precipitating, or could look with indifference upon the calamities of a civil war, does him great injuſtice.

He execrates the memory of thoſe men, to whom they may be juſtly attributed; but he is perſuaded that they never

originated! at leaſt in ſtates of any conſiderable extent, in the turbulent diſpoſitions of the people, nor in the arts of demagogues, but in the oppreſſion of their rulers, in the wantonneſs, folly, pride, or avarice of kings, miniſters, or governors. The Griſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers of Switzerland, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of Holland, the Lauds and Staffords of England, were the undoubted authors of the tragedies, acted in their reſpective countries; and if this continent ſhould be ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the blood of a ſingle citizen, it can never be charged to the unreaſonable pretenſions of the people, but to the Barnards, Hutchinſons, and ſome other traitors of a ſimilar ſtamp.</p>
               <p>He is convinced, that being prepared for a civil war is the ſureſt means of preventing it; that to keep the ſword of your enemies in their ſcabbards, you muſt whet your own. He is convinced, that remonſtrances, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prayers, and ſupplications, will make no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on our callous court, and abandoned parliament. England, Ireland, America, even Guernſey, Jerſey, and Minorca, are witneſſes of their inefficacy. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that fear alone can operate; there are ſymptoms that it already begins to operate. The monſter, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, begins to pant; preſs her now with ardour, and ſhe is down. Already the miniſtry have expreſſed in their letter an inclination to make ſome conceſſions, to meet you half-way, which I ſuppoſe, may be conſtrued thus, "that as they find they have it not in their power to eſtabliſh, by force, the deſpotiſm which they aimed at, they ſhall be very well ſatisfied if you will juſt cede ſo much of your rights and privileges as will enable them, by extending their pecuniary influence, and ſapping your virtue, to take away the reſt at their leiſure."</p>
               <p>There now remains, people of America, one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, however it may be taken, I think it my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to offer. Hiſtory tells us, that the free States of Greece, Thebes, Sparta, Athens, and Syracuſe, were all in their turns, ſubjugated by the force or art of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. They almoſt all, in their turns, recovered their liberty and deſtroyed their tyrants. The firſt act, upon
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024456_0108_0FC770BA527B6E18"/>
the recovery of their liberty, was to demoliſh thoſe badges of ſlavery, citadels, ſtrong-holds, and military te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements; the Switzers did the ſame; the people of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, loſt in corruption and lethargy as they are, could never be prevailed upon to ſuffer barracks amongſt them; even the courtly Blackſtone is ſtartled at the idea. No ſeparate camps, no barracks, no inland fortreſſes, ſays he, ſhould be allowed; in fact, wherever bricks are, freedom cannot be ſaid to exiſt, or ſhe exiſts ſo lamely, as ſcarcely to deſerve the name.</p>
               <p>It is worthy your conſideration, Americans, whether theſe badges ſhould remain or no. I ſhall now conclude, brave citizens, with invoking the Almighty God, from whom all virtues flow, to continue you in that ſpirit of unanimity and vigor which muſt inſure you ſucceſs, and immortalize you through all ages, as the champions and patrons of the human race.</p>

It may be ſaid, this is all declamation; it may be ſo, but it is a declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which an honeſt zeal in the public cauſe has forced me into. It is now time, gentlemen, to deviſe ſome means of putting a ſtop to this cancer before it ſpreads to any dangerous degree. You, gentlemen, of Virginia, and your neighbours of Maryland, have perhaps theſe means in your hands. I would propoſe then, that after a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited manifeſto expreſſing your abhorrence of the council,<note n="*" place="margin">I cannot perſuade myſelf that the council were unanimous in this infamous addreſs; there are individuals amongſt them of known probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſenſe, and patriotiſm.

Some of them have great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts for wheat and corn in theſe provinces, from Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Alexandria, Cheſter, Baltimore, and other parts. They export prodigious quantities, and enrich themſelves conſiderably by this commerce. I would propoſe that all commerce with theſe aſſaſſins ſhould be laid immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under an interdict; that not a ſingle ſhip belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a counſellor of New-York, unleſs he purges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by oath from having conſented to the addreſs, or of one of the proſtitute eleven, ſhould be furniſhed with a freight within the capes Henry or Charles; and I have that opinion of the virtue of theſe provinces, to think your injunctions would be efficacious. But here I muſt beg leave to pauſe for an inſtant, and aſk pardon of the public for my apparent preſumption. An individual who offers his thoughts to ſo reſpectable a body, as a Congreſs, delegated by the voice of a whole people, has certainly the air of preſumption. It is in ſome meaſure attributing to himſelf ſuperior lights and abilities; but, on the other hand, it is allowed, that an individual has frequently been fortunate enough to chalk out lines in which the moſt ſagacious and reſpectable bodies have not diſdained to walk. If his propoſals, or hints, be weak and abſurd, they will naturally be laughed at; but if his intentions be honeſt, the conſciouſneſs of having acted from motives of rectitude and the love of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, will ſufficiently compenſate for any ridicule which his ſchemes can incur. I would therefore wiſh, that what I offer ſhould rather be underſtood as hints than advice. If theſe hints are attended to, I ſhall reap no perſonal glory; if they are deſpiſed, I ſhall be no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſufferer, as my name will probably never be known. But to proceed with my propoſals, or hints, in which letter light I am moſt deſirous they ſhould be conſidered, I could wiſh, to the above-mentioned manifeſto, was ſubjoined the warmeſt letter of thanks to the virtuous ten of the Aſſembly of New-York, for their endeavours

to ſtem the profligacy and wickedneſs of the majority, and for the noble part they have acted as true Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and excellent citizens; that another addreſs, no leſs warm, ſhould be preſented to the gentlemen and people of New-York at large, expreſſing your opinion of their honeſty and public ſpirit, and lamenting their peculiar circumſtances; which to thoſe who are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to theſe circumſtances, may inculcate a belief that they done are exceptions to the character of patriotiſm, which the Americans are now indiſputably entitled to. But above all, I could wiſh that it were recommended to every province of the continent, more particularly to their immediate neighbours of Pennſylvania, the Jerſies, and Connecticut, not to ſuffer one of this depraved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decemvirate to ſet his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The opithets proſtitute, profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, &amp;c. which I have ſo freely made uſe of, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably appear illiberal; but, when we conſider the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous conſequences which the conduct of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Aſſembly-men of New-York are fraught with, it muſt be allowed, that no language can furniſh oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious terms adequate to their delinquency. I am far indeed from apprehending that their weight and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are ſufficient to ſhake the virtue of the continent, or occaſion any defection. I do not believe that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, much leſs a ſet of men, will be found who will be ſtupid and wicked enough to tread in their ſteps; the infamous *** of Philadelphia, and a ſmall perverſe drivelling knot of Quakers, who form his Senate and Court, excepted.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Worthy</hi> fixed his reſidence at New-York, with the profeſſed intention of working, with ſome congenial ſpirits in that city, towards the ruin of the whole fabric which the Congreſs had been raiſing. Indeed, it is moſt probable that he was the principal compiler, if not the dictator, of theſe wretched addreſſes. The ſtyle and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents

               <p>It may now be aſked, as I have repreſented the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, weight and credit of theſe eleven Aſſembly-men, of the majority of the Council of New-York, and their Philadelphian coadjutor, or, more properly, dictator, in ſo deſpicable a light, wherefore ſhould I found the alarm? What miſchiefs can poſſibly reſult from the utmoſt ſuch men can do? I anſwer, that although they can neither occaſion any defection, nor preſent the leaſt proſpect of ſucceſs to the enemies of America and liberty, they can do very conſiderable miſchief; they can procraſtinate the iſſue; they can, and moſt probably will, prolong the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies which we muſt, more of leſs, feel during the conteſt. There is nothing more certain than thee the miniſtry have proceeded to the enormous lengths they have done upon the preſumption, that the attacks upon Boſton would not have been taken up by the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as the cauſe of the whole.<note n="*" place="bottom">That this is the principle they acted upon is now put out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute by the conduct of Lord North in the Houſe of Commons, and ſome ſpeeches directed to him.</note> There is, therefore, nothing more certain, than that the appearance of our firmneſs and unanimity, muſt ſoon have overthrown them, or forced them into a total change of meaſures; but the leaſt appearance, that this firmneſs and unanimity no longer ſubſiſts, will encourage them to perſiſt, and will enable them to keep their ground ſome time longer. Theſe addreſſes of New-York will give this appearance; ſo that whatever the gentlemen, that merchants, the tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the mechanicks, and the people of America at large, ſuffer from the prolongation of the conteſt, whatever ſhall be added to the diſtreſſes and burthen of the people at home, whatever ſhall further impair the commence, ſtrength, credit, and reputation of the mother country,

               <head>ON A FAMOUS <hi>TRIAL</hi> IN THE COURT OF <hi>COMMON PLEAS,</hi> BETWEEN <hi>GENERAL MOSTYN,</hi> GOVERNOR OF <hi>MINORCA,</hi> AND AN <hi>INHABITANT</hi> OF THAT ISLAND.</head>
               <p>IT is a maxim with the Emperors of China, when the people of any of their provinces offer up complaints of their governors, immediately to recal them, to hear the charges brought againſt them, and, if they are found guilty, to puniſh them in proportion to their delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and ſuch is the parental complacency of thoſe eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern monarchs for their ſubjects, that even when the grievances complained of prove ill-founded, the governor who has had the misfortune, though innocently, to incur the ill-opinion of the people, is never more employed, in the ſame capacity, over that or any other province, his having been <hi>ſuſpected</hi> of mal-adminiſtration being deemed a total diſqualification. Though the juſtice of this maxim may not be univerſally admitted, it certainly is a wife one, as it is founded on a reſpect and deference of the public wiſhes; to which, when it can be done com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patibly with the public ſafety, that prince ought to pay the greateſt regard. But, how different has been the rule of conduct obſerved through the whole preſent reign! Does a governor render himſelf completely odious to the people over whom he is ſet to preſide?—he is that inſtant adopted a favourite at court. The infamous Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, who was not only arraigned, but ſtands convicted, in the opinion of all mankind, of one continual ſeries of miſrepreſentation, falſehoods, treachery, and every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of treaſon to the people of his government, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until the laſt poſſible moment; and, when recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024456_0115_0FC770CD49036750"/>
ſo far from meeting with the cenſures he had merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was exalted to the rank of a baronet, and had an ample proviſion made for him in Ireland. And this public reward for delinquency has had the effect which muſt naturally be expected; for his ſucceſſor in office, it is reported, pitches many bars beyond him in perfidy and wickedneſs, for which he probably expects an Iriſh peerage. And, to ſay the truth, if our court acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with itſelf, they are obliged, as his merits are ſtill greater, to confer on him a higher title, and a more ample proviſion than on the boronet, his predeceſſor.</p>
               <p>If we turn our eyes towards Ireland, the dencency and kindneſs exhibited by the court for that people is ſtill more ſtriking. The late viceroy, by talents peculiar to himſelf, almoſt on his firſt landing, incurred the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and deteſtation of the whole kingdom, to a man, This was a ſufficient, and, apparently, the only motive of his being continued for a long five years in his ſtation; for, what other motive can be conjectured? As it is agreed, on all hands, that even the wretched expedients from day to day, little jobs and larcenies, as well as the more ſubſtantial plundering, called, in the cant of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, buſineſs of government, were never ſo miſerably bungled through as by this ridiculous mock-majeſty. At length, however, a ſucceſſor is appointed: at length, under the protection of the whole military, he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the juſt reſentment of the people whom he had oppreſſed, beggared, and inſulted; and at length, thus circumſtanced, he is preſented to his ſovereign, by whom he is careſſed, ſmiled upon, and preferred in ſo diſtinguiſhed a manner, that a ſtranger who had been preſent, would have been apt to imagine him returned loaded with the ſpoils of ſome ancient inveterate enemy of his country, and not with the injuries and execration of a whole nation of loyal and affectionate ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Such has been the mode of treating the grievances of our natural brethren of Ireland and the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and a ſtill more comfortable proſpect is opened to our fellow ſubjects who are not of a Britiſh extraction.

The Canadians, the inhabitants of the ceded iſlands, and of Minorca; theſe people are told, that if their property is invaded, or their perſons inſulted, they are to ſeek redreſs from the King and Council. Are ſome late oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences calculated to give them confidence in thoſe from whom they are to ſeek redreſs? Let us, without exaggeration or perverſion, ſtate the caſe of General Moſtyn and Mr. Fabrigas. General Moſtyn is accuſed by Fabrigas of violently and illegally throwing him into priſon, and afterwards baniſhing him the iſland, for no other crime than petitioning againſt a regulation which he conceived to be prejudicial and grievous. The cauſe is tried: the allegation not only proves juſt in its full extent, but aggravated with a variety of wanton, cruel circumſtances.—Fabrigas, a ſubſtantial farmer, is thrown into the dungeon appropriated to fellons convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of capital crimes; the ſentinels receive ſtrict orders not to allow the leaſt refreſhment to be conveyed to him; oven the air-hole is guarded, leſt ſome of his children or friends ſhould drop a loaf of bread, or a bunch of grapes.</p>
               <p>Having lain in this miſerable dungeon for ſome days, he is at length, hand-cuffed and pinioned, drawn forth, and, by the ſimple fiat of this ſmart, lively miniature of God's vicegerent on earth, John Moſtyn, Eſq. hurried on board a ſhip <note n="*" place="bottom">He was baniſhed for a year to Carthagena. His wife, as they were carrying him on board, appeared on the beach with a matraſs, but the guard was ordered to drive her away with their bayonets; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of a matraſs being brought too great an indulgence.</note> prepared for the purpoſe, and interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the fire and water of his native iſland, until it ſhould pleaſe the ſaid little, mighty John Moſtyn, Eſq. to ſuſpend the interdict. And it was thought a wonderful act of clemency, not only by his viſier, the moſt accurate, judicious, liberal, veracious Mr. Wright,<note n="‡" place="bottom">His ſecretary. This gentleman was aſked in court, whether it was a part of the governor's privilege to behead or hang? and replied, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly, he believed it was. The chief engineer, eſteemed a man of ſome ſenſe and learning, ſeemed to be of the ſame opinion.</note> but by another illuſtrious member of the divan, in thus commuting the bow-ſtring or hatchet into the gentle ſentence of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

for theſe worthy miniſters gave it as their opinion, openly in an Engliſh court, that ſtrangling and behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was a part of his Highneſs's prerogative. But I ſhould beg pardon for attempting to be ludicrous upon an occaſion ſo very ſerious, not indeed becauſe a man of Mr. Moſtyn's ſtamp, a contemner, and, as far as a very little wit will enable him, a ridiculer of all publick ſpirit and ſentiment, a deſerter of his noble friend and patron,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lord Rockingham; to whom Mr. Moſtyn owed all his great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments; he oppoſed his patron when miniſter, becauſe he knew it would pleaſe the cabinet.</note> on the firſt appearance that he no longer poſſeſſed the power of ſerving him farther.</p>
               <p>That a man of this ſtamp ſhould be intoxicated with authority, and run into violence and abſurdity, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from immediate checks, is not to be wondered at, nor that ſuch a governor ſhould be furniſhed with a dull mercenary ſecretary, ready to execute the mandates of his principal, be they ever ſo iniquitous and prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; but that there ſhould he found a ſingle officer of rank, of no deſpicable parts, and ſome reading, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, adviſe and juſtify meaſures ſo repugnant to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our conſtitution and the rights of mankind, is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, and in the higheſt degree alarming: for, if ſuch notions become faſhionable amongſt the military, our laws are but a parapet of paper, which the ſword is ready to cut through on the firſt hint from a dictator. The idea, I ſay, of ſuch principles becoming faſhionable in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, muſt give the moſt ſerious alarm to every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al who does not wiſh annihilation to the preſent liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe iſlands, and enſlavement to their poſterity. But what follows, is more particularly a matter of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly concern to our fellow ſubjects, the coloniſts of America, the Canadians, and the people of Minorca. They are, it ſeems, if aggrieved, to ſeek redreſs from the king and council; but if they have reaſon to think that their redreſſers will become partiſans of thoſe who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, what muſt be the ſituation of their minds? Will they not naturally deſpair, and reſign themſelves

paſſively to the hand of power, or bravely attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves? To one of theſe alternatives, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance immediately ſubſequent to Mr. Moſtyn's trial, muſt tend to reduce them. Reeking with the infamy of being convicted by an honeſt jury of his country, he dared to preſent himſelf at the levee of her firſt magiſtrate, where he, who is the head, and in fact creates and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creates this court from which redreſs and equity are to flow, he, who ſhould conſider himſelf as the corrector of abuſes, and avenger of wrongs, could attempt to be face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious on the occaſion. Well, General, ſays the King, ſo you have been caſt; and who were the council em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by your doughty adverſary? The General, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran courtier, long accuſtomed to royal waggery, ſmartly replied, the learned ſerjeant Glynn, and the profound duke of Richmond. This was prodigiouſly witty, that the whole circle, lords of the bed-chamber, maids of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and privy council, all burſt into a loud laugh.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is to be obſerved, that the Treaſury paid General Moſtyn's da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</note>

               <p>ON Monday the 23d of November laſt, the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Major General Conway ſet out from this city,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024456_0119_0FC770DA70FA0278"/>
on his return to France. The hiſtory of the treatment this gentleman had received, is ſo ſingular that it muſt make a figure in the anecdotes of mankind. He was born in Ireland, but at the age of ſix was carried into France; was bred up from his infancy to the profeſſion of arms; and, it is univerſally allowed, by the gentlemen of the nation, that he has, in their ſervice, the reputation of being what is ſtiled <hi>un tres brave major d' infanterie,</hi> which is no ſmall character. It implies, if I comprehend the term right, a man poſſeſſed of all the requiſite quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to fill the duties of a general officer in the ſecondary line, but by no means ranks him among thoſe favoured mortals to whom it has pleaſed God to give ſo large a portion of the ethereal ſpirit, as to render reading, theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and practice unneceſſary; but with the ſpectacle of this phaenomena Heaven entertains the earth but very ſeldom; Greece, as hiſtorians report, had but one;<note n="*" place="bottom">Alexander; Henry the Fifth; and the Prince of Conde. It may be diſputed, however, whether theſe heroes were indebted to the gift of Heaven alone for their glories. Alexander ſerved ſome campaigns under his father Philip, had Ariſtotle for his maſter. Henry, before he became king, diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the civil wars againſt the houſe of Northumberland, and, if I recollect right, commanded in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt the Welſh; and the Prince of Conde had leſſons from the great maſters formed in the ſchools of the wars in the Low Country.</note> Rome none; England and France, only one each.— As to this hemiſphere, I ſhall be ſilent on the ſubject, left I ſhould be ſuſpected of not being ſerious. But be this as it may, it is paſt doubt that General Conway is a man of excellent underſtanding, quick and penetrating, that he has ſeen much ſervice, has read a great deal, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted well what he has read. It is not leſs certain, that he embarked, with the warmeſt zeal, for the great American Cauſe, and it has never been inſinuated, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by thoſe who have the talent of confounding cauſes, that his zeal has diminiſhed. His recompence has been, What? he has loſt his commiſſion; he has been refuſed the common certificate, which every officer receives at the expiration of his ſervices, unleſs his delinquencies have been very ſubſtantial indeed. And for what crime?
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024456_0120_0FC770DBF04ADE88"/>
For none, by any law, or the moſt ſtrained conſtruction that can be put on any law; the reaſons given are ſo far from being ſubſtantial, that they really ought to reflect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on his character. It ſeems he has been accuſed of writing a letter, to a confidential friend, communicating an opinion that the commander in chief was not equal to the great taſk he was charged with. Is this a crime? The contrary. If it was really his opinion, it was decent, it was honeſt, it was laudable, it was his duty. Does it come under any article of war? I may venture to affirm, that it does not. God help the community that ſhould be abſurd enough to frame a law which could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued into ſuch a ſenſe; ſuch a community could not long ſubſiſt. It ever has been, and ever ought to be, the cuſtom in all armies, not abſolutely barbarians, for the officers of high rank minutely to canvaſs the meaſures of their commander in chief; and if his faults or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes appear to them many and great, to communicate their ſentiments to each other; it can be attended with no one bad conſequence; for if the criticiſms are unjuſt and impertinent, they only recoil on the authors; and the great man who is the ſubject of them, ſhines with redoubled luſtre. But if they are all well founded, they tend to open the eyes of the Prince or ſtate, who, from blind prejudice, or ſome ſtrange infatuation, may have repoſed their affairs in hands ruinouſly incapable. Does any man of ſenſe, who is the leaſt acquainted with hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, imagine that the greateſt generals the world ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced have eſcaped cenſure? Hanibal, Caeſar, Turene, Marlborough, have all been cenſured; and the only Method they thought juſtifiable of ſtopping the mouths of their cenſors, was by a freſh exertion of their talents, and a perpetual ſeries or victories. <hi>Laiſſons parler ces hableurs l'eſpere, que nous leur fermerons la bouche a force des vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toires,</hi> was the anſwer of the king of Pruſſia to thoſe worthy Gentlemen, who thought to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by informing him, that ſome of his meaſures were made very free with by certain officers in his army. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is obſervable, that in proportion to the capacity

or incapacity of the commander in chief, he counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or diſcountenances the whole tribe of talebear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, informers, and pickthanks, who ever have been, and ever will be, the bane of thoſe courts and armies where they are encouraged, or even ſuffered. Allowing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington to be poſſeſſed of all the virtues and military talents of Epaminondas, and this is certainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a great deal, for whether from our modern edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or perhaps the modern ſtate of human affairs, it is difficult to conceive that any mortal in theſe ages ſhould arrive at ſuch perfection; but allowing it to be ſo, he would ſtill remain mortal, and of courſe ſubject to the infirmities of human nature: ſickneſs or other caſualties might impair his underſtanding, his memory, or his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and, in conſequence of the failure, he might adopt meaſures apparently weak, ridiculous, and pernicious. Now, I demand, ſuppoſing this certainly a poſſible caſe, whether a law, the letter or ſpirit of which ſhould abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſeal up the lips and reſtrain the pens, of every wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the defection, would not, in fact, be denouncing vengeance againſt thoſe who alone have the means in their power of ſaving the public from the ruin impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if they ſhould dare to make uſe of theſe means for its ſalvation. If there were ſuch a law, its abſurdity would be ſo monſtrouſly glaring, that we may hardly ſay, it would be more honoured in the breach than in the obſervance. In the Engliſh and French armies, the freedom with which the conduct and meaſures of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in chief are canvaſſed is notorious, nor does it appear that this freedom is attended with any bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; it has never been once able to remove a <hi>real</hi> great officer from his command. Every action of the Duke of Marlborough (every body who has read moſt know) was not only minutely criticiſed, but his whole conduct was diſſected, in order to diſcover ſome crime, blunder, fault, or even trifling error; but all theſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent pains and wicked induſtry, were employed in vain; it was a court intrigue alone that ſubverted him; the low military cabals paſſed as the idle wind.</p>

                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:024456_0122_0FC770E1F161CCC8"/>General Wolfe, with whom to be compared, it can be no degradation to any mortal living, was not merely criticiſed, but groſsly calumniated by ſome officers of high rank under him; but that great man never thought of having recourſe to the letter or conſtruction of any law, in order to avenge himſelf; he was contented with informing his calumniators, that he was not ignorant of their practices, and that the only method he ſhould take for their puniſhment, would be an active perſeverance in the performance of his duty, which, with the aſſiſtance of God, he made no doubt would place him beyond the reach of their malice. As to what liberties they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him perſonally, he ſhould wait till he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the rank of a private gentleman, and then ſpeak to them in that capacity.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, it appears, that it never was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be the meaning of the Engliſh article of war, which enjoins reſpect towards the commander in chief; and of courſe it ought not to be underſtood, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that article of the American code (which is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile copy from the Engliſh) is meant to proſcribe the communication of our ſentiments to one another, on the capacity or incapacity of the man on whom the ſafety or ruin of the ſtate depends; its intention was, without doubt, in part, complimentary, and partly to lay ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent reſtrictions on the licence of converſation and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which otherwiſe might create a diffidence in the minds of the common ſoldiery, detrimental to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervice. But that it was meant to impoſe a dead, torpid, idolatrous ſilence, in all caſes whatever, on men, who, from their rank, muſt be ſuppoſed to have eyes and underſtanding, nothing under the degree of an idiot can perſuade himſelf: but admitting, in oppoſition to common ſenſe and all precedents, the proceeding to be criminal; admitting Mr. Conway guilty of it, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent repreſented, which he can demonſtrate to be falſe; in the name of God, why inflict the higheſt, at leaſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative puniſhment, on a man untried and unheard. The refuſal of a certificate, of having honeſtly ſerved, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered

as the greateſt of negative puniſhments; indeed in the military idea, it is a poſitive one.</p>
               <p>And I ſincerely hope, and do firmly believe (ſuch is my opinion of the juſtice of Congreſs) that when they have coolly reflected on the merits and fortunes of this gentleman, they will do him that juſtice, which nothing but the haſty miſconſtruction of a law haſtily copied from another law, never defined nor underſtood, has hitherto prevented.</p>

               <p>COUNT Polaſki is certainly a good ſoldier, or he is not; for my own part, I believe him a very good one. In the firſt place he is a Polander, whoſe genius is adapted to the light or expedite war. In the ſecond place, he has had much practice in the beſt ſchools, and is undoubtedly brave and enterpriſing. If he is not a good ſoldier, as his corps is expenſive, he ought not to be detained; therefore, it is expedient, either to ſend him about his buſineſs entirely, or to make the proper uſe of him; but on the ſuppoſition that he knows his trade, I would propoſe the following ſcheme—That his legion ſhould be immediately completed to twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, four hundred cavalry, and eight hundred light infantry—for theſe eight hundred infantry, that a draft ſhould be made, without loſs of time, from every regiment of the continent, entirely of natives; not ſo young as to be unable to reſiſt the fatigues of this ſort of ſervice, but of the proper age for violent exerciſe and forced marches. Major Lee, who ſeems to have come out of his mother's womb a ſoldier, ſhould be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in this legion, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and to command ſpecifically the whole cavalry. If Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Lee's corps (for I know not their ſtrength) will not, added to the cavalry Polaſki already has, complete them
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:024456_0124_0FC770E70EA511B8"/>
to four hundred, let there be a draft made from the other regiment of cavalry, Moilands, Blands, and Sheldons, all of natives, and the very youngeſt men; becauſe on Polaſki's principle of exerciſe (which I believe to be the beſt in the world) none but very young men are capable of being trained to the manoeuvres; but as it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that either Count Polaſki or Major Lee underſtand the detail of cavalry, on which ſo much depends, let ſome Quarter-Maſters, or Serjeants, who have ſerved in the Britiſh cavalry, (and there are many on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) be found out, encouraged with rank and emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and employed. A corps thus compoſed, with brave and underſtanding officers at their head, ſuch as are Polaſki and Lee, with a few ſubordinate officers, knowing, in the detail, will render more effectual ſervice than any ten regiments on the continent. It would likewiſe put a ſtop, for the future, to that odious, perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious practice of picking the beſt men from every bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, on what are called extraordinary occaſions; which practice has abſolutely no other effect than diſguſting the greater part of the officers of the army, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole diſpirited and unfit for action. I could quote a ſtrong inſtance of the bad conſequences of this cuſtom. Some days before the affair of Monmouth, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Scott was detached with a corps of picked men and officers, to the no ſmall diſguſt of thoſe who were left behind, who could not help conſidering it as a ſort of ſtigma on their character. After this, the Marquis de la Fayette was detached with another corps of one thouſand, picked out in the ſame manner. This body, now conſiſting of twenty five hundred men, inſtead of falling on the enemies' flanks, did, from ſome fatality, abſolutely nothing at all. I was afterwards ordered to march to ſuſtain them, with three ſcanty brigades, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed entirely of the refuſe; and of this refuſe I was under the neceſſity of forming my van-guard on the day of the action of Monmouth; for the picked corps, by the blunders committed, were ſo fatigued that they could ſcarcely move their legs.</p>

               <p n="25">25th. Whether it muſt not appear to every man who has read General Waſhington's letter to Congreſs, on the affair at Monmouth, and the proceedings of the Court-Martial, by which General Lee was tried, that if the contents of the former are facts, not only General Lee's defence muſt be a tiſſue of the moſt abominable audacious lies, but that the whole ſtring of evidences,

                  <p>YOUR American poſts are exceſſive hard upon me, and <hi>mal reglèe's.</hi> You and Montgomery are ſo good as to write to me often from thence. I have been, upon honour, very exact in my anſwers, without having been lucky enough that either of you ſhould have heard from me. This time I hope to be more fortunate, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recommended my letter to the beſt hand. I envy you all the ſervice you have ſeen whilſt I have been in the moſt ſluggiſh inactivity. I have indeed got a ſon, but <hi>cela ne conte gueres.</hi> Our good fortune, and that of our friends, has been indefatigable this year, To-day, we have the news of the ſurrender of Munſter, and the French in Germany retiring, probably into winter quarters. Daun is doing the ſame, and is likely to leave the amazing King of Pruſſia once more in poſſeſſion of Saxony. The Ruſſians, we flatter ourſelves, will move no more. The Breſt fleet is out; Hawke after them, and a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them hoped for, and expected every moment.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:024456_0134_0FC7710511DDFD68"/>
Next year I hope to have ſomething to do in Germany, where they talk of ſending us. I believe you already know my trade—Lieutenant Colonel to George Elliott's Light Dragoons. Being as horſe-mad as ever, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rank of Colonel before, by being the King's aid de camp, I preferred <hi>that</hi> to a young regiment of foot. So many children have of late been made Generals, that we Children-colonels are already very high in the liſt. The riding of this new corps has kept me fully employed this whole ſummer, and I am now come up to town for winter quarters, which the ſeaſon makes much more pleaſant than the country ones. We are all here in grief for the loſs of poor Wolfe. Nobody of that age can be more publicly and privately admired and regretted. The war in America, we are in hopes, will be over very ſoon; if ſo, I ſhall hope then to have the pleaſure of ſeeing you. The French's fighting-days ſeem to be over, or, at leaſt, ſuſpended. Every day produces a change amongſt them, of generals, admirals, and miniſtry; and every thing ſpeaks them to be in the greateſt poverty and diſunion. It don't often happen here, or any where elſe, I believe, but there is certainly at preſent amongſt all here the greateſt ſpirits and unanimity imaginable, and no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of want; much debauch, and good living; ſo pray come amongſt us ſoon. You have the good fortune not only to have ſeen ſervice enough, but moſt of it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. All your friends are well. Adieu, my dear Lee! let me hear from you when you can, and be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that no one can intereſt themſelves more ſincerely about you than,</p>

                  <p>YOU have obliged me very much by a ſecond letter come lately to my hands, and dated at Niagara. We had before received accounts of the reduction of it, and your being in poſſeſſion of the glorious country around; which, by your deſcription, muſt be a paradiſe indeed; and it is much to be wiſhed, it may never again go out of your hands. Our acquiſition this year have been ſo great and important, that it has been thought proper to appoint to-morrow a public thankſgiving-day: and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Amherſt has not got ſo forward as was expected, yet he ſends word he is Maſter of Lake Champlain; which, as we are poſſeſſed of the other ſide of Quebec, muſt bound the enemy between the two in ſuch a manner, as, we conclude here, will diſtreſs them extremely, if not oblige them to make ſubmiſſion, and ſurrender. In Europe, you will have heard Boſcawen fell in with the Toulon fleet, and took four of them; and we are now in hourly expectation of Hawke's overtaking the Breſt fleet, which ſtole out of the harbour the other day, in order, as it is ſuppoſed, to cover a deſcent, either upon Ireland or this country, which they have long threatened us with; but it muſt be a very deſperate game they are playing, ſince, if our ſhips have the luck to come up with them, we have little fear here of their giving them ſuch a blow as will put an end to the naval force of France for ſome time to come.—But I will talk no more of public affairs; it will probably be of greater ſatisfaction to you, to hear of the welfare of your friends and relations, which I am happily enabled at preſent to aſſure you of; for I know not of any exception amongſt them all. My ſon is gone to Turin, and I hope we may preſume upon his health, though we have not lately heard from him; he is to ſtay here five or ſix months, and afterwards to ramble about Italy another twelve-month. Your ſiſter Sidney com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains you do not write ſo often as ſhe wiſhes. I gave her the ſatisfaction of knowing you had favoured me lately with a letter, and that you were well and happy,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:024456_0136_0FC771076E63CB20"/>
as I am willing to ſuppoſe by the ſtrain of your ſtile, which is very lively and entertaining. The books and choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late you deſired, have been ſent to Mr. Calcroft near a month ago, who has taken the charge of them; and I hope they will get ſafe to your hand: But ſure you are not to ſtay on that continent for ever: We wiſh you to come again amongſt your friends, and probably ſome change might be procured, as well as advance, on this ſide of the water, if you deſire it. Lord Granby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in Germany at preſent, and is likely to be at the head of the army on this ſide of the water too, if Ligonier drops; and it is ſuppoſed he cannot laſt a great while longer. The taking of Munſter, which we had advice of the other day, will be of great importance to our allied army, and ſecure them good winter quarters. A great many matches are talked of here in town, ſo that if you do not come ſoon, all our fine young ladies will be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; but I know of none of your more particular acquaintance that have, or are about, changing their ſtate. Pray go on writing to us; nobody better qualified to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain by their letters: I wiſh I had as good a knack on my ſide, for the ſake of your amuſement. Your aunt and couſins beg to live conſtantly in your memory and good wiſhes; they deſire I will aſſure you, you have theirs moſt heartily; and I hope I need not add, that you will invariably have thoſe of your affectionate and obliged uncle,</p>

that I have permitted to torment me whilſt I was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it; and therefore ſhall proceed immediately to thank you for the intelligence it brings me, and the aſſurances it renews of your affection and friendſhips.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have been heartily glad to have heard, my dear Colonel, that his Majeſty's recommendation had been more ſucceſsful in procuring you an eſtabliſhment equal to your merit and wiſhes; but am not at all ſurpriſed that you find the door ſhut againſt you by the perſon who has ſuch unbounded credit; as you have ever in <hi>freely</hi> indulged a liberty of declaiming, which many infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and invidious people have not failed to inform him of. The principle on which you thus openly ſpeak your mind, is honeſt and patriotic, but not politic; and is it will not ſucceed in changing men or times, common prudence ſhould teach us to hold our tongues, rather than to riſque our own fortunes without any proſpect of advantage to ourſelves or neighbours. Excuſe this ſcr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I remember my promiſe, to inform you of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of this place; and had I received a line from you upon the road, ſhould have endeavoured to find time during the diet to have given you a ſketch of the critical and unexpected affairs that agitated us; it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs now, as the public papers and your other correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents here have, doubtleſs, not failed to inſtruct you. The important affair of the diſſidents was rudely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently refuſed; and you cannot be ignorant that thoſe gentlemen have formed two confederations in Poland and in Lithuania, ſupportd by a Ruſſian army of thirty or forty thouſand men, and that we expect a diet extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in the months of Auguſt or September, for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating their demands, to the ſatisfaction of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers who intereſt themſelves in their behalf: and though it is impoſſible to ſay how it will end, yet the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at preſent are much in their favour, and we have all reaſon to think, that it will be conducted without any interruption of the tranquillity of the republic.</p>

The father has acted, on this occaſion, like a prince, and the ambaſſador like a comedian; the latter laughs, and is content with his dexterity, and his flatterers tell him, he is an <hi>habile negotiateur:</hi> but every prudent and impartial man muſt condemn a perſon of his rank and character —father of many children, and paſt the heat of youth— for having committed ſuch an extravagance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>chart du pais</hi> remains pretty much the ſame as when you left us: the ſame friendſhips and the ſame quarrels. You have been the inſtrument of making Lind's fortune; M— has given him the abſolute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and education of Monſ.

                  <p>I am much obliged to you, my dear Calonel, for your offers of ſervice, and am convinced, that you would ſeize any opportunity of being uſeful to me; I don't know in what manner you can do me a greater, than in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of your ſentiments for me. Take care of your health, and huſband well your fortune, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make you happy; and in your happineſs, I ſhall always find a ſincere ſatisfaction.

                  <p>OF all men on earth, you are the laſt from whom I expected to hear, unleſs it was in a paragraph of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Gazette, that ſuch a day Monſ. General Lee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Anglois,</hi> was cut to pieces, defending his Poliſh Majeſty, or in ſome deſperate uncommon attack; or, which was fully as likely, that you was hanged for treaſon, in ſome of the damned arbitrary governments you have been wandering through. But, how ſurprised! when, in the place of this, I received a flattering letter from you, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Dijon. Surely, Lee, the climate of France has produced this wonderful effect. I am ſure in Old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland you would never flatter any man, much leſs one whom you honoured with your friendſhip. Do you not know how apt we all are to forget ourſelves when in power, or upon any ſudden elevation; and how very ready we are to believe all the handſome things that even the moſt abject ſycophants are pleaſed to beſpatter us with? Then, my friend, how much more dangerous muſt it be from a man, of whoſe underſtanding I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had the higheſt opinion? And who is ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his candor and freedom of ſpeech, that they are, to the diſgrace of our day, well known to be his greateſt enemies. In ſpite of what I ſay, I will acknowledge I am proud of your good opinion, though delivered in too flattering a ſtile; but I hope it will have no other effect than to make me endeavour to deſerve it.</p>
                  <p>Taking it for granted, that you will like to know how I bear my promotion, I will give you as impartial an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, in as few words as it is poſſible for a man to give of himſelf. I feel myſelf independent, and a ſlave to ſlaves, obliged to court and flatter men whom I deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe, both for their want of abilities and want of honeſty. I hate power, and thoſe in it, more and more every day. I am plainer in my table and apparel than you ever knew me, without an attempt or wiſh to be rich. I have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and I feel they may one day be under another go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, on the ſpot where their father once preſided.
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:024456_0140_0FC771120B458750"/>
This helps to make me careful, and as tender as poſſible of thoſe entruſted to my care. My actions are as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic as they can poſſibly be made; and I hope my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and friends will never have reaſon to bluſh, or be aſhamed to hear of them. I find the care of a people a more difficult thing than I imagined it to be, and I found myſelf very defective as a legiſlator: the former, perhaps, time may render more eaſy, and I am endeavouring to remedy the latter, by as cloſe an application, to ſtudy the ſpirit of the laws of my country, as is in my power; in the mean time, I am cautious of doing much, leſt I may do more evil than good. This, if I know any thing of myſelf, is truth. How you will like the daubed por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, I know not, nor whether or not, I may not forfeit a part of your good opinion, by the badneſs of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>Having ſaid ſo much of myſelf, I now come to your buſineſs; and in the firſt place, I promiſe you, if it be in my power to do any for you, I will, and with more pleasure than you can aſk me. In the mean time, I can anſwer you ſome of your queries to a greater certainty, by being here, than if I had received your letter in Suffolk Street, where you directed it to me. You deſired to know if it is worth your while to lay out any money on your lands in this iſland; I anſwer, yes. You have half of the very beſt lot on this iſland, or at leaſt as good as any, and were I in your circumſtances, I <hi>would</hi> be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of the whole of it; in that manner I would lay out the firſt money. There are a good many French who live upon it already; but for want of title to the land, they do not improve it as they might: theſe would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a ſmall rent immediately, for which reaſon you ought to appoint an agent; and if you do not like to purchaſe the other half, you ought to come to ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Sir Francis M Leane, either to have a diviſion made of it, or to bear a ſhare of the expences; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

As you have a plentiful fortune, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether or not he has, perhaps better not. To ſuch a man you might give, at an eaſy rent, as much land as he thought would make him a compleat farm. He ought to bring ſome ſervants with him, who ought to be bound for three or four years, he paying them yearly wages, ſomething more than they get in England. He ought to bring likewiſe all the iron parts of every kind of farming utenſils, and all the neceſſary iron work for building him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a houſe; and, beſide that, either money, or a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to purchaſe cattle and a year's proviſions.</p>

                  <p>I RECEIVED two letters from you; one by Mr. Hey, the other by the pacquet: I thank you moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely for both. Your firſt was particularly acceptable, as it gave me an opportunity of renewing and of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my acquaintance with a gentleman, for whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have always had an high eſteem.

I wiſh thoſe who rule at preſent may ſhew, by the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they make for him here, that ſuch qualities are ſtill in ſome requeſt among ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>It was extremely kind of you to remember your friends in our dull worn out hemiſphere, among the infinite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of curioſity, that are ſo exuberantly ſpread out before you, in the vaſt field of America. There is, indeed, abundant matter, both natural and political, to give full ſcope to a mind active and interpriſing like yours; where ſo much has been done and undone; and where ſtill there is an ample range for wiſdom and miſtake. Either muſt produce conſiderable effects in an affair of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and importance. It will be no light miſchief, and no trivial benefit. When one conſiders, what might be

done there, it is truly miſerable to think of its preſent diſtracted condition: But as the errors which have brought things into that ſtate of confuſion are not likely to be corrected by any influence of ours, upon either ſide of the water, it is not wiſe to ſpeculate too much on the ſubject; it can have no effect, but to make ourſelves uneaſy, without any poſſible advantage to the public.</p>
                  <p>Here, as we have met ſo we continue, in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect repoſe. It has been announced to us, that we are to have no buſineſs but the gold coin; this has not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as yet: And if there be nothing further than we hear of intended, it will come on time enough. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics of the continent, which uſed to engage your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo much, attract no part of ours. Whether the American affairs will be brought before us is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
                  <p>Saturday, I heard the Maſſachuſetts petition againſt their governor and deputy, diſcuſſed before council. It was ſpoken to, very ably, by the council on either ſide; by Meſſrs.

The latter uttered a furious Philippic <hi>againſt poor Doctor Franklin.</hi> It requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Philoſophy, natural and acquired, to ſupport him againſt it. I heard that the petition will be rejected. The council was the fulleſt of any in our memory; thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five attended.</p>

that threaten the life of American liberty. Surely a man ſo humane, ſo ſenſible, ſo honourable, ſo indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in his circumſtances, and ſo great from family ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, would never undertake a buſineſs, fit only for an abandoned deſperado, or a monſter in human ſhape, a General Murray, a Macro, or a Ravilliac.</p>
                  <p>I cannot think what detains you ſo far to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at this ſeaſon of the year; without any diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Williamſburg, health, and ſuch as you like for aſſociates, are more certainly to be met with to the Northward; I know not, how you find it, but the older I grow, I become leſs and leſs inclined to new acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Selfiſhneſs and ſycophantry poſſeſs ſo generally the minds of men, that I think the many are beſt avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the few only who are liberal and ſincere, to be ſought for and careſſed. I therefore ſtick ſteadily to the cultivation of my farm, am intimate with few, read when I have time, and content myſelf with ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic comforts as my circumſtances and fortune afford me. I wiſh therefore, moſt anxiouſly, you would come to my retreat, and there let us philoſophize on the vices and virtues of this buſy world, the follies and the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the great vulgar and the ſmall.</p>

In any neighbourhood there is this moment as fine a farm mill, and tract of land to be fold as any in America, and provided it is convenient to you to pay down half the price, I am convinced you may have it a very great bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. It is altogether two thouſand four hundred acres, at thirty ſhillings ſterling an acre; I am ſatisfied you might have it ſo.

I ſuppoſe you have procured from Lord Dunmore his warrant for your five thouſand acres upon the Ohio, that will be very ſoon of conſiderable value. As to the Indians, the behaviour of certain of the white people is beyond all compariſon abominable towards thoſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py natives; not content with quiet poſſeſſion of all the land on this ſide the Ohio, they demand as a prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a peace, all the land between that river and the Miſſiſippi—but this ſtory is too long for a letter, you ſhall know the whole of this iniquitous affair when we meet—the gentleman who does me the favour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you this letter, has the pleaſure of your acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and can very fully inform you of the exceeding wickedneſs and abſurdity of the meaſures purſued, and purſuing, againſt the Indians.

                  <p>I RECEIVED your long letter with great pleaſure, and will anſwer it as fully as I am able. You muſt have miſunderſtood me, in what I ſaid of the bill to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Maſſachuſetts government, if you imagined I had either concurred in, or even forborn to expreſs my ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt diſapprobation of it, when it was depending in the houſe. The fact is ſo much otherwiſe, that I fought it through every ſtage, almoſt alone, when moſt of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were attending the New-Market meeting, or other occupations, equally entitled to be preferred to that duty. I may have ſaid indeed, that I prefer the form of the Engliſh government to that of any other country upon earth, becauſe it appears to me moſt calculated to reconcile neceſſary reſtraint and natural liberty, and to draw the line between them. It is the government I was born under, I am happy to live under, and would willingly die to preſerve and tranſmit entire; but I look upon the firſt principle of that conſtitution to be, that the whole muſt be governed by the will of the whole, and that any government where the authority reſiding with the <hi>few</hi> is ſupported by any other power than that of the <hi>many,</hi> in conſequence of their free concurrence and full approbation, is the worſt of tyranny. Judge
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:024456_0148_0FC7712AD9BF3F60"/>
then, my dear friend, whether I could approve of tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a free and happy people that form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which had been purchaſed with the blood, and eſtabliſhed by the wiſdom of their anceſtors; and of ſubverting that excellent polity, endeared to them by their proſperity, and ſanctified by the moſt laudable of human predilections, a veneration for their anceſtors, and an enthuſiaſm for the permanence of their liberties. <hi>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari,</hi> was the nobleſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ever bore teſtimony to the ſpirit of a free legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. I think it as laudable at Boſton now, as in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſome centuries ago. So far I ſtand upon the ground of natural right and manly feeling—thus much, I ſay, becauſe—<hi>Homo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </hi>—but to deſcend to the humbler ground of policy, nothing can be ſo abſurd, or impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, as to ſhake a frame ſanctified by long poſſeſſion, for the caprice of a moment, or the fancies of a few; to ſacrifice the wiſdom of ages to the preſumption of an hour; and to divert the ſtream of government, which has fertiliſed the country and enriched the people, by ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If therefore I prefer in ſpeculation the government of Virginia to that of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, it is not from thinking that what appears beſt in the abſtract, ſhould be impoſed on all: on the contrary, I am convinced that the minds of individuals and the manners of a people form and adapt themſelves naturally and imperceptibly as the mode of government, under which they are born. The modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of municipal inſtitutions are in themſelves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, provided they are approved by the people; but it is of the eſſence of freedom, and common to all free governments, that the people ſhould be convinced the laws they live under are of their own chuſing; and that there is no power on earth that can prolong their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:024456_0149_0FC7712C35983AE8"/>
or give force to their injunctions one hour, after the diſapprobation of the maſs of the people is ſignified.</p>
                  <p>I have been the more full upon this ſubject, becauſe I would not willingly he miſtaken in my principles upon ſo material a point. Now I am upon the ſubject of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, I cannot help expreſſing my ſurprize that you ſhould have been ſo far miſinformed, as to have believed that I, amongſt the reſt, could ſpeak with "approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſcoundrel Hutchinſon," ſo far from it, that I agree with you in the epithet, and was the <hi>only</hi> perſon in the houſe that declared my deteſtation of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my conviction that his whole conduct had been that of a parricide, who had attempted to ruin his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to ſerve his own little narrow ſelfiſh purpoſes. This I did in ſuch printed terms that I was informed he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

As to the Quebec Bill, I can, with pleaſure, aſſure you, that I oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, with activity throughout; and though I could not overſet it, I was at leaſt fortunate enough to ſet a defeated bound to deſpotiſm; and ſay, ſo far ſhall thou go, and no farther, by drawing the line which protected New-York and Pennſylvania; though I have ſince been told, that Burke takes the merit to himſelf, but upon what grounds I know not, as I propoſed the line without any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with him,</p>
                  <p>As to myſelf, I am out of Parliament, without any proſpect of being in; and though I ſhould have thought it infamous to have deſerted my poſt and not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get in, yet I hardly can ſay, that I much regret any being out there is ſo little proſpect of doing good.</p>

                  <p>The King's ſpeech to both Houſes of Parliament, at the opening of the ſeſſion, clearly evinces the neceſſity of ſpeedy and affectual exertions on the part of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, for the purpoſe of oppoſing, with force of arms, the infamous plan adopted by a venal miniſtry, for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting our moſt ineſtimable privileges.

                  <p>FORTUNE ſeems to be in a good humour with you. It is not enough that you have triumphed over external and internal enemies at New-York, but you are about to enjoy new triumphs in another part of the continent.

I tremble only at the price of victory on the plains of Abraham.</p>
                  <p>I preſage the ſurviving your conqueſts from one part of your character, and that is, you have a wonderful ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of infuſing your ſpirit into the minds of your troops. Should your blood mingle with the blood of Wolfe. Montcalm, and Montgomery, poſterity will execrate the plains of Abraham to the end of time.</p>
                  <p>Your appointment to the Canada expedition gave all your friends here great pleaſure. I think it is more than probable, the principal force of our enemies will be ſent to that quarter. Canada is dearer to the king than all the other colonies put together, as it is the only part of the Britiſh empire in which arbitrary power is eſtabliſhed by law. Should that province become the ſeat of war, we ſhall have no reaſon to complain; for our ſea-coaſts and ſea-port towns are in a poor ſituation to receive our enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Gulph and River St. Laurence, it is to be hoped, will concur with the elements in embarraſſing them. Mr. Pitt conquered America in Germany; who knows but General Lee may conquer Britain in America?</p>

                  <p>YOUR favour of the tenth ultimo, did not reach me till the twenty-ſecond inſtant. I that day wrote you an anſwer by one Mr. Campbell who was on his way, and who promiſed to give my letter a conveyance, if he did

not ſee you. I informed you, that I ſaw no objections to your paying off the incumbrances on your land, and the future payments whenever it is convenient for you to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be happy to ſee the important ſubject of the independence of North America, diſcuſſed in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and able manner you are capable of. I have troubled you with ſome of my crude thoughts, to afford you an opportunity when leiſure will permit, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation lead you, to explain my miſtakes and correct my errors. From the commencement of the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diſpute, I conſidered the ſhedding of blood, if that event ſhould take place, as the aera, at which would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that our anceſtors have fought many battles, and ſhed torrents of blood in ſupport of their conſtitutional rights, and whatever may have been the fate of arbitrary princes, the conſtitution was ever held ſacred, the inſtance of Charles's reign only excepted. The Whigs were then obliged to join with the Tories, in reſtoring royalty in its luſtre to get rid of a phantom which the Independents had raiſed under the name of liberty. The hope of a re-union with our brethren of Great Britain, and of the increaſing grandeur and proſperity of the whole empire, to me, I confeſs, had ſomething agreeable in it. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with eagerneſs inveſtigated the propoſed plan of operations, to enable me to judge of the probable event,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:024456_0153_0FC77139AC2E8C00"/>
and I found, or thought I found, the ſecurity of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, in connection with Great Britain almoſt certainly attainable; at any rate more practicable than the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an independent ſtate; for the following among other reaſons; that the people of America were determinately united in ſupport of that meaſure; that every inſult and injury from adminiſtration only tended to animate and cement; that the greateſt trading cities and moſt reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table characters in England are our friends; that even our enemies in parliament dare not ſtand the attack on the proper ground; but, in order to carry their point, have always inſiſted we were aiming at independency. That the belief of this is the ſole reaſon we have any enemies among the people of England, and though I am of opinion, the governing powers of Britain would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe the colonies totally, than yield one iota of their pretenſions, the people will think very differently when convinced our views extend no further than to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thoſe rights, which they themſelves hold eſſential to liberty. That it would be impoſſible for government to carry on a war againſt the inclinations, and ſo deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the intereſts of the people, as the preſent muſt obviouſly appear, when it is remembered, the cauſe of our conteſt is the aſſumed power of parliament, to tax the colonies, to alter our forms of government, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us to Britain for the trial of ſuppoſed offences, and to make laws, regulating our internal police. That the ſword would even drop from the hand of a Britiſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, if he believed it pointed againſt the breaſt of a man contending for his birth-right. That an attempt to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh an independency would unite England as one man againſt us; and though ſhe is burdened with an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous debt, and deprived of a moſt valuable branch of commerce, ſhe has ſtill great reſources; and it is not eaſy to foreſee the conſequences of the utmoſt exertions of her power. Beſides, it appears to be the intereſt of Europe, that America ſhould remain dependent. The power and importance of England, which by a defection of the colonies, ſhe would loſe, is neceſſary in the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:024456_0154_0FC7713B46244BD0"/>
ſyſtem. Holland and Portugal, I think, owe their political exiſtence to her; and even thoſe ſtates which might wiſh to ſee her depreſſed, were their intereſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Europe, would dread greater evils from the eſtabliſhment of an independent empire in North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the certain conſequences of which would be, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, the loſs of Mexico, South America, and the Weſt India Iſlands, to whomſoever belonging. But it is a neceſſary enquiry, on what terms can our difference be adjuſted which will ſecure us from future conteſts? I anſwer, it is impoſſible. The nature of human affairs is ſuch, that no political ſyſtem can be eſtabliſhed which the folly of weak, or ambition of wicked men will not in time ſubvert. Let Great Britain relinquiſh her claim of internal legiſlation and taxation; let ſtated times be limited for the holding and duration of aſſemblies, and counſellors, dependent on the Crown, he deprived of legiſlative powers, or hold their places during life; and let ſupreme judges be appointed in each colony, to hold their places during good behaviour, with certain and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate ſalaries. All this would be no real injury to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the only advantage ſhe ever did, or ever can receive from America is her commerce, an equitable ſhare of which ought to be ſecured to her by a grand commercial ſyſtem, to be agreed on by the legiſlators of the two countries, and to remain unalterable, except by mutual conſent. Such a plan of accommodation, I think, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers as fair for the permanent ſecurity of peace, wealth, and liberty, as any I have heard, or can deviſe for the government of America in an independent ſtate. I take it for granted, as I have never heard it diſputed, that a popular or democratic government muſt take place, which in its moſt perfect ſtate, I think much inferior to the mixed government of Britain; for I hold it as maxim, that wherever the ſupreme power is veſted in one man, or one body of men, the liberty of the ſubject is at beſt precarious. It appears from hiſtory, that popular fury is as formidable, and often exerciſed with as much injuſtice as royal indignation. Frequent elections are no ſecurity
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:024456_0155_0FC7713CB5E32A80"/>
in this caſe, the ſpirit of the people always influences the repreſentative body, and if a man becomes unpopular, however innocent, his ruin is inevitable. To you I need not give inſtances; neither is it poſſible in ſuch a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, to render the judicial powers totally independent. The ſame body of men who have the appointment of the judges, having alſo the power of removing them, will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry popular prejudice even to the ſeats of juſtice. In this reſpect, England has the advantage of all other nations. In cool diſpaſſionate hours, the three branches of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature concur in enacting laws for the general good of the community. The meaneſt ſubject cannot be puniſhed unleſs he tranſgreſſes thoſe laws, neither can the judges be diſplaced for faithfully executing them, without the like concurrence. This protects individuals equally from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular violence, and the arbitrary meaſures of kings and courtiers. But is America capable of receiving a democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic government? Have we that induſtry, frugality, oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that virtue which is neceſſary to conſtitute it? Laws and conſtitutions muſt be adapted to the manners of the people; they do not, they cannot form them. Whenever the manners change, the laws change with them, or loſe their force. Is not North America too extenſive for a popular government? But I find the ſpirit of the times is againſt a union; we muſt then become a confederacy of republics, each having ſupreme powers within itſelf. Does not this afford a proſpect of perpetual wars and internal feuds, till ſome one colony, or perhaps one man, becomes maſter of the whole continent? Recur to the hiſtoric page, and point out the age and country where this, under ſimilar circumſtances, has not been the caſe? The united provinces being ſurrounded by more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſtates, materially diſtinguiſhes their ſituation from that of theſe colonies. A congreſs or general council for regulating the affairs of the whole confederacy will hardly be ſufficient to maintain peace. There was a general council of the Engliſh Heptarchy, yet that iſland was an uninterrupted ſcene of blood and ſlaughter, till uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under one head.

                  <p>The country being called to arms for the expreſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of defending and ſecuring her conſtitutional liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is there not an inconſiſtency in employing thoſe arms to quite different p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>An apology might well be expected for this trouble; if I had a good one to offer, you ſhould have it. Some ſlight touches on the ſubject, with ſeveral expreſſions of regard interſperſed through your letters of buſineſs, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened me to take this liberty, and further, to requeſt an anſwer.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IMMEDIATELY after I had waited upon you at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, I proceeded to New-York, and finding much difficulty in purſuing my intended journey, I delivered your diſpatches to Mr. Lewis, by direction of Mr. Van B. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſton, and wrote to you at my return, acquainting you therewith. I have not wrote to you ſo frequently as I would do, imagining that your time might be employed better, in matters of greater moment to the public; and where public utility is in queſtion, apologies become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary; be pleaſed therefore to accept the following hints from one who has ſeen ſervice. I am amazed at a ſhip or two laying at New-York for ſome time paſt; I never ſaw two veſſels that lay in more danger were they attacked, and they alſo know it. The Aſia lay long in the North-River, and refuſed to go into the Sound, until Parker, a ſenior captain, was ſent with a ſhip to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him, with poſitive orders from the admiral to join; it may alſo be ſeen by their writing to the mayor, and by Parker's threatening and bullying the town. There are three ways of taking or deſtroying theſe ſhips, could it be kept ſecret: Firſt, by boarding; for as the Aſia muſt ground at low water, the ſprings upon cables would be of no uſe; and, I apprehend, that her lower guns could not range over the wharf when aground, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a few guns with grape-ſhot, run down upon the wharfs, upon her bow and quarters, would effectually ſweep and clear her decks, while the people boarded. Secondly, if there were mortars of even guns to throw combuſtible matter on the decks, into the rigging, to ſtick on her ſides, with grape as before, to prevent extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the guns with the grape would be out of the power of her guns while aground. The third and beſt method, as I imagine, I would undertake myſelf, with a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon to command the detachment, as ſecond in command, or engineer, or conductor of the works, or, as I told you, in any character, ſo that I might be ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="unknown:024456_0158_0FC77145AC00A9E8"/>The method I will here lay down to the beſt of my ability; there is Long-Iſland and Nutten-Iſland, well ſituated to place guns; and, I imagine, three or four hundred men would be ſufficient to compleat in one night all the neceſſary works: The greateſt difficulty would be, to get cannon to Nutten-Iſland, but they might come from the Narrows by night in flats. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> would be impoſſible to point out either the facilities or difficulties of the undertaking in the courſe of a letter; the greateſt difficulty will be, to keep it ſecret from the people of Staten-Iſland, Long-Iſland, and New-York. If this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not ſoon put in execution, they will be reinforced, or they will fall into the North-River; but if there was lodgment with ſome guns upon Nutten-Iſland, with the town battery to aſſiſt, they could not get out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running aground.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the batteries upon Long-Iſland begin to play, there ſhould be ſome of the Connecticut men, or ſome others, ready to run down upon the wharfs, with ſome few guns a-head and a-ſtern, with grape, to clear the decks, and fire into the ports. While loading, the batteries will have this advantage, that they can play by night if clear; this method will ſo harraſs and diſable them that they muſt ſtrike quickly or they will be board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When this affair is finiſhed the men ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately march to the Narrows, and erect a battery that would keep all out, and all in; twenty guns, properly diſpoſed, would ſink any veſſel that would dare attempt to go up, and would be out of the range of all ſhot from the ſhipping. Your cruiſers would find ſhelter and a good harbour. Had this been done laſt ſummer, our enemies at Boſton would have ſtarved before now. There ſhould be a camp formed there early in the ſpring, and two ſtrong forts erected with retrenchments to cover them; for you may depend upon it, there will be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous puſh made early to get up the North River; works upon each ſide would greatly retard and delay their operations; and I doubt not, but defeat the deſign of the campaign. To attack both they muſt divide their
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:024456_0159_0FC771494D36DFA0"/>
army, which would greatly harraſs them; and if they wait to attack them one after another, the campaign is loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, beſides, the attacks made upon them at landing within the vicinity, and perhaps under cover of theſe forts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments; alſo the attacks on their rear, while they are attacking the works. In ſhort, we have every thing in our favour, to defeat the enſuing campaign, if we only begin in time, and conduct matters properly.</p>
                  <p>You want nothing but experienced officers, five h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at leaſt. But to return to the men of war,—that I find ſo much intimidates the people of this country, is a well conſtructed floating battery, formidable and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in her own element at ſea, no doubt; but when oppoſed to the land, only an egg-ſhell. Batteries and guns properly placed will ſoon ſilence them. I will here deſcribe, as well as I can, the batteries of late made uſe of againſt ſhipping; the old batteries in our ports and harbours at home are found almoſt uſeleſs. As they are all built ſimilar or like that at New-York, very low and near the water, whereby the veſſel has all the power over them that ſhe could wiſh, not only from her great guns, but ſmall arms; whereas, quite the reverſe ought to be the caſe; the batteries ſhould be fixed at a diſtance from the water and veſſel, no nearer than two hundered yards if the ground will admit, from the channel, or where the veſſel is to anchor or ſail, and upon ground high enough to be out of the range of her ſhot, if ſuch ground cannot be found take the higheſt you can get, and ſink, or let in your platforms and guns upon the top or ſummit of the hill, the muzzels of the guns, as it were, peeping out of the hill. Thus the men will work their guns when thus ſituated with facility and ſafety, and out of the reach of all ſhot. There is no ſhip in the world that would dare offer to attack or paſs ſuch a battery, if twenty guns were mounted. Theſe are the kind of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries that I would propoſe for all attacks upon veſſels, and what I would make uſe of, upon Long-Iſland and Nutten-Iſland, and though the land is not ſo high as may be wiſhed, yet the ſinking and letting in the guns into

The commanding officers and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer at the Ferry, off and on, to reconnoitre the ground, and view the poſition of the veſſels. I have here thrown a few matters together, in a rough manner; however, I ſhall not needleſsly make any apology for troubling you, as the intention is good. I can aſſure you, that theſe hints, as I call them, are no whim, or production of my own, but are drawn from real practice and experience, which I have often ſeen and helped to execute in rivers, lakes, and harbours, during twenty-eight years ſervice. I cannot diſmiſs the Narrows; the enemy ſhould not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſlip into the heart of the country, without gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by inches: the Narrows are centrical, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereabouts diſpoſed to be troubleſome; it is a moſt deſirable ſituation for an army, as they can act either to the Eaſtward, or Weſtward, together, or ſeparate, and ſupplies can come from all quarters either by land or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A battery placed as beforementioned has great power and command of ſhipping; one ſhot fired in this
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:024456_0161_0FC7714E057B32C0"/>
angular manner from an eminence, will do more execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than twenty fired horizontally; for if the ſhot ſtrike the veſſel on one ſide, between wind and water, they will come out on the other ſide ſome feet below water: in ſhort, their powder-room and all is in danger, nor will the men's lying flat upon the decks ſcreen them. I have had experience of this, acting as a marine officer on b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I beg you would offer my ſervice to the honorable the Congreſs, as one that has ſeen ſervice both in horſe, foot, and marines. There is not an officer in America this day has ſeen more ſervice than I have, both abroad and at home, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring both the late wars.

                  <p>THE bearer, Monſ. Arundel, is directed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to repair to General Schuyler, in order to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him in the Artillery ſervice. He propoſes to wait on you in his way, and has requeſted me to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him by a line to you. He has been an officer in the French ſervice, as you will ſee by his commiſſions; and profeſſing a good-will to our cauſe, I hope he may be uſeful in inſtructing our gunners and matroſſes: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may adviſe in opening the nailed cannon.</p>
                  <p>I received the encloſed, the other day, from an officer, Mr. Newland, who ſerved in the two laſt wars, and was
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:024456_0162_0FC771515915C0C0"/>
known by General Gates, who ſpoke well of him to me when I was at Cambridge. He is deſirous now of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into your ſervice. I have adviſed him to wait upon you at New-York.</p>
                  <p>They ſtill talk big in England, and threaten hard; but their language is ſomewhat civiller, at leaſt, not quite ſo diſreſpectful to us. By degrees they come to their ſenſes, but too late, I fancy for their intereſt.</p>
                  <p>We have got a large quantity of ſalt-petre, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty ton, and thirty more expected. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-mills are now wanting; I believe we muſt ſet to work and make it by hand. But I ſtill wiſh, with you, that pikes could be introduced, and I would add bows and arrows: theſe were good weapons, not wiſely laid aſide:</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. Becauſe a man may ſhoot as truly with a bow as with a common muſket.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. He can diſcharge four arrows in the time of charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcharging one bullet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. His object is not taken from his view by the ſmoke of his own ſide.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. A flight of arrows ſeen coming upon them, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies and diſturbs the enemies' attention to his buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. An arrow ſtriking in any part of a man puts him <hi>hors du combat</hi> till it is extracted.</p>
                  <p n="6">6th. Bows and arrows are more eaſily provided every where than muſkets and ammunition.</p>
                  <p>Polydore Virgil, ſpeaking of one of our battles againſt the French in Edward the Third's reign, mentions the great confuſion the enemy was thrown into, <hi>ſagittarum nube,</hi> from the Engliſh; and concludes, <hi>Eſt res profecto dictu mirabiles, ut tantus ac potens exercitus a ſolis ferè Anglicis ſagittariis victus fuerit; adeo Anglus eſt ſagitti potens, et id genus armorum valet.</hi> If ſo much execution was done by arrows when men wore ſome defenſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, how much more might be done now that is out of uſe!</p>
                  <p>I am glad you come to New-York, but I alſo wiſh you could be in Canada. There is a kind of ſuſpenſe
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:024456_0163_0FC7715340B4C558"/>
in men's minds, here at preſent, waiting to ſee what terms will be offered from England. I expect none that we can accept; and when that is generally ſeen, we ſhall be more unanimous and more deciſive: then your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſolemn league and covenant will go better down, and perhaps moſt of your other ſtrong meaſures adopted.</p>
                  <p>I am always glad to hear from you, but I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your favours, being ſo bad a correſpondent. My eyes will now hardly ſerve me to write by night, and theſe ſhort days have been all taken up by ſuch variety of buſineſs, that I ſeldom can ſit down ten minutes without interruption.—God give you ſucceſs.</p>

                  <p>Laſt night I had the pleaſure to receive yours of the 15th. I am rejoiced you have weathered this fit of the gout; I don't think you will have another this winter, if you was careful in letting that paſs off: it may probably be of much ſervice to your conſtitution. When I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Canada, I did not mean you ſhould winter there; if you can ſecure the entrance into it, by getting Quebec, and poſſeſſing it this ſummer, you may leave the care of that province to your Brigadiers for the winter to come. The General was pleaſed you wrote to him, as he began to think you tardy. He writes to you by this expreſs. I like your intention of making the fort an open redoubt; I think ſome heavy guns upon the ſouth and weſt ſides, with good ſod merlons, will make the men of war keep aloof. It is a pretty high ſituation, and battering it at a diſtance, over the lower batteries, would have but little effect. We have lately had reaſons to ſuppoſe Mr. Howe had thoughts of leaving Boſton; the General will tell you his reaſons for thinking that was intended. Clinton, I am ſatisfied, went to ſee how affairs were circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at New-York, to conſult with Tryon, and to prepare the way for Howe's reception. Unleſs the enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs Canada, they cannot reinſtate the king's affairs on this continent; there is no way to recover Canada, but by the Rivers of St. Laurence and Hudſon. The St. Laurence is not practicable until late in May; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the firſt attempt would moſt aſſuredly be made at New-York: for theſe reaſons, I think your hands ſhould be ſtrengthened as much, and as expeditiouſly as poſſible. I am afraid you are deficient in gun-carriages; employ all the hands you can procure to make them. I am glad you expreſs yourſelf ſo well pleaſed with the Captains, Smith and Badlam; the former has good talents, and will, I hope, prove as faithful as he is capable. Ere long it will be known if I am right in my conjecture, that the great body of the enemy mean to endeavour to take poſt at, or near, New-York. Should that happen to be attempted, be aſſured we ſhall march with the utmoſt expedition
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:024456_0167_0FC7715EE97DB440"/>
to ſupport you. I expect ſoon to ſee Palfrey, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of what I wrote to him, when I hope to hear you are in perfect health. Little Euſtace is well, but nothing is done for him as yet. You know the more than Scotch partiality of theſe folks. I have had much to do to ſupport the lad you put into Colonel Whitcomb's regiment. They have no complaint in nature againſt him, but that he is too good an officer. What, in the name of reaſon, can Hite have trumped up to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a ſuit in Chancery upon? Mrs. Gates and I have puzzled our brains to find it out. The incloſed I deſire you will order to be immediately delivered to the poſtmaſter.

                     <salute>MY DEAR LEE,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOUR favour of the 5th ult. from Williamſburgh, the firſt I have received from you ſince you left this city, came to my hands by the laſt poſt. I thank you for your kind congratulations on our poſſeſſion of Boſton. I thank you for your good wiſhes in our future operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hope that every diabolical attempt to deprive mankind of their inherent rights and privileges, whether made in the Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with diſappointment and diſgrace, and that the authors in the end will be brought to ſuch puniſhment, as an injured people have a right to inflict.</p>
                  <p>General Howe's retreat from Boſton was precipitate, beyond any thing I could have conceived. The deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtores at Dunbar's camp after Braddock's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat was but a faint image of what was ſeen at Boſton; artillery carts cut to pieces in one place; gun carriages in another; ſhells broke here; ſhot buried there, and every thing carrying with it the face of diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as alſo of diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>Immediately upon their embarkation, I detached a brigade of five regiments to this city, and upon their ſailing, removed with the whole army hither except four regiments at Boſton, and one at Beverley, &amp;c. for the protection of thoſe places, the ſtores and barracks there, and for erecting works for defending the harbour of the firſt. Immediately upon my arrival here I detached four regiments by order of Congreſs to Canada (to wit, Poor's, Patterſon's, Treaton's, and Bond's) under the command of Brigadier Thompſon, and ſince that, by the ſame authority, and in conſequence of ſome unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accounts from that quarter, General Sullivan and ſix other regiments, namely, Stark's, Reed's, Wain's, Irvine's, Wind's, and Dayton's, have moved off for that department; the four laſt regiments are of Pennſylvania, and New-Jerſey. The firſt brigade arrived at Albany the twenty-fourth ultimo, and were moving on, when accounts came from thence the twenty-ſeventh. The other brigades muſt all be at Albany before this, as ſome
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:024456_0170_0FC771652E5C5110"/>
of the regiments ſailed ten days ago, and the laſt four, and the winds very favourable. This has left us very weak at this place, whilſt I have my fears that the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement will ſcarce get to Canada in time, for want of teams to tranſport the troops, &amp;c. to Fort George, and veſſels to convey them on afterwards.</p>
                  <p>We have done a great deal of work at this place. In a fortnight more, I think the city will be in a very reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable poſture of defence. Governor's-Iſland has a large and ſtrong work erected, and a regiment encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. The point below, called Red-Hook, has a ſmall, but exceeding ſtrong barbet battery; and ſeveral new works are conſtructed, and many of them almoſt executed at other places.</p>
                  <p>General Ward, upon the evacuation of Boſton, and finding there was a probability of his removing from the ſmoke of his own chimney, applied to me, and wrote to Congreſs for leave to reſign. A few days afterwards, ſome of the officers, as he ſays, getting <hi>uneaſy</hi> at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his leaving them, he applied for his letter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, which had been committed to my care; but, behold! it had been carefully f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rwarded to Congreſs, and, as I have ſince learnt, judged ſo reaſonable (<hi>want of health</hi> being the plea) that it was inſtantly complied with. Brigadier Fry, previous to this, alſo conceiving that there was nothing entertaining or profitable to an old man, to be marching and counter-marching, deſired, immediately on the evacuation of Boſton (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the 17th of March) that he might <hi>reſign his commiſſion on the</hi> 11<hi>th of April:</hi> the choice of the day became a matter of great ſpeculation, and remained pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly myſterious till he exhibited his account, when there appeared neither more or leſs in it, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of three calendar months; the pay of which he received without any kind of compunction, although he had never done one tour of duty, or, I believe, had ever been out of his houſe from the time he entered till he quitted Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="unknown:024456_0171_0FC77167726DE980"/>So much for two Generals: I have next to inform you, that the Pay-maſter-general, Colonel Warren, not finding it convenient to attend the army, from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous employments and avocations in which he was engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, alſo reſigned his commiſſion, and is ſucceeded by your old aid, Palfrey.</p>
                  <p>When I was ſpeaking of the diſtreſſed ſituation of the king's troops, and the Tories, at their evacuation of Boſton, I might have gone on, and added, that their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes did not end here. It ſeems, upon their arrival at Halifax, many of the former wore obliged to encamp, although the ground was covered deep with ſnow; and the latter, to pay ſix dollars a week for ſorry upper-rooms, and ſtow in them, men, women, and children, as thick, comparitively, as the hair upon their heads. This induced many of theſe gentry to return, and throw themſelves upon the mercy and clemency of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, who were for ſending them immediately back, as the propereſt and ſevereſt puniſhment they could inflict, but death being preferred to this, they now wait, in confinement, any other that may be thought due to ſuch parricides.</p>
                  <p>All the ſhips of war have left this place, and gone down to the Hook, except the Aſia, which lays five miles below the Narrows, and about twelve or fourteen from hence. I could have added more, but my paper will not admit of it. With compliment, therefore, to the gentlemen of my acquaintance with you, and with the moſt fervent wiſhes for your health and ſucceſs,</p>

                  <p>I HEARTILY thank you for you letter, and regret that I cannot have the pleaſure of meeting you; the great wiſh of my life is to ſee peace between two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries I almoſt equally love, while it is a queſtion whether this or an inexterminable war is to take place. I meant in words I had learnt from you, to ſet before you the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and mutual advantages both would derive from an agreement; and as the terms now offered are more for the intereſt of your favourite America than you ever ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to obtain, I ſhould have made no ſcruple to aſk your good offices, and to engage my own, to remove any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles that might obſtruct the peace.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould think it a greater honour to contribute in the ſmalleſt degree to this, than to have the greateſt ſhare in bringing about victory: theſe, to a thinking man like you, who has many friends on both ſides, ſubject him to a double regret.</p>
                  <p>I may not find another occaſion of meeting you eaſily, but I would travel far to have the pleaſure of embracing you, as a fellow ſubject of the ſame empire, and a friend. You will ſee by ſome ſpeeches in the Houſe of Commons, that others whom you value have the ſame wiſh. A ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated poem, juſt publiſhed, ſays,

I ſend you the pamphlet.</p>
                  <p>You do Sir H.

                  <p>YOUR kind concern for my health made me happy, and the high approbation you expreſs of my public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct highly gratified my pride. I had the pleaſure of receiving your letter which did me ſo much honour, about the 9th of laſt month. I was then at Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon's near Peterſburgh, where I had gone with Mrs. Page for the recovery of her health. Our trip happily has anſwered our wiſhes, and we are once more fixed at Williamſburgh. It is now four weeks ſince we have received any certain account of the ſituation of affairs in either of the Carolinas. Even your letter to brigadier Lewis countermanding the march of the troops did not arrive here till four weeks after it was written. The regiments had juſt began their march; but had they not been ſcattered abroad on diſtant ſtations, and badly provided with neceſſaries for ſuch an expedition, they would have reached the place of their deſtination before your expreſs could have ſtopped them. It will be worth your while to examine into the occaſion of this. I thought it a matter of ſo much importance to have ſuch orders communicated with diſpatch, that I adviſed the briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to ſend an expreſs to you immediately, to inform you of the unaccountable delay that yours had met with, and to recommend it to you to eſtabliſh a poſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your diſtrict; but he was preparing for an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Gwynn-Iſland, The brigadier ſet out laſt Monday on his way to our camp, attended by the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Woodford, Stephens, Buckner, Weedon, and ſome others, intending to examine into the ſtrength of the enemy, and ſubmit the propriety of an attack to a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of war. They reached the camp that night, and the next day finding that the Dunmore had changed ſtations with the other, and had expoſed herſelf very prettily to the very place where he had been preparing a battery for the Otter, they determined not to loſe this good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of beginning their cannonade, in which they might ſeverely and principally chaſtiſe the noble Earl. At eight o'clock, A. M. Captain Arundel and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

Denny ſaluted the Dunmore and Otter, with two eighteen pounders; the very firſt ſhot at the Otter, though a full mile from our battery, ſtruck her, as it is ſuppoſed, between wind and water, for ſhe did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the fire, but was towed off on the careen. The Dunmore fired a broadſide, and then was towed off, having received four ſhot through her ſides; whilſt ſhe was in tow, ſhe received a fifth through her ſtern which raked her; ſcarcely a ſhot was fired which did not do execution in ſome part of the fleet. A ſchooner loſt one of her maſts. Whilſt lieutenant Denny was firing on the fleet, their battery on the iſland began to play on him, and a ball paſſed through the embraſure; on which he immediately turned his cannon on their battery; for he had taken the precaution to have ſcope enough to take in the fleet, and that part of their battery; and fired three times ſucceſſively into their embraſure, which three rounds compleatly ſilenced that part of the battery; the other part facing our lines on the haven was almoſt as ſoon ſilenced by our battery erected againſt with four nines and three ſix pounders. Part of their camp was a little expoſed to both of our batteries which fired a few rounds into it. This fire was as well directed as that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſhips; for it beat down many of their tents, and threw their camp into the utmoſt confuſion. When this was diſcovered, the brigadier ordered canoes to be brought down, to enable the men to paſs over into the iſland; for, unhappily, we had not a boat on the ſhore: theſe could not be procured till the next day, when a ſmart cannonade began between the batteries; but as ſoon as our men had manned their boats, their fire ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they retired with precipitation to their boats, and eſcaped ſafely to their ſhips, having firſt broken off the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

overboard. We are now in poſſeſſion of the iſland. The fleet has retired, but is in ſight. This might have been a compleat affair, if proper meaſures had been precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed, and the whole tell conducted. Our men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, behaved well, our artillery was admirably ſerved, and we have diſgraced and mortified our enemies. In this affair we loſt not a man; but moſt unhappily poor Captain Arundel was killed by the burſting of a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en mortar, with which he was endeavouring to throw ſhells into the fleet. His loſs is irreparable. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with great ſpirit and activity, and was ſo hearty in our cauſe that he is univerſally lamented. Colonel Stephens is juſt returned from Gwynn's-Iſland; he ſays the enemy carried off all their cannon from their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, except one ſix pounder, which they ſpiked. They left ſix carriage guns in one of the tenders; ſeveral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes and a few whites were taken; two negroes and one of the fourteenth regiment deſerted to us. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners inform, that Lord Dunmore's mate was cut in two by a double headed eighteen pounder, which alſo took off one man's arm and another's leg, and drove a ſplinter into his lordſhip's leg. Tom Byrd was ill of a fever, and was carted off to a boat juſt before our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple landed. They were obliged to burn two fine ſmall veſſels that day, and at night, in the mouth of the river, they burnt alſo a large ſhip, ſuppoſed to be the Dunmore, as ſhe was not with the fleet next morning. The Fowey, it is ſaid, was with the fleet, but did not chuſe to come within reach of our guns. The Roe-buck was at the mouth of Rappahannock. The Colonel ſays, when he came away, the whole fleet had ſailed, and were out of light, and it was uncertain where they are gone; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Maryland? They went off in a bad plight, with out biſcuit or water. Their works were found of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſtruction and conſiderable extent; they were preparing to build houſes and a wind-mill: the had made a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have been interrupted in writing, and before I could return to my ſcrawl, I had the happineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your letter of the third of July. I moſt heartily congratulate you on your ſucceſs; it was a moſt glorious affair—a noble defence! The Britiſh navy has been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily checked in her proud career, and has received a moſt juſt and complete chaſtiſement. What muſt the king think now? The whole continent in arms againſt him, ſeven hundred and fifty of his favourite highlanders, in our poſſeſſion, and his fleets repulſed and diſgraced along our coaſts for two thouſand miles! I hope he will repent and be contented to put up with the loſs of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, or, if he does not, that he may meet with repeated diſappointment. The Marylanders were rouſed by the reſolve of our Convention, and have lectured their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives ſo well, that they have unanimouſly voted for independence—they have no occaſion for our rifle-men on that account: However I can aſſure you, on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſhore of Maryland there has been a conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Tories, inſomuch that Colonel Fleming has been obliged to march with a hundred and twenty men to quell them. We have not yet heard the event of that affair. I have juſt now received another letter from you, and am delighted with your deſcription of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Colonel Moultrie and the garriſon of Fort-Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van. It is not flattery, my dear General, when I tell you, that moſt of us here attribute the glorious diſplay of bravery on that day, to the animating preſence of a commander, who, independent of his great military abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and experience, appeared to be the evil genius of Clinton, who had followed him, and from whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he had ſeemed to retire and retreat along the coaſt, from Boſton to Charleſton. All that I could do, as there were not gentlemen enough in town, to make a council, was to deſire brigadier Lewis to ſend immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

                  <p>It would take a volume to tell you how many clever things were ſaid of you, and the brave troops under you command, after hearing of your late victory. It has given a wonderful turn to our affairs. The loſs of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada had ſtruck the ſpirits of many people, who now begin to think our cauſe is not abandoned, and that we ſhall yet triumph over our enemies.</p>
                  <p>The declaration of independence has produced a new aera in this part of America. The militia of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſeem to be actuated with a ſpirit more than Roman. Near two thouſand citizens of Philadelphia have lately marched towards New-York, in order to prevent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion being made by our enemies upon the ſtate of New-Jerſey. The cry of them all <hi>is for bottle.</hi> I think Mr. Howe will not be able to get a footing in New-York, and that he will end the preſent, or begin the next cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign in Canada, or in ſome one of the Southern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;—the only places in which America is vulnerable. We depend upon Gates in the North, and <hi>you</hi> oblige us to hope for great things from the South.</p>
                  <p>The Tories quiet, but very ſurly. Lord Howe's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation leaves them not a ſingle filament of their cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web doctrine of reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit of liberty reigns triumphant in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. The proprietary gentry have retired to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſeats, and honeſt men have taken the ſeats they abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much in the government of our ſtate.</p>
                  <p>The papers will inform you, that I have been thruſt into Congreſs. I find there is a great deal of difference
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:024456_0180_0FC77181DCC62A48"/>
between ſporting a ſentiment in a letter, or over a glaſs of wine upon politics, and diſcharging properly the duty of a ſenator. I feel myſelf unequal to every part of my new ſituation, except where plain integrity is required.</p>
                  <p>My former letters to you, may paſs hereafter for a leaf of the Sibyls. They are full of predictions; and, what is ſtill more uncommon, ſome of them have proved true. I ſhall go on, and add, that I think the declaration of independence will produce union and new exertions in England in the ſame ratio that they have done in this country. The preſent campaign, I believe, is only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to train us for the duties of next ſummer.</p>

                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING I ſhall probably feel the effect, I do moſt cordially and ſincerely congratulate you on <hi>your</hi> victory over Clinton and the Britiſh ſquadron at Sullivan's-Iſland. A victory undoubtedly it is, when an enemy are drubbed, and driven from a country they were ſent to conquer. Such is the caſe of Clinton and Sir Peter Parker, who are now with the fleet and army at Staten-Iſland, where General Howe and the troops from Halifax have been ever ſince the laſt day of June, and Lord Howe ſince the twelfth of July. Some Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians and a pretty many of the Scottish laddies have got in, and the reſidue of the fleet parted with, off the banks of Newfoundland, hourly expected. When the whole arrive, matters will ſoon come to a deciſion, every thing bong prepared on both ſides for the appeal, and on ours, I hope it will be obſtinate, if not ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>The latter, it is not in the power of mortals to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but they may endeavour to deſerve it; and this I am perſuaded, our troops will more than ever aim at,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:024456_0181_0FC7718843DCB560"/>
as I have impreſſed upon their minds the gallant beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the brave few, who defended Sullivan's-Iſland.</p>
                  <p>At preſent, the enemy can bring more men to a point than we can, and when reinforced by the Heſſians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, as unleſs the militia (faſter than heretofore) come into our aid, their numbers, when the Heſſians ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, cannot, by the beſt intelligence we can get, fall ſhort of twenty-five thouſand men. Ours are under twenty, very ſickly, and poſted on Governor's-Iſland, Long-Iſland, at Powles-Hook, Horn's-Hook, and at the paſs near King's-Bridge; more militia are expected, but whether they will be in time, time only can tell, as alſo where the point of attack will be. An opinion prevails, countenanced by hints from ſome of the principal Tories, and corroborated by intelligence from Staten-Iſland, that part of the enemy's fleet and army will go into the Sound, whilſt another part of it runs up the North-River, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cutting off all communication by water with this place, whilſt their troops form a chain acroſs the neck, and ſtop an intercourſe with Connecticut by land: others think, they will not leave an army in their rear, whilſt they have the country in their front, getting by that means between two fires, unleſs it is extended as a feint to withdraw our troops from the city, that they may ſlip in and poſſeſs themſelves of it: all this is but a field of conjecture.</p>
                  <p>Our affairs in the North have been growing from bad to worſe, till I hope they will mend, as one great ſource of the evil is in a way of being removed, I mean, the ſmall pox; but the army have retreated from place to place, till they are now got to Ticonderoga, oppoſite to which, on the Eaſt ſide of the Lake Champlain, they are about to eſtabliſh a poſt, which they ſay will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable; but whether it may be ſomewhat like the man who built a mill on account of a beautiful fall, and then had to conſider whether it was practicable to bring water to it, remains in ſome meaſure to be determined, as it is the opinion of ſome (I know nothing of the country myſelf) that the enemy may paſs this poſt and
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:024456_0182_0FC7718B2CB461B8"/>
get into Lake George, without receiving the leaſt annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from this work. Whether they would chuſe to leave a poſt in their rear without eſtabliſhing one them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſufficient to keep it in awe, is the point in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It gives me a very ſingular pleaſure to hear of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant behaviour of your young aids, and Mr. Jenefer, as alſo of Colonels Moultrie and Thompſon; to be the means at any time, of rewarding merit, will add greatly to my happineſs; and whenever you can point out a mode that can be abopted conſiſtently, you ſhall find me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This will alſo apply to Captain Bullet. What vacancies there may be in your department that he has his eye to, and could be appointed to with propriety, you muſt know better than I. That there is none here, I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſay. I have no doubt but the Congreſs would annex the rank of colonel to his office of adjutant. I believe they have done it in the inſtance of Griffin, who is appointed deputy-adjutant to the flying camp. If this would add any thing to his ſatisfaction, I ſhould have no objection to the mention of it. With every wiſh for your proſperity and ſucceſs, I remain with ſincere regard,</p>

                  <p>That no miſtakes may be made, you will direct the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting officers, from your diviſion, to provide two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct enliſting rolls; one for thoſe to ſign who engage during the war, the other for thoſe who enliſt for three years, if their ſervice ſhall be ſo long required.</p>

We do not yet know the loſs of killed and wounded on either ſide; but I imagine it muſt have been pretty conſiderable, as the engagement, at ſome parts of the lines, was of long continuance, and heavy.

<pb n="179" facs="unknown:024456_0186_0FC77198304573D0"/>
of America, ſo far as they ate dependant on it, are not totally cut off. You have deciſion, a quality often want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in minds otherwiſe valuable; and I aſcribe to this our eſcape from York-Iſland, from King's-Bridge, and the Plains; and I have no doubt, had you been here, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Mount-Waſhington would now have compoſed a part of this army: and from all theſe circumſtances, I confeſs I ardently wiſh to ſee you removed from a place where I think there will be little call for your judgment and experience, to the place where they are likely to be ſo neceſſary. Nor am I ſingular in my opinion, every gentleman of the family, the officers, and ſoldiers, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, have a confidence in you: the enemy conſtantly enquire where you are, and ſeem to me to be leſs confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent when you are preſent.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Cadwaliader, through a ſpecial indulgence, on account of ſome civilities ſhewn by his family to General Preſcot, has been liberated from New-York without any parole. He informs, that the enemy have a ſouthern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in view; that they hold us very cheap in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the late affair at Mount-Waſhington, where both the plan of defence and execution wore contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If a real defence of the lines was intended, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was too few; if the Fort only, the garriſon was too numerous by half. General Waſhington's own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeconded by repreſentations from us, would, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, have ſaved the men and their arms: but, unluckily, General Green's judgment was contrary. This kept the General's mind in a ſtate of ſuſpenſe till the ſtroke was ſtruck. Oh, General! an indeciſive mind is one of the greateſt misfortunes that can befal an army: how often have I lamented it this campaign!</p>
                  <p>All circumſtances conſidered, we are in a very awful, alarming ſtate, one that requires the utmoſt wiſdom and firmneſs of mind.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the ſeaſon will admit, I think yourſelf and ſome others ſhould go to Congreſs, and form the plan of the new army, point out their defects to them, and, if poſſible, prevail on them to bind their whole attention

to this great object, even to the excluſion of every other. If they will not, or cannot, do this, I fear all our exertions will be vain in this part of the world. Foreign aſſiſtance is ſoliciting, but we cannot expect they will fight the whole battle.</p>
                  <p>I intended to have ſaid more, but the expreſs is wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I muſt conclude with my clear and explicit opinion, that your preſence is of the laſt importance.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM honoured with your favour of the 18th ult. and can aſſure you, that of the merit or demerit of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the affair of Monmouth, on the 28th of June, I have not to this day framed any opinion. I have ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leiſure to attend to the military operations of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and am ſo incompetent a judge of the qualifications neceſſary to conſtitute the character of a general, that I make no judgment at all. But without admitting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that you have made greater ſacrifices in the cauſe of American freedom than any officer of our whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, without a ſingle exception, and that it is not leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that you have ſaved our whole army more than once from deſtruction (the proofs of which are not in my poſſeſſion) I can aſſure you, that I heartily diſapprove of all publications containing perſonal reflections on the character of any gentleman, and eſpecially on thoſe of your rank, in the American army. And if what was preſented to the public, as a mere republication of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per formerly printed by a Virginian, has been, as you ſay, republiſhed with many malicious alterations and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, it is ſtill the more inexcuſable; becauſe all ſuch alterations and additions, beſides their particular malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity againſt you (for which alone I ſhould condemn them) are an impoſition upon the world; and it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:024456_0189_0FC7719D7389E4B8"/>
by every man of honour, be the legal conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what it will, as a downright forgery. I can further aſſure you, that I cannot but diſapprove of Mr. Collins's inſerting the paper you refer to in his Gazette, not only becauſe no printer ought to make his preſs a vehicle for perſonal ſlander, but becauſe he ſet out with a profeſſed declaration againſt diverting his paper to ſuch purpoſes, and has ſo tenaciouſly adhered to that maxim till the publication in queſtion, as to reject, if my information be true, ſeveral pieces on account of the perſonal reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they contained on gentlemen in the ſervice of the enemy, and which the law of retaliation would clearly have warranted him to inſert. And I muſt declare, in juſtice to him, and from what I perſonally know of his humane diſpoſition, and his diſinclination to convey thro' the channel of his preſs any thing injurious to the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of others, that I firmly believe, he has taken the paper, preſented to him as a copy of a republication in Virginia, for a true copy. And it is generally ſuppoſed, by virtue of what law I know not, but perhaps by one as rational as that of deciding controverſies by private combat, in civil communities which reprobate that mode of deciſion, that a printer, by the bare republication of a paper, is not preſumed to adopt the ſentiments; and that, by diſcloſing to the party aggrieved, at whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it was republiſhed, he always averts the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſufferer from himſelf to that perſon. I ſhould, however, be very ſorry to find any of our printers imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>actice of the Britiſh ſubjects in New-York, who, whether they excel us in military diſcipline and courage or not, have, to my certain knowledge, hitherto ſurpaſſed us in printed calumny and detraction.</p>
                  <p>From theſe my ſentiments reſpecting the printers of defamatory papers, I hope, Sir, you will not queſtion my diſapprobation both of the original authors, and the ſecondary propagators, of ſlander. But neither Mr. Boudinot's appointment to, nor depoſition from, his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as commiſſary of our ſtate priſoners, being in my department, it is not in my power to do you the juſtice
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:024456_0190_0FC771A36B2453A8"/>
which you ſeem to expect in that line; nor is there any authority in this ſtate by which he can be-caſhiered, till the next meeting of our aſſembly, which ſtands adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the 19th of May. But the law of the ſtate is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at every one's ſervice; and in the caſe of libels, if we are to credit the Britiſh lawyers, ſo peculiarly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the proſecutor, that the ſcandal is not the leſs penal for being true, than if it was utterly falſe; which, I think, is giving a man as great a chance as can reaſonably be deſired; and perhaps, if you thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to publiſh your letter to me on the ſubject under conſideration, it would be as ample ſatisfaction againſt Mr. Boudinot, as the nature of the offence requires; but that I entirely ſubmit to your better judgment. In a word, Sir, whenever it ſhall be pointed out to me in what manner I can, with any propriety, interfere in the matter, either as governor of this ſtate, or as a private gentleman, I ſhall not heſitate a moment to do you all the juſtice which I conceive you deſerve. In the mean time, <hi>I</hi> embrace this opportunity to re-acknowledge my grateful ſenſe of your friendly intimations, ſome time ſince, of the enemy's peculiar reſentment againſt me, and your kind concern for my perſonal ſafety on that account. I muſt, however, take the liberty to ſay, as a man detached from all parties and wholly devoted to what he thinks the true intereſts of his country, that I ſhould be extremely unhappy in having reaſon to believe what is frequently, and perhaps injuriouſly, reported of you, that you endeavoured to leſſen the eſtimation in which General Waſhington is held by the moſt virtuous citizens of America; and which eſtimation, not, Sir, from a blind attachment to men of high rank, nor from any ſelf-intereſted motive whatſoever, but from a full conviction of his great perſonal merit and public impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I deem it my duty to my country to uſe my utmoſt influence to ſupport.</p>

                  <p>I AM diſtreſſed to think that all your friendly letters and meſſages to me have met with ſuch ungrateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns. I have written two letters to you, one of which was incloſed under a cover, directed to Mr. Wolford, and put into the Poſt-Office; the other was miſlaid and loſt before I could hear of an apportunity of ſending it. You ſee from this, that I have not been unmindful of you. You have wounded me in ſuppoſing that I am carried away by the tide of the times. I would as ſoon be ſuſpected of picking a pocket, as of infidelity in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or idolatry in politics.</p>
                  <p>Major Euſtace informed me of your reply to Preſident Reed's publications. Our printers refuſed to give it a place in their papers: it was beſt for <hi>you</hi> they did ſo. Have patience; time and poſterity will do you juſtice. The ſummer flies that now din our ears muſt ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. Nothing but virtue and real abilities will finally paſs muſter, when the public cool a little from the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into which the great and ſudden events of the late revolution have thrown us. I would rather be one of your dogs in a future hiſtory of the preſent war, than poſſeſs the firſt honours that are now current in America, with the characters which I know ſome of our great men merit. Poor Pennſylvania has become the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpot upon the ſurface of the globe. Our ſtreets, alas! have been ſtained already with fraternal blood; a ſad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, we fear, of the future miſchiefs our conſtitution will bring upon us; they call it a democracy, a mobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy in my opinion would be more proper.

                  <p>THERE are few circumſtances, that give me equal pleaſure to that of hearing from my friends; and as my eſteem for you has ever increaſed in proportion to your misfortunes in the road of perſecution, I am always made happy in a line from you, as it announces your preſent ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Your being robbed of your horſes is a common evil, and its falling harder on you than any other perſon is what I ſhould have expected, from the diſpoſition of wretches always diſpoſed to heap coals on the head of the injured. I am happy ever in having it in my power to inform you of the good eſteem in which you are held in the army; and that they are not now, whatever they have been, inclined to purſue the track of perſecution, beaten ſo bare as it is by creatures whoſe praiſe would be a diſhonour to any honeſt man.</p>
                  <p>Poor Fleury, the other day, called me a-one-ſide to whiſper to me, and after looking round, to prevent a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of being over-heard, he aſked me what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you? I could not help ſmiling, and, in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, telling him you was very well, and that he need not be afraid of acknowledging an acquaintance with General Lee in the moſt public aſſembly in America; that I eſteemed it an honour to call myſelf his friend; that my ſincere attachment to him was amply rewarded by the univerſal approbation of all good and ſenſible men. He anſwered me, he was very glad of it: it was every where known in France that you had been ill-treated, and that every perſon lamented your misfortune.</p>

They make ample amends for the enmities I have drawn upon myſelf from certain powerful quarters in my own country, where, perhaps, from ſome juſt judgment of God, the ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which would recommend to your Majeſty are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obnoxious. I devoutly wiſh, and proudly hope, for my own honour, that I may ever poſſeſs a place in the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:024456_0194_0FC771AC600DFE60"/>
eſteem of your Majeſty, and remain the averſion of thoſe who ſo widely, ſo totally, differ from you.</p>
                  <p>I am concerned I cannot more fully, and in a more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory manner, anſwer the ſeveral queſtions of your Majeſty on the ſtate of our country, than what I am able to do. Of ſome of theſe articles, the cauſe, though ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally treated of, appears not in the leaſt underſtood; on others, opinions are ſo various that it is preſumption to decide; but ſome are, I think, obvious to every man of common underſtanding; and of this claſs may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Mr. Pitt's quitting the ſtage, and the conduct of the American colonies towards the mother country.— With reſpect to the firſt, it is manifeſt, from a thouſand circumſtances, that with the health and frame of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary man, the underſtanding is likewiſe worn out. Before I came to England, I did not lay much ſtreſs on thoſe parts of his conduct which the newſpapers have ſo worried; and I recollect your Majeſty was of the ſame way of thinking, that there was nothing very monſtrous in his acceptance of a peerage, but that it might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, and argued a ſenſeleſſneſs of glory, to forfeit the name of Pitt for any title the king could beſtow. But ſince I am a little more behind the ſcenes, and am made acquainted with ſeveral circumſtances previous, conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant, and ſubſequent to this event, I am apt to agree with the majority of the better ſort, that this once noble mind is quite overthrown. Can it be reconciled to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the ſame man who had rendered his name ſo illuſtrious and ſo tremendous to the greateſt part of the globe, ſhould ſplit upon ribbons and titles; that when he had arrived at a higher pinnacle of glory than ever citizen did ſince the days of Epaminondas, he ſhould be captivated by ſuch a bauble, even though it ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no ill conſequences to the affairs of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? but when ſuch terrible ones were viſible, it muſt be conſtrued downright madneſs. Mr. Pitt, ſay they, was the only man who had capacity, ſpirit, and power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the honour and intereſt of the nation with foreign ſtates, correct the abuſes, and ſtem the torrent of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:024456_0195_0FC771B22A355028"/>
at home. His power was not founded on vaſt property or cabinet favour, but on his popularity. By ſinking into a peerage, his popularity would vaniſh of courſe, and with it all power of rendering, at a moſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical time, any farther ſervices to his country. If it is objected that it is poſſible to accept a title and retain the integrity of the citizen, they allow it; but that, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, the bulk of the people will not be perſuaded of it; that a popular miniſter muſt, therefore, not only be ſtrictly virtuous, but, like Caeſar's wife, his virtue muſt not be ſuſpected; that this perſuaſion of the people, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous as it may appear at firſt ſight, is founded on too much juſtice; for they obſerve, that from the time of Wentworth down to that of Pulteny, not one inſtance can be produced of a man's changing his ſeat from the lower to the upper houſe, without a thorough renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all principles and public virtue; but whether this opinion is well or ill founded, as it is a prevalent one, this revolt, error, folly, or madneſs, of ſuch a man has ſome direful effects; it taints with jealouſy all public affiance, eſtabliſhes a doubt, whether ſuch a thing as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic virtue can exiſt: in ſhort, it makes the bulk of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind indifferent who are in, who are out, as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſuaded that all men are, or will prove, in the end, equally vain apoſtates to the common cauſe, either through intereſtedneſs, vanity, or madneſs.</p>
                  <p>Such are the arguments not only made uſe of by the majority of Mr. Pitt's once admirers, but they were ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by thoſe who were ſuppoſed to have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt weight with him. Lord Camden, in particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding this reſolution to be a ſhort ſit of compliance, and that his friend would ſoon ſee the danger of the meaſure, delayed the ſigning of the patent for two days. But his lordſhip was miſtaken, the diſorder had taken deeper root than he imagined; no girl could ſhew more impatience for a new toy, than this firſt of men did, till the teſtimony of his folly was ſigned and ſealed to the whole world. Your Majeſty will probably object, that though Mr. Pitt played the child in one article, it is no
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:024456_0196_0FC771B32FB3A798"/>
proof of the general failure of his underſtanding; that no man was ever bleſſed with ſo entire faculties, as not, on ſome particular occaſion, and in ſome unlucky moment to betray weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>But this is not the caſe with Pitt, the decay of his parts is not only indicated by the act itſelf, but confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his conduct in public and private character: In public the doctrines he broaches are diametrically the reverſe of what he has, through the whole courſe of his life, aſſerted: In private, he is totally metamorphoſed; from the extreme of plainneſs and ſimplicity, he is all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, magnificence and oſtentation. But I might have ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your Majeſty this prolix detail, when in a few words, it would have ſufficed to have ſaid, that he has fits of crying, ſtarting, and every effect of hyſteric; it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, indeed, that ten years ago, he was in the very ſame condition, that therefore a poſſibility of his recovering once more his nerves, and with them all his functions; but from the age of the man, the generality conſider the piece as finiſhed; the honeſt and well wiſhers of their country lament over him, the corrupt and profligate ſing <hi>Te Deum,</hi> as the Devil probably did for the fall of man. Your Majeſty aſks who is to mount the ſtage in his room? I am ſo far from ſeeing any man ſo qualified in all points, as to fill his part in time of diſtraction and confuſion, that I know no ſet of men who have a chance of being called to it, who will not, by ignorance, obſtinacy, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, throw things into ten times greater confuſion than they are at preſent. My Lord Rockingham is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an honeſt, worthy, and ſpirited man, and poſſeſſes the good opinion of the people in general, but theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes will probably exclude him. The Thane, who is ſtill all powerful, will never admit of a man ſo endowed. He requires a certain degree of ſubſerviency and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance; in ſhort, he requires a miniſter of his own jobs and partialities, and not an adminiſtrator of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional affairs. As to the reſt, who form what is called the oppoſition, they are ſo odious, or contemptible, that the favourite himſelf is preferable to them; ſuch as

Grenville, Bedford, Newcaſtle, and their aſſociates. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is one of the moſt ridiculous order of coxcombs I ever heard of, he is eternally appealing to the public, forgetting that the public never conſidered him farther than they would an old pair of boots, which Mr. Pitt might, through a whim, have ſet a value upon, which when he choſe to throw aſide, it mattered not if they were thrown into a lumber room or the fire. Nothing could make the American coloniſts caſt off their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or even reſpect to their mother country, but ſome attempt on the eſſence of their liberty; ſuch as undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the ſtamp act was, which, if it had remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed, and admitted as a precedent, they would have been ſlaves to all intents and purpoſes, as their whole property would lie at the mercy of the Crown's miniſter and the miniſter's miniſters, the Houſe of Commons, who would find no end to the neceſſity of taxing theſe people, as every additional tax would furniſh the maſter with means of adding to their reſpective wages; but it would be impertinent in me to enter into a diſcuſſion of the propriety or impropriety, the juſtice or injuſtice, of this meaſure, when it is ſo fully and clearly treated in ſome tracts which are bound up together, and which I have ordered to be ſent to your Majeſty. If the humours which this accurſed attempt has raiſed, are ſuffered to ſubſide, the inherent affection which the colonies have for the mother country, and claſhings of intereſts one amongſt another, will throw every thing back into the old channel; which indeed is the caſe already: but if another attack of the ſame nature ſhould be made upon them, by a wicked blundering miniſter, I will venture to prophecy, that this country will be ſhaken to its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in its wealth, credit, naval force, and interior po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation.</p>

                  <p>YOU will do me great injuſtice if you attribute my ſilence for ſo many months to a want of ſenſe of your
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:024456_0198_0FC771BCAC099EE0"/>
exceſſive goodneſs and friendſhip, or even to careleſſneſs, which, conſidering the obligations I lie under to your highneſs, would be one and the ſame thing. The truth is, that I was unwilling to trouble you with a fulſome letter of acknowledgments, as I hope you are no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to my ſentiments on the ſubject; but I thought a few lines which would give you a ſketch of the ſtate of this country, of the parties, and of our proſpect in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to foreign and inferior affairs, would be the only poſſible method of making your Highneſs ſome return for the thouſand inſtances of friendſhip which I have received at your hands; but the moſt reaſonable ſchemes are frequently defeated: ſo it fares with me; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have been in London eight days, which in this political and communicative town is ſufficient, one ſhould think, to make a man maſter of every thing neceſſary to be known; but my evil ſtars have diſappointed me, and your evil ſtars have dictated to me, that, notwithſtanding the inſignificancy of all I have to ſay, it would be a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty treaſon to remain any longer ſilent. You muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accept the will for the deed; in a few poſts I hope to be able to amuſe you better. The King and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are out of town, or more properly, I ſhould have ſaid the miniſters and their King, for I do not find that the latter is any more a principal than when I left Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Lord Chatham is ſuppoſed to be abſolute in all affairs which concern the ſtate; Bute in his corner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains influence to a ſufficient degree, for the proviſion of his creatures and countrymen, in ſubordinate offices; he diſclaims all concern with buſineſs; but this is like the reſt of his conduct, a moſt impudent and ineffectual hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy; for he is, as uſual, not credited. A formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble oppoſition is expected, but the conjectures on its ſucceſs are too vague to be attended to. Some men of weight and reputation are embarked in it; but the heads are too odious to the nation in general in my opinion, to carry their point. Such as Bedford, Sandwich, G. Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, and, with ſubmiſſion, your friend Mansfield. He lately drew upon himſelf the laugh of the Houſe of Lords,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:024456_0199_0FC76D1A7B2DBFF0"/>
making uſe of the word Liberty of the Subject; and expreſſing great regard to it, it was called Satan preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſanctity. Conway is ſtill ſecretary of ſtate, and much regarded as a man of ability and integrity. Lord Shelburne, the other ſecretary, has ſurpaſſed the opinion of the world; he ſpeaks well, and is very diſtinct in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The Duke of Grafton is an abſolute orator, and has a fair character. An Iriſhman, one Mr. Burke, is ſprung up in the Houſe of Commons, who has aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every body with the power of his eloquence, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive knowledge in all our exterior and internal politics and commercial intereſts. He wants nothing but that ſort of dignity annexed to rank, and property in England, to make him the moſt conſiderable man in the Lower Houſe.</p>
                  <p>A diſpute with Portugal, on ſome commercial points, ſeems at preſent chiefly to occupy the thoughts of the miniſtry. It is thought, that an ambaſſador extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, with an eſcort of ten ſhips of war, which is the beſt <hi>ultima ratio,</hi> will be ſent to Liſbon. I have had ſome converſation with our miniſtry on the affairs of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but as this letter goes by the common poſt, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſend you the particulars. The character of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is high in their eſteem. I intreat your Highneſs to preſent my duty to him, to aſſure him of my zeal, veneration, and love; in a few days, I ſhall take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of writing to him, or to Mr. Ogroudſki. I wait till I have had a converſation with the King. Could your Highneſs procure me a copy of his Majeſty's pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, either in miniature, or otherwiſe? I aſk for a copy, as I would not preſume to trouble him to ſit. You would likewiſe make me very happy with your own. I was much pleaſed with an acquaintance with Laviſa at the Hague. His warm attachment to our incomparable maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has much endeared him to me. We have ſome books publiſhed here, which I fancy you would be glad to have, particularly, the whole letters of Swift. They are the beſt hiſtory of the times, and read with great avidity. When the Baltic is open, I ſhall ſend to his Majeſty a

conſiderable number, as he has done me the honour to truſt to my judgment, and drawn on Mr. Tipper for the coſt.</p>
                  <p>I have not heard from our friend Lind; I beg you will chide him for this abominable neglect. Wroughton too deſerves abuſe; I ſhall write to him in a few poſts. The reaſon of Lord Thanet's delay in regard to the horſe, was delicacy. He could not find any he thought good enough; but in the ſpring he will ſend a couple, which will, in all reſpects, ſuit his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>I entreat you, my dear prince, to pay my humble reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to your father, mother, the prince, chancellor, and all your houſe, to which I have ſo great obligations, and for which I have a ſincere love and honour, and that you will ſteal a few moments to give me under your hand what I am already convinced of, that I poſſeſs ſome ſhare of your love and friendſhip.</p>

                     <salute>MR DEAR COLEMAN,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU muſt undoubtedly think me a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſon, that, on a ſlender acquaintance, I ſhould have ſaddled you with the curation of my affairs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards not think it worth my while to write you even a civil note, ſuch as a common acquaintance, who had conferred no obligation, might have expected. The truth is, I have every day expected to be aſcertained of my deſtiny, and then intended to have given you a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial plan of my operations; but as this day is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, in all appearance, as ever, I ſhould be guilty of a monſtrous neglect, in any farther delaying, to pay the tribute of friendſhip which I ſo ſenſibly owe. Believe me, my dear Sir, that I moſt ſincerely love and honour you; and this love and honour is founded on ſo ſolid a
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:024456_0201_0FC76D1F0F8A6C90"/>
baſis, that I have dared to neglect a form which would not be pardoned by a perſon who is not really an object of eſteem.</p>
                  <p>I have been in this place two months waiting for an opportunity to join the Ruſſian army, and I am afraid I ſhall be obliged to wait a month longer. The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications are ſo filled with the offals of the confederates, who are themſelves a banditti, that it is impoſſible to ſtir ten yards without an eſcort of Ruſſians: the Engliſh are leſs ſecure than others, as they are eſteemed the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemies of the holy faith. A French comedian was the other day near being hanged from the circumſtance of his wearing a <hi>bob wig,</hi> which, by the confederates, is ſuppoſed to be the uniform of the Engliſh nation. I wiſh to God the three branches of our legiſlature would take it into their heads to travel through the woods of Poland in bob-wigs.</p>
                  <p>The firſt opportunity that will offer will be the preſent ambaſſador, who, it is ſaid, will now be ſucceeded in ten days; but this has been ſo long ſaid, that I begin to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of any opportunity at all; if none ſhould offer, I have made a wiſe journey of it: I believe it would break my heart. I have an unſpeakable curioſity of ſeeing this campaign, though, in fact, I believe it will be a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous one; if not like that of Harlequin and Scapin, it will reſemble the battle of Wilks and Talbot. The Ruſſians can gain nothing by beating their enemy, and the Turks are confoundedly afraid. I wiſh by practice, to make myſelf a ſoldier for purpoſes honeſt, but which I ſhall not mention. If I am defeated in my intention of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ruſſians, I think of paſſing through Hungary, and ſpending the enſuing winter in the ſouth of Italy, Sicily, or ſome of the iſlands in the Aegean ſea. As you are a ſcholar I venture to talk this cant. As to England, I am reſolved not to ſet my foot in it, till the virtue which I believe to exiſt in the body of the people can be put into motion. I have good reaſons for it. My ſpirits and temper were much affected by the meaſures which I was witneſs of, meaſures abſolutely moderate, laudable and
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:024456_0202_0FC76D21A392EB18"/>
virtuous, in compariſon of what has been tranſacted ſince. To return ſolemn thanks to the Crown for the manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupt diſſipation of its enormous revenues and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent demand on the people: to repair this diſſipation, to compleat their own ruin, is puſhing fervility farther than the raſcally ſenate of Tiberias was guilty of. In this light it is conſidered by all thoſe I converſe with, of every nation, even thoſe who have the leaſt idea of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Auſtrians and Ruſſians hoot at us. In fine, it is looked upon as the <hi>ultimatum</hi> of human baſeneſs, a <hi>conp de grace</hi> to our freedom and national honour.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, it is being a pleaſant correſpondent, giving you my comments on what paſſes under your own eyes, and being entirely ſilent on the tranſactions of this country, which you may be ſuppoſed to have ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of being acquainted with. You will not think me ſerious when I aſſure you, that I am as totally a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to them as yourſelf or any man in England. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey Gates, I am ſure, muſt know fifty times more of the matter. I ſee that the country is in one general ſtate of confuſion, filled with devaſtation and murder. I hear every day of the Ruſſians beating the Confederates; but as to what the Ruſſians, what the Confederates, what the body of the nation propoſe, I am utterly ignorant, though no move, I believe, than they are themſelves. The method of carrying on the war is equally gentle with what our's was in North-America; the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates hang up all the Ruſſians who fall into their hands, and the Ruſſians put to the ſword the Confederates. The Ruſſian Coſſacks have an admirable <hi>ſang froid</hi> in theſe executions. The other day, at a place called Rava, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fifty Confederates were condemned to the bayonet; but as they were tolerably dreſſed, they were obliged to ſtrip for the ceremony, the Coſſacks chuſing not to make any holes in their cloaths. The ſituation of the K— is really to be lamented, notwithſtanding he wears a crown. He is an honeſt, virtuous man, and a friend to the right of mankind. I wiſh he could perſuade a prince of my acquaintance, who is taught (as far as he can be
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:024456_0203_0FC76D24E4C1AB00"/>
taught any thing) to hate them, to exchange with him. I know a nation that could ſpare a whole family, mother, and all to the Poles, and only take in exchange this one man. I could ſay many things on this ſubject, <hi>digna literis noſtris, ſed non committenda ejuſmodi periculo, ut aut interire, aut aperiri, aut intercipi poſſint.</hi>

                  <p>I hope your kindneſs has not entailed any trouble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you with reſpect to my affairs. I hope Mr. Ayre has been punctual in his payment.

If you ſhall paſs by Mr. Hoares, I beg you will tell him, that I wrote to him from Munich, requeſting him to ſend me, if poſſible, a letter of credit to Warſaw, and to give credit to a Captain William Spey, for ſurveying my land in St. John's.

                  <p>I SHOULD write to you with more eaſe and pleaſure, had you not given me to underſtand that you looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as an able letter-writer. The ambition of coming,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:024456_0204_0FC76D25B08A77C8"/>
up to your expectations lays me under a conſtraint which will inevitably make me fall ſhort of every correſpondent. To render myſelf tolerable, I muſt endeavour to forget your ſex, your beauty; but, above all, the high opinion which you are pleaſed to conceive of my talents in this article. That I may not run into compliment, that I may diveſt myſelf of awe and vanity: the firſt you would deſpiſe as fulſome, and the ſecond and laſt would be productive of reſerve and petulance.</p>
                  <p>Your underſtanding and the care you have taken to cultivate it, cuts me off from ſome of the moſt fruitful ſubjects to female correſpondents; the dreſs, intrigues, and diverſions of the women in the ſeveral places we paſs through: but, on the other hand, it affords me ample liberty of pouring out my mind upon ſubjects which, unfortunately for my own eaſe, engroſs it entirely; the dreadful ſituation of all the honeſt part of mankind, and particularly of our own country. How miſerably fallen ſhe is in the eyes of every ſtate! How ſunk are we (in a few months I may ſay) from the ſummit of glory, opulence, and ſtrength, to the loweſt degree of poverty, imbecility, and contempt. Europe is aſtoniſhed at the rapidity of the change; high and low, men of every order, from the miniſters of ſtate to the political barbers, make it the ſubject of their admiration. How can it happen, ſay they, that Great Britain, ſo lately the miſtreſs of the globe, with America in one hand, Aſia and Africa in another, inſtead of the glorious taſk of giving laws and peace to nations, protecting the weak and injured, checking the powerful and oppreſſive, ſhould employ her time in tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the rights of her dependencies, and violating her own ſacred laws, on which her ſuperiority over her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours is founded? It was ſome conſolation, ſay they, for the generous few of the Romans who ſurvived the liberties of their country, that it was a Julius Caeſar, a man with more than mortal talents, who was their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter: and the patriots of England had ſome mitigation for their ſpleen, that it was a Cromwell who had over-reached them; but that * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:024456_0205_0FC76D2D6311F378"/>
ſhould be able to encompaſs the enſlaving of a ſpirited na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe every law ſeems dictated by Liberty herſelf, is too much to bear. They compare the noble remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of the French parliaments againſt the oppreſſions of their court, with the ſlaviſh addreſſes of ours. I muſt confeſs, that inſtead of ſending for cooks and hair-dreſſers from that country, I have long wiſhed that we were to ſupply ourſelves with members of Parliament. What it will come to, I know not, but it is time ſomething ſhould be done, and I flatter myſelf it will: there is much ſpirit in the body of the people; but I will endeavour to quit this ſubject; it makes me mad.</p>
                  <p>This country is the reverſe of ours; they have an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, patriot k—g, but a vicious nation. If God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in ſeeing a virtuous man (as Seneca ſuppoſes he does) ſtruggling with adverſities, he has a charming ſpectacle in the king of Poland: and I hope God will in the end, recompence the inſtrument of his pleaſure, by extricating him out of his diſtreſſes; nothing elſe can, I am ſure. You muſt excuſe me entering into a detail of theſe difficulties, as this letter may poſſibly fall into the hands of the Confederates, and be publiſhed to the nation, as ſeveral others, full as inſignificant, have already been, to the no ſmall detriment of this good man's affairs. I ſhall reſerve them for ſome future letter, or our evenings chat in Queen Anne Street, or Langham.</p>
                  <p>Our ſtation here, I mean thoſe who are about the king's perſon, is whimſical enough. We have few troops, the bulk of theſe totally diſaffected, and the town is full of (though not declared, far from being concealed) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates. We have frequent alarms, and the pleaſure of ſleeping every night with our piſtolson our pillows. I at preſent only wait for an opportunity to join the Ruſſian army: this does not offer every day, as a ſtrong eſcort is neceſſary, the communications being filled with bandit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of robbers, who are the offals of the Confederates. I believe it will be but a ridiculous campaign, ſomething like that of Wilks and Talbot. The Ruſſians can gain nothing by beating their enemy, and the Turks are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundedly afraid.</p>

I am convinced you will not think what I am ſaying as too great a liberty with your brother; I am convinced your ſentiments correſpond with mine; if I thought they did not, I ſolemnly declare, were your beauty and underſtanding greater than they are, I would not write to you. I have no doubt of Mr. Blake's doing his duty. He is not only well diſpoſed himſelf, but in the hands of one who might transform a Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roni into a Cato. He muſt be the devil himſelf, whom a young, beautiful, Engliſh woman, with the ſentiments of a Spartan matron, cannot lead into the way of political righteouſneſs. If women in general were like you, men could not poſſibly be ſuch raſcals. I have long lamented the accurſed prevailing notion, that women ought to have defective educations. It was the moſt cunning fiend in hell who firſt broached this doctrine; which had it not prevailed, the better part of the globe would not have groaned in the wretched ſtate of ſlavery we at preſent ſee it.

                     <salute>DEAR LOUISA,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHEN you firſt requeſted me to give you leſſons in Engliſh, I eſteemed myſelf happy to demonſtrate my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to Madam Kreithin for her ſingular kindneſs to me. I have been ſo uſed to converſe with myſelf and a few favourite books, that I never found it neceſſary to attend the toilets of women, merely as the generality do, to fly from themſelves, and kill the time which they have no other means of employing. This was my original motive; but on one or two converſations with my ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar I entertained a ſort of ambition of adding ſomething to the means of enlightening ſo excellent an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I perceived her to be poſſeſſed of. A little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Engliſh language I conceived to be one of the means, as it abounds with ſo many excellent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing books. For a few days my views were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this; but, O Louiſa! you ought, you muſt, have ſeen this ambition giving place to another leſs tranquil ſentiment. Why did not you check it in its birth, by affecting to find difficulties in the taſk you had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken? Why did you not, on ſome ſuch humane pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, remove me from your ſide before the flame had acquired ſuch inextinguiſhable fierceneſs? This you ſhould in charity have done, as you was determined to treat me as an enemy the moment I declared I loved. Your reſentment at my pretending to more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friendſhip, is futile and vain, or, what is worſe, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and deceitful. You know your own charms, your own power too well. You have proved them with an unhappy ſucceſs on ſeveral, not to be conſcious that it is impoſſible to ſee you often, and to hear you voice, without being forced beyond the bounds of friendſhip. But, to ſpeak proudly, I do not ſee why the declaration of my paſſion ſhould ſo heniouſly offend you. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire you with an equal paſſion for an object deſtitute of any kind of charm, would be ridiculous preſumption: and were I furniſhed with every charm that could capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate womankind, to entertain any hopes which might affect your happineſs or reputation would be the higheſt

                  <p>I WROTE a ſort of ſcrap of a note to you by the hands of Fawkner, and flattered myſelf that I ſhould have found at this place a ſcrap in return. I know your indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence too well, to expect a letter of a ſheet of paper, and do not expect it; but if you know how much pleaſure a ſcrap ſigned by your hand, certifying your health, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and good ſpirits, affords me, I am confident you would from time to time muſter up reſolution to write me a few lines, three will be ſufficient, which I inſiſt on, as a tribute due to friendſhip, which on my ſide I can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to be as pure and genuine as the ſpawn of ſuch a raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally planet as this is capable of; and I have the ſtrongeſt reaſon to think it is not leſs ſo on yours. I muſt therefore repeat it, that I expect a tribute of this ſort every fifth or ſixth poſt. I have been in this happy capital five weeks, waiting for an apportunity to join the Ruſſian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which does not offer every day, for the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are filled by a ſet of gentlemen who are called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, but why or wherefore they are pleaſed to ſtyle themſelves Confederates, I cannot find out. They give no reaſons, they propoſe no plan, but they rob, ſtrip, and generally murder every body who fall into their hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="unknown:024456_0209_0FC76D370D84A5C8"/>You uſed to dine formerly with very knowing wiſe politicians, ſuch as Hanſa, Stanley, and others, who are acquainted with all the ſchemes of all the nations, and all the individuals in Europe; I would requeſt you to give me ſome hints of what theſe worthies intend: You will ſcarcely believe me ſerious, but I do aſſure you, that I knew, before I left London, the ſtate of this country, full as well, if not better than I do here on the ſpot. If Gates is in the way, you will much oblige me, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his opinion. I have greater reaſon every day to congratulate my prudence in having left England; I am perſuaded, had I ſtayed, I ſhould have brought myſelf into ſome curſed ſcrape; even here, at ſo great a diſtance, I am thrown into ſtrange agitations of paſſions on the ſight of every newſpaper. Heavenly God! is it poſſible we ſhould be ſo far ſunk? to return ſolemn thanks for a manifeſtly corrupt diſſipation of ſuch enormous revenues, and an impudent demand on the public to repair this diſſipation, is puſhing ſervility to its <hi>ultima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Thoſe nations who have the leaſt idea of liberty, as the Auſtrians and Ruſſians, laugh and hoot at us;— compare, ſay they, the remonſtrances of the French par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments with the addreſſes of yours, and then dare to pride yourſelves in the ſuperiority of Britiſh ſpirit over their neighbours. It is impoſſible to make the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to theſe charges—I choak with grief and indignation. When I attempt to aſſure them that the body of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtill untainted, that they have ſtill ſentiments of freedom; they anſwer, that ſuch ſentiments are of little conſequence, when courage is wanting to put them in motion. Is not every of your moſt boaſted laws trampled upon, or eluded? Is not perjury, deſolation, and murder, encouraged and rewarded with the national money? Are not your magiſtrates, from the ſole merit of being declared enemies of the law, become factious partizans? Is not the choice of your people in their repreſentatives, treated with contempt and annulled? Are not your citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens maſſacred in the public ſtreets, and in the arms of their houſhold gods, by the military, and the military

As it is in Engliſh, I am in hopes no bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. can ariſe, if it falls into the hands of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates.

not one founded in juſtice; I muſt, it is my duty, to ſpeak freely to your Majeſty. The operations have been miſerably concluded; they opened with a capital defect—without a certainty of the ſtate of the place, (Chotzim) they were deſtined to attack it; they with infinite fatigue and expence marched to the certain (in idea,) reduction of it, without the poſſible means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it. Chotzim is perhaps as ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecure from aſſault as any fortreſs in the univerſe; but muſt inevitably be taken, when attacked with the neceſſary quantity of battering artillery, in forty hours. The hopes of reducing it with our pop-guns ſoon appeared vain; it was then ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly determined to blockade it, but the line of block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade was either broken in part, or totally taken away on every alarm. When the blockade was formed, the grand Vizier was expected with an hundred and fifty thouſand men. If that number was formidable, they ought not to have formed the blockade, but retired at once over the Neiſter, without haraſſing, for no purpoſe, their met and their horſes. If it was not formidable, they ought to have perſiſted in the blockade. In fact, the Ruſſian army, I mean the infantry, brave as it is, was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in number to form a line compleat of circumval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, againſt ſo numerous an enemy; but neither the marching without battering cannon, the blockading the place without a reſolution to perſiſt in it, nor any blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der committed, are ſo liable to cenſure, as the neglect to attack them in their camp. If ſucceſs in war can be aſſured, ours was certainly ſo.</p>

The longer I live, my love for you acquires greater force, perhaps from a cynical diſpoſition, in comparing you with other men. I have long been acquainted with your private virtues, and my opinion of your political virtues is now confirmed. I am only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at your having thoughts of quitting parliament. I know your reaſons, but cannot approve of them. You think, that as you are not a ſpeaker, at you have no turn for buſineſs, your attendance will little avail; that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contribute to ſtem the torrent of corruption and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany which, at preſent, bears down every thing before it. It is this indolent or deſpairing method of reaſoning, of many honeſt men, for I cannot help being perſuaded that there are ſtill many honeſt men, that have reduced us to this terrible ſituation. You know that the God of the Jews, who ſhould have been a judge of Jewiſh affairs, as he interfered in them ſo much, was of opinion that five righteous men were ſufficient to ſave the rotten ſtate of Gomorrah; and I do not find that he meant they ſhould be all ſpeakers. Beſides, the maſs of the people of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah was all polluted, but the maſs of the Engliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple certainly is not. I believe no people was ever poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of more public virtue, which is manifeſt from all their proceedings. I beg, my dear friend, you will not in deſpair quit the deck and get under hatches—work at the pump—hand a rope, doing any thing with good will and firmneſs—encourage others to do the ſame, and with ſo intrepid a pilot, as Sir George Saville, the veſſel may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps work into harbour, notwithſtanding the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſon of the major part of the crew.</p>

                  <p>THE noble part your Lordſhip has acted in oppoſing all the diabolical meaſures of our accurſed <hi>miſrulers,</hi> has encouraged me to addreſs theſe few lines to you. Men who are embarked in the glorious cauſe of liberty ſhould wave all ceremony. I ſhall, therefore, neither trouble you nor myſelf with making apologies. Incloſed I ſend your Grace a copy of the different reſolves of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs (though it is probable you may have received them before) their addreſs to the people of England, to the people of Engliſh America, to the people of Canada, and to the King. They argue ſo irreſiſtibly, and they breathe ſo noble an ardor, that if there is the leaſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding remaining in your iſland, and the leaſt virtue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the former muſt be convinced, and the latter rouſed to action. What could put it into our blockheads heads, that theſe people could be tricked out of their liberties by their cunning, or bullied by any force which they can ſend over? What devil of nonſenſe could inſtigate any man of General Gage's underſtanding to concur in bringing about this deluſion? I have lately, my lord, run through almoſt the whole colonies, from the South to the North. I have converſed with all orders of men from the firſt eſtated gentlemen to the pooreſt planters, and cannot expreſs my aſtoniſhment at the good ſenſe and general knowledge, which pervades the whole; but their elevated principles, their enthuſiaſm in the cauſe of freedom and their country, is ſtill more admirable.</p>
                  <p>I think I ſhould not be guilty of exaggeration in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, that there are two hundred thouſand ſtrong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died active yeomanry, ready to encounter all hazards and dangers, ready to ſacrifice all conſiderations rather than ſurrender a title of the rights which they have derived from God and their anceſtors: But this is not all, they are not like the yeomanry of other countries, unarmed and unuſed to arms; but they are all furniſhed and all expert in the uſe. They want nothing but ſome arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this they are now bent on eſtabliſhing. Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Rhode-Iſland, and Carolina, are forming corps:
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:024456_0214_0FC76D4475A93E60"/>
Maſſachuſetts-Bay has long had a ſufficient number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to become inſtructive to the reſt; even this Quakering province is following the example. I was preſent at a review of ſome of their companies at Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Rhode-Iſland, and really never ſaw any thing more perfect; in ſhort, unleſs the banditti at Weſtminſter ſpeedily undo every thing they have done, their royal paymaſter will hear of reviews and manoeuvres not quite ſo entertaining as thoſe he is preſented with in Hyde Park and Wimbledon Common.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now, my dear Lord, haſten to the main pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this letter: As your Lordſhip is juſtly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as one of the moſt ſtrenuous advocates, and patrons of this country, and one of the moſt active aſſertors of the rights of mankind, I muſt beg leave to propoſe to you, what, had you adverted to, I am perſuaded you would have already adopted; it is to ſet on foot a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription for a relief or an indemnification for the brave ſufferers of Boſton. Theſe people's ſufferings and merit are ſo tranſcendent, that men leſs animated with ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and public ſpirit than your Lordſhip, would exert themſelves in their cauſe. A town conſiſting of thirty thouſand people, perhaps of more eaſe and affluent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances than any other town of the world, reduced at one ſtroke to beggary and wretchedneſs; every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of them deprived of the means of ſupplying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a morſel of bread, but what is furniſhed to them by the precarious hand of charity; to ſee a whole people ſtruggling with the extreme of diſtreſs, not only magnanimouſly, but cheerfully, rather than comply with the wiſhes of brutal tyrants, and thereby admit prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents injurious to mankind and poſterity, is, I ſay, a ſtrain of virtue almoſt too bright for modern eyes to gaze at; and muſt ſill every breaſt, not totally dead to ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and feeling, with rage, indignation, horror, and compaſſion. But they went further; they made a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal offer to the Congreſs, to abandon their town, with their wives, children, aged, and infirm, throw themſelves on the charity of the inhabitants of the country, or build

huts in the woods and never reviſit their native walls, until re-eſtabliſhed in the full poſſeſſion of their rights and liberties. Your Lordſhip will ſee the Congreſs's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on this head: Theſe inſtances, I am ſure, render unneceſſary any thing I could ſay to incite a man of your Grace's ſtamp to exertions in their favour, or, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, in favour and ſupport of human virtue.

                     </gap>ing America without her own conſent, as I am afraid, from what I have ſeen of your ſpeeches, that you have already formed your creed on this article; but I will boldly affirm, had this right been eſtabliſhed by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtatutes, had America admitted it from time imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, it would be the duty of every good Engliſhman to exert his utmoſt to diveſt parliament of this right, as it muſt inevitably work the ſubverſion of the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The malady under which the State labours, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably derived from the inadequate repreſentation of the ſubject, and the vaſt pecuniary influence of the crown.</p>
                  <p>To add to this pecuniary influence and incompetency of repreſentation, is to inſure and precipitate our deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To wiſh any addition, can ſcarcely enter the heart of a citizen who has the leaſt ſpark of public virtue, and who is at the ſame time capable of ſeeing conſequences the moſt immediate. I appeal, Sir, to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to your experience and knowledge of our court and parliament, and I requeſt you to lay your hand upon your heart, and then anſwer with your uſual integrity and frankneſs, whether, on the ſuppoſition America ſhould be abject enough to ſubmit to the terms impoſed, you think a ſingle guinea raiſed upon her would be applied to the purpoſe [as it is oſtentatiouſly held out to deceive the people at home] of eaſing the mother country? Or whether you are not convinced that the whole they could extract, would be applied ſolely to keep up ſtill further the enormous fund for corruption which the Crown al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poſſeſſes, and of which a moſt diabolical uſe is made. On theſe principles, I ſay, Sir, every good Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman, abſtracted of all regard for America, muſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her being taxed by the Britiſh parliament; for my own part, I am convinced that no argument (not totally
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:024456_0217_0FC76D4C6C86F4D0"/>
abhorrent from the ſpirit of liberty, and the Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution) can be produced in ſupport of this right. But it would be impertinent to trouble you upon a ſubject which has been ſo amply, and, in my opinion, ſo fully diſcuſſed. I find by a ſpeech given as yours in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic papers, that it was by the King's poſitive command you embarked in this ſervice. I am ſomewhat pleaſed that it is not an office of your own ſeeking, though, a the ſame time, I muſt confeſs, that it is very alarming to every virtuous citizen, when he ſees men of ſenſe and integrity (becauſe of a certain profeſſion) lay it down as a rule implicitly to obey the mandates of a court, be they ever ſo flagitious. It furniſhes, in my opinion, the beſt argument for the total reduction of the army. But I am running into a tedious eſſay, whereas I ought to confine myſelf to the main deſign and purpoſe of this letter, which is to guard you and your colleagues from thoſe prejudices which the ſame miſcreants, who have infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated General Gage, and ſtill ſurround him, will labour to inſtil into you againſt a brave, loyal, and moſt deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people. The avenues of truth will be ſhut up to you. I aſſert, Sir, that even General Gage will deceive you, as he has deceived himſelf; I do not ſay he will do it deſignedly; I do not think him capable: But his mind is ſo totally poiſoned, and his underſtanding ſo totally blinded by the ſociety of fools and knaves, that he no longer is capable of diſcerning facts as manifeſt as noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſun. I aſſert, Sir, that his letters to the miniſtry, (at leaſt, ſuch as the public have ſeen) are one continued tiſſue of miſrepreſentation, injuſtice, and tortured infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from miſtated facts. I affirm, Sir, that he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no pains to inform himſelf of the truth; that he has never converſed with a man who has had the courage or honeſty to tell him the truth. I am apprehenſive that you and your colleagues may fall into the ſame trap, and it is the apprehenſion that you may be inconſiderately hurried by the vigour and activity you poſſeſs into mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which may be fatal to many innocent individuals, may hereafter wound your own feelings, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

poſſibly ſerve the cauſe of thoſe who ſent you, that has prompted me to addreſs theſe lines to you. I moſt devoutly wiſh, that your induſtry, valour and military talents, may be reſerved for a more honourable and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſervice, againſt the natural enemies of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (to whom our Court are ſo baſely complacent) and not be waſted in ineffectual attempts to reduce to the wretchedeſt ſtate of ſervitude, the moſt meritorious part of your fellow ſubjects. I ſay, Sir, that any attempts to accompliſh this purpoſe muſt be ineffectual. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly ſucceed. No man is better acquainted with the ſtate of this continent than myſelf. I have ran thro' almoſt the whole colonies from the North to the South, and from the South to the North. I have converſed with all orders of men, from the firſt eſtated gentlemen, to the loweſt planter and farmers, and can aſſure you that the ſame ſpirit animates the whole. Not leſs than one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand gentlemen, yeomen, and farmers, are now in arms, determined to preſerve their liberties or periſh. As to the idea that the Americans are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in courage, it is too ridiculous and glaringly falſe to deſerve a ſerious refutation. I never could conceive upon what this notion was founded. I ſerved ſeveral campaigns in America the laſt war, and cannot recollect a ſingle inſtance of ill behaviour in the provincials, where the regulars acquitted themſelves well. Indeed we well remember ſome inſtances of the reverſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly where the late Colonel Grant (he who lately pledged himſelf for the general cowardice of America) ran away with a large body of his own regiment, and was ſaved from deſtruction, by the valour of a few Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians. Such prepoſterous arguments are only proper for the Rigbys and Sandwichs, from whoſe mouths ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver iſſued, and to whoſe breaſt, truth and decency are utter ſtrangers. You will much oblige me in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating this letter to General Howe, to whom I could wiſh it ſhould be conſidered in ſome meaſure addreſſed; as well as to yourſelf. Mr. Howe is a man for whom I have ever had the higheſt love and reverence. I have
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:024456_0219_0FC76D514176B1E0"/>
honoured him for his own connections, but above all, for his admirable talents and good qualities. I have court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his acquaintance and friendſhip, not only as a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but as an ornament; I flattered myſelf that I had obtained it. Gracious God! is it poſſible that Mr. Howe ſhould be prevailed upon to accept ſuch an office! that the brother of him, to whoſe memory the much injured people of Boſton erected a monument, ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as one of the inſtruments of their deſtruction! But the faſhion of the times it ſeems is ſuch, as renders it impoſſible that he ſhould avoid it. The commands of our moſt gracious ſovereign, are to cancel all moral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, to ſanctify every action, even thoſe that the ſatrap of an Eaſtern deſpot would ſtart at. I ſhall now beg leave to ſay a few words with reſpect to myſelf and the part I act. I was bred up from my infancy in the higheſt veneration for the liberties of mankind in general. What I have ſeen of Courts and princes, convinces me that power cannot be lodged in worſe hands than in theirs; and of all courts I am perſuaded that ours is the moſt corrupt and hoſtile to the rights of humanity. I am convinced, that a regular plan has been laid, indeed every act ſince the preſent acceſſion evinces it, to aboliſh even the ſhadow of liberty from amongſt us. It was not the demolition of the tea, it was not any other particular act of the Boſtonians, or of the other provinces, which conſtituted their crimes; but it is the noble ſpirit of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, manifeſtly pervading the whole continent, which has rendered them the objects of miniſterial and royal venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Had they been notoriouſly of another diſpoſition, had they been <hi>homines ad ſervitudinem paratos,</hi> they might have made as free with the property of the Eaſt-India Company as the felonious North himſelf, with impunity. But the lords of St. James's and their mercenaries of St. Stephen's well know, that as long as the free ſpirit of this great continent remains unſubdued, the progreſs they can make in their ſcheme of univerſal deſpotiſm, will be but trifling. Hence it is, that they wage inexpiable war againſt America. In ſhort, this is the laſt aſſylum of perſecuted
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:024456_0220_0FC76D5377B94DF8"/>
liberty. Here ſhould the machinations and fury of her enemies prevail, that bright Goddeſs muſt fly off from the face of the earth, and leave not a trace behind. Theſe, Sir, are my principles; this is my perſuaſion, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am determined to act. I have now, Sir, only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that whatever meaſures you purſue, whether thoſe which your real friends (myſelf amongſt them) would wiſh, or unfortunately thoſe which our accurſed <hi>miſrulers</hi> ſhall dictate, you will ſtill believe me to be perſonally, with the greateſt ſincerity and affection,</p>

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHEN we were laſt together in ſervice I ſhould not have thought it within the viciſſitude of human affairs, that we ſhould meet at any time, or in any ſenſe as foes: the letter you have honoured me with, and my own feelings combine to prove we are far from being perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſuch.</p>
                  <p>I claim no merit from the attentions you ſo kindly remember, but as they manifeſt how much it was my pride to be known for your friend: Nor have I departed from the duties of that character, when I will not ſcruple to ſay, it has been almoſt a general offence to maintain it: I mean ſince the violent part you have taken in the commotions of the colonies. It would exceed the limits and propriety of our preſent correſpondence to argue at full, the great cauſe in which we are engaged. But, anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to preſerve a conſiſtent and ingenuous character, and jealous, I confeſs, of having the part I ſuſtain imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch motives as you intimate, I will ſtate to you as conciſely as I can, the principles upon which, not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, but moſt conſcientiouſly, I undertook it.</p>
                  <p>I have, like you, entertained from my infancy, a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for public liberty. I have likewiſe regarded the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:024456_0221_0FC76D55B097B280"/>
Britiſh conſtitution, as the beſt ſafe-guard of that bleſſing to be found in the hiſtory of mankind. The vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the conſtitution, in which it moves and has its being, is the ſupremacy of the King in Parliament, a compound, indefinite, indefeaſable power, co-eval with the origin of the empire, and co-extenſive over all its parts: I am no ſtranger to the doctrines of Mr. Locke and other of the beſt advocates for the rights of mankind, upon the compact always implied between the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governed, and the right of reſiſtance in the latter, when the compact ſhall be ſo violated as to leave no other means of redreſs. I look with reverence almoſt amounting to idolatry, upon thoſe immortal men who adopted and applied ſuch doctrine, during part of the reign of Charles the Firſt, and that of James the Second. Should corruption pervade the three eſtates of the realm, ſo as to prevent the great ends of their inſtitution, and make the power veſted in them for the good of the whole people operate like an abuſe upon the prerogative of the Crown to general oppreſſion, I am ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the ſame doctrine of reſiſtance applies as forceably againſt the abuſes of the collective body of power, as againſt thoſe of the Crown, or either of the component branches ſeparately: ſtill always underſtood that no other means of redreſs can be obtained. A caſe, I contend, much more difficult to ſuppoſe when it relates to the whole, than when it relates to parts. But in all caſes that have exiſted, or can be conceived, I hold, that reſiſtance, to be juſtifiable, muſt be directed againſt the uſurpation or undue exerciſe of power, and that it is moſt criminal, when directed againſt any power itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>And here you will diſcern immediately why I drew a line in the alluſion I made above to the reign of Charles the Firſt. Towards the cloſe of it the true principle of reſiſtance was changed, and a new ſyſtem of government projected accordingly. The patriots, previous to the long parliament, and during great part of it, as well as the glorious Revolutioniſts of 1681, reſiſted to vindicate

                     </gap>t it.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, lay your hand upon your heart, as you have enjoined me to do on mine, and tell me, to which of theſe purpoſes do the proceedings of America tend? Is it the weight of taxes impoſed and the poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief after due repreſentation of her burthens, that has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to take up arms? Or is it a denial of the legiſlative right of Great Britain, to impoſe them, and conſequently a ſtruggle for total independency? For this idea of a power that can tax externally and not internally, and all the ſophiſtry that attends it, though it may catch the weakneſs and prejudices of the multitude in a ſpeech or a pamphlet, is too prepoſterous to weigh ſeriouſly with a man of your underſtanding, and I am perſuaded you will admit the queſtion fairly put.</p>
                  <p>Is it then for a relief from taxes? or from the controul of parliament "in all caſes whatſoever," that we are in war? If, for the former, the quarrel is at an end. There is not a man of ſenſe and information in America, who does not ſee it is in the power of the colonies to obtain a relinquiſhment of the exerciſe of taxation immediately and for ever. I boldly aſſert it, becauſe ſenſe and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation muſt alſo ſuggeſt to every man, that it can never be the intereſt of Britain to make a ſecond trial.</p>
                  <p>But if the other ground is taken, and it is intended to wreſt from Great Britain a link of that ſubſtantial, and, I hope, perpetual chain, by which the empire holds, think it not a miniſterial mandate; think it not a mere profeſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ardour; think it not prejudice againſt any part of our fellow ſubjects, that induces men of integrity, and among ſuch you have done me the honour to claſs me, to act with vigour. But be aſſured it is conviction, that the whole of our political ſyſtem depends upon preſerving entire its great and eſſential parts; and none is ſo great and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential as the ſupremacy of legiſlation. It is conviction, that as the king of England never appears in ſo glorious a capacity as when he employs the executive power of the ſtate to maintain the laws, ſo, in the preſent exertions of
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:024456_0223_0FC76D5C73595708"/>
that power, his Majeſty is particularly entitled to our zeal and grateful obedience, not only as ſoldiers, but as citizens.</p>
                  <p>Theſe principles, depend upon it, actuate the army and fleet throughout: and let me at the ſame time add, there are few, if any, gentlemen among us who would have drawn his ſword in the cauſe of ſlavery. But why do I confine myſelf to the fleet and army? I affirm, the ſentiments I here touch, to be thoſe of the great bulk of the nation. I appeal even to thoſe trading towns which are ſufferers by the diſpute, and the city of London at the head of them, notwithſtanding the petitions and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances that the arts of parties and factions have extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſome individuals; and laſt, becauſe, leaſt in your favour, I appeal to the majorities of the laſt year upon American queſtions in parliament. The moſt licentious news-writer wants aſſurance to call theſe majorities mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial; much leſs will you, when you impartially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the characters of which they were in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree compoſed; men of the moſt independent principles and fortunes, and many of them profeſſedly in oppoſition in their general line of conduct.</p>
                  <p>Among other ſupporters of Britiſh rights againſt Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican claims, I will not ſpeak poſitively, but, I firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I may name the men of whoſe integrity and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you have the higheſt opinion, and whoſe friendſhip is neareſt your heart; I mean Lord Thanet, from whom my aid de camp has a letter for you, with another from Sir C. Davers. I do not incloſe them, becauſe the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters [little imagining how difficult your conduct would render our intercourſe] deſired they might be delivered into your hands.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe, as well as to renew "the rights of our fellowſhip," I wiſh to ſee you; and, above all, I ſhould think an interview happy if it induced ſuch expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations as might tend, in their conſequences, to peace. I feel, in common with all around me, for the unhappy deluded bulk of this country: they foreſee not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs that is impending. I know Great Britain is ready
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:024456_0224_0FC76D5DF07FB5E0"/>
to open her arms upon the firſt reaſonable overtures of accommodation: I know ſhe is equally reſolute to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her original right; and I alſo know, that if the war proceeds, your hundred and fifty thouſand men will be no match for her power. I put my honour to theſe aſſertions as you have done to others; and I claim the credit I am willing to give.</p>
                  <p>The place I would propoſe for our meeting, is the houſe on Boſton Neck, juſt within our advanced ſentries, called Brown's Houſe; I will obtain authority to give you my parole of honour for your ſecure return. I ſhall expect the ſame on your part, that no inſult be offered me.

                  <p>AS I am juſt informed you are ready to embark for England, I cannot refrain from once more treſpaſſing on your patience. An opportunity is now preſented of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalizing yourſelf as the ſavio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> of your country. The whole Britiſh empire ſtands tottering on the brink of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and you have it in your power to prevent the fatal cataſtrophe; but it will admit of no delay. For Heaven's ſake avail yourſelf of the precious moment: put an end to the deluſion: exert the voice of a brave, virtuous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen; and tell the people at home, that they muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſcind all their impolitic, iniquitous, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, murderous acts; that they muſt overturn the whole frantic ſyſtem, or that they are undone. You aſk me, in your letter, if it is independence at which the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans aim? I anſwer, no; the idea never entered a ſingle American's head, until the moſt intolerable oppreſſion forced it upon them. All they required was, to remain maſters of their own property, and be governed by the ſame equitable laws which they had enjoyed from the firſt formation of the Colonies. The ties of connection which bound them to their parent country, were ſo dear to them, that he who would have ventured to touch them, would have been conſidered as the moſt impious of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; but theſe ſacred ties, the ſame men, who have vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated or baffled the moſt precious laws and rights of the people at home, diſſipated, or refuſed to account for their treaſures, tarniſhed the glory, and annihilated the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the nation: theſe ſacred ties, I ſay, ſo dear to every American, Bute and his Tory adminiſtration are now rending aſunder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="unknown:024456_0226_0FC76D64854DD578"/>You aſk, whether it is the weight of taxes of which they complain? I anſwer, no: It is the principle they combat, and they would be guilty in the eyes of God and men, of the preſent world, and all poſterity, did they not reject it; for if it were admitted, they would have nothing that they could call their own; they would be in a worſe condition than the wretched ſlaves in the Weſt-India iſlands, whoſe little peculium has ever been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inviolate. But, wherefore ſhould I dwell on this? Is not the caſe with Ireland the ſame with theirs? They are ſubordinate to the Britiſh empire; they are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Parliament of Great Britain, but they tax themſelves. Why, as the caſe is ſimilar, do you not begin with them? But you know, Mr. Burgoyne, audacious as the miniſtry are, they dare not attempt it. There is one part of your letter which, I confeſs, I do not underſtand. If I recollect right, [for I, unfortunately, have not the letter by me,] you ſay, that if the privilege of taxing themſelves is what the Americans claim, the conteſt is at an end. You ſurely cannot allude to the propoſitions of North. It is impoſſible that you ſhould not think, with me and all mankind, that theſe propoſitions are no more or leſs than adding to a moſt abominable oppreſſion, a more abominable inſult. But, to recur to the queſtion of Americans aiming at independence: Do any inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any one of the provinces to their repreſentatives, or delegates, furniſh the leaſt ground for this ſuſpicion? On the contrary, do they not all breathe the ſtrongeſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment and filial piety to their parent country? But if ſhe diſcards all the natural tenderneſs of a mother, and acts the part of a cruel ſtep-dame, it muſt naturally be expected that their affections will ceaſe; the miniſtry leave them no alternative, <hi>aut ſerviri, aut alienari jubent;</hi> it is in human nature; it is a moral obligation to adopt the latter. But the fatal ſeparation has not yet taken place, and yourſelf, your ſingle ſelf, my friend, may, perhaps, prevent it. Upon the miniſtry, I am afraid, you can make no impreſſion; for, to repeat a hackneyed quotation,

                  <p>But, if you will at once break off all connections with theſe pernicious men; if you will wave all conſideration, but the ſalvation of your country, Great Britain may ſtand as much indebted to General Burgoyne, as Rome was to her Camillus. Do not, I entreat you, my dear Sir, think this the mad rhapſody of an enthuſiaſt, nor the cant of a factious deſigning man; for, in theſe colours, I am told, I am frequently painted. I ſwear by all that's ſacred, as I hope for comfort and honour in this world, and to avoid miſery in the next, that I moſt earneſtly and devoutly love my native country; that I wiſh the ſame happy relation to ſubſiſt for ages betwixt her and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which has raiſed the wide arch of her empire to ſo ſtupendous and enviable a height; but at the ſame time I avow, that if the parliament and people ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved enough to ſupport any longer the preſent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in their infernal ſcheme, my zeal and reverence for the rights of humanity are ſo much greater than my fondneſs for any particular ſpot, even the place of my nativity, that, had I any influence in the councils of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, I would adviſe not to heſitate a ſingle inſtant, but deciſively to cut the Gordian knot, now beſmeared with civil blood.</p>
                  <p>This, I know, is ſtrong emphatic language, and might paſs, with men who are ſtrangers to the flame which the love of liberty is capable of lighting up in the human breaſt, for a proof of my inſanity; but you, Sir, unleſs I have miſtaken you from the beginning, will conceive, that a man in his ſober ſenſes, may poſſeſs ſuch feelings. In my ſober ſenſes, therefore, permit me once more moſt earneſtly to entreat and conjure you to exert your whole force, energy, and talents to ſtop the miniſtry in this their headlong career. If you labour in vain (as, I muſt repeat, I think will be the caſe) addreſs yourſelf to the people at large. By adopting this method, I am ſo ſanguine, as to aſſure myſelf of your ſucceſs; and your
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:024456_0228_0FC76D67C4A1D250"/>
public character will be as illuſtrious as your perſonal qualities are amiable to all who intimately know you. By your means the coloniſts will long continue the farmers, planters, and ſhipwrights of Great Britain; but if the preſent courſe is perſiſted in, an internal divorce muſt inevitably take place. As to the idea of ſubduing them into ſervitude, and indemnifying yourſelves for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, you muſt be convinced long before this of its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not, perhaps, be extravagant, if I advanced, that all the ſhips of the world would be too few to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port force ſufficient to conquer three millions of people, unanimouſly determined to ſacrifice every thing to liberty; but, if it were poſſible, the victory would not be leſs ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous than the defeat. You would only deſtroy your own ſtrength. No revenue can poſſibly be exacted out of this country. The army of place-men might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, but her circuitous commerce, founded on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedom, which alone can furniſh riches to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, would fall to the ground. But the dignity of Great Britain, it ſeems, is at ſtake. Would you, Sir, if in the heat of paſſion you had ſtruck a ſingle drummer of your regiment, and afterwards diſcovered that you had done it unjuſtly, think it any forfeiture of your dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to acknowledge the wrong? No: I am well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with your diſpoſition, you would aſk him pardon at the head of your regiment.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now conclude (if you will excuſe the pedantry) with a ſentence of Latin: <hi>Juſtum eſt bellum quibus neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarium, et pia arma quibus nulla, niſi in armis, relinquitur ſpes.</hi> I moſt ſincerely wiſh you a quick and proſperous voyage, and that your happineſs and glory may be equal to the idea I have of your merits, as,</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  <p>IN my letter, lately ſent into Boſton, all political diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition was deſignedly avoided. I did not avail myſelf of the advantages which the ſacred cauſe of my country, of liberty, and of human nature, manifeſtly gave me over Mr. Gage. I remonſtrated with you in decent terms, with reſpect to the hard and unworthy treatment ſhewn, as I have been informed, to the ſoldiers and citizens of America, whom the fortune of war, chance, or an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous opinion of your honour, had thrown into your hands. In anſwer to this remonſtrance, we are inſulted with the moſt outrageous language, and abuſive epithets. Were we, Sir, the worſt of traitors; had we conſpired to ſubvert the liberties of our fellow ſubjects; had we conſpired to re-eſtabliſh on the throne the expelled ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of the Stuart houſe; or, could we be charged with any notorious breach of faith; had we, for inſtance, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome part of the troops under your command, upon certain conditions, into a ſurrender of their arms, and afterwards violated our engagement, the ſtyle which you aſſume would ſcarcely be juſtifiable.</p>
                  <p>You affect, Sir, to deſpiſe all rank not derived from the ſame ſource with your own; to ſpeak, as I think, with becoming pride, it is impoſſible to conceive a more honourable ſource than that to which I owe my preſent ſtation. I was called to it by the voice of the freely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen delegates of a virtuous and uncorrupt people. Yours, for aught I know, and, as I am told, is frequently the caſe, might have been obtained by connections with ſome proſtitute part of a proſtitute Houſe of Commons.</p>
                  <p>You threaten us, Sir, with a cord: Begin, Sir; I dare you to it. Although my nature ſhudders at the thought, neceſſity will force us to retaliate; and we have it in our power, Mr. Gage, to make a ten-fold retaliation.</p>
                  <p>You have the confidence to appeal to that Almighty God whoſe every law you have violated. Let that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, to whom the rights and happineſs of his creatures cannot be indifferent, judge then between us. When the great and tremendous day ſhall arrive; when
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:024456_0230_0FC76D6E0E179AE0"/>
all mortals are to render a ſtrict account, which, do you apprehend, Sir, will have the greateſt reaſon to tremble? The virtuous citizen, now forced to arms by the hands of tyranny; in arms not to rob, ſpoil, and invade; not as mercenary inſtruments to gratify the luſt, ambition, avarice, or revenge of ſceptered robbers or wicked mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but to defend their wives, children and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold goods, and to deliver down to their poſterity the bright inheritance of freedom they received from their fore-fathers: which, I once more demand, ſhall, on that dreadful day, have the greateſt reaſon to tremble? The citizens engaged in this righteous cauſe, or thoſe men, who by artifice, miſrepreſentation, and falſehood, have not only ſtained this fair continent with the blood of her children, but ſhaken the mighty empire of Britain to her foundation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now, Sir, cloſe my correſpondence with you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for ever, aſſuring you, that the intelligence you have received, with reſpect to the harſh treatment of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in our poſſeſſion, is as remote from fact, as that which you have conſtantly tranſmitted to the miniſtry, when ſpeaking of the principles and deſigns of America. Not only the officers and ſoldiers have been treated with the tenderneſs due to fellow-citizens and brethren, but even thoſe execrable parricides, born amongſt us, who have aimed their daggers at the vitals of their parent, have been protected from the fury of a moſt juſtly enraged people.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now, Sir, only add, that for the future, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mode of conduct you ſhall think proper to obſerve towards thoſe of our people who are in your cuſtody, ſuch exactly are the miniſterialiſts to expect in return.</p>

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I LITTLE thought the time could ever arrive when I ſhould not run with eagerneſs to embrace Mr. Gage. Whether it is from a cynical diſpoſition, or a laudable miſanthropy, whether it is to my credit or diſcredit, I know not; but it is moſt certain, that I have had a real affection for very few men; but that theſe few I have loved with warmth, zeal, and ardour. You, Sir, amongſt theſe few, I ſwear by all that is ſacred, have ever held one of the foremoſt places. I reſpected your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, liked your manners, and perfectly adored the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your heart. Theſe, Sir, are my reaſons, paradox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical as they may appear to many, that I now avoid what I heretofore ſhould have thought an happineſs. Were you perſonally indifferent to me, I ſhould, perhaps, from curioſity, appear in the circle of your levee; but I hold in ſuch abhorrence the conduct, temper, and ſpirit of our preſent court; more particularly their preſent dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical meaſures with reſpect to this country fills me with ſo much horror and indignation, that I cannot bear to ſee a man, from whom my affections can never be weaned, in the capacity of one of their inſtruments; as I am convinced that the court of Tiberius, or Philip the Second, were no more treacherous and hoſtile to the rights of mankind than the preſent court of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I cannot help thinking it one of the greateſt curſes fallen on mankind, that they ſhould be endued with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient art to ſeduce or delude men of the beſt hearts and heads. My Lord Chatham himſelf was for a time their dupe; and poor York was entrapped for his deſtruction. I believe, Sir, I know the tricks and inſidiouſneſs of the Cabinet better than you do. I have no doubt, but they were hard ſet to work upon you. May God Almighty extricate you, with honour and ſafety, from their clutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es! I know not whether the people of America will be ſucceſsful in their ſtruggles for liberty; I think it moſt probable they will, from what I have ſeen in my progreſs through the colonies. So noble a ſpirit pervades all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of men, from the firſt eſtated gentlemen to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:024456_0232_0FC76D7381EDBE70"/>
planters, that I think they muſt be victorious. I moſt devoutly wiſh they may; for if the machinations of their enemies prevail, the bright goddeſs, Liberty, muſt, like her ſiſter Aſtraea, utterly abandon the earth, and leave not a wreck behind. She has, by a damned conſpiracy of kings and miniſters, been totally driven from the other hemiſphere. Here is her laſt aſylum; here I hope ſhe may fix her abode.</p>
                  <p>I have now, Sir, only to entreat, that as knaves and fools will probably, from deſign and miſunderſtanding, exaggerate, disfigure, and diſtort what I do, and what I ſay, you will be upon your guard, particularly when it relates to yourſelf. Though it is difficult to ſeparate the man from the office, ſhould it be reported that I ever ſpeak of you in terms of diſreſpect, I entreat, that you will ſlight the report. I am not capable of it. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal friendſhip for Mr. Gage has taken too deep root in my breaſt; though, were you my brother, twinned at a birth, I muſt wiſh to defeat the purpoſes of thoſe by whoſe inſtructions Governor Gage muſt act.</p>
                  <p>As to North, my opinion of him is this, [and I have known him a long time] that did he hear of a ſingle free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the remoteſt part of the world, he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put his country to the expence of furniſhing forth an army and fleet for the ſole pleaſure of deſtroying that ſingle freeman. I know, Sir, you will do me the juſtice to believe that I am not acting a part; that no affectation has place in my conduct. You have known me long enough, I flatter myſelf, to be perſuaded, that zeal for the liberties of my country and the rights of mankind, has been my predominant paſſion. May God Almighty bleſs you, Sir, and, with honour to you, diſſolve the ſpell which has charmed you into a ſituation ſo incompatible with the excellence of your natural diſpoſition. Excuſe the length, and, if it appears to you, the impertinence, of this epiſtle, and believe me,</p>

                     <salute>MY DEAR PHIPPS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE not for a long time read any performance with ſo much pleaſure, as the paragraph in the public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers announcing your ſafe return. I congratulate your country, your friends, and particularly myſelf, on this happy event. As I moſt ſincerely love and honour you, I ſhould have been pleaſed, in common with all mankind, had your hopes and expectations been anſwered in their full extent; but, as your individual friend, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſatisfied; for the attempt is ſufficient to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize you. A young man of your rank and affluent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, giving up his eaſe, pleaſure, and connections, to encounter mountains, and even to riſk the taking up his reſidence in the thrilling regions of thick Ribbedia, for the public benefit, would have appeared heroic in any age or nation; but the inglorious inſipid character of the preſent age heightens the luſtre of the enterprize.</p>
                  <p>Once more, my dear Phipps, I congratulate you and all your friends on your ſafe return; and the honour which is your due, and which is not paid you at home; come to this country, where your praiſes are ſung daily; but your political parliamentary conduct has the largeſt ſhare of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Their opinion of your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, talents, and conſiſtency, is very high; and I hope you will believe that I do not labour to weaken it. By all that is ſacred, theſe are a fine people, liberal, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, ſenſible and firm. Your Mansfields and Norths may play over their wretched tricks, have recourſe to their paltry fineſſes, may bluſter and bellow, but they will never be able to trick or frighten theſe men out of their liberties. They are too acute and vigilant for the former to avail, and much too ſtrong for the latter. Twelve thouſand freſh coloniſts, half Germans, half Iriſh, were imported this year into Philadelphia alone, and not a much leſs number into the colonies of Virginia and New-York. The banks of Hudſon's-River, of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk, Suſquehannah, Juniatta, and the Ohio, from the Monongahela downwards thirty miles, which at the peace were totally a deſert, are become one continued chain

of villages. Four large military townſhips are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be eſtabliſhed on the Miſſiſſipi. I leave to judge, whether it will be eaſy to dragoon ſo numerous a people for any length of time. Ships of war, it is true, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and put to inconvenience ſome of their capital ports; but theſe teaſings and inſults will only ſerve to ſhew the abſurdity of your miniſter's policy in a more ſtriking light, by giving a unanimity to theſe people equal to their effectual ſtrength, when they may ſet at defiance the machinations, not only of an earthly, but of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal petentate himſelf and his miniſtry. Egregious blockheads! their folly encreaſes every day; no ſooner are they out of one bad ſcrape, but they get into a worſe.</p>
                  <p>This bleſſed tea project meets with a reſiſtance full as vigorous, though more regular and temperate than the ſtamp act. The coloniſts, one and all, have entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt ſolemn obligations to ſend it back to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, and continue furniſhing themſelves from the Dutch; ſo that by the ingenuity of our miniſtry, ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling is rendered an —

                  <p>AS General Waſhington has informed the Congreſs of his motives for detaching me, it is needleſs to trouble you upon the ſubject; I am therefore only to inform you, that I have collected a body of about twelve hundred men from the colony of Connecticut, whoſe zeal and ardour, demonſtrated on this occaſion, cannot be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently praiſed. With this body I am marching directly to New-York, to execute the different purpoſes for which I am detached. I am ſenſible, Sir, that nothing can carry the air of greater preſumption, than a ſervant's intruding his opinion, unaſked, upon his maſter; but, at the ſame time, there are certain ſeaſons when the real danger of the maſter may not only excuſe, but render laudable, the ſervant's officiouſneſs. I therefore
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:024456_0235_0FC76D7AE1A7C4B8"/>
flatter myſelf that the Congreſs will receive, with indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and lenity, the opinion I ſhall offer. The ſcheme of diſarming ſimply the Tories, ſeems to me totally inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; it will only embitter their minds and add <hi>virus</hi> to their venom. They can, and will, always be ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with freſh arms by the enemy. That of ſeizing the moſt dangerous will, I apprehend, from the vagueneſs of the inſtruction, be attended with ſome bad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and can anſwer no good one. It opens ſo wide a door for partiality and prejudice, to the different congreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and committees on the continent, that much diſcord and animoſity will probably enſue, it being next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to diſtinguiſh who are, and who are not the moſt dangerous. The plan of explaining to theſe deluded people the juſtice and merits of the American cauſe, is certainly generous and humane; but, I am afraid, will be fruitleſs. They are ſo rivetted in their opinions, that, I am perſuaded, ſhould an angel deſcend from heaven with his golden trumpet, and ring in their ears, that their conduct was criminal, he would be diſregarded. I had lately myſelf an inſtance of their infatuation, which, if it is not impertinent, I will relate. I took the liberty, without any authority but the conviction of the neceſſity, to adminiſter a very ſtrong oath to thoſe of Rhode-Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, that they would take arms in defence of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try if called upon by the voice of the Congreſs. To this Colonel Wanton, and others, flatly refuſed their aſſent; to take arms againſt their ſevereign they ſaid was too monſtrous. This is not a criſis, when every thing is at ſtake, to be over complient to the timidity of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of any particular ſpot. I have now under my command a very reſpectable force adequate to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſecuring the place, and purging all its environs of traitors, on which ſubject I ſhall expect, with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the determination of the Congreſs; their orders I hope to receive before or immediately on my arrival.</p>
                  <p>This inſtant the incloſed expreſs from the provincial Congreſs of New-York, was delivered into my hands; but as theſe gentlemen probably are not fully apprized of

the danger hanging over their heads, as I have received intelligence from camp, that the fleet is ſailed, and that it is neceſſary to urge my march, I ſhall proceed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I RECEIVED your commands on Sunday evening, and ſhould have anſwered it immediately, but waited for the reſult of an application I had made to Waterbury's and Ward's regiment, requeſting them to remain here until they can be replaced by a certain number of troops from Philadelphia, and the Jerſies. They have unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly conſented to ſtay till the twenty-fifth of this month, which is a fortnight longer than the term they were enliſted for. Before the expiration of this time, I am in hopes that ſome meaſures will be taken by the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:024456_0237_0FC76D8071DEF3D8"/>
Congreſs for throwing into the city, its environs, and Long-Iſland, a force ſufficient to diſpute the ground with any number of troops we have reaſon to expect; not that I would imply that theſe two Connecticut regiments remaining here would be able to prevent the landing and lodging themſelves in the iſland, even five battalions of the enemy, ſhould they chooſe to attempt it; but thoſe two regiments will enable us at leaſt to lay the foundation of the neceſſary works. I have ordered a regiment from the Jerſies, who will be here I hope in a few days. I ſhall not, Sir, trouble you with a detail of our intended works, as I ſhall have the power of paying my reſpects in perſon to the Congreſs in a very few days, for on Thurſday it is my intention to ſet out. I am in very little pain about the execution of what we have concerted, as it is committed to the hands of Lord Sterling, who ſhews much intelligence and activity. As this place will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be the ſcene of a good deal of action, it would be prudent to add ſomething to their preſent ſtock of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. I find by their returns, that there is in the whole colony, that ſent up to Fort-Conſtitution included, five tons and an half.</p>
                  <p>The numerous body of profeſſed Tories in Long and Staten-Iſlands, with not a few within the walls of the city, is a moſt alarming conſideration; the meaſures adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Provincial Congreſs, of obliging them to give bonds as a ſecurity for their good behaviour, can anſwer no purpoſe, but that of rendering them more bitter and violent. The firſt regiment of our gracious ſovereign's cutthroats which arrive here will indubitably cancel theſe bonds. I am well aſſured, indeed, that theſe bonds are made a public joke of already, by the worthy gentlemen who gave them. In ſhort, the friends to liberty are to a man convinced, that the Tories will take up arms, when encouraged by the appearance of any royal troops. The delicacy of our ſituation, the dangerous criſis of affairs, have therefore determined me to take a deciſive ſtep, which alone, according to my judgment, can ſecure us: I have propoſed to offer to theſe people a teſt, drawn
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:024456_0238_0FC76D81F35649C8"/>
up in ſuch terms, that refuſal or conſent to take it, muſt be a criterion by which we may be able to diſtinguiſh thoſe, whoſe ſwords are whetted to plunge into the vitals of their country, and whoſe, if not drawn in defence of the common righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, may be expected to remain quietly in their ſcabbards. The firſt I have directed to be ſeized without further ceremony and I ſhould think myſelf highly criminal, in omitting ſo ſalutary a ſtep before it is too late; perhaps I judge wrong; if I do, I muſt myſelf take the ſhame of being reputed weak, raſh, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. The intelligence I have received from General Waſhington will, at all events, juſtify, in ſome meaſure, my diſpenſing with forms.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE nothing of ſufficient importance to trouble the Congreſs with; but ſhall teaze you with a few words; I am exactly in the ſame ſituation I expected, puzzled where to go, or fix myſelf, from an uncertainty of the enemy's deſign: I can therefore only act by ſurmiſe; the general opinion is, that they will aim at this part of Virginia, viz. York and Williamſburgh, or that they will fix their head quarters in North Carolina: it has been already aſſerted, that Mr. Clinton was landed with one thouſand five hundred men at Wilmington; a letter from Brigadier Howe, dated from Edenton, ſays, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but not aſcertained. I wait for further intelligence; in the mean time, I ſhall employ myſelf in rendering this place, and York, as inacceſſible as poſſible; for it is my own perſuaſion, that they will endeavour to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the capital, not only as it is really a moſt tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and advantageous poſt, from commanding two ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:024456_0239_0FC76D898F14C378"/>
and a moſt abundant country; but it would give an air of ſuperiority and dignity to their arms, which in this ſlave country might be attended with important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, by the impreſſions it would make in the minds of the negroes. I wiſh we had a couple of good regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more in South-Carolina, it would then be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>hors inſult.</hi> The apathy of this province ſeems to go <hi>paſſibus aequis,</hi> with that of ſome other provinces, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the perſuaſion and aſſurances of all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that the Tories about Norfolk will moſt certainly repair to the King's ſtandard, and have propoſed means of ſecuring them; they ſay, ſuch means would be violent and cruel. In ſhort, as your affairs proſper, the timidity of the ſenatorial part of the continent, great and ſmall, grows and extends itſelf. By the eternal God, unleſs you declare yourſelves independent, eſtabliſh a more certain and fixed legiſlature than that of a temporary cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy of the people, you richly deſerve to be enſlaved, and I think it far from impoſſible that it ſhould be your lot; as without a more ſyſtematical intercourſe with France and Holland, we cannot, we have not the means of carrying on the war.</p>

                  <p>THE ſubject of this letter appearing to me of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing importance, I have reſolved to diſpatch an expreſs to inform you, that the Roebuck, a king's ſhip of 44 guns, has for ſome time left the Capes of Virginia, and, as we hear, is now lying off the Bay of Delaware, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to intercept the continental fleet. At Norfolk remain the Liverpool, a 30 gun frigate; the Otter floop of 14 guns, and ſome tenders; together with a ſhip, Lord
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:024456_0240_0FC76D8AEEE77628"/>
Dunmore on board, of little or no force; and a number of veſſels belonging to the Tories, with valuable cargoes and prizes, amounting, by a reaſonable eſtimate, to an hundred and forty thouſand pounds ſterling. If Mr. Hopkins is at Cape-Fear, would it not be a good meaſure to inform him, how ſure a prey theſe ſhips at Norfolk, with their immenſe treaſure of goods, arms, ammunition and other military ſtores would be to him, were he to come into the Capes of Virginia? It is not probable our fleet can keep the ſea much longer, a number of Britiſh ſhips of war being expected ſoon on the American coaſt; this laſt mentioned ſtroke would then be a glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; and if it ſhould be neceſſary afterwards to keep it a ſafe harbour, by erecting a battery at the mouth of the river leading to Norfolk, the navy of Great Britain might be, from the nature of the navigation, prevented from getting up. I am extremely anxious to know the ſtate of your province, and of the ſtate, number, and quality of your troops; any aſſiſtance which can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded you by this province, as far as depends on me, you may command. I ſhould have ſet out before this, for your province, but the confuſion, diſorder, and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies of Virginia, oblige me to paſs a few more days in my preſent quarters.</p>

                  <p>After having conſidered the number and quality of your troops, the ſtate and condition of your arms, artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and ordinance apparatus, the weakneſs and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages you labour under from the numerous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecting rivers, the multitude of your ſlaves, &amp;c. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to myſelf, that the enemy, will make this province their immediate object; and ſince the defeat of their ſchemes in North-Carolina, by Colonel Caſwell, it is the moſt natural ſuppoſition. I ſay, Sir, after having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered your ſtrength and weakneſs, no circumſtance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me ſo ſeriouſly alarming as the diſpoſition and ſituation of the inhabitants of the lower counties, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:024456_0242_0FC76D8DF2A0F3E8"/>
and Princeſs Ann; but that I might not reſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on my own opinion, I have called together ſome of the field officers who are beſt acquainted with that diſtrict, and they unanimouſly agree, that it will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, if not impoſſible, to ſecure and preſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, unleſs theſe inhabitants, thus dangerouſly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are removed from the very ſpot where they can do ſuch infinite miſchief. I am ſenſible, Sir, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval muſt be attended with very conſiderable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and perhaps much diſtreſs to individuals; but when the preſervation and being of the province, if not of the whole continent, are at ſtake, were theſe difficulties and diſtreſſes a thouſand times greater, they muſt be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to. I am in hopes, therefore, that the gentlemen of the Committee will immediately deviſe ſome means for removing theſe people, as well as their ſtock: at leaſt their wives and children ſhould be carried to a place of ſecurity, as hoſtages for the good behaviour of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and fathers. I ſhould be extremely ſorry to find myſelf under the neceſſity of deſtroying all their cattle, ſtores, and granaries, and forcing the inhabitants, at the point of the bayonet, from their homes; but unleſs their removal can be accompliſhed by ſome other means, I ſhall be conſtrained to theſe harſh methods; as otherwiſe, I cannot be anſwerable for the execution of the important truſt committed to my hands.</p>

                  <p>THE diſagreeable uncertainty I have been in, of the enemies' deſigns, from the circumſtance of their being
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:024456_0243_0FC76D950BEFE498"/>
able to fly in their ſhips from one ſpot to another, hath kept me at Williamſburgh. It is evident that their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal intention was againſt North-Carolina, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently total overthrow of their whole ſcheme by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Caſwell's victory, makes it more probable that they will bend their courſe to ſome other quarter; whether to this province, or South-Carolina, it is impoſſible to divine. I am myſelf more inclined to think that this will be their object, as the numerous interſecting navigable waters preſent them ſuch ſuperior advantages; though, at the ſame time, I confeſs myſelf in great pain for South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina; the force in that province ſeems alarmingly ſmall. I wiſh I could afford to detach from hence at leaſt three battalions; but neither our numbers of men, the ſtate and condition of our arms, nor the vaſt extent of this province open to attack, will admit of the thought. If Pennſylvania could ſpare three or four battalions for the defence 'Virginia, Virginia or North-Carolina might detach the ſame number to South-Carolina; and as the army which was employed in the blockade of Boſton is now ſet at liberty, I ſhould imagine this force might be afforded us.</p>
                  <p>We are ſo extremely deficient in arms, that I have been under the neceſſity of ſending an officer into the back parts of the country to purchaſe all the rifles he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for the continental ſervice. The arrangement I have made of arming two companies of each battalion with ſpears, will render muſquets and bayonets leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and the caſe I find in reconciling the men to theſe kind of arms, is a flattering ſymptom of their ſpirit. The price of theſe rifles, I am told, will be five pounds each; but as the article of cartouches and bayonets will be ſaved, upon the whole, they will not be more, if ſo expenſive.</p>
                  <p>The defence and ſecurity of the capital rivets, with their creeks, is an object of ſo great importance, that I have thought it neceſſary to direct as great a number of half gallies as poſſible, to be conſtructed with the utmoſt expedition; but as the carpenters and other artificers in
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:024456_0244_0FC76D963507DDE0"/>
this country are ſo lazy a race of mortals, that it is in vain to expect any fruits from their labours, unleſs there is a coercive power over them, I thought it the ſureſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt method to eſtabliſh two companies of carpenters on the ſame terms with thoſe in the Jerſies; the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is abſolutely neceſſary, and I flatter myſelf it will prove oeconomy.</p>
                  <p>The nature of the ſervice here is ſuch, the force not being collected into one point, but ſcattered in fragments, that a greater number of ſubordinate ſtaff officers are requiſite than in the Northern and Eaſtern armies. I have therefore taken the liberty, till the pleaſure of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is further known, to appoint a few who could not be diſpenſed with: incloſed is a liſt of them.</p>
                  <p>The Committee of Safety, I find, Sir, had not apprized you of their having already raiſed a company of artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and appointed officers. Captain Innes, who was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the head of it, though he profeſſes himſelf utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of this particular branch, is a man of great zeal, capacity and merit; and as there is a vacant majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the ninth, or captain Flemming's regiment, I have ventured to appoint him to act in that ſtation, in hopes that the Congreſs will confirm his commiſſion. A body of horſe is a <hi>ſine qua non</hi> in a country circumſtanced like this; I take the liberty of encloſing you an addreſs I publiſhed to the young gentlemen of this colony on the ſubject, and wiſh it may meet with your approbation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make Monſieur Arundel accountable for the ſixty dollars, but at the ſame time beg leave to ſubmit to the conſideration of the Congreſs, whether the expences of his journey ſhould not be allowed; they amount to thirty dollars: indeed the pay of the artillery officers and engineers is ſo wretched, that I do not ſee any chance of procuring men fit for the ſervice on the terms; and if they are procured, they cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt, unleſs the expences of their frequent journeys are paid; for they are obliged, from the nature of their buſineſs, to make more journeys than other officers, and not in corps, but

                  <p>THE committee will, I hope, excuſe my not having yeſterday made a report to them (as I think it my duty) of every tranſaction which is not merely military; but they were ſo much employed in the buſineſs of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Ann petition, that I thought it better not to enter on the ſubject. As I found that the inhabitants of Portſmouth had univerſally taken the oath to Lord Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and as that town was, I believe, juſtly conſidered as the great channel through which his Lordſhip received the moſt exact and minute intelligence of all our motions and deſigns, I thought it incumbent on me, and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſpirit of your inſtructions, to remove the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without exception; for even the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had learnt the art, and practiſed with addreſs, the office of ſpies. A conſiderable quantity of very valuable articles were found in the houſes of Mrs. Sprowle, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich, and Nuil Jamieſon, ſuch as molaſſes, ſalt, and other
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:024456_0247_0FC76DA02E000FE0"/>
things much wanted for the public. A liſt of theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles will be made out by the officer commanding the party, and laid before your board.</p>
                  <p>As the town of Portſmouth will afford ſo convenient ſhelter and quarters, to refreſh the enemy, on a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they make this part of the world their object, it would perhaps be politic to deſtroy it totally; but the houſes of ſome of the moſt notorious traitors I thought abſolutely neceſſary to demoliſh, in hopes of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midating the neighbourhood from trifling any longer, and flying in the face of your ordinances; for it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, unleſs I have been groſsly miſinformed, into what barefaced, open intercourſe with the enemy they had been encouraged, by no examples having been made. Sprowle's, Goodrich's, Jamieſon's and Skeddan's houſes were on this principle deſtroyed; the laſt, Skeddan, now a priſoner at Suffolk, accuſed, and, I believe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, of having been on board Lord Dunmore's fleet, ſince his acquittal by the committee of Norfolk. As we had undoubted intelligence that the fleet and army of Lord Dunmore were amply and regularly ſupplied with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and refreſhments of every kind, from that tract of country, lying between the Southern and Eaſtern branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as well as from Tanner's-Creek, notwithſtanding the poſitive ordinances levelled againſt this ſpecies of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and as from a habit of any ſort of action, be it ever ſo heinous, he who commits it, infallibly, in the end, perſuades himſelf there is no crime in it at all: ſo theſe worthies not only every day openly and conſtantly carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this dangerous commerce, but, it is ſaid, juſtified it in their converſation; it, therefore, Sir, in my opinion, as well as of the other officers, and the committee of gentlemen from Suffolk, became indiſpenſably neceſſary to take ſome vigorous ſteps on the ſpot, which might intimidate the whole knot of theſe miſcreants from their pernicious traffic.</p>
                  <p>A Mr. Hopkins, infamous for his principles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and who has a ſon, now a ſoldier in Dunmore's army, was fortunately the firſt man detected; he was
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:024456_0248_0FC76DA23814CFC0"/>
ſeized in his return from the fleet. He prevaricated and perjured himſelf very handſomely on the occaſion; but at length the fact was proved, and he confeſſed. The ſentiments of the committee and other officers concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with my own, we determined, after having ſeized his furniture, to ſet his houſe on fire in his preſence: This ſtep was not quite conſiſtent with the regular mode of proceeding: but there are occaſions, when the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity will excuſe deviations, and this I hope will appear to the committee to be one of thoſe occaſions. I muſt here, Gentlemen, beg leave to repeat my aſſurances, that if ever in my military capacity, I ſhould fall into any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which is more properly within the province of the civil, it will entirely proceed from miſtake, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, never from deſign; and upon theſe occaſions, ſo far from being offended by the admonition, or even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand, of your committees, I ſhall think myſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to them.</p>

                     <salute>SIR</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I FIND the part I have acted in the buſineſs of Mr. Eden, has given great umbrage to the council of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; I take the liberty of encloſing a copy of my letter to that board on the occaſion; as I hope it will appear to the Congreſs, a full explanation and juſtification of my conduct, I ſhall not trouble them any more on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>Five tranſports with troops are arrived at Cape-Fear; I ſhall therefore ſet out on Thurſday for Wilmington, by the way of Halifax. When we conſider, Sir, the vaſt extent of the vulnerable parts of this country; the numerous navigable interſecting waters, the multitude of
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:024456_0249_0FC76DA427640BA0"/>
ſlaves; that we have not more than five thouſand regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſit for duty in the province; that of theſe five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand not more than three are properly armed; that to arm them, defective as they are, the province has been drove to the neceſſity of diſarming the minute men; I ſay, Sir, that when theſe circumſtances are conſidered, I ſhall appear, I hope, reaſonable, in entreating the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to ſpare us, if poſſible, ſome battalions, and of thoſe battalions which are beſt armed. If indeed our minute men were properly furniſhed with muſkets and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if our rivers were already ſecured in the manner I propoſe; I ſhould think myſelf capable of baffling all their attempts with our preſent force; but ſituated as we are, my anxiety for the common ſafety obliges me to ſolicit a reinforcement. A letter from one of your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers informs me, that five thouſand blankets, and five thouſand pair of ſhoes, are on the road for the uſe of this army; they were much wanted; the number is, I believe, ſufficient. We are, as I obſerved before, wretchedly in want of medicines, as well as of a direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to our hoſpital. Doctor M'Clurg is a very able man, and univerſally eſteemed, qualified for the office; the pay of the regimental ſurgeons eſtabliſhed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is ſo low, that it is in this part of the world, where the common country practice of ſurgery is ſingularly lucrative, impoſſible to find capable men, who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; but I am in hopes that the convention will make ſuch additions out of the provincial purſe, as to enable us to fill the commiſſions with proper and competent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Now I am on the ſubject of pay, Sir, I muſt beg leave to urge the neceſſity of conſiderably increaſing that of the engineers. It is impoſſible that men, qualified for this important office, ſhould be prevailed upon to ſerve on ſuch miſerable terms. You have no American en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers; they muſt of courſe be foreigners; and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners expect, in their language, <hi>de quoi manger,</hi> that is, ſomething which will enable them to eat and drink. Twenty dollars per month will not enable them to eat and drink, and wear linen, or indeed any kind of cloaths;
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:024456_0250_0FC76DA62826EE40"/>
beſides, it muſt be conſidered, that theſe gentlemen are obliged, by the nature of their duty, to make more jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys than any other officers; that horſes muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and fed; that the expences of travelling in theſe Southern provinces are very high; from theſe reaſons, and many others, the pay of engineers ought to be, as it is in all other ſervices, greater than that of other officers. Upon the whole, Sir, I really do not think that they ought or can do with leſs than forty dollars per month, and rations at leaſt for their horſes. On more moderate terms I am perſuaded you cannot procure men equal to the taſk: as the corps is diſtinct, and not numerous, this neceſſary addition of pay will be an expence beneath the conſideration of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Richard Henry Lee informs me, that it was not the intention of the Congreſs that Captain Innes's company ſhould be reduced, to make way for Arundel's; but they ſhould both be eſtabliſhed. I think, Sir, it would be a uſeleſs expence. Captain Innes, who muſt, I am ſure, be an excellent officer in any other department, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf ignorant of this branch; his officers were equally ignorant: Arundel has got poſſeſſion of the company, and by his activity and knowledge will, I am perſuaded, make them fit for ſervice. Indeed to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh an artillery company, captain, ſubalterns, and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commiſſioned officers, being entirely compoſed of novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, can anſwer no end or purpoſe. It is my opinion, therefore, Sir, that inſtead of theſe two companies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the addition of thirty or forty men to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Arundel's, and two ſubaltern officers, will not only be better, but that it promiſes more advantage to the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>As I am on the ſubject of Captain Arundel, I beg leave to remind the Congreſs of what I mentioned on the ſubject of his expences on the road: There is one circumſtance of which, Sir, I could wiſh to be aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is the expence of the defence of theſe rivers, that is, the conſtruction of row gallies, floating batteries, &amp;c. to be brought to the account of the continent or of the
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:024456_0251_0FC76DA77B42F1B8"/>
province? I wiſh to be informed on this head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it is at the expence of the latter, I ſhall regularly propoſe to the Convention, or Committee of Safety, every ſcheme which may be attended with expence before it is entered upon. If the quarter-maſter-general, or his deputies, when they diſpatch any teams from Philadelphia with powder, or other neceſſaries, were to purchaſe the horſes throughout, for the continental uſe, inſtead of hiring them, the ſaving would be conſiderable; for in this country the hire is intolerably dear; ſo great indeed, that I have ventured to order a number of teams to be purchaſed.</p>
                  <p>I have juſt received a vague return of the forces of North-Carolina; of their powder and cannon; it does not appear that they have effective regulars, properly armed, more than two thouſand; of powder than two ton and an half; and as to cannon, they are almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtitute. As the enemy's advanced guard, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, is actually arrived, I muſt, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid detaching the ſtrongeſt battalion we have to their aſſiſtance; but, I own, I tremble at the ſame time at the thoughts of ſtripping this province of any part of its inadequate force. I am puzzled how to direct my motions from the uncertainty of the enemies' plan, but not diſpirited, as I am confident that the Congreſs will afford me every relief in their power, and am not in the leaſt diffident of the courage and zeal of the men and officers. I have, as yet, heard nothing of Mr. Stabler the engineer; I ought, in fact, to have at leaſt half a dozen; for we have a variety of poſts to throw up, and there is not a man or officer in the army that knows the difference between a <hi>chevaux de frieze</hi> and a cabbage-garden. I wiſh the Congreſs would indulge me with Mr. Smith, whom I know to be an able and active man.</p>

                  <p>AS I am obliged, by the arrival of the enemy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to North-Carolina, and am not leſs prompted by my zeal and affection for this province, than obliged by my duty, to take every precaution for its ſafety before my departure: on this principle I beg leave to lay before the Convention the following meaſures, which I conceive to be neceſſary:</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. To deviſe ſome means for eſtabliſhing a corps of cavalry; without which, an army is ſo extremely defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in every part of the world, and in none more than in this, for reaſons which it might be tedious to enumerate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. Without delay to order ſome able pilots of every river, to examine accurately the narroweſt part of the channel of each river; what is the nature of the ſhoals which form theſe channels; whether they are ſolid, firm ſand, gravel, or rock; what is the diſtance of the neareſt part of the channel from either ſhore; what is the nature of the ſhore; whether it is high or low; for I am ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine enough to hope, when theſe circumſtances are aſcertained, the navigation of moſt of the riv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s may be ſhut up to the enemy, by means of batteries, either float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or fixed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. As theſe purpoſes cannot be effected without a large body of carpenters, ſmiths, and artificers of every ſort, to eſtabliſh ſome companies of them, ſubject to the military laws; for without a coercive power, it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> part of the world to prevail on them to work.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly. As I underſtand there are prodigious ſtocks of ſheep and cattle on the iſlands near the eaſtern-ſhore, and as my authority does not extend to whatever concerns property, that you will order immediately all this ſtock to be tranſported to the continent; and if this is imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, to kill them, as otherwiſe they muſt indiſputably fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5thly. As the eaſtern counties are, from their great abundance of all the neceſſaries of life, ſo tempting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the incurſions of the enemy, and as I underſtand there will be no difficulty in procuring good men, I
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:024456_0253_0FC76DB070F518A8"/>
would humbly propoſe to the Convention, to augment Colonel Flemming's regiment to the ſame ſtrength of numbers with the other battalions.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now, Sir, beg leave to mention to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the convention, a very important matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; no leſs than the preſervation of the lives of our ſoldiers. The continental allowance to ſurgeons and ſurgeon's-mates of the regiments is ſo miſerably ſmall, and, at the ſame time, the common country prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſurgeons is ſo very lucrative in this province, that it is not poſſible to find men qualified for the ſtation who will accept; and as I cannot venture to propoſe, to the Continental Congreſs, the increaſe of the pay of the ſurgeons of the whole army, merely becauſe this increaſe is neceſſary in my diviſion, I muſt ſubmit it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Convention, whether ſuch an addition, as to bring up the pay of theſe gentlemen to the original provincial ordinance, will not be money well and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily expended.</p>

The inſtruction of your aſſembly to their delegates (which, <hi>inter nos,</hi> was a moſt wretched piece of buſineſs) was Roman magnanimity comparatively with this ſni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling production from Annapolis.

This ſtory is ſcarcely credible, but the poſſibility of the fact is now verified by the conduct of the Houſe of Convention of Maryland. What! when an attempt has been made to rob you and your poſterity of your birth-rights; when your fields have been laid waſte, your towns have been burnt, and your citizens butchered; when your property is ſeized and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated in all parts of the world; when an inexorable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, an abandoned parliament, and a corrupt puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous people, have formed an helliſh league to rob you of every thing men hold moſt dear; is it poſſible that there ſhould be creatures who march on two legs, and call themſelves human, who can be ſo deſtitute of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, courage, and feeling, as ſobbingly to proteſt, they ſhall conſider ſeparation from theſe butchers and robbers as the laſt of misfortunes?

Once more I muſt requeſt, that a ſtop be put to this childiſh, vicious, and ſcandalous practice. I extend the rule to thoſe who have the care of the field pieces; four hundred yards is the greateſt diſtance they ſhould be allowed to fire at.

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I ſhould have done myſelf the honour ſooner of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Congreſs of the attack made by the enemy's ſquadron on Sullivan's-Iſland, and their repulſe; but conjectured, that by waiting a day or two, I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be furniſhed with the means of ſending a more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, full and ſatisfactory account. My conjecture was right; for yeſterday five ſeamen made their eſcape, one of whom is a more intelligent fellow than is commonly found amongſt men of his level. Incloſed is a copy of their narrative; ſome parts of it are, perhaps, too whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and trivial to merit the attention of Congreſs, but I think it my duty to preſent it as it is, without adding or curtailing a circumſtance. I think, Sir, I may venture to congratulate the Congreſs on the event; not only the abvantages muſt be conſiderable, but the affair reflects no ſmall credit on the American arms.</p>
                  <p>On Friday, about eleven o'clock, the Commodore, with his whole ſquadron, conſiſting of two line of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-ſhips and ſix frigates, the rates of which are marked in the incloſed narrative, anchored at leſs than half muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſhot from the fort; and commenced one of the moſt furious and inceſſant fires I ever ſaw or heard. It was manifeſtly their plan to land at the ſame time their whole regulars at the eaſt end of the iſland, and, of courſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the fort by land and ſea. As the garriſon was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed entirely of raw troops, both men and officers; as I knew their ammunition was ſhort; and as the bridge by which we could reinforce, or call off the troops from the iſland, was unfiniſhed, you may eaſily conceive my anxiety. It was ſo great, that I was in ſuſpence whether I ſhould evacuate it or no. Fortunately, while I was in this ſtate of ſuſpence, ſome ammunition arrived from the town, and my aid de camp, Mr. Byrd, returning from the iſland with a flattering report of the garriſon's ſpirit, I determined to ſupport it at all hazards. On this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple I thought it my duty to croſs over to the iſland, to encourage the garriſon by my preſence; but I might have ſaved myſelf that trouble; for I found, on my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:024456_0258_0FC76DBBCD70B450"/>
they had no occaſion for any ſort of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I found them determined and cool to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: their behaviour would, in fact, have done honour to the oldeſt troops. I beg leave, Sir, therefore, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, in the ſtrongeſt terms, to the Congreſs, the commanding officer, Colonel Moultrie, and his whole garriſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as brave ſoldiers and exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ent citizens; nor muſt I omit, at the ſame time, mentioning Colonel Thompſon, who, with the South-Carolina rangers and a detachment of the North-Carolina regulars, repulſed the enemy in two ſeveral attempts to make a lodgment at the other extremity of the iſland.</p>
                  <p>Our loſs, conſidering the heat and duration of the fire, was inconſiderable: we had only ten men killed on the ſpot and twenty-two wounded; ſeven of whom loſt their limbs, but with their limbs they did not loſe their ſpirits; for they enthuſiaſtically encouraged their comrades never to abandon the ſtandard of liberty and their country. This, I do aſſure you, Sir, is not in the ſtyle of Gaſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nading romance, uſual after every ſucceſsful action, but literally fact; I, with pleaſure, mention the circumſtance, as it augurs well to the cauſe of freedom. At eleven the fire ceaſed, having continued juſt twelve hours without the leaſt intermiſſion. What the enemy's intentions are now, it is impoſſible to divine. I am inclined to think, they will, if they can repaſs the bar, bend their courſe to Cheſapeak or Hampton-Bay: perhaps ſhame and rage may prompt their land forces to ſome attempt before their departure: on my part, I ſhall ſpare no pains to diſcover their intentions and baffle their ſchemes.</p>
                  <p>As Georgia is a diſtrict of the command with which you have honoured me, I thought it prudent to requeſt ſome of their members to a conference with the preſident of this province, and myſelf. They accepted the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gave us great ſatisfaction from their intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and good ſenſe. Incloſed is the ſubſtance of their deliberation.</p>
                  <p>The province is certainly of the laſt importance to the common cauſe, and the mode of protecting it, pointed
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:024456_0259_0FC76DC2F6538820"/>
out by theſe gentlemen, is, in my opinion, in all its parts, wiſe and neceſſary. They had conceived a notion that I had powers to augment their eſtabliſhment; I aſſured them I had no ſuch powers; but both Mr. Rutledge and myſelf gave it as our opinion, that any expences mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly beyond their faculties which they might incur in the common cauſe, would be repaid by the Congreſs: and in this perſuaſion we ventured to enco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rage them to augment their cavalry, without loſs of time, and make the propoſed preſent of cattle to the Indians. Indeed, Sir, without a ſtrong corps of cavalry, I do not ſee how it is poſſible to protect theſe Southern colonies, and with one thouſand good cavalry, I think I could inſure their protection. From the want of this ſpecies of troops, Charleſton and its dependencies had certainly been loſt, if the enemy had acted with the vigor and expedition we had reaſon to expect; but a moſt unaccountable langour and inertneſs on their parts have ſaved us. If the ſcheme I propoſed in Virginia had been approved and adopted, it would have been not only a ſecurity but conſiderable oeconomy. The forage was to have been the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Now I am upon the ſubject, I cannot help men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, that I have been informed that the project has been conſidered by ſome gentlemen, as a ſort of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in me, in arrogating ſuch a power; but I fancy the affair was not properly underſtood: I ſaw the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate neceſſity of ſuch a corps. I knew they could be raiſed immediately by theſe means, and at the ſame time I was given to underſtand, by ſeveral gentlemen of the Virginia convention, that ſhould the Continental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs diſapprove of the expence (trifling as it was) there was little doubt of their convention defraying it; but, in fact, Sir, the meaſure ſeemed neceſſary for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the provinces, and not a day was to be loſt; which, I hope, will fully juſtify my conduct: and I muſt beg leave to repeat my aſſertion, that without cavalry theſe provinces cannot eaſily be defended.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh ſome means could be deviſed of reducing Eaſt-Florida to an American province. Had I force ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>MR. Rutledge will inform you by this expreſs, of the outrages committed by the Cherokees, which muſt be conſtrued as the commencement of a war. As it is now certain that a capital and favourite part of the plan laid down by our enemies, is to lay waſte the provinces, burn the inhabitants, and mix men, women, and children in one common carnage, by the hands of the Indians; and
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:024456_0261_0FC76DC632819890"/>
as this part of the plan, though a piece of inhumanity, is certainly more big with miſchievous conſequences than the reſt, it appears to me abſolutely neceſſary to cruſh the evil before it ariſes to any dangerous height. Indeed, if we avail ourſelves of the event, it may prove a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one. Perhaps we ought, in policy, to have wiſhed for it. We can now, with the greateſt juſtice, ſtrike a blow which is neceſſary to intimidate the numerous tribes of Indians from falling into the meaſures of our enemies; and as theſe Cherokees are not eſteemed the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable warriors, we can, probably, do it without much riſque or loſs. I think then, Sir, that without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's delay, a body of your frontier rifle-men ſhould be immediately furniſhed, and march into the country of the Overhill Cherokees, and make a ſevere, laſting and ſalutary example of them. The Carolinians propoſe at the ſame time attacking their lower towns, and, with the co-operation of Virginia, entertain no doubt of ſucceſs. Clinton's army and Parker's ſquadron are pretty much in the ſame ſituation as when I wrote laſt. They daily, indeed, make ſome alterations in the poſition of their land troops from one iſland to another; perhaps for new air or water, of which, the deſerters ſay, they are in great want. They tell us likewiſe, that conſiderable ſickneſs prevails in the army, and greater diſcontents from hard duty and bad diet. The ſpirit of deſertion begins to ſhew itſelf; five ſoldiers came over theſe two laſt nights, who aſſure us, that were they not on an iſland, from which it is difficult to eſcape, two-thirds of their army would ſoon be with us. I am myſelf inclined to believe them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, when I conſider the difficulties which the enemy's Generals have to encounter, the temper and diſpoſition of their troops, and the improving ſpirit of ours, I aſſure myſelf, that the game is in our hands. God give us more grace than to ſhuffle it away.</p>

                     <salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE received yours, of the 28th of May, and did not think it poſſible that any thing could come from your hand to give me ſo diſagreeable ſenſations. You tell me a dark, myſterious ſtory of a certain great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, of whom prince Ferdinand has declared, <hi>ſi l'on veut un officier,</hi> &amp;c. this great General in the clouds, will, it ſeems, graciouſly condeſcend to ſerve America, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that Congreſs will give him aſſurances of ſtepping over the heads of every officer but one, and this he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to, only on conſideration of the confidence due to an American. You aſk my opinion on this ſubject; but the palpable meaning of your letter is, to prepare me for a ceſſion of my rank in favour of ſome impudent adventurer. Buckwith is the man, as you conjecture, from his known political principles and military abilities, which are ſo tranſcendent, that I ought for the public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to make a ſecond ſacrifice. I am not, I believe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally proud; I do not think myſelf conceited of my talents; but to be put in competition, much more to be ſpurned aſide, to make room for ſo deſpicable a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as Buckwith, a generally reputed coward, (and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>—d ſycophant) I ſay, to be kicked out of my ſtation for ſuch a creature as this, would ſwell a man more humble than myſelf into a trumpeter of his own merits. Great God! is it come to this? I am not, it ſeems, an American; but am I not (if I may ſo expreſs myſelf) <hi>Americanior ipſis Americanis?</hi> Have I not, ſuch has been my zeal for your cauſe, once already waved my military claims in deference to the whim and partiality of ſome of your members? Did I not conſent to ſerve under an old church-warden, of whom you had conceived a moſt extravagant and ridiculous opinion? Your eyes were at length opened, and deacon Ward returned to his proper occupation; and would you now a ſecond time—do you think it conſiſtent with decency, I may ſay, gratitude or common honeſty, to load me a ſecond time with a ſimilar diſgrace? Have I betrayed any ignorance in my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Have I ſhewn a deſiciency in courage? Am I
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:024456_0263_0FC76DCAF21BB688"/>
ſlackened in my zeal or induſtry? What have I done to merit ſuch an indignation? What part of my conduct can juſtify your harbouring ſuch an idea? Have not I ſtaked say fortune, life and reputation in your cauſe? Is there a ſervice in Europe, to ſpeak proudly, (your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious propoſal forces me to it) is there a ſervice in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, where, with ſome ſmall reputation, and my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful friends, I might not expect the ſame rank I now hold? Have I not made myſelf a voluntary ſlave for the inſurances of American freedom? Have I, ſleeping or waking, employed a ſingle thought, but for her welfare, glory or advantage? But enough of this—You aſk my opinion, and I will freely, explicitly, and conciſely give it to you. If the Congreſs ſupercede me, I will, I muſt obey; but I hope, in common juſtice, and for their own honour, that they will re-eſtabliſh me, at leaſt in part, in the eaſy fortune which I have forfeited, ſo as to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to retire from a ſervice to which I am no longer thought adequate. Before I conclude, let me once more repeat confidentially to you, that if Buckwith is the man, in whoſe favour you meditate ſo groſs a piece of injuſtice, you will make a very bad bargain, as he is certainly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fame belies him, neither poſſeſſed of courage, abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or integrity.</p>
                  <p>In God's name, if a real genius, or acknowledged hero, favoured by Heaven with a more than common portion of etherial ſpirit, ſhould preſent himſelf, (a <hi>la Lippe,</hi> or <hi>Braganſa)</hi> receive him with open arms, as an immediate preſent from God; inveſt him with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the whole. No man loves, reſpects and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences another more than I do General Waſhington. I eſteem his virtues, private and public. I know him to be a man of ſenſe, courage, and firmneſs; but if a hero ſhould ſtart up, endowed with the attributes, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my perſuaſion reſide in the two I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and who would charge himſelf with the mighty taſk of your political ſalvation, General Waſhington ought, and, I am convinced, would reſign the truncheon; but that a little, paltry, impudent adventurer ſhould ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

ſtipulate for the ſecond rank, when, if his motives were pure, he could be equally ſerviceable in the third, fourth, fifth, or ſixth; it is not to be endured, it is a groſs impoſition on common underſtanding, and a groſſer attempt to rob an individual. I muſt beg and conjure you, my dear friend, for ſuch I am ſure you are, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the delicate, perhaps, you will ſay, falſe notions in which ſoldiers are bred; and that you will be careful of putting to ſo ſevere a trial the ſenſibility of one, who is moſt ſincerely, devotedly, and affectionately,</p>

                  <p>I USED to regret not being thrown into the world, in the glorious third or fourth century of the Romans, but I am now thoroughly reconciled to my lot. The reveries which have frequently for a while ſerved to tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle my imagination (but which, when awakened from my trance, as conſtantly I conſidered as mere golden caſtles built in the air) at length bid fair for being realiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We ſhall now, moſt probably, ſee a mighty empire eſtabliſhed of freemen, whoſe honour, property, and military glories are not to be at the diſpoſal of a ſcepter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tyrant; nor their conſciences to be fettered by a proud,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:024456_0265_0FC76DD186EFDD18"/>
domineering hierarchy. Every faculty of the ſoul will be now put in motion, no merit can lie latent; the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt offices of the ſtate, both civil and military, will now be obtained, without court favour, or the raſcally talents of ſervility and obſervance, by which court favour, could alone be acquired. Senſe, valour and induſtry will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us to the goal: every ſpark of ability which every individual poſſeſſes, will now be brought forth and form the common aggregate for the advantage and honour of the community. The operations of war will be directed by men qualified for war, and carried on with that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy natural to a young people. True unartized know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, unſophiſticated learning, ſimple genuine eloquence and poetry will be carried on to the higheſt degree of perfection. This, to many, I am ſenſible, would appear rant, but to you, who, I think, have congenial feelings with my own, it needs no apology. However, I ſhall now endeavour to deliver myſelf more like a man of this world.</p>
                  <p>I moſt ſincerely congratulate you on the noble conduct of your countrymen; and I congratulate your country on having citizens, deſerving of the high honour to which you are exalted; for the being elected to the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy of a free people is certainly the pinnacle of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man glory; and am perſuaded that they could not have made a happier choice.</p>
                  <p>Will you excuſe me? but I am myſelf ſo extremely democratical, that I think it a fault in your conſtitution that the governor ſhould be eligible for three years ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively. It appears to me that a government of three years may furniſh an opportunity of acquiring a very dangerous influence; but this is not the worſt; Tacitus ſays, <hi>plura peccantur, dum demeremur, quam dum offendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> A man who is fond of office, and has his eye upon re-election, will be courting favour and popularity, at the expence of his duty. He will give way to the popular humours of the day, let them be ever ſo pernicious. In ſhort his adminiſtration will be relaxed in general, or partial to thoſe whom he conceives to have the greateſt
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:024456_0266_0FC76DD2F1449450"/>
intereſt: Whereas, were all hopes of re-election preclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till after the intervention of a certain number of years, he would endeavour to illuſtrate the year of his government by a ſtrict, rigorous, and manly performance of his duty. Theſe notions may, perhaps, be weak and fooliſh; but ſuch as they are, I am ſure you will excuſe my uttering them.</p>
                  <p>There is a barbariſm crept in among us that extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhocks me, I mean thoſe tinſel epithets, with which (I come in for my ſhare) we are ſo beplaiſtered; <hi>His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> and <hi>His Honour;</hi> The <hi>Honourable Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> or the <hi>Honourable Convention.</hi> This ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, nauſeating cant may be well enough adopted to barbarous monarchies; or to gratify the adulterated pride of the <hi>magnifici in pompous ariſtocracies;</hi> but in a great, free, manly, equal commonwealth, it is quite abominable; for my own part, I would as lief they would put rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane in my mouth, as the <hi>Excellency</hi> with which I am daily crammed. How much more true dignity was there in the ſimplicity of addreſs amongſt the Romans! Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Tullius Cicero, Decimo Bruto Imperatori, or Caio Marcello Conſuli, than to his Excellency Major General Noodle, or to the Honourable John Doodle. My ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are perhaps trivial and whimſical; but, for my ſoul, I cannot help ſtarting them. If, therefore, I ſhould ſometimes addreſs a letter to you without the <hi>Excellency</hi> tacked, you muſt not eſteem it a mark of perſonal or official diſreſpect, but the reverſe.</p>
                  <p>The diſcontent of the troops which you mentioned as ariſing from the want of regular payment, might have been remedied by General Lewis; his warrant is undoubtedly ſufficient for the pay-maſter: however, I have written to that gentleman on this ſubject, and am in hopes that affairs for the future will be more ſatisfactorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted.</p>
                  <p>An old rice-boat, which we converted the other day into a row-battery, has made a conſiderable prize; no leſs than a brig with a whole company of the royal high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land emigrants on board, conſiſting of two officers and
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:024456_0267_0FC76DD608D55A40"/>
fifty men: although they ſaw that they were inevitably our prize, had the impudence to throw their arms over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, for which they ought to have their ears cut off, as it was contrary to all the rules of war.</p>
                  <p>I ſend you incloſed the ſtate of the enemy's navy; I think there is no doubt of their army having ſteered their courſe Northward; on this preſumption I ſhall direct my courſe towards Virginia, but firſt muſt aſſiſt to regulate the military affairs of this province, in the beſt manner I can; though, in fact, that will be doing little; the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of this complex play we are acting, of Duke and no Duke, are numberleſs and great. The preſident is thought by ſome to be the real commander, I am thought ſo by others; in ſhort, there muſt be no troops but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental. The council is at preſent employed in ſettling a more regular poſt. We have received none theſe eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days; for my own part, I conclude the mail has been intercepted and carried on board the man of war. Seven tons and a half of powder were ſafely landed four days ago, at George-town.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I WISH I had been informed how I am to addreſs myſelf in writing to the Board of War; whether to the board in general, to the firſt members on the liſt, or to the ſecretary. I have ventured on the laſt mode; if it is wrong, I hope I ſhall be excuſed and corrected. The irregularity and tardineſs of the poſt are now become a matter of my ſerious concern; we never receive a letter from Philadelphia in leſs than ſix or ſeven weeks; that from the members of the Board of War and Ordinance is only juſt now arrived, though dated the twelfth of
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:024456_0268_0FC76DDC9E4DC448"/>
June. I have been preſſed, Sir, by ſeveral members of the Convention of Virginia, to eſtabliſh a poſt for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict; but am apprehenſive, that it might interfere with the continental poſt; however, the conſequences ariſing from the irregularity of the poſt are ſo very ſerious, that all other conſiderations muſt be waved: In the mean time, I am conſtrained to the neceſſity of putting the continent to the expence of an expreſs almoſt on every occaſion.</p>
                  <p>I am extremely rejoiced at the eſtabliſhment of a Board of War; for the buſineſs of Congreſs was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and heterogeneous, that it was impoſſible they ſhould give the neceſſary attention to the affairs of any one diſtinct department; their regulations with reſpect to returns, &amp;c. ſhall be punctually obſerved. I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered General Armſtrong to collect the returns from the different corps, to digeſt them into one, and tranſmit them immediately to the Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>I am myſelf buſied in arranging matters for an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Eaſt-Florida. It is much to be lamented, that theſe Southern colonies ſuffered the whole of laſt winter to paſs over their heads without preparing the means either of offence or defence. Not a ſingle row-galley or armed boat was furniſhed by Virginia, North, or South-Carolina; were we provided with a moderate fleet of theſe ſort of veſſels, I think I could enſure the reduction of Eaſt-Florida, an object, though not equal with Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, is certainly of very great importance. Here the meaſures of the Southern Indians are concerted and planned, their treaties negociated and concluded; here they receive their bribes, for their murderous operations, and from hence they are ſupplied with all the means and inſtruments of war: from hence they have lately made ſome alarming incurſions into Georgia, carried off a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of negroes, and not leſs than two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand head of cattle: they have likewiſe thrown up a poſt on the river St. Mary's, which, if ſuffered to remain, may prove extremely troubleſome to Georgia, by affording a ready aſylum to negro deſerters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="unknown:024456_0269_0FC76DDD774C6AF8"/>From theſe conſiderations, although I cannot think of laying ſiege to Auguſtine, having neither boats, horſes, waggons, nor any other means of conveying cannon, ammunition, or proviſion for the purpoſe. I think it both a prudent and neceſſary meaſure to attempt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the whole province of Eaſt-Florida. It will be a ſecurity to Georgia, occaſion infinite diſtreſs to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of St. Auguſtine, but, above all, make a ſalutary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the minds of the Creeks, who now are thought to ſtand wavering. They profeſs a good diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the American cauſe; but if, by a ſtrong predatory expedition into the province of the enemy, we give an idea of our proweſs and ſuperior ſtrength, they will be riveted in our intereſt. If I was ſure Mr. Clinton and his army had ſteered their courſe to New-York, as the deſerters all agree, and a letter which was left in Long Iſland confirms, [a copy of which is here encloſed] I ſhould, as I have nothing immediately elſe to do in my diſtrict, march in perſon with this party; but the bare poſſibility of his being gone to Virginia will detain me. Every ſhip of the enemy has now repaſſed the bar. It appears by this ſame encloſed letter that they were more roughly handled than even the deſerters repreſented.</p>
                  <p>The Congreſs I make no doubt have been informed of the incurſions made, and the ravages committed by the upper and lower Cherokees; an expedition I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand is furniſhed forth by Virginia, againſt the upper nations; another by this province againſt the lower; the ſucceſs or miſcarriage is of the laſt conſequence; I am therefore deſirous of forming a ſecond line, or <hi>corps de reſerve,</hi> and detaching for this purpoſe, a regiment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, but have not as yet been able to procure waggons ſufficient for two companies. It will be neceſſary that Congreſs ſhould make ſome regular eſtabliſhment for waggons, I ſhould think one waggon at leaſt, if not two, ſhould be purchaſed and appointed to each company of the whole army, and regiments made reſponſible for theirs reſpectively. We ſhould then be able to march when occaſion requires expedition; at preſent it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:024456_0270_0FC76DDF01206FD8"/>
as much impoſſible to march an hundred miles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fate of a province depended upon it, as if the ſoldiers wanted legs.</p>
                  <p>I hope the Congreſs and Board of War will excuſe my giving an opinion on a ſubject on which it has not been aſked; but I conceive it to be my duty not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſilent on any affairs of ſuch moment. I find, Sir, that repreſentations have been made, that many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies would ariſe from putting the troops of this province on the continental eſtabliſhment. I can aſſure the Congreſs, that it is almoſt impoſſible to carry on the ſervice, if they remain on the colonial eſtabliſhment; the difference of the laws, the diſtinction of rank, occaſion ſo much confuſion; and the ridiculous farce of Duke and no Duke, we are playing, (the officers not always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending who is their proper commander, whether the preſident, or continental general) occaſions very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſtractions; but there are other matters of more ſerious conſideration, of which I ſhall not trouble you with a detail; nor do I find that the officers of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince object to a continental eſtabliſhment, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, all thoſe I have converſed with, ſeem deſirous of it. Upon the whole, I think it abſolutely eſſential to the public ſervice, that theſe regiments ſhould immediately be put on the ſame footing, and be governed by the ſame laws, with the reſt; nor am I ſingular in opinion: the two brigadiers, all the officers of every rank, and the greater part of the gentleman of the country concur with me.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Muhlenburg, of the eighth battalion of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, has been made very uneaſy by ſome letters he has lately received with reſpect to the rank of his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Theſe letters intimate, that it was never the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Congreſs to conſider the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth, battalions of the Virginians on the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal eſtabliſhment until they were entirely complete. That his regiment never was entirely complete; and that, conſequently, after having ſo long thought himſelf on the continental eſtabliſhment; and on this preſumption
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:024456_0271_0FC76DE08F6BB548"/>
having marched five hundred miles from his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, under the command of a continental general, he now, at leaſt, finds himſelf only a provincial officer.</p>
                  <p>I have ventured to aſſure him and his officers, who are equally uneaſy, that there muſt be ſome miſtake in this affair; in fact, the hardſhip would be ſo great, that I cannot believe their apprehenſions are well founded. It was, if I remember right, notified in April, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safety in Virginia, that they were then taken upon the continental eſtabliſhment; and, though in this I may be miſtaken, without the proviſo of their being complete.</p>
                  <p>It happened at this time, though not complete to a man, (for no regiment ever is complete to a man) that Muh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburg's regiment was not only the moſt complete of the province, but, I believe, of the whole continent; it was not only the moſt complete in numbers, but the beſt armed, cloathed and equipped in all reſpects for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſervice; I muſt repeat, that I cannot conceive that it was ever the intention of Congreſs that the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be filled to a man; but that they ſhould be competent to ſervice in or out of their province. In moſt ſervices when new levies are raiſed, one half of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed complement entitles them to eſtabliſhment. Muh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburg's regiment wanted only forty at moſt. It was the ſtrength and good condition of the regiment, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to order it out of its own province, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any other. I certainly conſidered them at that time as continental troops, otherwiſe I could have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to order them out of the province.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now ſubmit it to the conſideration of the Congreſs, if it would not really be the greateſt cruelty, that their ſtrength and good condition ſhould be turned againſt them. It was their ſtrength and good condition which carried them out of their province, where, had they remained and known that it was a neceſſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their eſtabliſhment to be complete to a man, they certainly could have accompliſhed it in three days. I do, therefore, moſt ſincerely hope, and confidently perſuade
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:024456_0272_0FC76DE790F60E68"/>
myſelf, that Muhlenburg's regiment will at leaſt data their rank from the day I ordered them to march out of their province; not only juſtice, but policy requires it, for you will otherwiſe loſe a moſt excellent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>I often repreſented to Congreſs how difficult or impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it would be to engage, or retain after they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, any engineers of tolerable qualification on the wretched pay eſtabliſhed. The two appointed to my diſtrict have [as I expected] quitted the ſervice; it was indeed impoſſible for them to exiſt. Stabler, I hear, has entered into the ſervice of Virginia. Maſſenburg is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by this province, at fifty-four dollars per month, a ſervant, rations, and his travelling expences. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly begged his diſmiſſion from me, aſſuring me (and, I believe, ſincerely) he was zealous in the cauſe of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; that he would willingly, if I choſe it, enliſt as a common ſoldier; but that to ride about the continent from north to ſouth, find horſes, and appear like a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was impoſſible. I could not in conſcience force him to ſtarve, ſo conſented to his engaging in this ſervice. I am now without a ſingle engineer, and really know not how to carry on the buſineſs. I hope the board will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the neceſſity of ſupplying me.</p>

As a thorough knowledge of the preſent condition of this colony, of its ſtrength and weakneſs, is certainly a matter of very ſerious conſideration, I ſhall lay before the Board the beſt and moſt accurate information I am able.</p>
                  <p>Georgia is a ſtate of much greater importance to the empire of America than generally ſuppoſed, at leaſt, than what I myſelf imagined before I viſited it. The variety
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:024456_0274_0FC76DEA5F3C0860"/>
of navigable rivers, commodious harbours, and find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; the prodigious quantities of rice, and immenſe ſtocks of cattle, both on the iſlands, and on the main; but above all the gentleneſs and ſalubrity of the winter ſeaſons, with the conveniency of its ſituation for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Weſt-India iſlands, would render it a moſt valuable poſſeſſion to the enemy; the Altamaha, a very noble river, already furniſhes a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and may, in time, furniſh any quantity of lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the garriſon of St. Auguſtine, and, indeed, the whole province of Eaſt-Florida, draw their ſubſiſtence from Georgia; and, if all intercourſe with her were cut off, that neſt of robbers and pirates would probably fall to the ground, and of courſe, the empire of the United States become more round and entire. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſummed up together, muſt evince the importance of keeping Georgia or any part of it out of the hands of the enemy; the means of doing it, demands the utmoſt attention. I have turned my thoughts to the ſubject, and ſhall beg leave to ſubmit the reſult to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Congreſs.

M'Intoſh's battalion is really a very fine one, (one of the beſt, I think, on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) but as, perhaps, it might appear a harſh taſk, to inſiſt on this battalion's acting with the neceſſary rigour againſt ſome of their neareſt connections and relations, accuſed of being concerned in treaſonable practices; it is my intention to remove them either into South or North-Carolina, where they can be more ſerviceable, and have an opportunity of compleating themſelves, which in this ſtate, from the dearth of men, is impoſſible, and
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:024456_0275_0FC76DEF760AB780"/>
replace them with an equal or greater number from South-Carolina.</p>
                  <p>Such is the preſent condition of the ſtrength of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, very far from being adequate to its defence. My ſcheme for its ſecurity is, as row gallies, and armed boats are ſo well calculated for what is called the inland navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, give them an infinite advantage over veſſels mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly failing, which in theſe ſtrait confined waters have no room for manoeuvring; they will ſecure the rivers againſt the predatory incurſions of the enemy, prevent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of negroes, ſweep the coaſts clear of tenders; but, above all, facilitate the means of the different ſtates mutually aſſiſting each other with troops, cannon, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and other requiſites, which is now effected with difficulties, ſlowneſs, and monſtrous expence. Three gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are already on the ſtocks in this port, and we have armed and equiped ſeveral boats with ſwivels, and one gun on the bow of each. The leaſt of them capable of containing thirty men, and rowed with fourteen oars; ſailors, of whom we find ſo great a ſcarcity, are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for this ſpecies of veſſels, the ſoldiers are compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the buſineſs; beſides the equipment of theſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and boats, I propoſed eſtabliſhing little forts, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts, in certain ſituations, on the river St. Mary's, Satilla, Sapello, and Altamaha, which may enable us to make incurſions from time to time, when circumſtances require it, into Eaſt-Florida, and render it dangerous for them to make attempts of a ſimilar nature into Georgia. Theſe redoubts, or little forts, will likewiſe ſerve as places of rendezvous, refreſhment, and retreat for bodies of horſe rangers which ought continually to be patroling on the frontier. Such are the beſt methods, after having conſulted the moſt intelligent people, which, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, can be deviſed for the defence and ſecurity of this ſtate, unleſs, indeed, we could prevail on the province, to contract their frontier, by breaking up all their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the other ſide of the Altamaha, which, to me, I confeſs, appears a wiſer and more oeconomical mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but this, I am afraid, is not to be accompliſhed.</p>

                     <pb n="269" facs="unknown:024456_0276_0FC76DF32F9194F0"/>I muſt now beg leave to lay before the Board, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the higheſt concern, and which certainly demands the moſt ſerious attention of Congreſs, as, unleſs reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, it may not only diſtreſs the circumſtances of the public, but bring a diſgrace on the American character; I mean the unconſcionable advantages which individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, merchants, mechanics, farmers, and planters are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take of the public neceſſities. If boats, wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, horſes, drugs, clothing, ſkins, neceſſaries, even lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle refreſhments, ſuch as fruit or garden ſtuff, are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſoldiers, no price being regulated, the extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is monſtrous: the expences of the war muſt not only be prodigiouſly ſwelled by this want of regulation, but the officers and ſoldiers are diſguſted to the ſervice by the toleration of ſuch impoſition; for inſtance, the Virginians and North-Carolinians are ſo much out of temper with Charleſton, on this head, that ſhould it be again attacked, and the aſſiſtance of theſe troops be again requiſite, I am afraid we ſhall find a dangerous repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in them to march, when ordered. I moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly wiſh, therefore, that the Congreſs will make it an object to remedy this evil. Might they not recommend or enjoin to the legiſlatures of the different ſtates, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a committee of aſſeſſors from their reſpective bodies, to ſix the prices of the different articles in their provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Whether this method is or is not proper, I cannot pretend to ſay; but ſomething, I muſt repeat, ſhould be done.</p>
                  <p>The waſte, difficulty, and expence ariſing from a want of method in proviſioning the troops, when aſſembled in any particular ſpot, upon an emergency, are ſo great, that magazines ought to be eſtabliſhed in every province, more particularly in thoſe, which have the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of being attacked: by theſe means, the troops will not only be better fed, but be an immenſe ſaving to the continent; for the contractors, not being preſſed for time, can, at their leiſure, purchaſe every ſpecies of neceſſaries in theſe parts, where they are beſt and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; but, when a great and ſudden demand is made, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

for cattle, corn, ſpirits, &amp;c. they are under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking that which is next at hand, and giving the ſellers their own price. On this conſideration, in concurrence with the preſident and council of South-Carolina, I have thought it expedient to eſtabliſh ſome magazines in South-Carolina, of pork, beef, corn, &amp;c. beſides ſtraw and whiſky, which, in theſe low, damp countries, are abſolutely neceſſary; at all events, this eſtabliſhment can be no loſs to the continent, as the beef and pork, at leaſt, can always, with advantage, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Weſt-Indies. Were I at a leſs diſtance from the Congreſs, I ſhould not take the liberty of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a ſingle dollar without having obtained their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; but, at this diſtance, I muſt aſſume ſuch a power, or let the public affairs go to wreck, and of courſe, prove myſelf totally unworthy of the great truſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs have repoſed in me.</p>

                  <p>IT will be neceſſary in addreſſing a letter of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo abruptly to your Excellency, that I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you who the writer is. I have ſerved as lieutenant-colonel in the Engliſh ſervice, colonel in the Portugueſe, afterwards as aid de camp to his Poliſh majeſty, with the rank of major general. Having purchaſed a ſmall eſtate in America, I had determined to retire, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my days, to a peaceful aſylum: when the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the miniſtry, and court of Great Britain, forced this continent to arms, for the preſervation of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I was called, by the voice of the people, to the rank of ſecond in command. I make no doubt of this letter's
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:024456_0278_0FC76DF571E57FA0"/>
being kindly received by your Excellency, both in the character of a good Frenchman, and friend to humanity. The preſent conjuncture of affairs renders the intereſt of France and of this continent one and the ſame thing; every obſervation drawn from hiſtory muſt evince, that it was the excluſive commerce of theſe colonies, which enabled Great Britain to cope with France, gave to her a decided ſuperiority in marine, and, of courſe, enabled her in the frequent wars betwixt the two nations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her rival to the laſt extremity. This was the caſe, ſo peculiarly in the laſt war, that had the Britiſh mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry perſevered, Heaven knows what would have been the fate of France. It follows, that if France can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the monopoly, or the greater part of this commerce, her opulence, ſtrength, and proſperity, muſt grow to a prodigious height; and nothing can be more certain, than that, if America is enabled to preſerve the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhe has now declared, the gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>r part of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, if not the monopoly, muſt fall to the ſhare of France.</p>
                  <p>The imaginary plans of conqueſt of Lewis the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, had they been realized, would not have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the power of that monarchy, on ſo ſolid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent a baſis, as the ſimple aſſiſtance, or rather friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercourſe with this continent, will inevitably give. Without injuſtice, or the colour of injuſtice, but, on the contrary, only aſſuming the patronage of the rights of mankind, France has now in her power to become not only the greateſt, but the moſt truly glorious monarchy which has appeared on the ſtage of the world. In the firſt place, her poſſeſſions in the iſlands will be ſecured againſt all poſſibility of attack; the Royal Revenues immenſely increaſed, her people eaſed of their preſent burdens, an eternal incitement be preſented to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and the means of increaſe by the facility of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding ſuſtenance for their families multiplied. In ſhort, there is no ſaying what degree of eminence, happineſs, and glory, ſhe may derive from the independence of this continent. Some viſionary writers have indeed aſſerted,
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:024456_0279_0FC76DFC6F2CFB08"/>
that could this eountry onec ſhake off her European trammels, it would ſoon become more formidable alone, from the virtue and energy, natural to a young people, than Great Britain with her colonies united in a ſtate of dependency. But the men who have built ſuch hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes muſt be utter ſtrangers to the manners, genius, diſpoſition, turn of mind, and circumſtances of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Their diſpoſition is manifeſtly to agriculture, and the ſimple life of ſhepherds. As long as vaſt tracts of land remain unoccupied, to which they can ſend colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (if I may ſo expreſs it) of their offspring, they will never entertain a thought of marine or manufactures. Their ideas are ſolely confined to labour and to planting, for thoſe nations, who can, on the cheapeſt terms, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with the neceſſary utenſils for labouring and planting, and cloaths for their families; and till the whole vaſt extent of continent is fully ſtocked with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they will never entertain another idea. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effected for ages; and what then may happen, it is out of the line of politicians to lay any ſtreſs upon: moſt probably, they will be employed in wars amongſt themſelves, before they aim at foreign conqueſts. In ſhort, the apprehenſion is too remote to rouſe the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of any reaſonable citizen of a foreign State. On the other hand, it is worthy your Excellency's attention, to conſider what will be the conſequences, ſhould Great Britain ſucceed in the preſent conteſt. America, it is true, will be wretched and enſlaved; but a number of ſlaves may compoſe a formidable army and fleet. The proximity of ſituation, with ſo great a force, entirely at the diſpoſal of Great Britain, will put it in her power to take poſſeſſion of your iſlands on the firſt rupture. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending to the ſpirit of propheſy, ſuch, I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, will be the event of the next war; upon the whole, I muſt repeat, that it is for the intereſt, as well as glory of France, to furniſh us with every means of ſupporting our liberties, to effect which, we only demand a conſtant ſyſtematic ſupply of the neceſſaries of war. We do not require any aid of men, we have numbers, and, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:024456_0280_0FC76DFDB06E29B0"/>
courage ſufficient to carry us triumphantly through the ſtruggle. We require ſmall arms, powder, fieldpieces, wollen and linen to cloath our troops; alſo drugs, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly bark: in return for which, every neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for your iſlands may be expected, as rice, corn, lumber, &amp;c. If, indeed, you could ſpare us a few able engineers, and artillery officers, they may depend upon an honourable reception and comfortable eſtabliſhment. The Sieur de la Plain, one of your countrymen, now engaged in the cauſe of the United States of America, will have the honour of delivering this letter to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. I have no doubt of his being received with that politeneſs, and kindneſs, to be expected from a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of your rank and character.</p>

                     <salute>MY DEAR RUSH,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THOUGH I had no occaſion for freſh aſſurances of your friendſhip, I cannot help being much pleaſed with the warmth which your letter, delivered to me by Mr. Hall, breathes; and, I hope, it is unneceſſary to aſſure you, that my ſentiments, with reſpect to you, are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent.</p>
                  <p>You will think it odd, that I ſhould ſeem to be an apologiſt for General Howe: I know not how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, but when I have taken prejudices in favour, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man, I find it a difficulty in ſhaking them off. From my firſt acquaintance with Mr. Howe, I liked him: I thought him friendly, candid, good natured,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:024456_0281_0FC76DFF31A7E618"/>
brave, and rather ſenſible than the reverſe. I believe ſtill, that he is naturally ſo; but a corrupt, or, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, no education, the faſhion of the times, and the reigning idolatry amongſt the Engliſh, (particularly the ſoldiery) for every ſceptered <hi>calf, wolf, hog,</hi> or <hi>aſs,</hi> have ſo totally perverted his underſtanding and heart, that private friendſhip has not force ſufficient to keep a door open for the admittance of mercy towards political here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. He was beſides, perſuaded that I was doubly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, both as a traitor and deſerter. In ſhort, ſo totally was he inebriated with this idea, that I am convinced he would have thought himſelf both politically and morally damned had he acted any other part than what he did. He is, beſides, the moſt indolent of mortals: never took farther pains to examine the merits or demerits of the cauſe in which he was engaged, than merely to recollect, that Great Britain was ſaid to be the mother country, George the Third King of Great Britain, that the parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was called the repreſentatives of Great Britain, that the King and parliament formed the ſupreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that a ſupreme power is abſolute and uncontrolable, that all reſiſtance muſt, conſequently, be rebellion; but, above all, that he was a ſoldier, and bound to obey in all caſes whatever.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are his notions, and this his logic; but through theſe abſurdities I could diſtinguiſh, when he was left to himſelf, rays of friendſhip and good nature breaking out. It is true, he was ſeldom left to himſelf; for never poor mortal, thruſt into high ſtation, was ſurrounded by ſuch fools and ſcoundrels. M'Kenſey, Balfour, Galloway, were his counſellors: they urged him to all his acts of harſhneſs; they were his ſcribes: all the damned ſtuff which was iſſued to the aſtoniſhed world was theirs. I believe he ſcarcely ever read the letters he ſigned. You will ſcarcely believe it, but I can aſſure you as a fact, that he never read the curious proclamation, iſſued at the head of Elk, till three days after it was publiſhed. You will ſay, that I am drawing my friend Howe in more ridiculous colours than he has yet been repreſented
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:024456_0282_0FC76E00B0590788"/>
in; but this is his real character. He is naturally good humoured, complaiſant, but illiterate and indolent to the laſt degree, unleſs as an executive ſoldier, in which capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city he is all fire and activity, brave and cool as Julius Caeſar. His underſtanding is, as I obſerved before, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good than otherwiſe; but was totally confounded and ſtupified by the immenſity of the taſk impoſed upon him. He ſhut his eyes, fought his battles, drank his bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, had his little whore, adviſed with his counſellors, received his orders from North and Germain, (one more abſurd than the other) took Galloway's opinion, ſhut his eyes, fought again, and is now, I ſuppoſe, to be called to account for acting according to inſtructions; but, I believe, his eyes are now opened; he ſees he has been an inſtrument of wickedneſs and folly: indeed, when I obſerved it to him, he not only took patiently the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but indirectly aſſented to the truth of it. He made, at the ſame time, as far as his <hi>mauvais honte</hi> would permit, an apology for his treatment of me.</p>
                  <p>Thus far with regard to Mr. Howe. You are ſtruck with the great events, changes, and new cnaracters which have appeared on the ſtage ſince I ſaw you laſt; but I am more ſtruck with the admirable efficacy of blunders. It ſeemed to be a trial of ſkill which party ſhould outdo the other; and it is hard to ſay which played the deepeſt ſtrokes; but it was a capital one of ours, which certainly gave the happy turn which affairs have taken. Upon my ſoul, it was time for Fortune to interpoſe, or we were inevitably loſt; but this we will talk over another time. I ſuppoſe we ſhall ſee one another at Philadelphia, very ſoon, in attendance. God bleſs you!</p>

                  <p>WHEN an officer of the reſpectable rank I bear is groſsly traduced and calumniated, it is incumbent on him to clear up the affair to the world, with as little delay as
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:024456_0284_0FC76E090B418BC8"/>
poſſible. The ſpirit of defamation and calumny (I am ſorry to ſay it) is grown to a prodigious and intolerable height on this continent. If you had accuſed me of a deſign to procraſtinate the war, or of holding a treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble correſpondence with the enemy, I could have borne it: this I am uſed to; and this happened to the great Fabius Maximus. If you had accuſed me of getting drunk as often as I could get liquor, as two Alexanders the Great have been charged with this vice, I ſhould, perhaps, have ſat patient under the imputation; or, even if you had given the plaineſt hints, that I had ſtolen the ſoldiers ſhirts, this I could have put up with, as the great Duke of Marlborough would have been an example; or if you had contented yourſelf with aſſerting, that I was ſo abominable a ſloven as never to part with my ſhirt, until my ſhirt parted with me, the anecdotes of my illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious nameſake of Sweden <note n="*" place="bottom">Charles XII.</note> would nave adminiſtered ſome comfort to me. But the calumny you have, in the fertility of your malicious wit, choſen to invent, is of ſo new, ſo unprecedented, and ſo helliſh a kind, as would make Job himſelf ſwear like a Virginia Colonel.</p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible that the celebrated Miſs F—s,<note n="‡" place="bottom">This young lady was a Jeweſs,</note> a lady who has had every human and divine advantage, who has read [or, at leaſt, might have read] in the originals, the New and Old Teſtaments; [though I am afraid ſhe too ſeldom looks even into the tranſlations:] I ſay, is it poſſible that Miſs F—s, with every human and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine advantage, who might, and ought to have read theſe two good books, which [an old Welſh nurſe, whoſe uncle was reckoned the beſt preacher in Merionethſhire, aſſured me] enjoins charity, and denounces vengeance againſt ſlander and evil ſpeaking; is it poſſible, I again repeat it, that Miſs F—s ſhould, in the face of the day, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her malignity ſo far in the preſence of three moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable perſonages; (one of the oldeſt religion in the world, one of the neweſt; for he is a new-light man;

and the other, moſt probably, of no religion at all, as he is an Engliſh ſailor;) but I demand it again and again, is it poſſible, that Miſs F—s ſhould aſſert it, in the preſence of theſe reſpectable perſonages, "That I wore green breeches patched with leather?" To convict you, therefore, of the falſehood of this moſt diabolical ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; to put you to eternal ſilence (if you are not paſt all grace) and to cover you with a much larger patch of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy than you have wantonly endeavoured to fix on my breeches, I have thought proper, by the advice of three very grave friends (lawyers and members of Congreſs, of courſe excellent judges in delicate points of honour) to ſend you the ſaid breeches, and, with the conſciouſneſs of truth on my ſide, to ſubmit them to the moſt ſevere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and ſcrutiny of you and all thoſe who may have entered into this wicked cabal againſt my honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.

                  <p>NOTHING has happened to me of late, that has given me more concern than the ſerious light in which I am told you are purſuaded to conſider the harmleſs jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular letter I wrote to you; I ſay, perſuaded to conſider; for on the firſt receipt of it, when you were directed alone by your own excellent underſtanding, you conceived it as it was meant, an innocent <hi>jeu d' eſprit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not mean to compliment, when I aſſure you, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my honour, that it was the good opinion I had of your underſtanding which encouraged me to indulge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this piece of raillery, which is in effect, not in the leaſt directed againſt you, but againſt myſelf and ſome

others; if it contains any ſatire, you are obviouſly the vehicle, not the object.</p>
                  <p>My acquaintance with you is too ſlender to take any liberties which border on familiarity; and I had been taught to believe, that the liberality of your mind and diſpoſition, would be pleaſed with any effort to make you laugh for a moment in theſe melancholy times. Upon the word of an honeſt man, if I had thought a ſingle ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this traſh could have given you uneaſineſs, I would ſooner have put my hand into the fire than have written it. Thank God, I have not that petulant itch of ſcribbling, and vain ambition of paſſing for a wit, as to

                  <p>I HAVE juſt received your letter of January the 3d: I know not whether you have received them, but in the courſe of this and the laſt year, I wrote you two letters, informing you fully of my health and ſpirits; the two points which, from your natural tenderneſs and affection,
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:024456_0288_0FC76E1435577CB0"/>
I know you muſt be moſt ſolicitous about; they have both, thank Heaven, and the good conſtitution we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our father and mother, never failed me a ſingle day; and until I am conſcious of having committed ſome unworthy action, which, I can aſſure you, is not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the caſe, the iniquity of men ſhall never bear me down. I have, it is true, uneaſy feelings, but not on my own perſonal account. I feel for the empire of Great Britain, I feel for the fortunes of my relations and friends, which muſt rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ve a dreadful ſhock in this great convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As to my perſonal honour, for I ſuppoſe you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the affair of Monmouth, all I ſhall ſay is, that as I believe the proceedings of the court have been ſent to England, and as you have eyes to read, and capacity to judge and make proper comments, I may be quite eaſy on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>What has not our quondam friend Gage to anſwer for? I laboured, at Boſton, by a letter, to open his eyes, and he treated my efforts as the effects of republican inſanity. Had he liſtened to me, the empire of Great Britain would have ſtood; the affection and allegiance of this great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple continued for ages. He is, in fact, anſwerable, for the ſubverſion of the Britiſh empire, and for the blood of, at leaſt, one hundred thouſand Engliſhmen, or the immediate deſcendants of Engliſhmen. I fancy too, by this time, Lord Piercy and General Burgoyne lament that they conſidered my letters as the ebullition of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or faction. But as my letter muſt be opened before it reaches you, any thing like politics muſt be improper. God bleſs you my dear ſiſter. My love to the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhends, Hunts, Bunburys, Mrs. Hinks, and the Barrets.</p>

                     <salute>MY DEAR SISTER,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE other day, by a kind act of Providence, a letter of yours fell into my hands, of ſo late date as the 20th of March, and what is more, it had the appearance of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having been opened. You will better conceive, than I can expreſs, the pleaſure which I received from it; for I aſſure you, that my American enthuſiaſm is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo far worn off, that the greateſt ſatisfaction I can receive, is to be informed of the health and welfare of my Engliſh friends, who, with all their political ſins, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and follies, ſtill poſſeſs more virtues, at leaſt, as individuals, than all the nations of the earth. As to the Americans, though I once thought otherwiſe, when their characters are impartially and minutely diſcuſſed, I am ſure they will appear not only deſtitute of the perſonal virtues and good qualities, which render thoſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from ſo eſtimable in the eyes of other nations, ſuch as truth, honeſty, ſincerity, and good underſtanding; but I am much miſtaken, if the great public qualities which you at a diſtance ſuppoſe them to be endowed with, will ſtand a ſcrutiny; but a ſcrutiny of this kind, in a letter, is not poſſible: all that I ſhall ſay is, that, the New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landmen excepted, the reſt of the Americans, though they fancy and call themſelves republicans, have not a ſingle republican qualification or idea. They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a god of the day, whoſe infallibility is not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: to him all the people muſt bow down and ſing Hoſannas.</p>
                  <p>You are curious, my dear ſiſter, on the ſubject of my finances, and are deſirous to know whether theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to whom I have ſacrificed every thing, have ſhewn the ſame black ingratitude with reſpect to my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as they have in other matters; I can aſſure you, then, that their actions are all of a piece. Was it not for the friendſhip of Mr. Robert Morris and a fortunate purchaſe I made, more by luck than cunning, I might have begged in the ſtreets, but without much chance of being relieved; not but that, to be juſt, there are many exceptions to the general character of the Americans,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:024456_0290_0FC76E1819BECA30"/>
both in and out of the army, and I think the greater number are of the latter claſs, men of ſome honour, and who, I believe, have, from the beginning, acted on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and all theſe I may, without vanity, ſay, have been my friends and advocates. Among the worthies of America I reckon Mr. Robert Morris of Philadelphia; Richard Henry Lee of Virginia; Adams and Lovel, and ſome others, of New-England; the Morris's of New-York; and Dr. Ruſh of Philadelphia. In the army there are many worthy to be mentioned, Generals Schuyler, Mifflin, Sullivan, Muhlenburgh, Wayne, Weedon, Green, Knox, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I have been particularly fortunate in my aid de camps —all young gentlemen of the beſt families, fortunes, and education of this continent; but above all, I ſhould mention young Colonel Harry Lee, who has ſignalized himſelf extremely in this accurſed conteſt, the ruinous conſequences of which to the whole empire, I predicted to Lord Piercy and to my friend General Burgoyne. To do the Americans juſtice, they certainly were not the aggreſſors, but the retroſpect now is of no uſe. In all civil conteſts the people, in general, have not been the aggreſſors; they only wiſh to defend, not to encroach. The monarchs or magnates generally commence by their oppreſſions. Witneſs the diſputes betwixt the patricians and the plebeians of Rome, and our wars in the time of Charles the Firſt; but the people in the conteſt forget the principles on which they ſet out, which ultimately brings deſtruction on both parties; and this I extremely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend will be the caſe at preſent. I ſhall now quit the labyrinths of politics, and return to the ſubject of my own finances. Mr. Mure has uſed me moſt cruelly and villanouſly; notwithſtanding the vaſt ſums he owes me, he has proteſted a bill of three hundred pounds, which has thrown me into unſpeakable diſtreſs. He has affected a delicacy in honouring the bills or a rebel; but if he will conſult the proclamation of Sir Henry Clinton, in the year ſeventy-eight, he will find that I am exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the apprehenſion of confiſcation by the terms of
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:024456_0291_0FC76E1E1EC6A1B0"/>
this proclamation, which declares, That no man, from the date hereof, who does not poſitively act in a civil or military capacity, is ſubject to the confiſcation of his property; but as I have reaſon to think that the man will avail himſelf of every chicane, when money is in the caſe, I muſt entreat that you will urge Sir Charles Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury and Davers to endeavour to influence him, at leaſt to furniſh Mr. Garton, for my uſe, with five, four, or at leaſt three hundred pounds until the conteſt is over, and the law, according to the terms of peace, tells us what is to be done; but, at any rate, he, Mr. Mure, can have no claim as an individual to my fortune: he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it to ſomebody.</p>
                  <p>I am extremely concerned at the embaraſſment our couſin S— gives you with regard to the legacy, but it is the very error of the moon; ſhe comes more near the earth than ſhe was wont to do, and makes men mad. Is my worthieſt friend Butler alive, and amongſt you? if he is, a thouſand bleſſings, in my name, on his head. God Almighty, my dear ſiſter, give you long life, eaſe, and ſpirits, is devoutly the wiſh of</p>
