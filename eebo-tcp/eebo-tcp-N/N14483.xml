            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The like benevolent motives which actuated our brethren in that kingdom, thus publicly to advocate the cauſe of the moſt oppreſſed part of the human ſpecies, induced our yearly-meeting held in Philadelphia laſt year, to addreſs the Congreſs of theſe American ſtates, on the ſame very intereſting and important ſubject, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courteouſly received, we are encouraged to republiſh the above mentioned petition and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, in hope the minds of thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with power here, may become ſo effectually moved by a ſenſe of the enormity of the evil complained of, as to exert their authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, that the cry of this oppreſſion may not be continued in our land.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE OPPRESSED AFRICANS.</head>
            <p>WE are engaged, under a ſenſe of duty, to bear a public teſtimony againſt a ſpecies of oppreſſion which, under the ſanction of national au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, has long been exerciſed upon the natives of Africa, is grown up into a ſyſtem of tyranny, and is unhappily become a conſiderable branch of the commerce of this kingdom: an oppreſſion which in the injuſtice of its origin, and the inhumanity of its progreſs, has not, we apprehend, been exceeded, or even equalled, in the moſt barbarous ages.</p>
            <p>We are taught, both by the holy ſcriptures, and by the experience of ages, to believe that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge of the whole earth chaſtiſeth nations for their ſins, as well as individuals: and can it be expected that he will ſuffer this great iniquity to go
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018353_0005_0FA5CE50E9A04FA0"/>unpuniſhed? As the deſign of the inſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is for a terror to evil-doers, and the praiſe of them that do well, we wiſh it may be ſeriouſly conſidered, whether this has been made the rule of its adminiſtration in this land. Will it not rather be found on inquiry, that, with reſpect to the enſlaved negroes, its benevolent purpoſes have been pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that its terrors have fallen on the innocent, while evil doers, and oppreſſors, have been openly encouraged?</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding government, in former times, have been induced by what we conceive to be a miſtaken, as well as an unjuſt, policy, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this evil, we are perſuaded that many of the preſent members of the legiſlature, as true friends of civil and religious liberty, hold this unrighteous trafic in the utmoſt abhorrence. This perſuaſion, joined to the favourable reception of the petition of our laſt Yearly-meeting to the Houſe of Commons, encourages us to addreſs you, thus freely, on this important ſubject; and we apprehend that the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of this iniquitous practice is not only required by the calls of juſtice and humanity, but is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſound policy. For avarice in this, as in other inſtances, has defeated its own purpoſe. Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, ſo populous, and ſo rich in vegetable and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral productions, inſtead of affording all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a well regulated commerce, is ſcarcely known but as a mart for ſlaves, and as the ſcene of violence and barbarities, perpetrated, in order to procure them, by men profeſſing the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>The arguments which have been advanced by the few writers, who have attempted to juſtify this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human buſineſs, can have no weight with generous minds. Thoſe, in particular, which are drawn from the permiſſion to hold ſlaves amongſt the Jews, can in no wiſe be applied to the practice amongſt us: for, bleſſed be the God and Father of all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 26.</note>,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018353_0006_0FA5CE5267F9FE58"/>who hath made of one blood all nations of men, we now live under a diſpenſation eſſentially different from that of the law; in which many things were permitted to the Jews, becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts. All diſtinctions of name and country, ſo far as they relate to the ſocial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are now aboliſhed. We are taught by our bleſſed Redeemer to look upon all men, even our enemies, as neighbours and brethren, and to do unto them as we would they ſhould do unto us.</p>
            <p>Under a diſpenſation ſo admirably adapted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the temporal as well as the eternal happineſs of mankind, that any ſhould deviate ſo far from its principles, as to encourage a practice ſo replete with iniquity, and in particular that this nation, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally characterized by its attachment to civil and religious liberty, ſhould have contributed, perhaps more than any other, to the eſtabliſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of ſlavery, is a moſt painful reflection. It would ſurely have been more conſiſtent with the avowed principles of Engliſhmen, both as men and as Chriſtians, if their ſettlement in heathen countries had been ſucceeded by mild and benevolent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to civilize their inhabitants, and to incline them to receive the glad tidings of the goſpel. But how different a conduct towards them has been purſued! it has not only been repugnant in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical view, to thoſe commercial advantages which a fair and honourable treatment might have procured, but has evidently tended to increaſe the barbarity of their manners, and to excite in their minds an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to that religion, the profeſſors whereof ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly treat them.</p>
            <p>This traffic is the principal ſource of the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive wars which prevail among theſe unhappy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and it is attended with conſequences, the mere recital of which is ſhocking to humanity. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent ſeparation of the deareſt relatives, the tears of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018353_0007_0FA5CE5322846D00"/>conjugal and parental affection, the reluctance of the ſlaves to a voyage from which they can have no proſpect of returning, muſt preſent ſcenes of diſtreſs which would pierce the heart of any, in whom the principles of humanity are not wholly effaced. This, however, is but the beginning of ſorrows with the poor captives. Under their cruel treatment on ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, where, without regard to health or decency, hundreds are confined within the narrow limits of the hold, numbers periſh; and, by what is called the ſeaſoning in the Iſlands, many are relieved by a premature death, from that ſeries of accumulated ſufferings which awaits their leſs happy ſurvivors. The meaſure of their afflictions yet remains to be filled; being ſold to the higheſt bidder, and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a hot iron, they have yet to linger on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitied, the whole term of their miſerable exiſtence, in exceſſive labour, and too often under the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs controul of unprincipled and unfeeling men, without proper food or cloathing, or any encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſweeten their toil; whilſt every fault, real, or imaginary, is puniſhed with a rigour which is but weakly reſtrained by the colony laws: inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the greateſt enormity, even the moſt wanton or deliberate murder of the ſlaves, being only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, if puniſhed at all, by trifling pecuniary fines.</p>
            <p>But a bare enumeration of the calamities of this wretched people, would exceed the limits propoſed to this ſhort addreſs: we think it not improper, however, to give the following extract from a late author, who was an eye-witneſs of the miſeries of this perſecuted race.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If we bring this matter home, and, as Job propoſed to his friends, "put our ſoul in their ſouls ſtead;" if we conſider ourſelves, and our children, as expoſed to the hardſhips which theſe people lie under, in ſupporting an imaginary greatneſs;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:018353_0008_0FA5CE53E6ECE7A0"/>
Did we, in ſuch caſe, behold an increaſe of luxury and ſuperfluity among our oppreſſors, and therewith feel an increaſe of the weight of our burdens, and expect our poſterity to groan under oppreſſion after us;</p>
               <p>Under all this miſery, had we none to plead our cauſe, nor any hope of relief from man, how would our cries aſcend to the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, who judgeth the world in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and, in his own time, is a refuge for the oppreſſed!</p>
               <p>When we were hunger-bitten, and could not have ſufficient nouriſhment, but ſaw them in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pleaſing their taſte with things fetched from far;</p>
               <p>When we were wearied with labour, denied the liberty to reſt, and ſaw them ſpending their time at eaſe; when garments, anſwerable to our neceſſities, were denied us, while we ſaw them cloathed in that which was coſtly and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;</p>
               <p>Under ſuch affliction, how would theſe painful feelings riſe up as witneſſes againſt their pretended devotion! And if the name of their religion were mentioned in our hearing, how would it ſound in our ears, like a word which ſignified ſelf-exaltation and hardneſs of heart!</p>
               <p>When a trade is carried on productive of much miſery, and they who ſuffer by it are ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands miles off, the danger is the greater of not laying their ſufferings to heart.</p>
               <p>In procuring ſlaves from the coaſt of Africa, many children are ſtolen privately; wars alſo are encouraged among the negroes: but all is at a great diſtance. Many groans ariſe from dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, which we hear not. Many cries are uttered by widows and fatherleſs children, which reach not our ears. Many cheeks are wet with tears, and faces ſad with unutterable grief, which we ſee not. Cruel tyranny is encouraged. The
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018353_0009_0FA5CE54A1B82FD8"/>hands of robbers are ſtrengthened; and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands reduced to the moſt abject ſlavery, who never injured us.</p>
               <p>Were we, for the term of one year only, to be eye-witneſſes to what paſſeth in getting theſe ſlaves; was the blood which is there ſhed, to be ſprinkled on our garments; were the poor captives, bound with thongs, heavy laden with elephants teeth, to paſs before our eyes, in their way to the ſea;</p>
               <p>Were their bitter lamentations, day after day, to ring in our ears, and their mournful cries in the night, to hinder us from ſleeping!</p>
               <p>Were we to hear the ſound of the tumult, when the ſlaves on board the ſhips attempt to kill the Engliſh, and behold the iſſue of thoſe bloody conflicts: what pious man could be a witneſs to theſe things, and ſee a trade carried on in this manner, without being deeply affected with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?</p>

            <p>Our religious ſociety in theſe kingdoms, and in North America, have for many years tenderly ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathized with this unhappy people, under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated ſufferings, and have endeavoured to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them relief: nor has their cauſe been without other advocates; whoſe numbers we have with much ſatisfaction obſerved to increaſe. The expectation of many, who are anxiouſly concerned for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this national evil, is now under Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, fixed upon the wiſe and humane interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the legiſlature; to whom, with dutiful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, we earneſtly recommend the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this important ſubject; with a pleaſing hope, that the reſult will be, a prohibition of this traffic in future, and an extenſion of ſuch relief to thoſe who already groan in bondage, as juſtice and mercy may dictate, and their particular ſituations may admit. That ſo the bleſſings of thoſe who are ready to periſh may reſt upon you, and this nation may no longer, on their account, remain obnoxious
