            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Honourable Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN you reflect upon the present confused and distress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed state of this, and the other colonies, I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that you will think no apology necessary for the liberty I have taken, of addressing you on that subject. The unhappy contention we have entered into with our parent state, would inevitably be attended with many disagreeable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, with many and great inconveniences to us, even were it conducted on our part, with <hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>moderation.</hi> What then must be the case, when all proper and moderate measures are <hi>rejected?</hi> When not even the <hi>appearance</hi> of decency is regarded? When nothing seems to be consulted, but how to perplex, irritate, and affront, the <hi>British Ministry, Parliament, Nation and King?</hi> When every scheme that tends to <hi>peace,</hi> is
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014453_0003_0F928FD0EB81AE18"/>
branded with <hi>ignominy;</hi> as being machination of slavery! When nothing is called FREEDOM but SEDITION! Nothing LIBERTY but REBELLION!</p>
            <p>I will not presume to encroach so far upon your time, as to attempt to point out the <hi>causes</hi> of our unnutural contention with <hi>Great Britain. You</hi> are well acquainted with them.—Nor will I attempt to trace out the <hi>progress</hi> of that <hi>infatuation,</hi> which hath so deeply, so miserably, infected the <hi>Colonies. You</hi> must have observed its rise, and noted its rapid growth. But I intreat your patience and candour, while I make some <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> on the <hi>conduct</hi> of the Colonies in <hi>general,</hi> and of <hi>this</hi> Colony in <hi>particular,</hi> in the present dispute with our <hi>mother country:</hi> By which it will appear, that <hi>most,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that have been adopted, have been <hi>illegal</hi> in their <hi>beginning, tyrannical</hi> in their <hi>operation,</hi>—and that they <hi>must</hi> be <hi>ineffectual</hi> in the <hi>event.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the happiness of the <hi>British Government,</hi> and of all the <hi>British Colonies,</hi> that the people have a right to share in the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature. This right they exercise by choosing <hi>representatives:</hi> and thereby constituting one branch of the legislative authority. But when they have chosen their representatives, that right, which was before diffused through the whole people, centers in their <hi>Representatives alone;</hi> and can legally be exercised by <hi>none but them. They</hi> become the guardians of the lives, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the rights and properties, of the people: And as <hi>they</hi> are under the most sacred obligations to discharge their trust with <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> so the <hi>people</hi> are under the strongest obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to treat them with <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>respect;</hi> and to look to <hi>them</hi> for redress of all those grievances that they can justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of.</p>
            <p>But in the present dispute with Great Britain, the <hi>representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people</hi> have not only been <hi>utterly disregarded,</hi> but their <hi>dignity</hi> has been <hi>trampled upon,</hi> and their <hi>authority contravened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A COMMITTEE, chosen in a <hi>tumultuous, illegal</hi> manner, usurped the most <hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> authority</hi> over the <hi>province.</hi> They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into contracts, compacts, combinations, treaties of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014453_0004_0F928FD2042595A0"/>
with the other colonies, without <hi>any</hi> power from the <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature of the province.</hi> They agreed with the other Colonies to send Delegates to meet in convention at Philadelphia, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine upon the <hi>rights and liberties of the good people of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> unsupported by any Law. They issued notifications to the several supervisors through the colony, desiring them to <hi>assemble the people,</hi> in order to choose committees, to choose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates to represent them in the Congress. They directed, or encouraged, or abetted a <hi>mob,</hi> in perpetrating a crime, which the laws of the province forbid, under the severest penalty, <abbr>viz:</abbr> the robbing Captain Etherington, an Officer in his Majesty's service, of a number of <hi>sheep,</hi> which he had purchased, to carry with him to St. Vincent's. They had the <hi>insolence</hi> to direct the manner in which the Delegates should be chosen in the <hi>counties:</hi> And the <hi>greater</hi> insolence, to count all the <hi>friends to order and good government,</hi>—those namely, who did not choose to obey their seditious mandate,—as being of <hi>their party,</hi> and as acquiescing in the <hi>New-York choice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Delegates had met at Philadelphia, instead of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling a reasonable plan of accomodation with the parent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they employed themselves in censuring acts of the British parliament, which were principally intended to prevent <hi>smug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling,</hi> and all <hi>illicit trade;</hi>—in writing addresses to the people of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to the inhabitants of the <hi>colonies</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and to those of the <hi>province of Quebec,</hi> in <hi>particular;</hi> with the <hi>evident design</hi> of making them <hi>dissatisfied with their present go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and of <hi>exciting clamours,</hi> and raising <hi>seditions</hi> and <hi>rebellions</hi> aganist the <hi>state;</hi>—and in exercising a <hi>legislative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all the colonies.</hi> They had the insolence to proclaim themselves <q>A FULL AND FREE REPRESENTATION of—HIS MAJESTY'S FAITHFUL SUBJECTS IN ALL THE CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LONIES FROM NOVA-SCOTIA TO GEORGIA;</q> and, as such, have laid a <hi>tax</hi> on all those colonies, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>profits</hi> arising from the <hi>sales of all goods</hi> imported from Great-Britain, Ireland, &amp;c. during the months of December and January: Which <hi>tax</hi> is to be employed for the <hi>relief</hi> of the <hi>Boston poor.</hi> They adopted a <hi>mad set of resolves,</hi> framed by an <hi>arch rebel,</hi> who hath since <hi>fled his country,</hi> for fear of being apprehended, and imposed afterwards upon the deluded people of the county of <hi>Suffolk</hi> in the province of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay; approving</hi> their wisdom and fortitude, and <hi>recommending</hi> 
               <q>a perseverance in the same firm
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014453_0005_0F928FD2C0E84108"/>
and <hi>temperate</hi> conduct, as expressed in the</q> said resolves,—notwithstanding those resolves entirely unhinged the <hi>civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of that <hi>province,</hi> fomented a <hi>spirit of dissatisfaction to Great-Britain, and of rebellion</hi> against the <hi>state;</hi> and declared that the people of that county would not act always on the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive,</hi> against the King's troops.</p>
            <p>I must beg leave to enumerate a few of the <hi>effects</hi> of the measures of the Congress—The government of <hi>Rhode-Island</hi> have disman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the fort in their harbour, and carried off the cannon, in order to employ them <hi>against his Majesty's forces.</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>New-Hampshire</hi> have, under the command of Major SULLIVAN, one of the <hi>Delegates, attacked,</hi> and by <hi>force of arms taken</hi> a FORT at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> belonging to his Majesty, and carried off all the powder and small arms found in it. The people of <hi>Maryland</hi> have had a <hi>provincial Congress</hi> who have assessed that colony in the sum of £.10,000, to be expended in arming and disciplining the inhabitants, to <hi>fight against the King.</hi> The people in <hi>New-England</hi> are raising, arming and disciplining men, for the same <hi>loyal</hi> and <hi>christian</hi> purpose. The people of <hi>New-York</hi> have, in obedience to the Congress, chosen a <hi>new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> consisting of no less than SIXTY persons; to act, first, in the capacity of tax-gatherers, to collect the duties imposed by the <hi>Congress</hi> for the benefit of the <hi>Boston poor,</hi> by <hi>distress and sale of the goods</hi> imported during the last and the present month: and secondly, as <hi>spies</hi> and <hi>informers;</hi> to see that the non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, non-consumption, and non-exportation schemes, decreed by the <hi>Congress,</hi> be carried into <hi>due execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the first of these schemes, we are in danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of <hi>many</hi> of the <hi>comforts,</hi> and of <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>necessaries</hi> of life. We lie at the mercy of the merchants, who may strip us of <hi>every farthing,</hi> by demanding what <hi>they</hi> shall think <hi>only a reasonable profit</hi> on their goods. By the second, our very mode of living is made subject to their inspection; and we shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably soon see these lordly Committee-men condescend to go pimping, and peeping, and peering, into tea-canisters and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasses jugs. By the third scheme, an <hi>embargo</hi> is to take place, after the tenth of September next, on all <hi>the farmers produce</hi> of EVERY KIND. So that should their whole plan be carried fully into execution, the laborious, necessary and numerous <hi>body of</hi> FARMERS would soon be reduced to distress and beggary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014453_0006_0F928FD81274FDA8"/>The state to which the GRAND CONGRESS, and the <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Committees,</hi> have reduced the colonies, is <hi>really deplorable.</hi> They have introduced a <hi>system</hi> of the most <hi>oppressive tyranny</hi> that can possibly be imagined;—a <hi>tyranny,</hi> not only over the <hi>actions,</hi> but over the <hi>words, thoughts,</hi> and <hi>wills,</hi> of the <hi>good people of this province.</hi> People have been threatned with the <hi>vengeance of a mob,</hi> for speaking in support of <hi>order</hi> and <hi>good government.</hi> Every method has been used to intimidate the <hi>printers</hi> from publishing any thing, which tended to <hi>peace,</hi> or seem'd in favour of government; while the most <hi>detestable libels</hi> against the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>British parliament,</hi> and <hi>Ministry,</hi> have been <hi>eagerly read,</hi> and <hi>extravagantly commended,</hi> as the <hi>matchless productions</hi> of some <hi>heaven-born genius,</hi> glowing with the <hi>pure flame</hi> of civil liberty. They not only oblige people to <hi>pay</hi> the tax assessed on their goods for the benefit of the Boston poor, but they also oblige them to say, that they are <hi>willing</hi> to do it; when it is notorious, that many, if not most of them, would refuse if they <hi>dared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold, Gentlemen, behold the wretched state to which we are reduced! A <hi>foreign power</hi> is brought in to <hi>govern this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi> Laws made at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> by factious men from <hi>New England, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,</hi> and the Carolinas, are imposed upon us by the most <hi>imperious menaces.</hi> Money is levied upon us without the <hi>consent</hi> of our <hi>representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:</hi> which very <hi>money,</hi> under colour of relieving <hi>the poor</hi> people of Boston, it is too <hi>probable</hi> will be employed to <hi>raise an army against the King. Mobs</hi> and <hi>riots</hi> are encouraged, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>force</hi> submission to the <hi>tyranny of the Congress.</hi> A very <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectable gentleman,</hi> who serves his King in an honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, has been threatened with ASSASSINATION, by the SONS OF LIBERTY, only for—<hi>doing his duty;</hi>—for securing a number of muskets, <hi>illegally imported,</hi> and which were intended to arm the people of <hi>New England</hi> against their <hi>lawful Sovereign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To YOU, Gentlemen, the good people of this province look for relief: on YOU they have fixed their <hi>hopes:</hi> from YOU they expect deliverance from <hi>this intolerable state of slavery.</hi> They have chosen YOU to be the <hi>guardians</hi> of their <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> You have hitherto executed the important trust commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, with such <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> as entitle you to their most <hi>grateful acknowledgments,</hi> and encourage them to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend</hi>

upon you with the <hi>utmost confidence.</hi> They know well that all the <hi>insidous arts</hi> that evil-minded and <hi>designing</hi> men can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly make use of, will be employed, to lead you <hi>away</hi> from that <hi>rectitude of conduct,</hi> which hath hitherto marked <hi>all your actions;</hi> and they anxiously wait the <hi>issue of your deliberations.</hi> If you <hi>assert</hi> your <hi>own dignity</hi>—If you maintain your own rights and privileges, we shall again be a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> and, I trust, not an <hi>ungrateful</hi> people: but if you <hi>prostitute the dignity of your House;</hi>—if you betray the rights of your constituents, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the decrees of the Congress;—<hi>you</hi> will thereby introduce a <hi>foreign power</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> and <hi>tax</hi> this province, and <hi>we</hi> shall be, of all men, the most wretched.—If laws made, and decrees passed, at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> by the <hi>enthusiastic republicans</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> are to bind the <hi>people of this province, and extort money from them,</hi> why, Gentlemen, do <hi>you meet?</hi> Is it barely to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister</hi> their <hi>edicts,</hi> and to <hi>rivet</hi> the fetters of their <hi>tyranny</hi> on your <hi>constituents?</hi> Your constituents, in <hi>that</hi> case, would be better <hi>without</hi> you. You would be an useless burthen upon them: <hi>worse</hi> than useless; a snare and a trap to them. Your duty requires you to <hi>interpose your authority,</hi> and to break up this <hi>horrid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination</hi> of <hi>seditious men,</hi> which has already enslaved this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and which was <hi>intended</hi> to draw the <hi>faithful subjects</hi> of our <hi>most gracious Sovereign</hi> into REBELLION and a CIVIL WAR. The CONGRESS address themselves to the people of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, among others, in the following words: <q>We think our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound in duty to observe to you, that the schemes agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated against the colonies have been so conducted, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it prudent, that you should extend your views to <hi>mournful</hi> events, and be in <hi>all</hi> respects prepared for <hi>every</hi> contingency.</q> They had <hi>war</hi> in their <hi>hearts</hi> when this sentiment was <hi>conceived,</hi> and <hi>rebellion</hi> dictated the <hi>expression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What, I beseech you, will be the consequence of pursuing the mode of conduct, which <hi>they</hi> have delineated? It will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the redress of no <hi>one grievance</hi> we <hi>complain of.</hi> It will not <hi>intimidate</hi> the people of Great-Britain. We see no appearance of fear on their part; but <hi>every circumstance</hi> shews <hi>a settled design</hi> to assert the supremacy and vindicate the authority of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The measures of the Congress will <hi>irritate</hi> them, but never can <hi>conciliate their affections. </hi> Should they in <hi>some degree</hi> distress their trade and manufactures, they will distress <hi>us</hi> much
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014453_0008_0F928FDBC5E7CB88"/>
more <hi>severely.</hi> The schemes of the Congress will, from their very nature, operate but slowly against the government and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Great-Britain; and before they can produce their full effect, the <hi>present contention</hi> will probably be <hi>settled.</hi> The <hi>very next summer</hi> will finish the dispute, either <hi>peaceably,</hi> or by <hi>force of arms.</hi> Should we oblige them to recur to this latter mode of acting, the <hi>Parliament</hi> will probably <hi>make a constitution for us,</hi> without consulting <hi>our</hi> inclinations; and force us to accept it, at the mouths of their cannon. Is it not better to make some <hi>reasonable proposals,</hi> to take <hi>some prudent step towards an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> before matters come to this <hi>dreadful extremity?</hi> Suppose you do not; but adopt the <hi>mad measures of the Congress;</hi> or suffer them to proceed, and bring their <hi>delirious machinations to effect:</hi> The consequence will be, that you will establish the most ignominious, and <hi>abominable tyranny</hi> over your <hi>constituents,</hi> and over <hi>yourselves,</hi> that ever was invented. They have already <hi>made,</hi> and are now, by means of the <hi>New-York Committee of sixty, executing</hi> laws which <hi>contravene your authority.</hi> They are <hi>levying money</hi> on your <hi>constituents,</hi> without <hi>your consent.</hi> They have impudently <hi>encroached</hi> on the PRIVILEGES OF YOUR HOUSE, by dictating to your Agent, EDMUND BURKE, <abbr>Esq</abbr> how he shall act in this dispute, without ever <hi>asking your advice,</hi> or waiting for <hi>your opinion.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See their Letter to the Agents of the several Colonies. But <hi>here</hi> let it be <hi>remarked,</hi> That the <hi>General Strictures</hi> on the <hi>Congress,</hi> are far from being levell'd against the <hi>Delegates</hi> from <hi>New-York;</hi> whose pacific dispositions, and wise endeavours to <hi>accommodate,</hi> tho' <hi>unsuccessful,</hi> ought not to be <hi>unnoticed.</hi>
               </note> Their <hi>abettors</hi> and <hi>supporters</hi> are frequently <hi>insinuating</hi> the <hi>incapacity</hi> and <hi>inability</hi> of the <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble House of Assembly,</hi> to do any thing of <hi>real consequence</hi> towards settling this <hi>unnatural contention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if they treat the <hi>Representatives</hi> of the province in this disrespectful manner, what are the <hi>people</hi> to expect? We shall not dare to eat, or drink, or sleep, or act, or speak, or think, but in the precise mode which they shall direct. They have already regulated our trade and commerce, our manner of living, and our diversions; and, if their VINDICATOR is to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, the <hi>next</hi> Congress is to regulate our <hi>courts of justice.</hi>—Then will their tyranny be established; a tyranny of the most dreadful kind;—which <hi>makes</hi> laws and <hi>executes</hi> them without <hi>check or controul.</hi> Then will our happy constitution be destroyed, and a REPUBLIC be raised on its ruins. Then will YOU, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, become an useless body; and it will be a matter of no consequence whether you ever meet again, or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014453_0009_0F928FDC435E1750"/>There is one consideration which, in particular, I must men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and which, I think, ought to have great weight with <hi>you,</hi> and with <hi>every person.</hi> The people in <hi>New-England</hi> have wrested the <hi>command</hi> of the MILITIA from their <hi>Governors,</hi> which they are diligently training, and forming for <hi>action.</hi> Whatever may be their <hi>ostensible</hi> reason, the <hi>real</hi> one undoubtedly is, to <hi>oppose the King's troops,</hi> and to support a <hi>rebellion</hi> against <hi>their Sovereign.</hi> The people of <hi>Maryland,</hi> and of the <hi>Lower Counties</hi> on <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> are following their example. The <hi>Pennsylvanians</hi> are calling together a <hi>Provincial Congress,</hi> to meet the 23d instant. They have taken this step even while their <hi>Assembly</hi> is <hi>sitting.</hi> But I wonder not at this: That Assembly, by <hi>approving,</hi> and, as far as their power extends, <hi> confirming</hi> the measures of the GRAND CONGRESS, have <hi>prostituted their own dignity,</hi> and <hi>betrayed the rights of their constituents;</hi> and unless some <hi>superior power interposes,</hi> they will shortly find themselves <hi>absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled</hi> by these <hi>grand Continental,</hi> and <hi>petty Provincial</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRESSES.</p>
            <p>The design of the <hi>projectors</hi> of this provincial congress in Pennsylvania, is undoubtedly to concert a plan for embodying a militia, to act in concert with the New-Englanders, Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers. &amp;c. Take care, Gentlemen, that this procedure does not spread, and infect <hi>this</hi> province by the contagion of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample! I cannot conceive a worse state of thraldom, than a military power in any government, unchecked, and uncontroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the civil power. And this must be the case, with respect to a militia upon such an establishment as that of Maryland and New England. The laws of the congress, not the laws of the province, will be the rule of its conduct. Enthusiastic dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and brain-sick committee-men, will be its commanders; and the friends of order and good government, the devoted vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims of its power.</p>
            <p>We have been taught to consider the colonies, as being of the utmost consequence to Great-Britain. We have been told that her very <hi>existence, </hi> as a <hi>sovereign state,</hi> depends upon them. Let us suppose this to be true. Let us also suppose that Great-Britain views the colonies in the same light that <hi>we</hi> do; the consequence will be, that she will exert her utmost abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to retain them under her dominion. She will send every man, and every ship that she can spare, rather than suffer them
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014453_0010_0F928FDCE5E5EF50"/>
to be torn from her. A considerable army of British troops is already in America. All accounts from England agree in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that a larger body will be sent hither <hi>early in the spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose our opposition to the British government should bring on a war, and that the power of Great-Britain, as is most probable, should prevail; will she immediately <hi>recall</hi> her troops? Will she subject herself to the expence of transporting <hi>another</hi> army to America, a <hi>few years hence?</hi> Will she not think it more prudent to keep a considerable military force in this country, to support the civil power, and to prevent the American republicans from throwing all into confusion again, that they may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish their rebellious purposes?</p>
            <p>Suppose 20,000 men should be fixed upon an American esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment; who is to cloathe, feed and pay them? Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or the Colonies? By driving matters to extremity, we shall oblige Great-Britain to do the very thing that we are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, at least are <hi>pretending</hi> to endeavour, by our mad schemes, to <hi>prevent.</hi> We shall oblige her to raise a revenue upon us to support an army, to retain us in our dependance on her <hi>imperial authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>other</hi> colonies run madly into such measures as must bring ruin upon them, are <hi>we</hi> obliged to imitate and follow them? If the people of New England will kindle a fire, and then rush into it, have we no way to shew our regard and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them, but to jump in after them? Let us rather keep out, that we may have it in our power to pull <hi>them</hi> out, before they are burnt to death. A little scorching I believe will not hurt them. It may do them good: it may make them dread the fire hereafter; for, like children, they seem incapable of learning from <hi>any</hi> experience but <hi>their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We, Gentlemen, have no alternative left, but either to join the other colonies in a <hi>war</hi> against Great-Britain, or to make the best terms that we can, for ourselves. The <hi>former</hi> may have the most <hi>old Oliverian</hi> glory in it, but the <hi>latter</hi> is certainly the most <hi>prudent</hi> course. It will save <hi>this province,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the <hi>whole continent,</hi> from <hi>desolution</hi> and <hi>destruction.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:014453_0011_0F928FDDA4993788"/>On you, Gentlemen, it depends, under the good providence of Almighty God, whether this war meditated by the Congress, shall blaze out in America, or not. <hi>All</hi> the Colonies in <hi>New-England,</hi> and <hi>same</hi> to the <hi>south-ward,</hi> have run head-long, under the influence of the Congress, into such measures, as evidently <hi>tend</hi> to a war against our <hi>mother-country,</hi> and our <hi>gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</hi> This province, as yet, hath taken no decisive step. You have it in your power to establish it in peace and felicity; to secure it by a firm constitution; to make it the mediatrix with Great-Britain, for all the <hi>other</hi> Colonies, and to prevent the rage of slaughter, and the effusion of human blood.</p>
            <p>Act now, I beseech you, as you ever have done, as the faithful representatives of the people; as the real guardians of their Rights and Liberties. Give them deliverance from the tyranny of the <hi>Congress</hi> and <hi>Committees:</hi> Secure them against the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid carnage of a <hi>civil war: </hi> And endeavour to obtain for them a FREE AND PERMANENT CONSTITUTION.</p>
            <p>You know whether, and how far, the people of this province are aggrieved by any acts of the British Parliament; and we look to you to procure us <hi>such</hi> relief as you shall think <hi>effectual.</hi> We know of no representatives but <hi>you,</hi> whom we have legally chosen. On your wisdom and integrity we can rely. We have long known, and often tried you. From <hi>you alone</hi> we expect the means of redessing our grievances, and of guarding our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py form of government, against all <hi>oppression</hi> from <hi>without,</hi> and all <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>insidious innovations</hi> from <hi>within.</hi> From <hi>you,</hi> we expect some plan of accommodating our unhappy disputes with our mother country, and of preventing a renewal of them, by obtaining such a line of government as shall establish the <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign authority of Great-Britain</hi> over <hi>all the British domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and at the same time secure the <hi>rights and liberties of the Colonists:</hi> And your <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> we know are <hi>equal to the case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be assured, Gentlemen, that a very great majority of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituents disapprove of the late violent proceeeings, and will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you in the pursuit of more <hi>moderate measures,</hi> as soon as You have <hi>delivered</hi> Them from the <hi>tyranny of Committees,</hi> from the <hi>fear of violence,</hi> and the <hi>dread of mobs.</hi> Recur boldly to your

            </p>
            <p>Address yourselves to the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>two Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> Let your representations be <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>firm,</hi> and principally directed to obtain a <hi>solid American Constitution;</hi> such as we can <hi>accept</hi> with <hi>safety,</hi> and <hi>Great-Britain</hi> can <hi>grant</hi> with <hi>dignity.</hi> Try the experiment, and you will assuredly find that our most gracious Sovereign and both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament will readily <hi>meet</hi> you in the <hi>paths of peace.</hi> Only shew your <hi>willingness</hi> towards an accommodation, by <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the supreme legislative authority of Great-Britain,</hi> and I dare confidently pronounce the attainment of whatever YOU with <hi>propriety,</hi> can <hi>ask;</hi> and the LEGISLATUAS of GREAT-BRITAIN with <hi>honour concede.</hi>
