            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">
               <hi>SATURDAY, April</hi> 22, 1775.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The preſent neceſſary defenſive war, on the part of America, juſtified by the laws of God, nature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſtate and nations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no treaſon or rebellion.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT muſt be apparent to every Engliſhman, not blinded by malice or ignorance, that the Americans, by raiſing forces, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up arms, have no intention to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his Majeſty's perſon, crown or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor to draw any Engliſh blood; but only to defend themſelves, their rights and liberties, againſt encroaching violence and lawleſs power, to reſcue his Majeſty out of the hands of his preſent evil malignant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers, to bring him back to a juſt ſenſe of his duty, and thoſe delinquents to condign puniſhment, who are now engaged in a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate conſpiracy againſt the natural rights of mankind. The Americans have endeavoured, by every poſſible means, to accommodate the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:013979_0002_0F92596D02093D80"/>preſent unhappy diſpute with the King and his infernal minions, upon juſt, reaſonable, and honorable terms, but hitherto in vain. His Majeſty having, contrary to his oath, his duty, and the fundamental laws of God and the realm, ſent an army of mercenary ſoldiers to America againſt his ſubjects, for the avowed and open purpoſe of robbing them of their peace, their rights, their liberties, their properties, or their lives, and to impoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful taxes by force of arms; the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans may lawfully and juſtly, by the great principles of the conſtitution, without any treaſon or rebellion, take up arms in defence of their privileges, laws, lives, liberties and properties; even if the King were preſent to aſſiſt and encourage his ſoldiers in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, bloody, and deſtructive civil war.</p>
            <p>When a King throws off all reſtraint of law, and is bound by no principles of juſtice or humanity, when he invades with open force the liberties and perſons of his ſubjects in a hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile manner, only to anſwer the moſt diabolical, arbitrary, and infamous purpoſes, the people of England, and every part of the Britiſh empire, will be juſtified in taking up arms, and reſiſting ſuch invaſions and violence; otherwiſe they muſt fall a prey to his inſatiable rapine, and become the abſolute ſlaves of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, by way of conqueſt.</p>
            <p>We have ſeveral inſtances in the hiſtory of this country, and in many ages, of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013979_0003_0F92596DD5013280"/>of England reſiſting, by force of arms, the oppreſſions, rapines, unjuſt violence, and armies of their Princes raiſed againſt them; and they have even encountered their Kings in open battle, and taken them priſoners; ſometimes expelled, and at other times depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them from their royal authority, when they became incorrigible, open and profeſſed enemies to the kingdom, and ſought the ruin and deſolation of their ſubjects; when by office, duty, oath, and common juſtice, they were bound inviolably to protect them in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and peace. Among many other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſuch proceedings, and the bravery and virtue of our anceſtors, are the following, <hi>viz.</hi> the caſe of King John, Henry the Third, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Firſt, Richard the Third, and Henry the Sixth; nor are theſe examples ſingular, all kingdoms, and in all ages, have done the ſame, when their Kings (like the preſent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign on the throne of England) degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into tyrants, of which there are infinite precedents in hiſtory; and ſuch actions in every age and nation have always been deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawful and juſt, as warranted by the laws of God, nature, reaſon, ſtate and nations, all which inſtruct not only particular perſons, but whole cities and kingdoms, for their own neceſſary defence and preſervation, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of human ſociety and liberty, to protect themſelves againſt all unlawful violence and tyranny, even in the perſon of their Kings,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013979_0004_0F92596E81AA6828"/>their miniſters, or minions, to whom the laws of God, nature, man, nor any civil nation, ever yet gave the leaſt authority to murder, ſpoil, oppreſs, or enſlave their ſubjects, or deprive them of their liberties or eſtates; reſiſtance were it unlawful or unjuſt (as the pimps and pariſites of a court would inſinuate) a few ambitious, bloody minded, tyrannizing Kings might, without moleſtation, in a ſhort ſpace of time, ruin, murder, or enſlave the whole race of men; overturn the ſettled forms of civil government, extirpate the chriſtain religion, and deſtroy human ſociety at their pleaſure; this, and worſe, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had been effected; nay, every ſtate and kingdom, had been totally ſubverted long ago by the worſt of monſters, lawleſs Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had not this juſt, natural, hereditary power of reſiſting and oppoſing their illegal violence (inherent in the people) reſtrained and prevented ſuch bloody and deſtructive deſigns from being carried into execution.</p>
            <p>This neceſſary and defenſive oppoſition, and reſiſtance againſt regal violence, which has ever been held lawful, and often practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in almoſt every kingdom, will juſtify the Americans, in taking up arms and reſiſting the preſent arbitrary, cruel, and bloody mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, now carrying on againſt them, by an infatuated, obſtinate, perverſe King, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal miniſters, and their agents, whoſe only object in view is the entire ruin of this once
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:013979_0005_0F92596F42DED530"/>great, happy, powerful, and flouriſhing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the deſtruction of public liberty.</p>
            <p>It is expreſsly declared by Ariſtotle, Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, King Edward the Confeſſor in his eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed laws, the Council of Paris in 829, by Bracton, Forteſcue, and even King James himſelf, that a King governing in a ſettled kingdom, ceaſes to be a King, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into a tyrant, ſo ſoon as he leaves to rule by law, much more when he begins to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his ſubjects perſons, rights, liberties, to ſet up an arbitrary power, impoſe unlawful taxes, raiſe forces, and make war upon his ſubjects, whom he ſhould protect, and rule in peace; to pillage, plunder, waſte, and ſpoil his kingdoms; impriſon, murder, and deſtroy his people in an hoſtile manner; this they ſeverally declared to be the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of tyranny, condemned and deteſted by God and all good men. The whole ſtate and kingdom therefore, in ſuch caſes as theſe, for their own neceſſary preſervation, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with force of arms, when no other means can ſecure them, not only paſſively but actively reſiſt their Prince, in ſuch his violent and tyrannical proceedings; without reſiſting any kingly lawful authority, for that is veſted in the King's perſon, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and not the deſtruction of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; becauſe the illegal oppreſſion and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical actions are not warranted, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the laws of God, and the realm
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013979_0006_0F9259704F555E88"/>(to whom he is accountable, and by whom he is juſtly cenſurable) he is no lawful King, nor magiſtrate, but an unjuſt oppreſſive ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, a mere private man, who by ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings hath denuded himſelf of his juſt regal authority; ſo that all thoſe laws made for the defence of the King's perſon and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power, the ſuppreſſion of inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, treaſons, and conſpiracies againſt him, while he governs his people according to law, as by oath and duty he is bound, will yield on countenance, encouragement, or protection to him in ſuch tyrannical and cruel oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but more eſpecially when he turns a public enemy to his people, and proclaims open war againſt them; invades their laws, liberties and perſons, and exerciſes all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hoſtilities againſt them, the ſame as the moſt barbarous and foreign enemy would do; it being contrary to common ſenſe and reaſon, to ſuppoſe that our laws, which ſtrictly inhibit and puniſh the very ſmalleſt violations of the public peace in all other perſons, ſhould countenance, juſtify, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize them in the King, the firſt miniſter, and ſupreme fountain of juſtice; and not permit the people, under pain of rebellion and treaſon, ſo much as to defend their lives, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, eſtates and religion, from the open violence of the King himſelf, or his malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant plundering miniſters and favourites. When as Forteſcue and Bracton prove, Kings
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:013979_0007_0F925970EA896B68"/>of all others, both by oath and duty, ought to be more obſervant, and obedient to the laws of God and the land than the very meaneſt of their ſubjects.</p>
            <p>That precept of St. Paul, Romans xiii. 1, 2, 3, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher powers,</hi> &amp;c. means no more than this, that as long as Kings legally and juſtly execute the truſt committed to their charge, and conferred on them by God and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they muſt, and ought to be obeyed and ſubmitted to, without the leaſt reſiſtance pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or public; but if they degenerate into tyrants, and turn profeſſed enemies to their people, by murdering, impriſoning, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them by open violence, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by force of arms, to ſubvert their laws, liberties or religion, and expoſe them as a prey to their mercileſs blood thirſty ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I dare confidently to affirm, it was never the intention of St. Paul, much leſs of our laws, to inhibit ſubjects, under pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, high in conſcience, treaſon or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, by defenſive arms, to reſiſt Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or any of their mercenary adherents.</p>
            <p>It was certainly never the intention of the Apoſtle, to eſtabliſh in the world any irriſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible lawleſs tyranny, or ſpoil of kingdoms, and butchery of ſubjects, execrable to God and man in all ages, and in all perſons who have reſiſted them, even unto blood; he meant rather totally to ſuppreſs them. There being ſcarce any more pregnant text againſt
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013979_0008_0F925975A9967430"/>the tyranny, the boundleſs prerogative, the illegal proceedings of Kings, and the higher powers in all the ſcripture, than that of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans xiii. 1ſt to 7th verſe, if properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and rightly interperted, as Pareus and others prove; therefore the reſiſtance of the Americans, againſt our preſent ſeduced, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant <hi>Popiſh King,</hi> is no violation of any law of God or the land, but a juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary war, which they have by every means, to the utmoſt of their power, endeavoured to prevent, and therefore no treaſon or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion within the meaning of any law or ſtatute; they are only arming themſelves, for their own neceſſary preſervation, and to prevent their inevitable ruin, they mean not openly to aſſault the royal army of butchers; and I believe there is no divine among the whole bench of Popiſh Biſhops, no caſuiſt among the whole tribe of venal lawyers, except a few proſtituted court ſlaves, villainous enough to affirm that it is damnation in conſcience, or treaſon and rebellion in point of law, for our injured and ſuffering fellow ſubjects in America, to take up arms for the preſervation of their lives, their liberties, and their property, but would rather deem it juſt and honorable, nay a duty for every Engliſhman to venture his life, and his fortune in their defence; in defence of the dear bought rights of his country, and rather than live a ſlave, to die gloriouſly in the cauſe of public liberty.</p>
