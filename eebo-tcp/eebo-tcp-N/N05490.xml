            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ATCHFULNESS is the great Duty which our Lord is here preſſing upon his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; that they might be in actual Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for his Coming, at what Time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall be, whether ſooner or later; <hi>at the ſecond or third Watch of the Night,</hi> ℣. 38. And here our Saviour conſiders them as Servants, and from thence argues their Obligation to Watchfulneſs, and a conſtant Readineſs for his Coming. And he takes the Argument from the Cuſtom of Servants (that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants) watching and waiting for the coming home of their Maſters, when gone Abroad, eſpecially to a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when it was very uncertain at what Hour of the Night they would come Home. Now in ſuch Caſes, the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006956_0003_102AC4B1079A5D88"/>
Maſter required, &amp; expected, and the good Servant would, accordingly be in Readineſs to open to his Maſter and let him in, whenever he knocked at the Door. The good Servant inſtead of being aſleep, and all in the Dark, when his Maſter came home, tho' late at Night; would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, with his looſe Garment girt about his Loins, that it might not be in the Way to hinder or retard him in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and opening to his Maſter immediately. But then, it being in the Night, Lights would be neceſſary for the Reception of his Maſter: Accordingly the watchful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant will take Care not only to have Candles or Lamps, with Oil, in the Room, but to have them lighted, &amp; actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally burning; that he might not have the leaſt Thing to hinder him; but ſo ſoon as ever he heard his Maſter's Knock he might open to him immediately, and his Maſter find every Thing in readineſs.</p>
            <p>And now from this Cuſtom our Saviour takes Occaſion to recommend the ſame Watchfulneſs, and actual Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Diſciples for his Coming, how ſoon or ſudden ſoever it ſhall be. <hi>Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lights burning, and ye your ſelves like unto Men that wait for their Lord &amp;c.</hi> And ſo our Saviour explains himſelf, ℣. 40. <hi>Be ye therefore ready alſo, for the Son of Man cometh in an Hour when ye think not.</hi> If Chriſt's Coming here, has a primary Reference to his coming to judge the Jews in the Deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and Diſſolution of the Jewiſh State; yet it may refer to his coming to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at Death; and his coming to judge the World at the laſt Day: of which the Deſtruction of Jeruſalem may be conſidered as an eminent Type, or lively Emblem. And if we conſider his coming at Death, or at the Judgment; they are both utterly uncertain as to the Time. We know neither the Day, and much leſs the Hour, when the Son of Man ſhall come. As to his coming by Death, we know in general, that it cannot be far off: But whether he will come early in the Evening, or in the ſecond Watch, or in the third Watch of the Night, even to advanced old Age, who can ſay, before it comes to paſs? —</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006956_0004_102AC4B348B435E0"/>And now, as I have already obſerved, that theſe Words have an Eye to the Manner of a faithful Servant, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his Maſter to come Home: But not knowing at what Hour, endeavours to have every Thing in actual Readineſs; that whether he comes ſooner or later, he may open to him immediately: So I ſhall carry on this Similitude thro' my Diſcourſe, as what may afford many inſtructive Thoughts to us.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, what I propoſe is,
<list>
                  <item>1. To conſider this Direction of our bleſſed Lord, to <hi>have our Loins girded about.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. What it is to have <hi>our Lights burning.</hi>

                  <item>3. Agreable hereto, I ſhall deſcribe the Man, the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who is thus <hi>waiting for the Coming of his Lord.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. I ſhall then conſider <hi>the Bleſſedneſs</hi> of all who are in ſuch a watching, waiting Frame.</item>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider this Direction of our bleſſed Lord: <hi>Let your Loins be girded about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this, as I hinted, has Reference to the Manner of thoſe Nations, who were wont to wear long &amp; looſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they were obliged to gird or tuck up, when they engaged in any Buſineſs, that they might not be in their Way to fetter, intangle or hinder them. And thus Servants to be ready to wait upon their Maſters at their coming home, girded their Garments about their Loins: And would not have ſo much as this to do, when their Maſter knocked: And would be thus girded up all the Evening; and to the ſecond, and third, and fourth Watch of the Night, if their Maſters tarried ſo long.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:006956_0005_102AC4B5CF05B7E8"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> And now, <hi>What Instruction does this afford to Chriſtians: what would Chriſt have his Servants do, correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with this</hi>?</p>
            <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>It is a Call to Chriſtians to ſhake off all their Sleep and Drowſineſs, and be in a wakeful Frame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Servant's girding up his Loins to be ready for his Maſter's coming, ſuppoſes him to be awake, and ready for Buſineſs. So when Chriſt ſays to his Diſciples, Gird up your Loins; it is as much as to ſay, Chriſtians muſt ſhake off all their Dulneſs, Drowſineſs, and Sloth, and get and keep in a wakeful watchful Frame.— As for Sinners, they are in a Sleep, in a Sort of dead Sleep, and the Call of the Goſpel to ſuch is that, in Eph. v.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepest, and ariſe from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Life.</hi> And as for real Chriſtians, they are exceeding apt to be drowſy and ſleepy in the Buſineſs of Religion, and Service of Chriſt. The Things of Time and Senſe lull them aſleep. In the Parable of the Virgins, the wiſe are repreſented as ſlumbring as well as the fooliſh, Matth. 25.5. <hi>While the Bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi> But now, when Chriſt ſays to Chriſtians, <hi>Let your Loins be girded about</hi>; it is as much as to ſay, Awake out of all your Slumbers, rowſe up and beſtir your ſelves in the Service of Chriſt and of your Souls. — And ſurely conſidering we know not when our Lord will come, it concerns us to ſhake off all our Drowſineſs, leſt coming he find us ſleeping. And this is to have all our Powers awake; and we ready to every Duty and Service God calls us unto.—It is aſtoniſhing to think, what dull drowſy and ſlothful Frames Chriſtians fall into, conſidering we know not but the Lord is at Hand, that He the Judge is before the Door; and may knock by the Meſſenger of Death this very Night. Wherefore when Chriſt ſays in the Text, <hi>Let your Loins be girded about</hi>; you muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him ſpeaking to them, as in Rom. 13.11. <hi>And that knowing the Time, that it is high Time to awake out of Sleep; for now is your Salvation nearer than when you at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi> And in 1 Theſ. v.6. <hi>Therefore let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſober.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006956_0006_102AC4B93A676698"/>Anſ. 2. <hi>It intends the laying aſide every Thing that would fetter, clogg or hinder us in any of the Duty and Service that Chriſt our Lord calls us unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Servant was to gird his Garment about his Loins, that it might not hang in his Way, when he was waiting upon his Maſter. And the good and watchful Servant who expected his Maſter to knock at the Door, inſtead of having his Garment hang looſe, girded it about him, that he might run without any Delay to open unto him. And beſides, he knew not what his Maſter might have for him to do when he came in: and therefore would have his Garment girded about him, ſo as to be no Obſtruction to him. Accordingly, when Chriſt calls upon us Chriſtians to have our Loins girded about; it intends that we ſhould as much as poſſible get every Thing out of the Way, that would hinder us in our Chriſtian Courſe, or keep us in an unſuitable Frame for the Coming of Chriſt at Death. It intends that we lay aſide every Thing that would put us into an unfit Poſture for Death to meet us in.</p>
            <p>Here then, as Sin and Corruption working in our Hearts, would be very unſuitable, and very much indiſpoſe &amp; hinder us from a due Attendance upon Chriſt at Death; ſo to gird our Loins, is to get rid as much as poſſible of the Workings of Sin &amp; Corruption within us. While Luſts of any Kind prevail, a Man is as unprepared for the Coming of Chriſt by Death, as the Servant is to run and wait upon his Maſter, with all his Garments hanging looſe about him. So that to gird up your Loins, &amp; be in a wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſture for your Lord, is to be getting rid of every vicious Habit, with all your Might, ſtriving againſt corrupt Nature, and all the out-breakings of it: calling in the Aids of the divine Spirit to ſubdue it for you. Whatever Luſt you find begins to work within you, it muſt be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with all your Might, conſidering how unſuitable it will be for you to be intangled with any Luſt, when Chriſt the Lord ſhall knock at the Door by the Meſſenger of Death.— And therefore, when Pride, or Paſſion, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or Carnality, begin to work in your Hearts; then conſider with your ſelves, and ſay, Is this a proper
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006956_0007_102AC4BB76E694A8"/>
Poſture for Death to find me in? Is this a fit Frame for a dying Man? If Chriſt my Lord ſhould now come and call for me, is this a fit Temper to meet him in? Now ſuch like Reflections would put us upon girding up our Loins. And Oh! what Strength would it give us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and repel a Temptation to Sin, to conſider and ſay within our ſelves, that for aught we know, Chriſt our Lord and Maſter may be at the Door ready to call for us; and how ſhall we, while under the Power of Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, be ready to meet him, or even to look him in the Face?</p>
            <p>Anſ. 3. <hi>But then this girding up the Loins may more eſpecially intend the laying aſide the Sin that moſt eaſily beſets us; and which we are moſt liable to fall into.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sins which Chriſtians are more particularly addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, are like long looſe Garments that are always in the Way, hindring from many good Things, that otherwiſe might be done by us. There is nothing that ſo much comes in the Way, and hinders a Man in running the Chriſtian Race, &amp; from preparing for the Coming of Chriſt by Death and Judgment, as his own particular Sin, his Conſtitution Sin, or the Sin he has been long accuſtomed to; or that to which he is peculiarly expoſed, by his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by his Place, and Station in the World, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he is in the Way of, and the Examples and Entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sinners, that he is unavoidably expoſed unto. Theſe, I ſay, are the Sins that fetter us, and hinder us from being in a due Preparation for the Coming of Chriſt. Accordingly, the Apoſtle lets the Chriſtian Hebrews know, that as ever they would run the Chriſtian Race ſet before them, <hi>they must lay aſide the Sin that eaſily beſets them,</hi> Heb. xii.1. The Sin that encompaſſes, that claſps, or clings round about them; as their long Garments did, to which the Apoſtle ſeems to refer. And therefore, as thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were to be laid aſide, or girded up before they were fit for Buſineſs; ſo thoſe Sins that claſp, and cling round about us, ſo as to fetter and intangle us in running the Chriſtian Race, muſt be put out of the Way. Whether our particular Sin be Pride, or Paſſionateneſs, or Envy, or
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006956_0008_102AC4BF03845848"/>
Malice: whether it be Unbelief, or Diſtruſt, or Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Whether it be Worldly-mindedneſs, or Carnality: Whether it be Idleneſs, or Sloth, or Voluptuouſneſs, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance. I ſay, whatever it be, we muſt with all our Might labour to get rid of it, as ever we would be ready to meet Chriſt at his Coming. — For conſider, I beſeech you, how unfit you will be for the Coming of the Son of Man, while you are intangled with any of theſe Luſts? Who can think himſelf in a fit Poſture to meet Chriſt at Death, and at the Judgment, with his Mind puffed up with Pride and Vanity? or his Spirit broiling with angry Paſſions, and breathing out Threatnings and Revenges? or who has his Heart ſwallowed up with worldly Cares, and earthly Affections; or is wallowing in ſinful Pleaſures? Surely this, to keep to the Similitude before us, would be as improper, and as unbecoming, as it would be for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who is ordered to wait for his Maſter's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, to have all his Cloaths hanging ſo about him, and be ſo intangled with them, that he could not ſo much as ariſe and open the Door to him.—And this may ſuffice to ſhew what our Saviour means, when he calls upon his Diſciples to have their <hi>Loins girded about.</hi> — It is to rouſe up out of all our Sleepineſs and Dulneſs, and exert our ſelves with Life, Spirit and Activity, in the Service of Chriſt; and to lay aſide every Sin, and eſpecially every Sin that does moſt eaſily beſet us, as what will hinder us from being in a ſuitable Readineſs for the Coming of our Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed now to conſider the next Word of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, viz. <hi>And your Lights burning.</hi>—</p>
            <p>And this I ſaid, refers alſo to the Manner of Servants waiting for their Maſter's coming home in the Night, let it be what Hour of the Night it would; whether early or late, the Servant took Care not only to have Candles or Lamps, and Oil in them, ready to light: but had his Lamps actually lighted, and burning, that when the Maſter knocked at the Door, he might not then have the Lamps
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006956_0009_102AC4C1B1CDEC78"/>
to light up; but being already lighted, might go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and open to him, and light him into the Room, where the Lights were burning, and all Things ready to receive him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. And now, <hi>What are we to understand by our Saviour's calling upon his Servants, thus to have their Lights burning?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. in General, <hi>It intends, that Chriſtians ſhould ſee to it, that they have all Things in actual Readineſs for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of Man at Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Servant muſt have not only ſome Lamps and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of what afforded Light; but there muſt be Oil in the Lamps; and not only Oil in the Lamps, but they muſt be actually lighted up, and burning. Agreable to this, there muſt be in Chriſtians, not only an outward Shew and Appearance of Readineſs; but there muſt be a real habitual Readineſs: and not only ſo, but an actual Readineſs for the Coming of Chriſt. — So then, to keep to the Similitude of my Text, let me ſay—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If you would be in Readineſs for the Coming of the Son of Man, you muſt have at leaſt a Lamp of outward Profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Lamp is the Emblem of an outward Profeſſion. So our Saviour is underſtood in his Parable of the ten Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Matth. xxv.1. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto ten Virgins who took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi> ℣. 3. <hi>They that were fooliſh took their Lamps; but took no Oil with them.</hi> Which is univerſally interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Profeſſion which they made. And a Lamp is a fit Emblem of an outward Profeſſion; as might eaſily be ſhewn. And now, it is the Duty of all under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to have a Lamp of a fair Profeſſion. That Servant who has not ſo much as a Lamp, is not in any Readineſs for his Maſter's coming home in the Night: No more are Perſons under the Goſpel prepared for the Coming of Chriſt, without a free, fair, and open Profeſſion of him. The Servant was to have his Lamps, the Form and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Light; ſo you muſt have the Form and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Religion. Not that this will by any Means
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006956_0010_102AC4C33662BAC0"/>
anſwer the End of it ſelf, any more than an empty Lamp would anſwer the End to give Light: But as a Lamp is neceſſary to contain that which affords the Light; ſo a Profeſſion of Chriſt is neceſſary to our being Chriſtians. Altho' many Profeſſors will be diſowned and rejected of Chriſt hereafter; yet if we don't profeſs him to be our Lord, and freely acknowledge him before Men, he will finally diſown and reject us. Matth. x.32.33. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall confeſs me before Men, him will I confeſs before my Father which is in Heaven. But whoſoever ſhall deny me before Men, him will I deny before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> So that the denying Chriſt, or neglecting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to own him (which is a Sort of denying him) is not ſo light a Thing as ſome People imagine; but it is highly requiſite to our being ready for the Coming of the Son of Man, that we make an open Profeſſion of him.</p>
            <p>That Servant would be look'd upon as very far from being ready for his Maſter's coming home in the Night, who had not ſo much as a Lamp or Candle in the Houſe. And let me tell you, that if you have not ſo much as the Lamp of a Chriſtian Profeſſion, you are as far from being prepared for the Coming of Chriſt at Death or the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Indeed there are Degrees of Profeſſion; but we ſhould labour to ſtand compleat in our Chriſtian Profeſſion, and to walk in all the Commandments, &amp; come up to all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord. And as for ſuch, who thro' Careleſneſs or indulged Sloth, or Baſhfulneſs, neglect to make a full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, or to come up to his holy Ordinances; they are in a very poor Readineſs for Death or Judgment. For ſuppoſing that Chriſt the Maſter ſhould knock at your Door by the Meſſenger of Death; and after that, you ſhould be called to Judgment, what Excuſe could you make to the Maſter, that you had not ſo much as owned him, or openly profeſſed him to be your Lord?</p>
            <p>Wherefore let all ſuch who are unbaptized; or being come to Years of Diſcretion, neglect to renew their baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Covenant, and to take the Bonds thereof upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to ſeal the ſame at the holy Sacrament of the Supper:
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006956_0011_102AC4C4B7D165F0"/>
And when the Neglect hereof is thro' Careleſneſs &amp; a Spirit of Indifferency, or thro' Baſhfulneſs, and a being aſhamed to make ſuch a publick Appearance, conſider thoſe awful, and very awakening Words of our Saviour, Matth. viii.38. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my Words in this adulterous and ſinful Generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed when he cometh in the Glory of the Father with his holy Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If we would be in Readineſs for the Coming of Chriſt, we must have not only the Lamp of a fair Profeſſion; but the Oil of true Grace in the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Servant who waits for the coming home of his Maſter, don't content himſelf with having a Number of empty Lamps hanging about in the Room, or in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but he ſees that there be Oil in them, that will burn and afford Light unto his Maſter.— So what Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us as abſolutely neceſſary to our being in Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his Comng, is the Oil of true Grace in the Heart. There is no Man is or can be in Readineſs for the Coming of the Son of Man, without this. For altho', a publick Profeſſion of Chriſt, and of his holy Religion, be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible Duty; yet a bare empty Profeſſion will not anſwer the End, any more than empty Lamps will ſerve to give Light in the Room. A Soul empty of true Grace, is like an empty Lamp, and is utterly unprepared for the Coming of Chriſt by Death, or to the Judgment.—There muſt be a gracious Change wrought in Mens Hearts by the Spirit of God: There muſt be the Seeds and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of every Grace, and ſo that which is called the Habit of Grace: And if Chriſt ſhould come to any by Death before they are thus endowed with the Grace of God, alas for ſuch poor Souls! they will be loſt &amp; undone for ever. There muſt be the Habit of Faith, true Faith; <hi>for without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; and he who believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> Mar. xvi.16. There muſt be the Grace of true Repentance towards God, as well as Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>For unleſs we repent, we ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luk. xiii.3. There muſt be a Principle of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006956_0012_102AC4CACFB74508"/>
in the Heart, and the Practice of it in the Life: For <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. xii.14. And the ſame may be ſaid as to the Love of God, and as to the Love of our Neighbour, and to Humility, and Patience, Self-denial, and every other Grace. For this Habit of Grace in the Soul, is the very Thing that prepares for the Coming, and Preſence of Chriſt. Let a Man have every Thing elſe; yet if this one Thing be lacking, he cannot be ready for the Coming of Chriſt. Let a Man make never ſo high a Profeſſion, and appear never ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and be never ſo confident about himſelf, and his own Readineſs for Death and Judgment: Let him ſay never ſo much of his waiting and longing for his Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Departure, in the confident Expectation or Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his going to be with Chriſt; yet if the Habit of true Grace be wanting, he is by no Means fit for that awful Change: And if Chriſt ſhould come to him while in ſuch a graceleſs State, all his confident Boaſts, and high Expectations will only expoſe him to a greater Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. "For what is the Hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul?" The deplorable Caſe of ſuch is repreſented by the fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the Parable, who had Lamps, but no Oil to keep them burning: and while they were running about ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and begging for Oil, <hi>Behold the Bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the Marriage; and the Door was ſhut:</hi> And when they came and cried, <hi>ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; He anſwered and ſaid, Verily, I know you not,</hi> Matth. xxv. at the Beginning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we would be in all due Readineſs for the Coming of Chriſt by Death, we muſt have not only the Lamp of a fair Profeſſion, and the Oil of true Grace in the Heart; <hi>but the Lamp muſt be lighted, and actually burning</hi>; i. e. <hi>this true Grace must be in lively Exerciſe:</hi> — And <hi>your Lights burning,</hi> is the Direction of the Text. The Servant who waited for the coming of his Maſter, kept his Lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Evening, even to the third or fourth Watch of the Night, if his Maſter did not come before. And this
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006956_0013_102AC4CC55A62128"/>
Advice to the Chriſtian, is to have his Graces in lively and vigorous Exerciſe. What Chriſt here recommends to his Diſciples, is not only an habitual, but an actual Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his Coming; and in Order to it, recommends not only the Habit, but the lively Exerciſe of Grace. — As for the Habit of Grace, it belongs to every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; for it is the gracious Habit that makes the true Chriſtian. But this Habit, when it is not in lively Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, is like Oil in the Lamp, but not lighted up, or only ſo lighted as that it ſcarce affords any Light at all, and is ſo dim, that it can hardly be diſcerned: or ſo poor a Light, that it ſeems to be juſt going out. But now, the Direction of our Lord is to have our Lights burning; that is, burning bright &amp; ſtrong; which is to have Grace in lively Exerciſe, as the beſt Preparative for his certain and ſudden Coming by Death and Judgment.</p>
            <p>Thus we may not content our ſelves with a ſuppoſed Principle of Faith or of Repentance: But there muſt be the Exerciſe, the lively Exerciſe of Repentance towards God, and of Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And as there muſt be the Principle or Habit of Love to God, ſo there muſt be the Exerciſe of it: The Heart muſt be filled with the higheſt Eſteem of him, and carried out in moſt ardent Deſires after him, and in the higheſt Delight and Satisfaction in him, which muſt ſweetly but power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully carry us on in a Courſe of ſincere and chearful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him: <hi>For this is the Love of God that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous.</hi>— So again, there muſt be not only the Habit of true Love and Charity to our Neighbour; but the Soul muſt be actually going forth in ſincere Wiſhes and ſervent Prayers for their Welfare; and we muſt be much in Acts of real Goodneſs and Kindneſs to them, as we have Ability and Opportunity for it. So again, there muſt be not only the Principle of Humility; but we muſt be cloathed with Humility; and we muſt walk humbly with our God: and there muſt be a condeſcending to Men, even to Men of low Degree. Again, as there muſt be the Habit of Patience, ſo this muſt be put forth in a patient bearing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006956_0014_102AC4CEC05D98F0"/>
every Evil we meet withal. And then there muſt be not only a ſelf-denying Spirit; but there muſt be an actual denying our ſelves: there muſt be a denying our Self-Will, our Self-Humour, or Self-Honour, or Self-Eaſe, or Self-Intereſt, as the Cauſe of God, and the real Good of others, calls for it. And now to have Grace thus in Exerciſe, is to have our Lights burning.</p>
            <p>And here I would further ſay, that for Perſons to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they have the Principle of Grace in their Hearts; and yet not to Exerciſe it in their Lives, is a ſad Sign that they are ignorant of themſelves, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſomething, when indeed they are nothing; for Grace in the Heart will ſome how or other manifeſt itſelf in the Life, Matth. xii.35. <hi>A good Man out of the good Treaſure of his Heart bringeth forth good Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I don't ſay, that wherever there is a Principle of Grace, there is always the diſcernable Exerciſe of it; for by ſome Means or other; eſpecially by Means of remaining Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and ſome preſent powerful Temptation; the gracious Principle may be obſtructed in its Operation; and ſo may be buried up for the preſent as it were like Fire covered over with Aſhes, as not to be diſcerned. And as to ſome particular Graces or Vertues, there may not be at all Times Occaſion for the Exerciſe of them. But unleſs there be a prevailing Inclination to exerciſe every Grace and Vertue, as there is Occaſion: And if there be not ſome Exerciſe thereof generally as Occaſions call for it, there is Reaſon to fear, that the Principle it ſelf is wanting:—for, to keep to the Similitude of the Text; ſhould we not be ready to conclude there was no Oil, or no good Oil in a Lamp, when upon no Occaſion we could light it, and ſet it a burning? A Principle of true Grace is powerful, and active: and therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is found, it will have a general Influence upon Mens Lives: And therefore when we ſee no ſuch graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Influence upon Mens Lives, it is juſtly to be feared the Habit it ſelf is wanting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:006956_0015_102AC4D3DCD59780"/>I inſiſt the more upon this Point, to ſtave People off from that Self-Flattering, &amp; Deceiving, that is common among Men, whereby they fancy they have true Grace in their Hearts, when there appears nothing of it in their Lives; and ſo vainly conclude they are ready for Death, and for the Coming of the Son of Man: when alas, they have nothing in Readineſs for ſuch an awful Change; and would be put to as great a Plunge, and meet with the ſame dreadful Diſappointment as the fooliſh Virgins.</p>
            <p>I would not therefore have any of you think, that you are prepared, much leſs that you are waiting for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord, from a vain Conceit, that there is the Principle of Grace within, when there is no Exerciſe of it. <hi>What doth it profit my Brethren, if a Man ſay he hath Faith, and hath not Works? Can Faith ſave him</hi>? Jam. ii.14. It is not the ſaying, We have Faith, that will ſave us: nor will the having ſuch a Faith, as is without Works; yea, tho' it ſhould ſwell up into a preſumptuous Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Aſſurance, prepare for the Coming of Chriſt. So then, to finiſh this Head, and to conclude at preſent: To have <hi>our Lights burning,</hi> is not to have Grace only ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in the Soul, in the hidden Man of the Heart, that is ſeen only to God: but it is that which operates alſo in the Life and Converſation, and in all our Concerns with Men; ſo as to appear to Men. Accordingly, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our directs us in Matth. v.16. <hi>Let your Lights ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And truly Grace in lively vigorous Exerciſe cannot be hid long; but it will break forth as the Light. True Grace is true Wiſdom, and that <hi>will make a Man's Face to ſhine,</hi> Eccl. viii.1. Yea, as the ſame inſpired Preacher tells us, Prov. iv.18. and with which I now conclude; <hi>The Path of the Just is as the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect Day.</hi>

            <head>SERMON II.</head>
            <p n="3">III. I Now proceed, as I propoſed, <hi>more particularly to deſcribe the gracious Saint, that is thus waiting for the Coming of his Lord: Who has his Loins girded about, his Lights burning, and ſo is like unto them who wait for their Lord, when he ſhall return from the Wedding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He is ſtrong in the Faith as to his Lord's Coming, at Death, and the Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Diſſolution of Nature by Death, all Men, whether good or bad, believe they ſhall come to it. <hi>The Living know that they ſhall die,</hi> becauſe they ſee People dying continually; and all the paſt Generations gone off the Stage. But then, the true Saint not only believes that it is appointed for all Men once to die; but that after Death is the Judgment: A Day <hi>in which God has appointed to judge the World in Righteouſneſs by that Man Chriſt Jeſus whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given Aſſurance to all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead,</hi> Act. xvii.31. And now the watching waiting Chriſtian, not only gives his general Aſſent to theſe Things, that he ſhall die, and that there will be a Reſurrection and a Judgment to come, when he, and all Mankind, muſt give an Account of themſelves to God; but he has a realizing Senſe of theſe Things. He ſees theſe Things in their Reality, and in their Nearneſs. As the watchful Servant, who is waiting for the Coming of his Lord, with his Loins girt and his Lights burning, has not only a general diſtant Thought, that his Lord may come ſome Time or other; but he has
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006956_0017_102AC4D6F9F927F0"/>
realizing Apprehenſions, that he will certainly come, and knows not, but that he may this very Minute knock at the Door.—Thus the true Chriſtian, who has his Grace in lively Exerciſe, not only realizes Death, as what will moſt certainly come; but as what is haſt'ning on apace to him. He always endeavours to keep up a lively Senſe of the utter uncertainty of the Time when his Lord ſhall come by Death, whether at Evening, or at Cock-crowing, or in the Morning.—Is the watchful Chriſtian in his Youth, he don't ſet Death at forty or fifty Years diſtance; for he is ſenſible that youthful Vigour, is no Security againſt the Arreſts of Death, becauſe Multitudes die in Youth, while their <hi>Breaſts are full of Milk, and their Bones moiſtened with Marrow: They come forth like Flowers, and are cut down.</hi> And as he ſees ſome dying in every Age, he looks upon himſelf liable every Day and Hour of his Life to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Stroke. And if God ſpares his Life from Year to Year, even till old Age; yet the watchful Chriſtian all that while looks upon himſelf in this State of utter Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to the Time when his Lord ſhall call for him; and accordingly paſſes the whole Time of his ſojourning here in the lively realizing Apprehenſion of this, that for aught he knows, Death may be at the Door. The watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful waiting Chriſtian, in the midſt of Health and Vigour won't <hi>boast ſo much as of a To-morrow,</hi> becauſe <hi>he knows not what a Day may bring forth.</hi>— In ſhort, the Chriſtian who is in a waiting Poſture, keeps Death &amp; Judgment always in his View, as what are certain, as what are near, and for aught he knows, at the very Door: And if he in his Mind ſtretches Life to the longeſt Period, and thinks of arriving to a great old Age; yet even then he conſiders with what ſwift Wings Time paſſes away; and that his Years ſpend as faſt as Days and Nights can roll over: and that even fourſcore Years, are but as a Tale that is told, they are ſoon cut off, and he flees away. And the Thought hereof greatly affects him, and has a powerful and happy Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon him. For,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006956_0018_102A7BF6DA6EF7C0"/>2. <hi>The waiting Chriſtian is above all concerned to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Coming of his Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He views Death and Judgment in their infinite Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as well as great Reality. His Heart is deeply affected with the Thoughts of dying, and of appearing before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, to give Account of all Things done in the Body. Death and Judgment appear awful to him. Every Time he thinks of them (which is very frequent) it gives a Solemnity of Spirit; and fills him with Concern, that he may be prepared for ſuch an awful Hour as <hi>that,</hi> when he ſhall paſs out of Time into Eternity, and appear before his Judge, and have his eternal State determined. He is ſo far from making light of Death, that he ever thinks and ſpeaks of it with Seriouſneſs. He conſiders it as the grand deciſive Hour, which fixes his State for Eternity, either in Happineſs or Miſery. The great Concern therefore of his whole Life, is to prepare for Death: and he looks upon his Life ſpent to good Purpoſe, only when it is in Preparation for Death and Judgment. His Heart is very ſenſibly affected with the Thought of dying in his Sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in as much as then there will be no Hope, or Help for him: that then the Day of Grace will be over, and the Door of Mercy will be ſhut; and there will remain, nothing but a fearful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation to devour him: The Thought of which fills him with Amazement.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, he has the moſt pleaſing View of the Happineſs of all thoſe who are well prepared for their great Change. And Oh! what a pleaſing Senſation has he of thoſe Words! Rev. xiv.13. <hi>And I heard a Voice from Heaven, ſaying to me, write, Bleſſed are the Dead who die in the Lord, from henceforth; Yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi> Accordingly, the Deſire of his Soul is, that he may die in the Lord; that he may die the Death of the Righteous. But then, he don't content himſelf with the bare Deſire of this, like <hi>Balaam</hi> of old; but his Concern is ſuch, as puts him upon giving all Diligence, that he may be prepared for the awful Change; and that he may be found of his Judge in Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006956_0019_102AC4DAB64F4A30"/>Accordingly,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He who is waiting for the Coming of his Lord, is above all concerned that he may be found in him, and intereſted in the Redemption he has wrought out for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has a lively Senſe of his own Sin and Corruption; and plainly ſees, that if God ſhould ſtrictly mark his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity againſt him, he ſhould not be able to ſtand in the Judgment; and that if he was to anſwer perſonally at the Bar of God, for his own Defects and Failings, and for his groſſer Sins, he muſt be condemned: And that if he be found only with his own imperfect Righteouſneſs, he could never be juſtified. Conſidering therefore that Death is haſtning, and that Judgment follows upon it; the great Concern of his Soul is, that he may be found in Chriſt; becauſe there is no Condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus. His Concern is to receive him as he is offered to him in the Goſpel; ſo as to be intereſted in him, and in his meritorious Obedience and Death, to be cloathed with the white Raiment of his Righteouſneſs, that the Shame of his own Nakedneſs may not appear. His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern is with the Apoſtle, that he may at that Day be found in Chriſt; <hi>not having on his own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is thro' the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith,</hi> Phil. iii.9. He has too great a Senſe of his own Sins &amp; Failings, to expect a legal Juſtification before God; and therefore he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to obtain it in the Way of the Goſpel, even by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; a <hi>Faith that is made perfect by Works.</hi> Accordingly he looks to Chriſt for Righteouſneſs and Strength, truſting to be aſſiſted, pardoned, and accepted only for his Sake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> building all his Hopes of Heaven and Happineſs, upon the Covenant of Grace, that is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Blood.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He watches, prays, and strives against every Thing that would render him unfit to meet his Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having a conſtant realizing Senſe of his Lord's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he is very much concerned leaſt he ſhould come and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006956_0020_102AC4DE78799888"/>
find him unprepared. And he is ſenſible that Sin is the Thing that moſt of all diſqualifies him for meeting Chriſt at Death or Judgment. This is therefore what the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian is moſt afraid of; and what he is above all concerned to be delivered from. The workings of Sin within him, and the out-breakings of it, in his Words and Actions, are the Burden of his Soul, and what he groans to be delivered from; for he finds how they break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and diſcompoſe and ruffle, and ſo unfit him for the Coming of Chriſt. Whenever therefore he feels cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature riſing, and he himſelf giving Way to Pride or Paſſion, or Envy, or Diſcontent, or Worldly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Filthineſs, he rouzes himſelf out of ſuch a Frame, with the Thought, that the Maſter is coming, and how ſhall I look him in the Face with ſuch filthy Luſts as theſe upon me! He therefore reſiſts and oppoſes them; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calling in the Help of the divine Spirit, gets the Maſtery of them: ſo as to <hi>put off the old Man which is corrupt according to deceitful Luſts</hi>; and to be dying to Sin every Day.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The waiting Christian diligently attends every Duty God calls him unto, doing whatever his Hands find to do with his Might, conſidering there is no Work nor Device, nor Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor Wiſdom, in the Grave whither he is going.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Servant who would be ready for his Lord's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conſiders what his Lord has given him to do, before he comes and calls him to an Account: and this he ſets himſelf about immediately, and without any Delay, leaſt his Lord ſhould come before it be done. He don't leave Things to be done next Year or next Month, or ſo much as till to Morrow, that can as well be done to Day: For, for aught he knows his Soul may be this Night required of him. He is ambitious of being able to ſay at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Lord, in ſome good Meaſure as Chriſt himſelf did, when he was about to leave the World, Joh. xvii.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth, and finiſhed the Work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> Accordingly, he conſiders what Work God has given him to do, in and by which he
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006956_0021_102AC4E1060D83C8"/>
might ſerve and glorify him. That is, he conſiders his general and his particular Calling, and the Duties that reſult therefrom; and attends the ſame with all Diligence.</p>
            <p>Thus the watching waiting Chriſtian attends diligently the Duty of his general Calling.—That is, at he is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Saint, to be a Chriſtian, he endeavours to be ſuch an one. He endeavours, that the Life he lives here in the Fleſh, be by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved us and gave himſelf for us; and is concerned to live in all Things as the Grace of God teaches him; <hi>which is to live ſoberly and righteouſly and godly in the preſent World:</hi> And the Way he takes to make his Calling and Election ſure, is to give Diligence to grow in all the Graces and Virtues of the Chriſtian Life, adding to Faith, Vertue, to Vertue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godlineſs, Brotherly-kindneſs, and Charity.</p>
            <p>But then, the Chriſtian who would be ready for his Lord's Coming, diligently attends the Buſineſs of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling.—He is not carried away with ſuch a miſtaken Notion, that he muſt lay aſide his worldly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Concerns to prepare for Death and Eternity: but rather endeavours to do it after ſuch a Manner, that may forward rather than obſtruct his Preparations for the ſame. Accordingly, he will be diligent in his worldly buſineſs; but will take Care not to be too much cumbred therewith. Altho' he ſees he muſt have his Head and his Hands in the World, the one to project, and the other to perform the Buſineſs thereof; yet he endeavours as much as poſſible to keep his Heart out of it. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to do the Buſineſs of his Calling, not from an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Love of the World; but from a Senſe of Duty, and in Subordination to his ſpiritual Intereſt, and in ſuch a godly Sort, as to be ready for his Lord's Coming, even altho' he ſhould be found in his Shop, or in his Field, or in any lawful Buſineſs whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Chriſtian who would be always ready and even waiting for the Coming of his Lord, will conſider
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006956_0022_102AC4E3BAF38D80"/>
the ſeveral Stations &amp; Relations he ſtands in to his Fellow-Creatures, and the various Duties that reſult therefrom; and is concerned to be conſtantly and faithfully diſcharging the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thus, if he be a Ruler, he rules in the Fear of God, conſidering he himſelf, is ſubject and accountable to the great Ruler of the Univerſe. If he be among the ruled, he ſubmits to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake, leading a quiet and peceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.—Is he a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and the Paſtor of a Flock? out of Love to Chriſt, and out of Love to precious Souls, he feeds the Sheep, and feeds the Lambs, with Knowledge and Underſtanding, with all Diligence and Faithfulneſs, as One who muſt give an Account.— Or does he belong to the Flock? he will eſteem his faithful Miniſter very highly in Love for his Works Sake; will duly attend his Miniſtrations, and hearken to the Counſels of God that ſhall be brought to him. And while his Miniſter freely ſows to him ſpiritual Things, he will not think it a great Thing if he ſhall reap or receive of his carnal Things.— Again, is he an Houſholder? he will walk in his Houſe wiſely and in a perfect Way, maintaining Religion, good Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his Family, reſolving with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and taking Care, that <hi>as for him and his Houſe they will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Is he a Parent? he is careful to inſtruct his Children, and <hi>bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</hi> Is he a Child? he <hi>honours his Father and his Mother</hi> — Is he a Maſter? he <hi>renders to his Servants that which is juſt and equal, knowing that he alſo has a Maſter in Heaven,</hi> that he expects will quickly call for him.—Is he a Servant? he obeys his Maſter in all lawful Things; <hi>not with Eye-ſervice as Men pleaſers, but in Singleneſs of Heart fearing God, and doing all as unto Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, is the waiting Chriſtian rich in this World? he <hi>don't trust in theſe uncertain Riches, but in the living God</hi>; and is <hi>rich in good Works; laying up in Store a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation against the Time to come.</hi>—Is he Poor? he is content, truſting in God, and caſting all his Cares upon him; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006956_0023_102AC4E61DD469E0"/>
that he may be rich in Faith, and ſo an Heir of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Finally, under this Head; Is there any Thing to be ſaid, teſtified, or done by him, neceſſary for perpetuating the Memory of Things, or for the Preſervation of Peace among Brethren, and Neighbours, or for the preventing any Injuſtice after his Deceaſe? he will take effectual Care to have it done without Delay. And be ſure the Chriſtian that is in a proper waiting Poſture will ſet his own Houſe, and all his outward Affairs in Order, making ſuch Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions and Settlements of his worldly Goods, as he ſees neceſſary to do Juſtice to his Family &amp; Friends, and to all with whom he is concerned: And won't leave ſuch an important Affair as that of making his Will, to be done, even when his Lord actually knocks at the Door, and calls him away immediately. — Thus the watching waiting Chriſtian, is for having every Thing done, that his Lord expects or requires ſhould be done againſt his Coming.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The waiting Chriſtian ſets more and more looſe from the World, and all Things in it; which he expects ſpeedily to take an everlaſting Farewell of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The realizing Views of Death, Judgment and the World to come, give the Chriſtian a lively Senſe of the Vanity of the World, and of all earthly Enjoyments, and begets an holy Indifferency in the Soul to all Things here below.—He conſiders, that whenever the Maſter ſhall knock by his Meſſenger Death, he muſt leave all behind him; and the Places which now know him, ſhall know him no more: And that he muſt go as naked out of the World, as he came into it. And therefore as the Chriſtian is in certain Expectation of this in a little Time, his Affections all cool to the World, and the Things which are in it. If Riches increaſe, he don't ſet his Heart upon them; becauſe he conſiders they are uncertain at beſt; and that in a little Time he muſt certainly leave them. And on the other Hand, if he meets with Poverty, Diſappointments and Afflictions in the World, he bears them with Patience, and Contentment, conſidering the Time is ſhort, and that his
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006956_0024_102AC4E86EB1FEA8"/>
Redemption draweth near.—In ſhort, the waiting Chriſtian ſo realizes the Brevity and Uncertainty of humane Life, that he looks upon himſelf but as in a ſojourning State, travelling thro' this World as faſt as the Wings of Time can carry him; and looks upon his Houſe not as his Home, but only as an Inn, for a Way-faring Man to lodge in, as it were for a Night: And what Conveniences, and Comforts he finds, he accepts them thankfully at the Hands of a kind Providence. And whatever Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences or Troubles he meets with, he ſubmits quietly to them; hoping in a little Time to get to his Journey's End, to his heavenly Father's Houſe, where he ſhall meet with all, that he can deſire.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Accordingly the waiting Christian has his Affections more and more ſet upon God and Chriſt, and Things above.</hi>—</p>
            <p>His Treaſure is in Heaven, and his Heart is there alſo: yea, his Converſation is in Heaven, from <hi>whence he looks for the Saviour, which is Chriſt Jeſus the Lord.</hi> He conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Chriſt is coming: And this draws forth his Soul in longing Deſires after him; ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. xl.2. <hi>My Soul thirsteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before him</hi>? Moreover, he thinks of Heaven, and this puts him into an heavenly Frame. He loves to contemplate the Glories of Heaven, and he loves to ſpeak of Heaven, where he hopes to be in a little Time, with all the Saints that are gone before: And this puts him upon labouring more and more after the heavenly Temper. Having the Promiſes, and ſo the realizing Views of this bleſſed and glorious State, he is for <hi>cleanſing himſelf yet more and more from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God.</hi> And the nearer he draws to the heavenly World, the more of Holineſs, Humility, Love and Charity, appear in him, ſo that Heaven ſeems to be begun in his Soul, and ſome Rays of the heavenly Light and Glory begin to dawn upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006956_0025_102AC4EAB4B3B300"/>Thus I have given you ſome Deſcription of the Saint who has his <hi>Loins girded,</hi> his <hi>Lights burning</hi>; and is as a Man that <hi>waiteth</hi> for the Coming of his Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I now proceed, as I propoſed, briefly to ſet forth the <hi>Bleſſedneſs of that Servant who is in ſuch a watching waiting Frame for the Coming of his Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find watching.</hi> And ſurely of all the Men in the World, theſe are the bleſſed Men: And to ſet forth the Bleſſedneſs of ſuch, let me ſay,—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Such are in high Favour with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the bleſſed Ones, whoſe Tranſgreſſions are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and whoſe Sins are done away in the Blood of Chriſt; ſo that they are juſtified freely by God's Grace, thro' the Redemption there is in him: And they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the dearly beloved Son of God. God the Father is their Friend &amp; Father: Jeſus Chriſt is their Redeemer and Saviour: and the Holy Ghoſt is their Sanctifier, Guide and Comforter. But then, as I am ſpeaking, not only of true Chriſtians in general (of which this is their happy State) but of firſt-rate Chriſtians more eſpecially, even of ſuch, who inſtead of ſlumbring and ſleeping, as even the wiſe Virgins did; are watching and waiting for their Lord's Coming: So theſe, we may conſider as intitled to ſome diſtinguiſhing Marks of Favour. Theſe are the Servants of the moſt high God, that he delights to honour. Theſe are his Jewels, and his Treaſure: Theſe are the Saints in the Earth and the excellent Ones, in whom is his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. And God oftentimes confers many Marks of his ſpecial Favour upon them in this Life, if not always in Temporals, yet in ſpiritual Bleſſings: <hi>They have Life,</hi> ſpiritual Life: yea, <hi>they have it more abundantly,</hi> Joh. x.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Bleſſed are ſuch watching waiting Chriſtians, as they are in the moſt deſirable Frame to live in, let it be never ſo long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006956_0026_102AC4EE565D43F8"/>It may ſeem a Paradox to ſome, to tell them it is a bleſſed Thing to be always tho'tful of Death, and a bleſſed State, and to be conſtantly looking and waiting for that great Change. Some Perſons are ſo far from thinking it a bleſſed State, that they look upon it as a very uneaſy Poſture to be in, &amp; ſtrive all they can, by Company, Diverſions, or Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to croud ſuch gloomy melancholy Thoughts out of their Minds. And as to ſome, it is a conſtant Burden upon their Spirits; and the ſervile Fear hereof takes away all the Comforts of Life. Hence we read, Heb. ii.15. of thoſe, <hi>who thro' Fear of Death, were all their Life-time ſubject to Bondage.</hi> But he who will ſeriouſly conſider of the Matter, will find that the Thoughts of Death, and being in a wachful Frame, getting ready for the Coming of Chriſt, is the moſt bleſſed Frame we can be in, during the whole Courſe of Life, ſtretched out to the longeſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. If a Man ſhould live Threeſcore Years and ten, yea, if by Reaſon of Strength, he ſhould attain to Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years; yet the moſt deſireable Way of Living for that Man from his Youth-up, would be to have <hi>his Loins girded, and his Lights burning, and he as one waiting for the Coming of his Lord</hi>; and to be in Readineſs for him, as if he was actually at the Door. Never does a Man live to ſo good Purpoſe. as when he is in actual as well as habitual Readineſs for the Coming of Chriſt. And Oh! what a bleſſed Frame would People be in, did they live always in the near Views of Death, Judgment, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! And he who lives in the neareſt &amp; moſt realizing Views hereof, is the moſt bleſſed Man, as he is in the moſt bleſſed Way of living. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He lives moſt to the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He walks the cloſeſt with God, and lives the neareſt to him. He has the moſt tender Concern for his Honour, and the Intereſt of Chriſt, and is moſt careful to live up to his Chriſtian Character. Such Men who are in a watching waiting Poſture, are the Men whoſe Conſciences are tender, and are very fearful of every Thing that is offenſive to God, or would bring Diſhonour to his Name:
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006956_0027_102AC4EFD933C840"/>
They live the moſt remote from Sin of any; and moſt careful to obſerve the divine Precepts; yea, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the Fruits of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, <hi>which are by Jeſus Christ to the Praiſe and Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such Men live more to the Good and Benefit of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the near and realizing Views Men have of the Coming of Chriſt, will their Tempers towards one another be corrected. How does Pride and Envy, Wrath and Hatred ſubſide, and Clamour &amp; Evil-ſpeaking grow ſilent, when Chriſt our Lord by the Meſſenger of Death appears to be at the Door? And how does Love and Good-will to all Men begin to riſe and glow in the Hearts of Saints, when they by ſome evident Tokens ſee Death haſtning upon them? And what a forgiving, and aſking Forgiveneſs? And what a Care to repair every Injury they have done, and to give all Chriſtian Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, where they have given Offence; when in the near Views of Death and Judgment? Which ſhews, that if Chriſtians were always in ſuch a waiting Poſture, they would live more up to the Chriſtian Law of Love to one another. Then Chriſtians would have a ſtricter Regard to Truth and Juſtice in all their Concerns one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and abound in all Acts of Kindneſs and Charity to the proper Objects thereof; and endeavour to be of all the Benefit to Mankind they can, by their Counſels and Inſtructions, and Prayers, and every kind Office. And in ſhort, will at ſuch a Time exhibit a bright Example of all Chriſtian Graces and Vertues; and ſet forth the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Glories of Religion, ſo as to recommend the ſame to the Eſteem and Choice of others. When does Religion appear ſo amiable and excellent, as in a Servant waiting for the Coming of his Lord, full of Faith, full of Love to God, and Charity to Men, &amp; with an Heart emptied of the World; but full of God and Chriſt, full of Heaven, and heavenly Converſation: And at the ſame Time acting with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Care and Fidelity in every Station and Relation of Life? Inſomuch that if it was not for the horrible Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions &amp; Prejudices of Mens Hearts againſt the true
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006956_0028_102AC4F36423C520"/>
Religion of Chriſt, every one would be enamoured by his Example. Chriſtians in a truly watching &amp; waiting Frame, will ſo <hi>cauſe their Light to ſhine before Men, that others ſeeing their good Works, will be ſtrongly induced to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Such a watching waiting Frame is much for their own Peace and Comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Loins girded about, and the Lights burning, what is it, but Grace in the ſeveral Branches of it, in lively Exerciſe? And ſurely there is nothing that affords ſuch true Peace, ſuch real Pleaſure, and ſolid Satisfaction to the Soul, as this. <hi>Her Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths are Peace. She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her,</hi> Prov. iii.17, 18. Whatever the vain, carnal, thoughtleſs World may think of it; yet it is certain, that no Men do ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually conſult their own Peace and Comfort in this World, as they who are in a watching waiting Frame for the Coming of Chriſt, and have every Thing ready for his moſt ſudden Appearance. When does the Man live ſo near to God; when does he live ſo like to God, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſuch Communion with him, as when Faith, and Hope, and Charity, are drawn forth into lively Exerciſe? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in ſuch a Way, the Chriſtian is moſt likely to ſee God's reconciled Face, and to enjoy the Evidences of his Love; Yea, and to walk up &amp; down in the Light of his Countenance, <hi>which puts more Gladneſs in the Heart, than when Corn and Wine and Oil are increaſed.</hi> Pſal. iv.6, 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Such watching waiting Servants are bleſſed as they are in the Way to a peaceable and quiet, and ſometimes to a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Saint by realizing Death, by bringing it near and preparing for it; gets at length reconciled to it: ſo that the Terror of it vaniſhes: for as to all ſuch, the Sting of Death, which is Sin, is taken away; and being thus diſarmed, it ceaſes to terrify them. Theſe watching Chriſtians are the perfect, and the Upright in the Earth:
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006956_0029_102AC4F5EB1D7DA8"/>
and <hi>mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright, for the End of that Man is Peace,</hi> Pſal. xxxvii.37. Chriſtians, who are waiting and in actual Readineſs for the Coming of Chriſt, when he knocks at the Door, they will not be ſurprized, nor put into any hurrying Confuſion; but will with all Calmneſs receive the Meſſage. Such are willing to wait all the Days of their appointed Time till their Change ſhall come: But when it actually comes, they are ready to ſay with good <hi>Simeon</hi> of old, <hi>Now, Lord, letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace, according to thy Word, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation,</hi> Luk. xxix.29, 30. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſuch are enabled with an holy Serenity, as well as Stedfaſtneſs of Faith, to commend their Spirits into the Hands of God who gave them; and into the Hands of Chriſt, who redeems and ſaves them, ſaying with holy <hi>Stephen, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi> Yea, ſometimes at the near Approach of Death, they are filled with Joy, and are enabled in holy Triumph to ſay, with the Apoſtle, 1 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 55, 56, 57. <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy Victory! the Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law; but Thanks be to God that giveth us the Victory thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Such are bleſſed as they are in the Way not only of being received to Heaven; but of receiving distinguiſhing Marks of Honour from their Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe Servants whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find watching: Verily, I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird himſelf, and make them ſet down at Meat and will come forth and ſerve them.</hi> As my Text goes on. What a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and even aſhoniſhing Repreſentation is this of the condeſcending Favour of Chriſt, and of the very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Honour he will do to ſuch watchful waiting Chriſtians! How ſurprizing would it be to a faithful humble Servant, to ſee his Maſter upon his coming home, ſo pleaſed with the Faithfulneſs and Care of his Servant, in having all Things in ſuch Readineſs againſt his coming; as to gird himſelf, his Cloaths about him, and cauſe his Servant to ſit down to Meat, and he the Maſter, to come
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006956_0030_102AC4F90CF87AF8"/>
forth and ſerve him, and wait upon him? And yet, by ſuch a Similitude, our bleſſed Lord is pleaſed to repreſent the diſtinguiſhing Favour he will ſhew to ſuch Servants, ſuch Chriſtians, as are in all Readineſs for his Coming. All true Chriſtians ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the World at Death: For their Souls ſhall no ſooner leave their Bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than they ſhall be conducted by Angels to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, to the Paradice of God. And altho' their Bodies, like the Bodies of other Men, ſhall lie down in the Grave and ſee Corruption; yet here is the bleſſed Difference, that while others ſhall <hi>riſe to Shame and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Contempt,</hi> theſe <hi>ſhall riſe to Life,</hi> glorious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal: their <hi>Bodies faſhioned like unto Christ's glorious Body.</hi> And how bleſſed will they be at the Judgment, when Chriſt their Lord and Judge ſhall place them at his Right Hand, and then pronounce the bleſſed <hi>Euge, Well done, good and faithful Servant,</hi> upon each of them, ſaying, <hi>Thou hast been faithful in a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many Things, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord,</hi> Matth. xxv.21. Obſerve, it is not ſaid, the Joy of thy Lord enter into you, but <hi>enter ye into the Joy.</hi> The Joy is too great to enter into them, and therefore they are to enter into that, ſo as to be even ſwallowed up in an Ocean of Joy.

            </p>
            <p>But as I am ſpeaking more eſpecially of firſt Rate Chriſtians, who are eminent for their Watchfulneſs, and Readineſs for the Coming of Chriſt; ſo we may conſider ſuch, as receiving higher Marks of Favour than other Saints. They ſhall be not only barely admitted into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but ſhall have an Entrance miniſtred to them <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly</hi> into the Everlaſting Kingdom. They ſhall not ſqueeze thro' the Gates into the Celeſtial City; but they ſhall have an <hi>open</hi> Entrance, and this miniſtred to them <hi>abundantly:</hi> And they, inſtead of ſome of the lower Seats, ſhall be advanced to the higher Manſions. Such Diſtinction

will be made among the Saints: <hi>For as one Star differeth from another in Glory, ſo alſo is the Reſurrection,</hi> and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv.41, 42. And then Chriſt their Lord, will as it were make them to ſit down to Meat, and ſerve them: for he will make moſt free and full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of himſelf, and of the Tokens of his Love unto them, far beyond all that we can deſcribe. "For Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it ſo much as entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, what glorious Things are prepared and laid up for ſuch:" And ſo I forbear. And what has been ſaid, is abundantly ſufficient to ſet forth the Bleſſedneſs of every watching and waiting Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And thus I have finiſhed the ſeveral Things I propoſed to conſider in the Text. I have told you, what it is to have your <hi>Loins girded,</hi> and your <hi>Lights burning</hi>; and deſcribed the Servant who is thus <hi>waiting for the Coming of his Lord:</hi> And have hinted ſomething at the Bleſſedneſs of ſuch Servants. I ſay, hinted at it, becauſe it is beyond us to give an adequate Deſcription thereof.</p>
            <p>And now, altho' the Subject affords many uſeful Heads by Way of Application; yet the Time and Seaſon will not allow it: But Oh! may the divine Spirit apply what has been ſaid to your Hearts and mine: That we may be found among thoſe bleſſed Servants, whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find thus watching. And therefore wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other Heads of Improvement, I ſhall only apply it to the ſpecial Occaſion that has brought me hither this Day.</p>

               <p>GOD in his holy Providence has at length come and knocked, and called for his Servant, your venerable and aged Paſtor, whom, we truſt, had his Loins girded, and his Lights burning, and was in Readineſs for the Coming of his Lord. It was late in the Night naturally and literally, as well as ſiguratively ſpeaking, that our Lord came to him, and all on a ſudden: But, we truſt, he found him watching; and has received him among his bleſſed and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:006956_0032_102AC4FCE330AAC0"/>The great Former and Father of Spirits, formed and fitted him for the People of this Place, and then beſtowed him upon you; and continued him for many Years, even to a great old Age, as an eminent Bleſſing to you. His natural Capacities, his acquired Accompliſhments, and his gracious Endowments; not only rendred him a pleaſant and agreable Companion; but gained him a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eſteem and Reſpect, and rendered him eminently, and extenſively uſeful in a great variety of Ways, relating both to the temporal and the ſpiritual Intereſts of this People, and of both Miniſters and People in Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Towns and Churches. He was eminently fitted for this Place, in its Infant State, and when you were few in Number; as was your Caſe when he came firſt among you: when you needed a Man of ſuch Wiſdom &amp; Prudence to adviſe and aſſiſt you in your outward and civil, as well as ſpiritual Concerns. And I believe it will be allowed, that but few People have had ſo great Help, Benefit, and Comfort of a Miniſter, in all Reſpects, as this People have had in Mr. HANCOCK.</p>
               <p>He had an uncommon vivacity of Spirit, that made him diligent, active and chearful, and ready to every good Work, that God called him unto.—He was early in the Morning, and early in the Week, at his Studies, and in his Preparations for the Sabbath; in which he made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he gave Attendance to Reading, and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the ſound Doctrines, the wiſe Counſels, and the moving Exhortations, with which he entertained you, from Sabbath to Sabbath: In which, he ſhewed himſelf a ready Scribe, well inſtructed to the Kingdom of Heaven, bringing out of his Treaſure, like the good Houſholder, Things new and old.</p>
               <p>And by his diligent and early Application to his Studies, he redeemed Time for many other uſeful Services, both of a private and publick Nature. You your ſelves, and your Fathers, who are dead and gone, if they were here, could teſtify how much Time he has employed, how much Evil he has prevented, and how much Good he has done, by his ſeaſonable, cautious, and wiſe Counſels, in your
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006956_0033_102AC4FFE5DC17C8"/>
Town Affairs; and in your Domeſtick and Family Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
               <p>You muſt be ſenſible he was a great Lover of Peace, and a wiſe Counſellour of Peace: and having an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sagacity and Penetration, ſaw when the Cloud of Contentions firſt began to ariſe, even altho' it was no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than a Man's Hand; and by his wiſe pacifick and ſeaſonable Interpoſitions, would diſperſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Few Miniſters who have been ſo much concerned in the various Affairs of their People, as he was in your's; and yet I never heard him taxed of being in the leaſt Meaſure a faulty buſy Body in other Mens Matters; for you your ſelves were ſo ſenſible of his Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of his Capacity and Readineſs to direct and adviſe you that, as I have underſtood, you ſeldom or never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in any important or difficult Affair, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting him upon it.</p>
               <p>And Oh! what a happy Talent had he to prevent Quarrels and Differences among you: to reconcile Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences when begun; and to root out the Seeds of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord when ſown among Brethren and Neighbours!</p>
               <p>That facetious Temper, and Turn of Wit, which was natural to him, and which altho' ſome People of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Make, might think at ſome Times, abounded; yet, this muſt be ſaid, that he made a very good Uſe of it in general; and that it ſerved for many valuable Purpoſes. How did it ſerve to ſcatter the Clouds of Melancholy that hung upon People's Spirits, and ſtir up a pleaſant Chearfulneſs in them? How did he hereby ſoften Mens Tempers, and correct their ill Humours, and bring the Fretful, the Angry, and the Revengeful, into a calm, peaceable and forgiving Frame?</p>
               <p>And as you have had the Character of a peaceable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I believe you will readily grant, that it has been very much owing to the pleaſant, prudent, and pacifick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of your deceaſed Paſtor: And if you ſhould now fall into unhappy Contentions, you will abundantly confirm the ſame: But I pray God you may ſhow your ſelves to be ſtill under the happy Influence of his Counſels, and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006956_0034_102AC50225720770"/>
Example, by continuing in Peace, and preſerving your Character.</p>
               <p>But then, the very uſeful Talents of this deceaſed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord, were not confined to the Church and Town of <hi>Lexington</hi>; for many Towns and Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Difficulties, have been well inſtructed, greatly aſſiſted, and comforted by him. Great Reſort has been to him for Counſel and Aſſiſtance; ſo that <hi>the Care of the</hi> Neighbouring <hi>Churches</hi> in a Manner <hi>came upon him.</hi> But few Miniſters have been ſo much employed in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Councils as he was; and eſpecially in Ordination Councils: For having been the Senior Miniſter of this County for near thirty Years, he has been even as a Biſhop among us; and preſided in moſt of the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Councils for a great Number of Years. Upon how many he has laid his Hands in the ſolemn Seperation of them to the Work of the Miniſtry, I know not; but I underſtand, that he himſelf, a few Days before his Death, obſerved, that he had given the ſolemn Charge to twenty one Miniſters; which I believe no Miniſter in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try beſides has been able to ſay.</p>
               <p>And he was greatly beloved and honoured by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, &amp; Sons in the Miniſtry; being a Lover of Hoſpitality, and a Lover of good Men, there was great Reſort to his Houſe, by People of various Characters; where they met with hearty Welcomes: and ſcarce ever went away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome inſtructive, as well as exhilerating Obſervations; ſo that Miniſters of every Age loved his Company, and ſought to him for Advice.—And ſuch was the Goodneſs of God to him, and to his Family, as well as unto you, that altho' he lived to a great Age; yet he did not out-live his Uſefulneſs: For he retained his Spirits, and the Powers of his Mind, with uncommon Vivacity &amp; Vigour, even to the laſt.</p>
               <p>In leſs than a Fortnight before his Death, he gave the ſolemn Charge to a young Miniſter in a Neighbouring Town,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev.

which he was wont to perform ſuch Services, and with a Vigour that was uncommon for ſuch Years. And you your ſelves are Witneſſes, with what Zeal and fervour of Spirit he addreſſed you the Lord's-Day before his Death, when he would have you <hi>wiſt,</hi> or be ſenſible, that he was about his heavenly <hi>Father's Buſineſs,</hi> and was for doing it with all his Might; conſidering, that he, as well as others, by Reaſon of the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> was ſubjected to Death, when his labouring Time would all be over, there being no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wiſdom, in the Grave, whether he ſaw himſelf a going.<note n="*" place="bottom">One of the Texts Mr. <hi>Hancock</hi> preached upon the Sabbath before his Death, was in Luk. ii.49. <hi>Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Father's Buſineſs.</hi> The other Rom. v.12. <hi>Wherefore as by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Altho' the Spritelineſs of his Temper, continued in a great Meaſure; yet he by bodily Infirmities had frequent Monitions of his approaching Diſſolution. He expected his Lord would quickly knock at the Door; and therefore when called to publick Services of late Years; he would frequently expreſs his Apprehenſions of its being the laſt of that Kind of Service he ſhould ever perform. And altho' the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers of Death took him in his bodily Sleep; and he was little more than waked out of that Sleep by Extremity of Pain, before the Sleep of Death came upon him; yet we truſt he was ready for ſuch a ſudden Call; and is gone to receieve the Reward of a faithful Servant; <hi>I heard a Voice from Heaven, ſaying unto me, write, Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth; yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them,</hi> Rev. xiv.13.</p>
               <p>And now, may the bereaved Family be ſupported by the believing realizing View of this. May they be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that God has continued him to ſuch an advanced Age, ſo great a Comfort and Bleſſing to them: and may they be comforted with this Thought, that his Departure, and Abſence from them, is to be preſent with the Lord.</p>

                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:006956_0038_102AC50B6F5BB010"/>But at length the Time came that he muſt die; ſo that now ye ſhall ſee his Face, and hear his Voice, no more. Well, remember how you have received and heard, and hold faſt, and repent! Oh! remember the many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counſels, and pathetick Exhortations, which he has delivered to you in the Name of the Lord from this Deſk; as well as in a more private Manner. And may the Thought of his ſudden Death, and that he can call upon you no more, ſerve to bring many Things to your Minds, which he has ſaid to you, and impreſs them more deeply upon your Hearts than ever: by which Means, tho' he be dead, it may be ſaid, that he ſtill ſpeaketh unto you.</p>
               <p>And now, ſince God has made ſuch a Breach upon you, you will be ready to ſay, What ſhall we do? and how ſhall the Breach be repaired? Why, you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he who has made this Breach upon you, is ſtiled, the <hi>Repairer of Breaches, the Reſtorer of Paths to dwell in,</hi> Iſai. lviii.12. And <hi>with him is the Reſidue of the Spirit.</hi> Oh, my Hearers, tho' we your Miniſters are not ſuffered to continue by Reaſon of Death; yet Chriſt our Redeemer liveth to take Care of his Churches, and to provide for them. Well then, you muſt commit yourſelves to him, as to the great Shepherd and Biſhop of your Souls.—When <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was dead, his Diſciples came <hi>and took up his Body &amp; buried it, and went &amp; told Jeſus,</hi> Mat. xiv.12. Well, you have taken up the Body of your deceaſed Paſtor, and buried it: and the next Thing is, to go and tell Jeſus; tell him, that your Paſtor is dead, and that you are as Sheep without a Shepherd; and beg of him to take the Paſtoral Care of you, and guide you in every Step towards a future Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that he would preſerve you in Peace, and not ſuffer you to fall out by the Way.</p>
               <p>And here, let me tell you; that hearkening to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Text will wonderfully ſerve to prevent the out-breakings of a contentious Spirit, and preſerve you in Peace. If your Loins be girded, and your Lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and you waiting for the Coming of your Lord, Oh! how would every Thing that is Contentious or Unpeacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in your Tempers, ſubſide! Surely, he who conſiders
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006956_0039_102AC50ED50CA048"/>
the Lord is at Hand, will be peaceable and quiet, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a Moderation that ſhall be known unto all Men.</p>
               <p>So that the Advice of the Text is the beſt for you: And as it was what Chriſt gave to his Diſciples <hi>then</hi>; ſo he gives to you, and to all of us, <hi>now. What I ſay unto you, I ſay, unto all, Watch,</hi> Matth. xiii.37. And as it is the Voice of Chriſt's Word, ſo is it of his Providence. The Voice of your deceaſed Paſtor's ſudden Death, to you is, <hi>Be ye alſo ready, for in ſuch an Hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh,</hi> Matth. 24.44.</p>
               <p>This then is the Exhortation that ſpeaketh to every Age: To thoſe who are Young, or in the middle of their Days: But it ſpeaks moſt loudly to thoſe who are advanced in Years; to have your Loins girded, your Lights burning, and you all to be in a waiting Poſture for the Coming of your Lord.</p>
               <p>The faithful Servant, who is waiting for his Maſter to come Home; the later it is at Night, the more ſtrongly does he look for him, and the more careful is he to be in actual Readineſs for his Coming; that nothing might be lacking, that is neceſſary for the due Reception of his Maſter, whom he expects every Minute to knock at the Door. Well, Decays of Nature, Infirmities of Age, as well as daily Obſervation, tell you, that your Time is ſhort, and that Chriſt by his Meſſenger Death, is juſt at Hand. How then does it concern you to be ready, and even waiting for his Coming. And you ſhould now ſee that Nothing be left undone any longer, that is neceſſary to be done by you before his Coming. If you have any worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns unſettled, delay them no longer. But above all, ſee that you ſettle all Affairs ſo far as poſſible between God, and your own Souls. Examine your ſelves afreſh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be in the Faith; prove and try your ſelves, over and over again: and cry mightily to God, to ſearch and try you. And Oh! ye elderly People! ſee that your Lights be burning. Labour to ſhine bright in Faith, in Humility, in Meekneſs, in Peaceableneſs, in Love and Charity. Let an heavenly Temper, in a heavenly Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhine brighter in you than ever! which may give
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006956_0040_102AC511E5872998"/>
the beſt Evidence to your ſelves, and to others, that you are really going to that bleſſed Place.</p>
               <p>And now, to move Young and Old, and People of every Age, to be thus really, habitually, and actually rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the Coming, the ſudden Coming of Chriſt, I think I have ſaid enough: And I will only add by Way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection.</p>
               <p>That our Lord will certainly come ſooner or later, to every one of us; and it is of infinite Importance to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for his Coming, our eternal Salvation depends upon it. If we be ready when Chriſt comes, we ſhall enter with him into the Marriage Chamber, and ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with the Lord: But if not ready at that Time, we are undone to all Eternity. <hi>When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the Door, and ye begin to ſtand without and to knock at the Door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us: he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence ye are,</hi> Luk. xiii.25. Well, none of us can tell how ſoon or ſuddenly he may come to us. But if he ſhould tarry never ſo long, let me tell you, that we can never live to ſo good Purpoſe, as when in actual Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Coming of the Son of Man. It is then, my Brethren, that we live moſt to the Glory of God, to the Honour of Chriſt, to the Intereſt of Religion, and to the Safety, Peace, and Comfort of our own Souls. — More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this is the Way to prevent our being ſurprized at the Approach of Death; and is the moſt likely Way to enjoy a bleſſed Calm, yea, and an holy Joy in <hi>that</hi> awful Hour.</p>
               <p>Finally, This is the Way to be commended, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly rewarded by our Lord and Maſter, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. I conclude all, with his own gracious Words, Matth. xxiv.46. <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> And ℣. 38. of the Context. <hi>And if he ſhall come in the ſecond Watch; or come in the third Watch, and find them ſo, bleſſed are thoſe Servants.</hi>
