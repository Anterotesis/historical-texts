            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Governor having been informed laſt Week, at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſeveral Invitations ſent by this Government, at ſundry Times, to the <hi>Indians</hi> living on and near the <hi>Ohio,</hi> the <hi>Delaware</hi> Chief <hi>Beaver,</hi> and the Deputies of other Tribes of Weſtern <hi>Indians,</hi> would be at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> on the Eighth Inſtant; ſat out from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> attended by ſeveral Gentlemen, and came here on the Ninth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and found that the <hi>Indians</hi> had arrived the Evening before.</p>
               <p>On the Tenth the Governor, attended by the Gentlemen abovementioned, with ſeveral of the Inhabitants of this Town, paid a Viſit to <hi>Beaver,</hi> and the other <hi>Indians,</hi> at their Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about a Mile from the Town, where he took them by the Hand, and bid them heartily welcome; and having ſeen that they were well accommodated, took his Leave, and came back to Town.</p>
               <p>The Governor Yeſterday Afternoon received a Meſſage from <hi>Beaver,</hi> that having been a long Time from Home, they would take it very kindly if he would be pleaſed to open the Conferences with them To-morrow Morning, without waiting any longer for the <hi>Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as he and thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> with him were the firſt invited, and were only made acquainted with the coming of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> ſince they left their Homes.</p>
               <p>The Governor returned them for Anſwer, that the Interpreter was not come; but as ſoon as he ſhould arrive, he would immediately proceed to Buſineſs with them, and give them Notice when to attend.</p>
               <p>This Afternoon arrived Six <hi>Tuſcarora Indians,</hi> who waited on the Governor, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him, that they were ſent to him by thoſe of their Nation, living at <hi>Onohoquage,</hi> on the Upper Waters of the <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> with a Letter; which, after the Ceremony of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eyes and Heart, by a String of Wampum, they delivered to him, and it follows in theſe Words.—</p>
               <p>

               <p>After the Governor had read the Letter, they delivered him a Belt of Wampum, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Sincerity of their Profeſſions contained in the ſaid Letter.</p>
               <p>They then delivered the Governor another Belt from the <hi>Nanticokes</hi> and <hi>Conoys,</hi> as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their joining with the <hi>Tuſcaroras</hi> in the ſame ſincere Profeſſions.</p>
               <p>The Governor acquainted them that he would take the Letter into Conſideration, and at a proper Time return them an Anſwer.</p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is now a great while ſince we have had the Pleaſure of meeting one another in Council, wherefore I take this Opportunity of condoling with you for the Loſſes you may have ſuſtained by the Death of any of your People, and with this String I gather up the Bones of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Brethren, and bury them decently, according to the Cuſtom of our Forefathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A String</hi> (460)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this String I diſperſe the dark Clouds, which for many Years have hung over our Heads, and prevented our ſeeing each other, that we may for the future meet and confer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as our Fathers uſed to do, and brighten and renew the Covenant Chain of Friendſhip, for our mutual Benefit and Advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A String</hi> (300)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Council-Chamber hath contracted much Duſt, for Want of Uſe for ſome Years paſt, and hath alſo been ſtained with Blood, I, with this String, ſweep it quite clean, and wipe all Blood from off the Seats, that we may ſit down and confer together, without ſeeing any Thing to interrupt us, or make us uneaſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A String</hi> (280)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having now wiped your Eyes, opened the Way to your Hearts, and cleanſed the Council Seats, I, by this Belt, take you by the Hand, and bid you heartily welcome, and aſſure you, that I am ready to do every Thing in my Power to ſtrengthen and preſerve that Brotherly Love and Friendſhip, which ſo long ſubſiſted between your Anceſtors and His Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Government.</p>
               <p>A Belt.</p>
               <p>The Governor then told them he had finiſhed what he had to ſay to them at preſent, and that if they were prepared to ſpeak to him at this Time, he was ready to hear them; if not, he would appoint another Time for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Beaver, <hi>the Chief of the</hi> Delawares, <hi>then ſpoke to the Governor as follows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We all rejoice to hear what you have ſaid to us, and are glad that you have cleanſed us, and have ſpoke to us in the Manner which our Forefathers uſed to do to one another. As we ſpeak different Languages, we ſhall be glad of an Opportunity of conſulting among ourſelves, and ſhall deliver what we have to ſay to you To-morrow Morning.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I HAVE heard what you ſaid to me Yeſterday, and am well pleaſed with it. You have cleanſed me, opened my Eyes, and cleaned my Ears in the ſame Manner as our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers uſed to do.

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When our Grandfathers uſed to meet our Brethren, they cleanſed each others Hearts, and took away all Grief and Sorrow out of them:—By this String I do likewiſe clean your Hearts, and remove all Sorrow and Grief from them, and ſtrengthen your Breath, that you may ſpeak more freely to your Brothers here before you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a great While ſince we ſaw one another; we here preſent are really very glad to ſee you and all our Brethren well.—It is about four Years ago ſince we firſt received any Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from you, and ever ſince we have been employed in carrying good News to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round, who were rejoiced to hear it from you. And we have been likewiſe ever ſince endeavouring to bring in your Fleſh and Blood, as you required it of us. Mr. <hi>Croghan,</hi> and the Commander at <hi>Fort-Pitt,</hi> know that we have delivered many of them, and now we bring a few more of them to you. There are ſome behind yet, and they meet with good Uſage, and live as we do, and chuſe to ſtay with us; but I hope they will come to you after ſome Time, becauſe you live better than we do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I heard you Yeſterday, and was much rejoiced to hear you, as were all your Brethren here preſent. You told me you had removed all the dark Clouds that hung over us. I am rejoiced that the dark Clouds are diſperſed, ſo that we can ſee one another clearly.</p>
               <p>By this Belt I do, on my Part, diſperſe the Clouds. Now, Brother, let us join heartily, and put our Hands together, to put away the Clouds.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould ſee the Clouds riſe again, let us join to remove them, and keep Peace toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that our Children and Grandchildren, when they meet, may rejoice to ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and live to great Ages in Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are rejoiced to ſee one another; all the dark Clouds are now ſcattered, and the Sun ſhines clear upon us, and all the Nations who are our Friends. We ſee plainly that good Road which our Grandfathers uſed, when they travelled to your Council Fire, to conſult about our Affairs, when we lived in Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will join with you to keep that Road open and good; I aſſure you it was never yet quite ſtopt up; we find our old Council Fire, which our Grandfathers made, is ſtill burning; now by this Belt I collect dry Wood to put to the Fire, and make it bigger, ſo that the Smoke may riſe to the Skies; when other Nations ſee it, they will know by the Light that I have been in Council with my Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beaver <hi>then got up, and holding a Belt in his Hand, ſaid,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Belt we received laſt Fall from Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> at <hi>Fort-Detroit,</hi> who then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that he had heard of the good Work of Peace in which we had been engaged with our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which Belt repreſents us, the <hi>Delawares,</hi> in the Middle, and the Weſtern Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> at one End, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at the other, Hand in Hand, together holding faſt the Chain of Friendſhip; and aſſured us, that if we held this Chain of Friendſhip faſt, our Children and Grandchildren ſhould grow up, and live to great Ages.—We were ſo pleaſed with this, that we put it into our Hearts, and have always kept it there till now.</p>
               <p>And now, Brother, you have heard from me what paſſed between Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> and me.—I aſſure you I will actually do what was deſired of me, and hold faſt this Chain of Friendſhip. I aſſure you I will always do my Part in keeping this Friendſhip firm, and the Nations to the Weſtward will do the ſame. I deſire all you, my Brethren, will be ſtrong, and join heartily in keeping this Friendſhip alive; which if you do, you and your Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children ſhall arrive at a great Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſire you will take Pity on thoſe of our Brothers that live or come amongſt you, and be kind to them. Our Brethren live among you, becauſe they love you. When any of our Brothers the <hi>Engliſh</hi> come amongſt us, we always take Pity on them, and give them Victuals, to make their Bodies ſtrong; and we deſire that you will do the ſame to ſuch of us as come amongſt you, or live with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have no more to ſay at preſent; I ſhall wait to hear what you have to ſay to us at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time. You deſired me to bring other Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> with me, and I have brought them a great Way, who alſo wait to hear what you have to ſay.</p>
               <p>The Governor then acquainted <hi>Beaver,</hi> that he was well pleaſed to hear what they had ſaid to him; and that he received it into his Heart, and ſhould take a proper Opportunity to give them an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The Governor roſe and went to the Place where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners ſat, and received them one by one, from the Hands of King <hi>Beaver,</hi> and here follow their Names.

               <p>FRIDAY, AUGUST 13, 1762. This Afternoon <hi>Tokahaion,</hi> and a Number of the <hi>Six Nation Indians</hi> coming to Town, about Fifteen of them waited on the Governor, at his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and <hi>Tokahaion</hi> ſpoke to the Governor as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were ſome Time ago invited by you, and our Brethren the <hi>Quakers</hi> of this Province, to come to this Treaty at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> with our Couſins the <hi>Delawares.</hi> Agreeable to this Invitation, we came down as far as <hi>Harris</hi>'s Ferry, where we heard that you intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Home To-morrow, which induced us to make all the Haſte we could to this Place, that we might have the Pleaſure of ſeeing you. On our Way one of our Brethren died, but our Hurry was ſo great that we threw his Body aſide, and did not ſo much as ſtay to bury him. We are juſt come to Town, and pay you this Viſit to take you by the Hand, and let you know we are glad to ſee you. We muſt requeſt of you to order your People to lock up all Rum, and not let our <hi>Indians</hi> have any, till the End of our Conferences.—He added, that they had ſeen the Cabbins which had been built to accommodate them, but that they were at ſo great a Diſtance from the Place where their Couſins the <hi>Delawares</hi> were lodged, that they could not conveniently diſcourſe with them; wherefore he deſired that others might be provided near to them To-morrow.</p>
               <p>The Governor took them by the Hand, and after bidding them welcome, told them that they were miſinformed reſpecting his deſigning to return Home To-morrow; that as he heard they were on their Way, he had waited ſome Days, in Expectation of their coming, and was now glad to ſee them; that he would do every Thing in his Power, during their Stay here, to render their Situation eaſy and agreeable to them, and would give ſtrict Orders that no Rum ſhould be ſold to them; that the Field where the <hi>Delawares</hi> were encamped, being too ſmall to accommodate them, he had pitched on a Place which he judged moſt convenient, where Cabbins had been built, by his Order, for their Reception, at a conſiderable Expence of Time and Money, which he hoped they would be well pleaſed with; but if, on Trial, they ſhould ſtill be diſſatisfied with that Situation, he would remove them where they thought moſt proper; and that when they had reſted themſelves, after the Fatigues of the long Journey they had come, he would ſpeak to them, and give them ſufficient Notice of the Time, that they might be prepared to meet him in Council.—They were refreſhed with a Draught of Beer, and then took their Leaves, and departed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Delawares, Shawaneſe, Twightwees, Wawachtanies, Tuſcaroras,</hi> and <hi>Kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apoes,</hi>

               <p>I return you Thanks for your Speeches of Yeſterday, which were very agreeable to me; and I ſhall now give you an Anſwer to ſuch Parts thereof as require one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I take Notice of what you ſaid Yeſterday, let me remind you of the ſtrict Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which was eſtabliſhed with your Forefathers, by our old Proprietor <hi>William Penn,</hi> on his firſt Arrival in this Country, and how happily it ſubſiſted between them and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, till the Troubles which unfortunately broke out ſome few Years ago, and ſtopt up the Road between us. The many Meſſages which we have ſince, from Time to Time, ſent you, by <hi>Frederick Poſt</hi> and <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and the great Pains we have taken to drive away the Evil Spirit, plainly ſhew how ſincerely we have been diſpoſed to renew that Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You acquainted me, that after receiving our firſt Meſſage about Place, which was about four Years ago, you made it known to all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations on this Side, and over the Lakes, who were glad to hear the good News; and as we deſired you to deliver up our Fleſh and Blood, you ſay that you have, from Time to Time, delivered up many at <hi>Fort-Pitt,</hi> to the Commanding Officer, and to Mr. <hi>Croghan,</hi> and that you now have brought in a few, which you delivered to me Yeſterday. You likewiſe ſay, you have yet others in your Poſſeſſion, and that ſome of them chuſe to live with you; but you made no Doubt of their coming to us ſome Time hence; as we live better than the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Priſoners that you have delivered at <hi>Fort-Pitt,</hi> as well as for thoſe you have now brought along with you, and delivered to me, I return you my hearty Thanks; but you muſt remember, that on re-eſtabliſhing and renewing the antient Chain of Friendſhip with us, you repeatedly engaged to deliver us all our Fleſh and Blood, which you have taken from us, by the Inſtigation of the Evil Spirit. On theſe Aſſurances and Engagements we have relied, and as we cannot enjoy the Bleſſings we expected from that Peace, till the Parents and Relations of thoſe Priſoners have them reſtored to them, I muſt inſiſt on your taking every Meaſure in your Power to deliver them up, agreeable to your Engagements, which will be the only Means of ſtrengthening and eſtabliſhing a laſting Peace, to us and our Children, yet unborn.</p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You Yeſterday, by this Belt, ſaid you would join with me in diſperſing the dark Clouds, which have for ſome Time hung over our Heads; and deſired I would join with you, in hearty Endeavours to prevent any more Clouds from riſing, or if they ſhould chance to riſe, from coming to an Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD, who made all Things, has given us Eyes to ſee, and Tongues to ſpeak to each other, freely and openly; and I aſſure you, if I ſhould ſee any little Clouds ariſe, at never ſo great a Diſtance, I will take every Meaſure in my Power to prevent their encreaſing, and communicate it to you forthwith; and if you do the ſame to me, at all Times, it will prevent any Clouds from gathering to an Head, ſo as to diſturb the public Peace and Tranquility, which have been lately ſo happily eſtabliſhed between us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It gave me great Satisfaction Yeſterday, to hear you declare your Intentions to keep open the Council Road between your Nation and us. As a ſmall Interruption on that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may be attended with dangerous Conſequences to us both, I heartily join with you in keeping the Road open, and perfectly clear from Obſtructions, for our mutual Uſe and Advantage.</p>
               <p>I likewiſe take it kind in you to heap up dry Wood on our Council Fire, and I, on my Part, ſhall ſtill add more Wood to it, that the Smoke thereof may be ſeen by the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> to the Sun-ſetting, that are in Friendſhip with His Majeſty's Subjects.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Yeſterday you ſhewed me a Belt, with the Figures of three Men in it, which you ſay you received from Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> laſt Fall, at the Conference he held with all the Weſtern Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> at <hi>Fort-Detroit,</hi> repeating what he ſaid to you on it; all which Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions there I am acquainted with, by Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> who, as His Majeſty's Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, did then renew the antient Covenant Chain of Friendſhip, in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all His Majeſty's Subjects, with all thoſe Weſtern Nations of <hi>Indians.</hi> You ſay further, that ſince you received that Covenant Belt, you laid it cloſe to your Heart; and, by this Belt, you aſſure me that you, and all the Weſtern Nations, are determined to adhere ſtrictly to that Treaty and Renewal of Friendſhip; and deſire me to be ſtrong, and hold it faſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt remember, that you then not only promiſed Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> to deliver up all our Fleſh and Blood, who were Priſoners in your ſeveral Towns and Countries; but that this Promiſe was an expreſs Condition of that Treaty, made between him and you. This Matter lies ſo near to my Heart, that I ſhould not act as your true and ſincere Friend, if I did not ſpeak with the greateſt Freedom and Plainneſs to you about it, and tell you again, that it is impoſſible we can look upon you as our Brethren, if you detain from as our Fleſh and Blood; we cannot ſleep quietly in our Beds, till we ſee them all; our very Dreams are diſturbed on their Account; we demand of you nothing more than the Right which God and Nature has given us.</p>

                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009412_0009_0F7404D736E70208"/>
If we had among us ever ſo few of your Children, would you think that any Profeſſions of Friendſhip we could make to you were ſincere, if we withheld them from you but for one Day? Your Brother <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> may remember, that at our firſt conſering with him, at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> we had then one of your People in Priſon, and he thought it ſo grievous a Thing, that he told us he could not ſpeak freely to us, and ſhould look upon what we ſaid as coming not from our Hearts, but from our Mouths only, until the ſaid Priſoner was reſtored to him; which was immediately done. Can you then delay doing us that Juſtice, which you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves expected and received from us! We do not well underſtand your Meaning, when you ſay, ſome of the Priſoners chuſe to live with you. If you intend it as a Reaſon for not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up, till they conſent to come, we muſt inform you, that we cannot admit of it. They were born Subjects of our Great King, and as ſuch, he has a Right to demand them. You have, it is true, by the Delivery of ſome of the Priſoners, performed your Agreement in Part; but as we know, and you acknowledge, there are a great many yet behind, we now inſiſt poſitively, that you do not fail, immediately on your Return, to collect every one that remains among you, and deliver them up to us. Relying therefore on your Honeſty, and that you will faithfully comply with an Engagement you have ſo ſolemnly made with us, I do, by this Belt, in Behalf of all His Majeſty's Subjects of this Province, lay Hold of that Covenant Belt, and will keep it faſt, that we, our Children, and Grandchildren, may long enjoy the Bleſſings of Peace, and live together as Brethren, tilt they are old Men.</p>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not chuſe to ſpeak now myſelf, as I do not ſpeak clearly and diſtinctly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall appoint this <hi>Indian,</hi> named <hi>Cleghiccon</hi> (in <hi>Engliſh, Simon</hi>) to ſpeak for me.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Day before Yeſterday you ſpoke to me, and I have heard you, and we your Brethren, the Weſtern <hi>Indians,</hi> have all been conſulting about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now inform you, in Behalf of my Grandchildren, the <hi>Tawwas,</hi> they have none of your Fleſh and Blood left in their Towns, for they have delivered them all up to you: Likewiſe in Behalf of my Grandchildren, the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> they have delivered them all up alſo, and have none left; Alſo on Behalf of the <hi>Wawaghtanies,</hi> they have none of your Priſoners, for they have alſo delivered them all up: And laſtly, on Behalf of another Nation, called the <hi>Kickapoes,</hi> they ſay they never had any Priſoners.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Day before Yeſterday I heard what you ſaid, and I aſſure you I am very well pleaſed with it. From what you have ſaid, I ſuppoſe this Matter of the Priſoners to be the principal Buſineſs for which you invited us here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have told you I left ſome of your Fleſh and Blood where I came from, and I aſſure you I look upon them as my own Fleſh and Blood, and I aſſure you again, you ſhall ſee them ſome Time hence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am very well pleaſed that you have demanded them now, and aſſure you, you ſhall have every one of them that remain with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may remember that you told me, we ſhould deliver all the Priſoners at <hi>Pittſburgh,</hi> and I ſhall be glad you would now ſhew to me the Perſons here whom you ſhall appoint to receive thoſe our Friends, and we ſhall be glad of it.</p>

You ſpoke to me in Behalf of your Grandchildren, the <hi>Tawwas, Twightwees, Wawaghta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and <hi>Kickapoes,</hi> acquainting me that they had reſpectively delivered up all our People, who were Priſoners in their Towns during the War</p>

               </p>
               <p>You told us that our demanding the Priſoners at this Time, and in the Manner we have done it, was very agreeable to you; and you ſuppoſed it was the principal Buſineſs for which we invited you here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You judge right, in thinking that the Affair of our Priſoners was a principal Reaſon of our inviting you here; it really was ſo, for we had it very much at Heart.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon of our deſiring to ſee you was, that we might renew our antient Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and brighten and ſtrengthen the Covenant Chain, which ſo long and happily ſubſiſted between our Anceſtors. This laſt has now been done to our mutual Satisfaction, and it has given me, and all the good People preſent, the higheſt Pleaſure to hear from your own Mouths that, agreeable to our Demand, you are determined to deliver up all the Priſoners that remain in your Towns, to ſuch Perſons as I ſhall appoint to receive them, at <hi>Pittſburgh.</hi>

               <p>I have not yet concluded upon the Perſons to be ſent to <hi>Pittſburgh,</hi> for that Purpoſe, but you may be aſſured I ſhall very ſoon; who, when they come, will bring with them a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and full Credentials from me; by which you will know, that they are deputed by me to receive the Priſoners from you. I propoſe they ſhall be at <hi>Pittſburgh</hi> the Second Day of <hi>October</hi> next, by which Time I expect you will have collected all of them, and brought them to that Place.</p>

               <p>Trade is a Buſineſs of Importance, and what I intended to mention to you all at this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. You know that, for ſome Years paſt, this Government hath kept a great Store at <hi>Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> in order to ſupply you with Goods, in Exchange for your Skins and Furs, near your own Homes. Good Men have been appointed to regulate the Prices of our Goods, and your Skins, and great Care has been taken that you ſhould not be cheated, or impoſed upon, by thoſe who have, from Time to Time, kept the Provincial Store; but I am ſorry to inform you, that the Charges of carrying our Goods, and bringing back your Skins, ſo many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles, on Horſeback, are ſo high, that it is a great Diſcouragement to that Trade, and we loſe a great Deal of Money by it every Year, inſomuch that I ſear it will drop, unleſs your Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> will conſent to let us go, with our Canoes, up the Weſt Branch of <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> as far as we can, and build a few Store-houſes on the Banks of that River, to ſecure our Goods in, as we paſs and re-paſs. This will cut off a long Land Carriage, and may be a Means of encouraging the Continuance of the Trade with you, and enabling our People to ſell their Goods to you at a reaſonable Rate.—We intend to ſpeak to your Uncles on this Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now finiſhed my Anſwers to your ſeveral Speeches, but I have ſtill ſomething parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to ſay to <hi>Beaver,</hi> and our Brethren of the <hi>Delaware</hi> Nation, living at <hi>Allegheny,</hi> and deſire you will attend to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren the</hi> Delawares,</p>
               <p>I take this Opportunity to inform you, that about Six Years ago your Brother <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> made a Complaint againſt the Proprietaries, wherein he charged them with defrauding the <hi>Delawares</hi> of a Tract of Land, lying on the River <hi>Delaware,</hi> between <hi>Tohiccon-Creck</hi> and the <hi>Kittatinny Hills.</hi> He alledged, that this Complaint was not made by him, on his own Account, but on Behalf of the Owners of the Land, many of whom, he ſaid, lived at <hi>Allegheny.</hi> This Diſpute, Brethren, was, by mutual Conſent, refered to our Great King GEORGE, who ordered Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> to enquire fully into the Matter, and make his Report to Him, that Juſtice might be done you, if you had been wronged. Accordingly Sir <hi>William,</hi> about two Months ago, came to <hi>Eaſton,</hi> where, on the Proprietaries Commiſſioners producing and reading ſundry Writings and Papers, <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> was convinced of his Error, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he had been miſtaken with Regard to the Charge of Forgery made againſt the Proprietaries, having been miſinformed by his Anceſtors, and deſired that all further Diſputes about Land ſhould be buried under Ground, and never heard of more; offering that ſuch of the <hi>Indians</hi> as were then preſent ſhould ſign a Releaſe for the Land in Queſtion, and that he would endeavour to perſuade the reſt of his Brethren who were concerned to do the ſame at this Treaty at <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> Now, Brethren of <hi>Allegheny,</hi> as we are Face to Face, be plain, and tell whether you are ſatisfied with, and approve of, what was done at the laſt Treaty at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> and whether you lay any Claim to thoſe Lands, that there may be no Room left for any future Diſpute about it among our Children.</p>

               <p>As to my own Part, I know nothing about the Lands upon the River <hi>Delaware;</hi> but ſince you requeſt it, I will firſt ſpeak to my own People about it.</p>

               <p>I muſt acknowledge I know nothing about the Lands upon the <hi>Delaware,</hi> and I have no Concern with Lands upon that River. We know nothing of the <hi>Delawares</hi> Claim to them. I have no Claim myſelf, nor any of my People. I ſuppoſe there may be ſome Spots or Pieces of Land, in ſome Parts of the Province, that the <hi>Delawares</hi> claim; but neither I nor any of my People know any Thing of them. As to what you and our Brother <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> have done, if you are both pleaſed, I am pleaſed with it. As to my Part, I want to ſay nothing about Land Affairs; what I have at Heart, and what I came down about, is to confirm our Friendſhip, and make a laſting Peace, ſo as our Children and Grandchildren may live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in everlaſting Peace, after we are dead.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I am very much pleaſed with what you have ſaid; you ſpeak like an honeſt Man, and I hope that the Friendſhip that has been made between us and our Brethren, the <hi>Delawares,</hi> will remain firm, as long as the Sun ſhines, and the Rivers run.</p>

               <p>Your Brothers, the Proprietaries, about three Years ago, directed me, as ſoon as <hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung</hi>'s Complaint againſt them was determined, and Juſtice done to their Characters, to make their old Friends, the <hi>Delawares,</hi> a Preſent, in their Name, to ſupply your Waiſts, and as a Mark of their Affection and Regard for you, and to convince you that they had no ill Will in their Hearts againſt you, but looked upon you as formerly to be their good Friends and Brothers. Now as that Diſpute is happily at an End, I am at Liberty to follow their Directions, and ſhall accordingly order a Preſent of Goods to be delivered to you from the Proprietaries.</p>

               <p>We are all very glad to ſee you, and your Brethren that are with you, in Health. All die <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and our Nephews, have had interpreted to them all that you ſaid, and they are pleaſed with it, and very glad to ſee you, and that it has pleaſed the Great GOD, who has all Power in his Hands, to ſuffer us to come together, to ſpeak to one another freely.</p>

               <p>It is now three Years ſince you firſt demanded of us your Fleſh and Blood. Now hear me, as to what I and all our Nations and our Allies, that live as far as the Sun-ſetting, have done.</p>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I aſſure you, in Behalf of all of us preſent, and the Weſtern <hi>Indians,</hi> of whom you have been demanding your Fleſh and Blood, that I have them here, and that it is not my Fault, neither can I ſay our Maker has been the Cauſe, but the <hi>French</hi> have been the Cauſe why you have not had them ſooner.</p>
               <p>Then directing his Diſcourſe to his Brothers and Couſins, the <hi>Delawares,</hi> he proceeded, and ſaid,</p>
               <p>I never had Occaſion to go to War with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; the People I had Occaſion to go to War with live to the Southward; it has been ſo from all Ages, and we have always gone to War againſt the Southern <hi>Indians;</hi> I never had Cauſe to go to War with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> this was owing to the Evil Spirit, the Devil. When I uſed to go to War with the Southern <hi>Indians,</hi> and brought Priſoners Home, I thought they were mine, and that no Body had any Right to meddle with them. Now ſince I joined with you, I went to War again, and I brought <hi>French</hi> People Home with me, as Priſoners, and you took them from me; this makes me think it was owing to the Evil Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſire you to be ſtrong. I have heard you often ſay, you would be very glad if I would bring you the Captives, and you would make me Satisfaction, becauſe you know I am not as you are; I am of a quite different Nature from you; ſometimes I think you are not in Earneſt with me, in telling me you will make me Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have heard you, and ſo have all my Brothers and Couſins to the Weſtward heard what you have ſaid about giving us Satisfaction; your Words ſeem to be very ſweet to us. You told us if we did ſo and ſo, you would do ſo with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know we are different Nations, and have different Ways. We could not immediately perform what you required of us, in returning your Fleſh and Blood, becauſe every one of theſe Nations have different Ways; that is the Reaſon why we could not ſo ſoon perform it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am ſorry it is ſo difficult for us to underſtand each other: If we could underſtand one another, we would put one another in Mind of the Friendſhip that ſubſiſted between us and our Forefathers; but as we do not eaſily underſtand one another, we are obliged to deliver you the Subſtance in ſhort of what we have to ſay, which makes it tedious.—(Meaning that they are obliged to interpret in two or three Languages, before it is told to us.)</p>

               <p>You have often told me, if I would bring your Fleſh and Blood you would be very glad, and would give ſuch Priſoners Liberty to return with them, if they did not incline to ſtay with you, and to go where they pleaſed.</p>

                  <hi>Thomas King</hi> being aſked, who it was that promiſed the Priſoners ſhould be left to their Choice, to return with them, or to go where they pleaſed? He anſwered, the Governor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> and there were two Governors there at that Time.—(Meaning Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Denny,</hi> and Governor <hi>Bernard,</hi> of <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi>)</p>

               <p>You have been requiring your Fleſh and Blood theſe three Years; I promiſe you I will give you them, and now I will deliver all I have brought.</p>

               <p>I am ſorry we cannot ſpeak to one another any faſter, becauſe we cannot underſtand one another without ſo many Interpreters, and this takes up much Time, ſo that we muſt be ſlow in telling our Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>You have told us, of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> that we muſt aſſiſt you to ſee your Fleſh and Blood. If we aſſiſt you, you ſay you ſhall ſee your Fleſh and Blood.</p>

               <p>We have done what we can, and that is the Reaſon why you ſee ſo many of your Fleſh and Blood; ſome <hi>Indians</hi> part with them with Reluctance, and want to keep them longer;

                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>You have often told us, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> that we ſhould aſſiſt in getting your Fleſh and Blood. I have done my Endeavour, and taken great Pains: I have got a great many of them, though at firſt with great Diffently: When I brought them by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forts, they took them away from me; all along from <hi>Oſwego</hi> to the Carrying Place, and ſo to <hi>Niagara,</hi> till I got to <hi>Shamokin,</hi> they got them all from me, and I believe they have made Servants of them; This is the Reaſon why I brought ſo few of them: No Wonder they are ſo loath to come, when you make Servants of them. You know that you have told me that I ſhould aſſiſt you, you cannot deny it: By and by you will ſay, I never told you to aſſiſt me, and that I tell Lies when I ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>You told me you would be very glad if I would bring you your Fleſh and Blood, and that you were able to make me Satisfaction for them: You ſaid you had Rooms full of Goods, and that we ſhould never want any Thing while you have Goods: You told me, we ſhall have a Recompence for our Trouble in bringing them down. I aſſure you, I have brought all your Fleſh and Blood that I could get at this Time; there are ſome behind yet, but they belong to ſuch People as are gone to War againſt the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> and we could not take them without their Leave, and when they return from War, we will certainly bring them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>I have brought Fourteen of your Fleſh and Blood, that is all I could get this Time; for as I told you, your People in the Forts have got them all away from me, they have ſtole them, or perſuaded them to run away from me, and have hid them in the Buſhes. As I told you, there are few left that belong to thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that are gone to War againſt the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> with whom we have been at War from all Ages, and they are at War with you; I aſſure you when they return, we will bring them all to you. You uſed to tell me, I always came una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares upon you, when I did come; you certainly knew that I was coming ever ſince laſt Spring, and you might have got every Thing ready for me. There is one Captive at the Camp that ſays he will not come, he ſays the Governor has ſeen him, and talked with him at the Camp; all the reſt are here.</p>

               <p>It may be there are two Governors of you; your Meſſages and your Words do not agree together; when I repeat what you have ſaid to me, it ſeems diſagreeable to you.</p>
               <p>Here the Governor aſked what he meant by two Governors, and deſired him to explain himſelf, for he could not underſtand him.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You want to know what my Meaning is, by ſaying there are two Governors. In every Country there is always one Head Governor, but here are two Governors. It will not do for me to point out People, for you muſt certainly know there is more than one Governor. I hear one ſay ſuch a Thing, and another ſay ſuch a Thing; but I will not point out any Body, leſt you ſhould differ. You will hear of it hereafter. I heard that both Governors came from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> but perhaps I may be miſinformed.</p>
               <p>The Governor deſired to know, whether any Meſſages had been delivered to them in their own Country, and by whom, and what the Meſſages were. He inſiſted on their giving him a plain Anſwer.</p>
               <p>They anſwered, that the <hi>Cayugas,</hi> who were at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in the Spring, brought the Meſſages to them; but do not pretend that they were delivered in the Governor's Name, but they might have brought what paſſed only in private Converſation.</p>

               <p>As I have now brought your Fleſh and Blood, I would have you to take Care of them, and keep them faſt. I brought a Girl to <hi>

               <p>I have brought an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoner, who I love as my own Wife: I have a young Child by her. You know it is very hard for a Man to part with his Wife. I have delivered her, therefore take Care of her, and keep her ſafe, that ſhe dont make her Eſcape.</p>

               <p>Our Grandfathers uſed to tell us, we ſhould keep faſt Hold of the Chain of Friendſhip, and always adviſed us to obſerve it; but now, in latter Days, as ſoon as I came acroſs the Hatchet, I got Hold of it, and really I did not know what I was about, and ſtuck it into your Heads. By this Belt, I take the Hatchet out of your Head; it belongs to you and the <hi>French;</hi> you are both of one Colour. It has been the Fault of the <hi>French</hi> that we ſtruck you, and therefore we take the Hatchet out of your Head.</p>

               <p>There is a large Pine Tree in the <hi>Oneida</hi> Country, which I take and pull up by the Roots, and then it makes a great Hole; when I look down the Hole, I ſee a great River, running very ſtrong at the Bottom. By this Belt I gather all your Bones, wherever I can find them, and bury them in that Hole, and the Hatchet with them; when I put them down the Hole, they fall into that ſtrong Stream, and float down it, I know not where. I ſtick that Pine Tree down again in the ſame Hole, and then no Body can diſcover that there has been a Hole; ſo that neither you nor I, nor our nor your Grandchildren, ſhall ever be able to know where your Bones are laid. This is the Cuſtom of our Forefathers, that when any Difference aroſe between them and their Brethren, they buried it in this Manner.</p>

               <p>It was we of the <hi>Mohocks, Oneidas, Senecas, Onondagoes, Cayugas,</hi> and <hi>Tuſcararas,</hi> that firſt brought about the good Work of Peace.—He added, that the <hi>Mohocks</hi> and <hi>Oneidas</hi> were the eldeſt of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and both of a Height.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>I will acquaint you further, that I have more Brothers to the Weſtward, and that we are all Brothers down as far as to the Sun-ſet; my Friends are ſo many, that I cannot tell hove many they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>I will let you know, that though the <hi>Mohocks</hi> are the eldeſt, yet they are the furtheſt off to the Eaſtward: When they hear any Thing, they paſs through the <hi>Oneidas</hi> to the <hi>Onondagoes,</hi> where the Council Fire burns: Likewiſe, when the <hi>Senecas</hi> hear any Thing, they come to the <hi>Cayugas,</hi> becauſe they are next to the <hi>Onondagoe</hi> Council; ſo that whenever they hear any Thing to the Eaſt or Weſt, it is carried to the <hi>Onondagoe</hi> Council. (Meaning, that when you ſhall ſend any Meſſages to the <hi>Onondagoe</hi> Council, they muſt be ſent either to the <hi>Senecas</hi> or <hi>Mohocks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>I will mention our old Friendſhip; I will make it new again; I will brighten up our old Chain of Friendſhip. Our Grandfathers uſed to tell one another they had one Heart, and
<pb n="19"
                      facs="unknown:009412_0018_0F7404E0D8C98CF0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>here it is; they both had Hold of it: They uſed to tell one another they had one Head, here it is. I tell you the ſame; you and we have one Head, and one Heart. We Fourteen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tell you ſo.</p>
               <p>They delivered a Belt of Nine Rows, repreſenting the Figure of two Men in the Middle, with a Heart between them, and Six Diamonds on each Side; one of the Men repreſents the <hi>Indians,</hi> the other the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>Now we have renewed our old Friendſhip; I am a little afraid your Fire is almoſt out, it is not good; now I will take all that bad Fire away, and kindle it again, and make a good Fire of it; I will take good dry Wood, and kindle up the Fire afreſh that our Grandfathers have made, and ſo make the Smoke riſe up ſo very high, that all diſtant Nations ſhall ſee it, and thereby know that there is a Council Fire here. There was a good Fire at <hi>Eaſton;</hi> that was really a good Fire, for when I came to that good <hi>Eaſton</hi> Fire, I could have my Belly full of Victuals, and Plenty of Drink; but now I come here, I have little to eat; I am ſure I have no other Drink than dirty Water, which almoſt choaks me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt of Six Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>What we have hitherto ſaid, concerning Peace, has been concluded upon by our old Counſellors. We alſo deſired our chief Warriors to be ſtrong, and aſſiſt the old Counſellors; and deſired, if any Thing ſhould be wanting in the old Counſellors, they would aſſiſt them in it, in order that our Friendſhip may be laſting; for the Counſellors can do nothing, unleſs the Warriors ſhould give their Conſent to it. We Fourteen Nations tell you ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt with Seven Rows, with Two Diamonds in it, repreſenting the Counſellors and Warriors, united in Council together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>Our Friendſhip ſeems to go on very kindly. I will tell you one Thing, you are always longing after my Land, from the Eaſt to the Weſt; you ſeem to be longing after it. Now I deſire you will not covet it any more; you will ſerve me as you have done our Couſins, the <hi>Delawares;</hi> you have got all their Land from them; all the Land hereabouts belonged to them once, and you have got it all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>I deſire you to go no further than <hi>Nixhiſaqua</hi> (or <hi>Mohenoy</hi>) I deſire you will ſettle no higher up, for if you keep preſſing on me, you will puſh me out, for I ſhall have no Place to live on, nor hunt in, neither for me nor my Grandchildren; ſo I deſire you will preſs no further. I deſire another Thing, that you will not take it from me by Force: If you take this Land by Force, it will never go well with either of us. You may remember that GOD gave us this Land, and you ſome other; yet I have parted with ſome of it to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt of Six Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>You have deſired me to aſſiſt you, in order to bring in your Fleſh and Blood, which now you ſee I have done. You uſed to tell me, if I would bring in your Fleſh and Blood, or aſſiſt you therein, you would ſatisfy thoſe who brought them in theſe are mighty pleaſing Words to me, and I hope you will do ſo. Some of our Warriors who are here have no Guns, and if you will beſtow any on them, I deſire they may be good. You are daily making Riſles; I do not know what you do with them. When you gave me any Guns, you gave me yellow-ſtocked ones, that are worth nothing. I have aſked you now four Times. At <hi>Eaſton</hi> you gave me only Gun-Locks: What think you could I do with them, without Stocks and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels? I make no Guns. After I got the Gun-Locks, I joined myſelf with General <hi>Forbes,</hi> and went to War with him, as you ordered me, againſt the <hi>French;</hi> and as ſoon as I had done it, you ſtill gave me only Gun-locks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Bunch of Ten Strings, moſtly black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed what I had to ſay to you, I am now going to ſpeak to my Couſins. Pleaſe to hearken to what I ſhall ſay to them.</p>
               <p>Then directing his Diſcourſe to the <hi>Delawares,</hi> he ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Couſins,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could hardly get along. I heard ſuch frightful News, that indeed I could not get along, if I had not had good Courage. <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> before I ſat off from Home, I heard you ſhould ſay, you would poiſon us all, ſo that we ſhould not hold this Treaty. Thinks I to myſelf, I will come nevertheleſs; if I die, it will be well; I can die but once; ſo then I came along as far as <hi>Wyoming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Couſins,</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I came there, <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> began to make his Complaints that he had no Fire, ſo ſays I, Couſin, there is certainly ſome Fire, for I made one here for the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:009412_0019_0F7404E188A10F88"/>
                  <hi>(Cacawaſheca)</hi> and I made another Fire at <hi>Shamokin,</hi> for <hi>Alammapis;</hi> another Fire I made at <hi>Wighalouſin;</hi> another Fire I made at <hi>Diahoga.</hi> All thoſe Fires are there yet. The Fire at <hi>Wighalouſin</hi> is a good Fire, for I heard no bad Stories there; that Fire at <hi>Shamokin</hi> is not yet out; if any Body ſtirs it, it will ſoon blaze. I made the Fire at <hi>Wyoming</hi> for the <hi>Shawaneſe;</hi> perhaps they will ſtill return to that Place. Then I came along as far as <hi>Harris</hi>'s Ferry; there I heard another Piece of bad News from <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> who ſaid he had got a Sort of Poiſon that will give the <hi>Indians</hi> the Bloody Flux, and as ſoon as they come, he would give it to them, that they might get the Flux, and die along the Road as they go. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe Diſcouragements, I came along, and got here. I now ſuſpect there is a Bag of Poiſon ſomewhere about this Camp, that will give us the Flux as we go Home; and I think it will be great Shame, if it ſhould be ſo, becauſe our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brethren ſent for us; and if any of us ſhould die, it will appear to them as if they had loſt ſo many of their own People, becauſe it was they that ſent for us.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> I muſt teach you better; I will correct you; you muſt not talk of ſuch a Thing, for if any of us die, it will be ſaid <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> was the Cauſe of it; ſo you ſhould not ſay ſuch Things. By this Belt I make a Fire for <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> at <hi>Wyoming;</hi> I tell him to ſit there by the Fire Side, and watch that Fire; but I dont give it to him, for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brethren caſt an Eye upon that Land; therefore I ſay to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> watch that Fire, and if any White People come there, tell them to go away, for that Land belongs to your Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations.</hi> The <hi>Six Nations</hi> want to keep up that Fire, that they may hear from their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The Belt was given to <hi>Tipiſcohan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then turning to the Governor, be ſaid,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is all I have to ſay at preſent, but I have more in my Heart, which I cannot ſpeak now, having ſtaid ſo long that I am quite fatigued.</p>
               <p>The Governor then acquainted <hi>Thomas King,</hi> that he had been attentive to all he ſaid, and that he thanked him for it, and when he had conſidered of it, would at a proper Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him an Anſwer; but told him, that he had not yet delivered him the Priſoners, and as this was in improper Place, he deſired a few <hi>Indians</hi> would take them to the Court-Houſe, where he would receive them.</p>
               <p>The Conference then broke up, and the Governor, his Council, and the Commiſſioners, went with ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Chiefs to the Court-Houſe, to receive the Priſoners; where being come, the Governor acquainted <hi>Thomas King,</hi> that he was now ready to receive the Priſoners from him, and that they need not be under any Apprehenſions of being uſed ill, for that he would be kind to them, and treat them like Children, and reſtore them to their Parents and Relations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then they delivered to the Governor the Priſoners, as follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elizabeth Williams,</hi> a young Woman, delivered by <hi>Muſſauſe,</hi> a <hi>Munſey Indian; Henry Williams,</hi> about Eighteen Years of Age, Brother to <hi>Elizabeth Williams,</hi> delivered by <hi>Conoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hocheratoquin,</hi> a <hi>Munſey; Peggy Dougherty,</hi> delivered by <hi>Eckgohſon,</hi> a <hi>Munſey; Mary Tidd,</hi> and her Child, taken near <hi>Samuel Depui</hi>'s, by <hi>Eckgohſon; Abigail Evan,</hi> and her Child, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Stony-Creek,</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> by <hi>Cowachſora,</hi> a <hi>Seneca.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Beaver,</p>
               <p>I told you, a few Days ſince, of the Diſputes that had happened between your Brothers, the Proprietaries, and <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> about Land; and that I had their Orders, as ſoon as that Diſpute ſhould be ended, and the Proprietaries Characters cleared, to make the <hi>Delaware Indians</hi> a Preſent of conſiderable Value, as a Mark of their Affection to their old Friends. To which Preſent from the Proprietaries, the good People of this Province have been pleaſed to make an Addition, of equal Value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brothers,</hi> Teedyuſcung <hi>and</hi> Beaver,</p>
               <p>As that Diſpute is now happily ſettled, I do (in Conſequence of the Proprietaries Orders, and upon what was agreed upon at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> upon that Subject, between me and your Friends, the People of this Province) make you a Preſent of the Goods and Money now lying before you, to be equally divided between you, as a Proof of the Regard, both of the Proprietaries and People, for their old Friends, the <hi>Delaware</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Beaver,</p>
               <p>As this is the firſt Time we have ſeen you, and our Friends from the Weſtward, ſince the late Diſturbances; and as ſome of them have been at Expence in collecting and bringing down our Fleſh and Blood, which they have now delivered to us, I, and your Friends of this Province, have thought fit to make you this further Preſent, to teſtify the Pleaſure we have in ſeeing you, after ſo long an Abſence, and our Thankfulneſs for your having reſtored the Priſoners.—As you know better than we, in what Manner to divide the Preſent now made you, we deſire you will do it amongſt thoſe who come with you, in the moſt juſt and equitable Manner, paying a particular Regard to thoſe who have now, or at any other Time, been at Trouble and Expence in collecting and reſtoring our Fleſh and Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Teedyuſcung,</p>
               <p>We have had frequent Opportunities of ſhaking you by the Hand, ſince the War, and you, upon many Occaſions, received the ſtrongeſt Proofs of our Reconciliation and Friendſhip for you. Nevertheleſs, as we obſerve that a greater Number than common of your Friends are come down with you, in order to enable you to ſhew your Kindneſs to them, we think fit to make you this additional Preſent.</p>
               <p>And now, Brothers, I heartily wiſh the Peace and Friendſhip, which have been renewed betwixt us at this Treaty, may continue and grow ſtronger, as long as the Sun ſhall ſhine, or the Rivers run; to which you may be aſſured we, on our Parts, ſhall contribute to the utmoſt of our Power, as we doubt not you will alſo on yours.</p>
               <p>After the Governor had finiſhed his Speeches to <hi>Beaver</hi> and <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> the latter roſe up, and addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Beaver,</hi> deſired him to take Notice, that he now delivered up all his Right and Claim to the Lands on the River <hi>Delaware,</hi> that have been in Diſpute between him and the Proprietaries of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> and that he now, as he <hi>(Beaver)</hi> ſaw, received
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009412_0021_0F7404E279038520"/>this Money and Goods from his Brethren the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> He further deſired <hi>Beaver</hi> to acquaint all the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Allegheny,</hi> that the <hi>Delaware</hi> Nation have now no Right or Claim to any of the Lands on the Waters of the River <hi>Delaware,</hi> that have been in Diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then turning to the Governor, ſaid to him,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Brother Governor, our Children and Grandchildren ſhall never be able to ſay here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that they have any Right or Claim to the Lands that have been in Diſpute upon that River.</p>
               <p>The Governor, directing his Diſcourſe to <hi>Beaver</hi> and <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> told them, that as they had now received a conſiderable Sum of Money, he cautioned them againſt giving too much of it to their young Men, who, inſtead of laying it out in Things neceſſary and uſeful, might be tempted to debauch themſelves with ſtrong Liquors, which might occaſion them to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and do Miſchief, not only to one another, but alſo to their Brethren, the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which might endanger the Chain of Friendſhip betwixt them and us, and would be a very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Return for all the Kindneſs we had ſhewn them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which they both anſwered,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they were obliged to the Governor for his Advice, in which they thought he had their Good at Heart, and promiſed to follow it, and heartily thanked him for it.</p>
               <p>The Governor then delivered to <hi>Beaver</hi> and <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> reſpectively, <hi>Two Hundred Pounds,</hi> in milled Dollars, and the Value of <hi>Four Hundred Pounds</hi> in Goods, to be equally divided between them. He further preſented to <hi>Beaver,</hi> and thoſe who came with him from the <hi>Ohio,</hi> the Value of <hi>Four Hundred Pounds</hi> in Goods; and the Value of <hi>Two Hundred Pounds</hi> in Goods to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and his Friends and People. And after taking them both by the Hand he departed, and the Conference ended.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>You likewiſe aſked me to let you build a Fort there, to defend my Land, and to defend yourſelf; you told me, that you did not deſire any greater Quantity of my Land than what the Fort took up. I granted you Liberty to build a Fort, becauſe you told me it was the Great King GEORGE deſired you might build one on my Land; and I endeavoured to aſſiſt you. You alſo told me, as ſoon as ever the Peace was concluded you would go away; or that at any Time when I ſhould tell you to go away, you would go away, and that I might do what I would with the Fort.</p>

               <p>Now all the different Tribes of us preſent, deſire that you will call your Soldiers away from <hi>Shamokin;</hi> for we have concluded a Peace, and are as one Brother, having one Head and one Heart.</p>
               <p>If you take away your Soldiers, we deſire you would keep your Trading Houſe there, and have ſome honeſt Man in it, becauſe our Couſins follow their Hunting there, and will want a Trade. This is the Way for us to live peaceably together.</p>

               <p>I muſt tell you again, theſe Soldiers muſt go away from <hi>Shamokin</hi> Fort; I deſire it, and let there be only Traders live there; you know who are the honeſt People; we deſire that

This will be the Way for us to live peaceably together; but for you to keep Soldiers there, is not the Way to live peaceable. Your Soldiers are very often unruly, and our Warriors are unruly, and when ſuch get together they do not agree. For as you have now made Peace with all our Nations, there is no Occaſion for Soldiers to live there any longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>We, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> have all conſulted, and concluded on this Matter of your removing the Soldiers from <hi>Shamokin;</hi> for you know we go to War with the Southern <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Cherokees;</hi> we have been at War with them ever ſince we were created, and the Place where the <hi>Shamokin</hi> Fort ſtands is right in our Warriors Path, and you know that Warriors are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an unruly People. For this Reaſon we deſire you to take away your Soldiers, and place ſome honeſt Man there, that he may ſupply our Warriors with Ammunition, and any other Neceſſaries that they may want, when they go to War againſt the <hi>Cherokees.</hi> We muſt preſs you to take away your Soldiers from <hi>Shamokin,</hi> as our Warriors are unruly. You have planted Corn there, and if our Warriors come there, they may cut ſome of your Corn-ſtalks, and then you will be angry. The Fort you have there does not now do any Good, for you have many other Forts all around you; this one therefore can be of no Uſe to you; it ſtands as it were at your own Doors.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We deſire that the preſent Store-keepers at <hi>Shamokin</hi> may be removed, and honeſt Men placed there in their Room; for our Hunters, who have been down there, complain that when <hi>Indians</hi> come there, and want Proviſions and Goods, they find the Store ſometimes ſhut up, and they cannot be ſupplied with what they want.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
               <p>For my Part, I think <hi>John Harris</hi> is the moſt ſuitable Man to keep Store; for he lives right in the Road where our Warriors paſs, and he is very well known by all of us in our Nation; as his Father was before him; we all know him. If you chuſe <hi>John Harris,</hi> we deſire you will order him to keep Proviſions and Cloaths, to give to our People, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come there naked; and likewiſe Ammunition for our Warriors, for that is their Path. We deſire you may have no Trading Houſes higher up the <hi>Saſquehannah</hi> than <hi>Shamokin;</hi> let the <hi>Indians</hi> come there, or to <hi>John Harris</hi>'s; if they want to trade, let them come down to theſe Trading Houſes. We alſo deſire you will ſend your Meſſages to <hi>John Harris</hi>'s, ſo that we may hear from one another, becauſe where he lives the Road ſeems to divide, and ſpread, and it goes to many Places. And we further deſire you will give him a Commiſſion for theſe Things, in Writing.</p>

               <p>I have now mentioned two Places for you to keep Store Houſes at, <hi>Shamokin</hi> and <hi>John Harris</hi>'s; but perhaps they will ſell at different Prices, and if we have a Mind to have Goods cheapeſt, we may go to <hi>John Harris</hi>'s. We therefore deſire you will let us know, what Prices you ſet upon your Goods.</p>

We deſire you will appoint him to keep Store at <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> becauſe that is alſo in our Warriors Path. We deſire likewiſe, that there may be a Black-ſmith and Gun-ſmith, becauſe my Couſins will be there a hunting, and will want their Things mended.

               <p>I will alſo acquaint you of another Trading Place, which is the Place they call <hi>Patowmack,</hi> in <hi>Maryland.</hi> One <hi>Dantel Creſſap</hi> has ſent me Word, by many Warriors, this Spring, and he tells me, that if the Governor would order him to keep a Store there, he would provide every Thing for the Warriors; for his Father uſed-to maintain all the <hi>Indian</hi> Warriors that paſſed and re-paſſed that Way. He likewiſe tells me, if the Governor would let him know what he thould do, and if he ſhould be allowed to do this, he would provide for the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. We now deſire, that he may be the Perſon appointed to receive Meſſages, and that you would acquaint the Governor of <hi>Maryland</hi> with this, that the Warriors may paſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs that Way, without any Moleſtation.</p>

               <p>We deſire you to acquaint the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> that we may paſs and re-paſs through his Province, when we go to War with the <hi>Cherokees;</hi> for our Warriors Road is ſtopped up in many Places; <hi>Engliſh</hi> People have ſettled on it. And now we deſire that a Road may be opened, that we may paſs ſafely. We deſire nothing but Love and Friendſhip with our Brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as we paſs through. We deſire you will ſend a Letter, with this Belt, to the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> as from us, as ſoon as poſſible; for I do not know how ſoon my People may go that Way; our Warriors have already the Hatchet in their Hands, and perhaps they may go there before your Letter gets there; for which Reaſon I deſire you will make Haſte in this Buſineſs.</p>

               <p>We now deſire you to be ſtrong, and that you will give us Powder; I do not think that you will refuſe to let me have Powder, for you are able. Our Brother, General <hi>Johnſon,</hi> though but a ſingle Man, ſupplies all our People with Powder; when we go to ſee him, he fills all our Powder-horns with it. I ſee a great many of you here, and I think you are more able than he. Our own People at Home will have their Eye upon us, and expect that we ſhall bring them ſome Powder, and Preſents; we therefore hope you will conſider us in this, and make them larger than common, as we do not come to ſee you often.</p>

               <p>I now ſpeak in Behalf of our Warriors. When we heard your Words come to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, they were very pleaſing to us, that you would make Preſents to your Brethren, when they come to ſee you, and would give them any Thing they might went. Now we deſire you will give us ſome Vermilion, for you know that the eldeſt Brother has always Pity and Compaſſion on the youngeſt Brother; we know you are able, as you make all theſe Things in yourſelves. We have all concluded Peace now, but we have given our young Men Liberty to go to War with the Southern <hi>Indians;</hi> this is the Reaſon of our wanting the red Paint; you ſee the Warriors always paint themſelves, when they go to War.</p>

Whenever the <hi>French</hi> were aſked for Paint, or any Thing elſe, they always gave it to the <hi>Indians</hi> readily; and it is no Wonder that ſo many <hi>Indians</hi> liked the <hi>French,</hi> ſince they were ſo kind to them.</p>
               <p>You ſee ſeveral of our <hi>Indians</hi> here dreſſed in <hi>French</hi> Cloaths; and we deſire the Governor will be ſtrong, and ſupply us with every Thing.</p>

When I came from <hi>Eaſton</hi> laſt, I had no Proviſions given me to eat, ſo that when I got Home I was almoſt ſtarved, and a mere Skeleton.</p>

The Governor made Anſwer to them, and told them, that he had bought their Land from their Uncles.—What they wanted to know about their Land is this, that if they found it was not ſold by the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> they
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009412_0025_0F7404E50645D1D8"/>think they ought to be paid for it.

               <p>There are yet two White Men in the Camp; one of them, though he came with us, yet it was not by our Conſent; he would follow us; he belongs to a Warrior, that is gone to War againſt the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> and we had no Right to bring him, without the Warrior's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; you ſee him every Day; he is at Liberty. The other is a Deſerter; he came among us of his own Accord; we informed Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> of it, and Sir <hi>William</hi> ſaid, that perhaps he might have miſbehaved, and that we might keep him; perhaps he might learn the Language, and be of Service as an Interpreter, and that he might ſtay with us, if he would; he did not come to us as a Priſoner, and as he has his Liberty, you may talk with him, if you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Governor made Anſwer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That as to the Captive, he expected they would deliver him up; and deſired that they would bring the Deſerter to him To-morrow Morning, that he might ſpeak with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which</hi> Kinderuntie <hi>replied,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot deliver up the Captive to you; he does not belong to me; he belongs, as I told you, to thoſe that are gone to War; he came here of his own Accord; he followed me down, and if I ſhould deliver him now, the Warriors would ſay that I had ſold him, and that will make me aſhamed; I therefore deſire my Brother will not force me to deliver him at this Time, to make me aſhamed. As to the Deſerter, I will bring him to you at any Time.</p>
               <p>The Governor concluded, by ſaying to them, that he would have them conſider of this Matter in their Council again, and reflect ſeriouſly upon it, as he ſhould have no Dependance on all they had already ſaid, about reſtoring the Priſoners; unleſs they now delivered up this one to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> then broke up, and went to their Camp.</p>

               <p>By this String I deſire you may conſult among yourſelves, and appoint a Man to ſit in Council in his Place, which will be agreeable to me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have, according to the antient Cuſtom of your Anceſtors, upon my bidding you wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and cleaning you, performed the uſual Ceremonies on like Occaſions; with which I am well pleaſed, and return you Thanks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A large String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren, (Holding up the Belts and Strings that they gave)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe Belts you have made me ſeveral Speeches, reſpecting my requeſting you to uſe your Influence with your Nephews, and all other <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, to reſtore to us all our Flaſh and Blood. I make no Doubt you have met with ſome Difficulties on that Head, as I am very well acquainted with the Manner in which you carry on War againſt one another, and that what Priſoners you take, you claim an abſolute Property in, by adopting them into your own Nation, as ſoon as they bring them Home.</p>
               <p>But, Brethren, the Caſe is quite different between you and us. We do not look upon you to have the ſame Sort of Right over our Fleſh and Blood, as over your own. As we are of a different Colour from you, ſo we have different Cuſtoms. It is a conſtant Rule with us White People, that upon making of a Peace with thoſe with whom we have been at War, the Priſoners on both Sides are faithfully delivered up. Beſides, you may remember it was a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Engagement between us, upon re-eſtabliſhing the antient Chain of Friendſhip that thoſe Nations who had taken any of our People Priſoners, ſhould deliver them all up; and this, Brethren, I muſt inſiſt upon, as the only Means of burying every Thing that has paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. I thank you for the Influence you have uſed, and the Trouble you have taken, upon this Occaſion; but we are informed, by ſuch as have lately paſſed through the <hi>Indian</hi> Countries, that there yet remain a great many of our People, as Priſoners, in ſome of your Towns, particularly among our Brothers, the <hi>Senccas.</hi> It is, I ſuppoſe, as you fay, that ſome of them may belong to the Warriors, who are gone to War againſt the Southern <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> with whom you are always at War; but whether they belong to them, or any other People, we expect that you will acquaint them with your repeated Engagements, that they ſhall all be delivered up, and therefore that they will no longer continue unwilling to part with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what you ſay about our Promiſes of paying you for our Fleſh and Blood, you muſt have been miſtaken; for I never either told you ſo, or ſent you any ſuch Meſſage. If you have received any Meſſages to that Effect, they muſt have come from ſome other People. But I muſt be plain with you on this Subject, and tell you, that it is never our Cuſtom to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe our Fleſh and Blood of any Nation whatſoever. But, Brethren, what I have told you, and what I now again tell you, is this, that for any Services you may have done, with any of the Nations, on that Account, or for any Trouble or Expence they may be at, in bringing them down to me, I will make you and them a ſuitable Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what you ſay about making Servants of our Priſoners, we are entirely ignorant of it; we do no ſuch Thing, but as ſoon as we receive them from your Hands, we deliver them up to their Parents and Relations, if they happen to be preſent, and if not, we cloath them, and take Care of them, till we can get an Opportunity of ſending them to their Friends. They are our own Fleſh and Blood, and we uſe them as tenderly as is in our Power; if any have been treated otherwiſe, it is owing to your not delivering them to me. We have, indeed, at the Inſtance of ſome of your own People, put the Priſoners into the Court-Houſe, till we could take their Names, and be informed of the Places of their Abode; and as ſoon as we were told this, they were all cloathed, and forthwith ſent along, with ſome good Perſons to take Care of them, to their Habitations; therefore do not entertain any Notion that we make Servants or Slaves of them, and when you return Home, let all your Nations know that this is truly the Caſe, and that the Priſoners are at Liberty to go to their Relations, as ſoon as they are delivered up to us; or, if they have no Relations, they go into ſuch Places where they can beſt get Employment, in order to maintain themſelves.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I think it my Duty to tell you, that ſuch of our White Men who want to ſtay with you, are either Deſerters from the Army, or have behaved ill amongſt us, and were they to ſtay with

               <p>It grieves me that any Occaſion ſhould have been adminiſtred to you, to obſerve to me, in ſo public a Manner, that there are others beſides myſelf who concern themſelves in Affairs of Government. If it be as you ſay, I muſt tell you, Brethren, that it is a great Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an high Infringement of the Rights of Government, for any Perſon whatſoever, within this Province, except by my ſpecial Order or Commiſſion, to ſend or deliver Meſſages to you, or to any other Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> or to treat with you, or them, on any public Matters. I am the only Perſon intruſted by His Majeſty, and the Proprietaries, with the Adminiſtration of public Affairs within this Province; and I deſire you to take Notice, that in order to prevent any Thing of this Kind for the future, all Meſſengers I ſhall ſend to you ſhall be furmthed with proper Credentials, and my Speeches in Writing, under the uſual Seal; and if any Perſons, <hi>Indians</hi> or others, ſhould take upon them to deliver to you any Meſſages in my Name, unleſs they bring with them ſuch Credentials as above mentioned, I deſire you will pay no Regard to them, and acquaint me therewith.</p>

               <p>The Proprietaries of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> have never forced a Purchaſe of Lands from any of their Brethren, the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſince they have owned this Province. It is very well known, that the Native <hi>Indians</hi> very readily ſold their Lands to the Proprietaries, as ſoon as he arrived here in their Country, about Eighty Years ago. And about Thirty Years ago the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> obſerving greater Numbers of White People than thoſe old Purchaſes could accommodate, voluntarily ſold to the preſent Proprietaries ſome Lands, lying further Weſt. And their Number ſtill increaſing, at <hi>Albany,</hi> in the Year 1754, they ſold them more Lands, as far as the Limits of the Province to the Weſt, to be bounded by a Line agreed upon to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>And let me remind you of their Kindneſs to you, in this Reſpect; for no ſooner were they informed that you repented of this laſt Sale, than they immediately gave Orders to their Agents here, to execute a Releaſe to you for all the Lands over the <hi>Allegheny Hills,</hi> which was accordingly done at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> in the Year 1758, in public Council; when a Draught of the Part of the Country, which the Proprietaries held, by the <hi>Six Nations</hi> Deed, on this Side the <hi>Allegheny Hills,</hi> was ſhewn to, and approved by, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> ſome of whom are now preſent; and the Draught, and Copy of the Proprietary Releaſe, were delivered in open Council to them, who returned their hearty Thanks to the Proprietaries for their Goodneſs. I hear thoſe Chiefs put the Releaſe and Draught into Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi>'s Hands, and deſired him to keep it for them, together with many other Deeds and Papers, at the ſame Time. Now, Brethren, as no Time has been fixed for the running of the North Line, or Boundary of this laſt Purchaſe, I deſire you to apply to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> and whenever you and he ſhall think it neceſſary to run that Line, I ſhall always be ready to join with you; and until this be done, agreeable to your Deed, I ſhall not ſuffer any of my People to ſettle beyond it. By your Speech it appears to me, that you think the Line is fixed at <hi>Mohonoy;</hi> but by the Deed, which I have not brought with me, and ſo cannot now produce it, to the beſt of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the Line begins at a certain Mountain, by the River Side, about a Mile above

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of you may remember, that at the Treaty held laſt Year, at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> the <hi>Six Nations</hi> complained to me, that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſettled upon their Lands, and deſired me to aſſiſt them in preventing that Settlement, that they might not be wronged out of their Lands. They told me further, that they heard the Land had been ſold; that the <hi>Six Nations</hi> never ſold it, and that thoſe who ſold it ſtole it from them; that it was two <hi>Tuſcaroras,</hi> one <hi>Oneida,</hi> and one <hi>Mohawk,</hi> who ſold it, unknown to the <hi>Six Nations.</hi> To this Requeſt I anſwered, that a Number of People, from <hi>Connecticut</hi> Government, had ſettled at a Place on the River <hi>Delaware,</hi> called <hi>Cuſhietunck,</hi> about Fifty Miles North of the <hi>Blue Hills,</hi> being the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment complained of, and claimed all the Lands from thence quite up to <hi>Wyoming;</hi> that I had ſent Meſſengers to them, to inform them that thoſe Lands belonged to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and ordered them to remove away; but they reſuſed to do it, aſſuring me, by the Meſſengers, that they had purchaſed all thoſe Lands of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and under that Pretence had a Right to hold them.</p>
               <p>As there are now many more of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> preſent than were at <hi>Eaſton</hi> laſt Year, I again requeſt you to tell me plainly, whether theſe Strangers are ſettled there by your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or not, and why no Meaſures have been taken, if, as ſome of you told me at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> the Lands were not ſold by you, to oblige thoſe private <hi>Indians,</hi> who ſtole the Land from you, to procure a Surrender of their unjuſt Deed, from the People to whom they have made it, that it might be brought into the <hi>Onondagoe</hi> Council, and there cancelled or deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon which</hi> Thomas King, <hi>without conſulting any of the other Chiefs, roſe up and ſpoke.</hi>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very well known that the Land was ſolo by the <hi>Six Nations;</hi> ſome are here now that ſold that Land; it was ſold for <hi>Two Thouſand Dollars,</hi> but it was not ſold by our Conſent in public Council; it was as it were ſtolen from us. Some People ſaid that my Name was to it, on which I went down immediately to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to ſee whether it was or not, and found it was not. I brought a Paper back from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> which I ſhall ſhew to the Governor. Had I not gone down to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> the Lands would have been all ſettled up to <hi>Wyoming,</hi> as ſar as <hi>Awicka,</hi> Twelve Miles on this Side <hi>Chenango.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas King</hi> being then aſked, whether thoſe Lands at <hi>Cuſhietunck</hi> were a Part of thoſe Lands that were ſtolen from them? He anſwered, they had nothing to do with them; they belonged to the <hi>Delawares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Governor aſked, whether the Lands above the Hills, and at <hi>Cuſhietunck</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, belonged to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> or to the <hi>Delawares?</hi> this was aſked of all the <hi>Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> preſent, and the Governor deſired they would all give an Anſwer to it, <hi>Thomas King</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already ſaid that thoſe Lands belonged to the <hi>Delawares.</hi> They anſwered, that they would take it into Council, and give him an Anſwer in Writing.</p>

               <p>By this String I inform you, that a few Days ſince your Couſins, the Weſtern <hi>Indians,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to me about our Trade with them, and told me that we ſold our Goods very dear, and deſired we would ſell them cheaper; on which I informed them that I had, for their Benefit, opened a large Store of Goods at <hi>Pittſburgh,</hi> and had appointed honeſt Men there to deal juſtly with them, and made no Doubt but they had done ſo; but that our Land Carriage was ſo long, and made the Expences ſo very high, that we loſt Money by the Trade every Year; and that I know of no other Method, by which we could ſupply them cheaper, than by your ſuffering us to go up the Weſtern Branch of the <hi>Saſquehannah</hi> River, with Boats or Canoes, and to build ſome ſmall Store Houſes, to put our Goods and Skins in, as we went up and came down that River. This Liberty I told them I would apply to you for, and I now deſire you will be free, and tell me whether you will conſent that we ſhould build ſuch Store Houſes there, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do any Thing of that Kind, without having firſt obtained your Approbation, or to give you the leaſt Reaſon to think we intend to ſettle any of the Lands there.</p>
               <p>If you approve of this Propoſal, I will ſend proper Perſons to view that River, and to ſee how far Boats or Canoes can go up it; and I deſire the People I ſhall ſend upon that Service may be under your Protection, and treated as your Friends, by any of your People they may happen to meet with in their Journey.</p>

               <p>You have laid out two Roads already; one you told me was a good one, the other leads from <hi>Potowmack,</hi> and now you want another Road to go by Water; we cannot grant it to you, becauſe our chief old Men are not here; we are chiefly Warriors here; I am almoſt as chief a Man as any among them, but we cannot grant it to you, becauſe our chief Men are not preſent, and the Matter has not been conſulted in Council. I give you this Anſwer now, becauſe I have the Care of thoſe Lands; but if it is agreed upon in our Council, that will be another Thing; but at preſent we deny you entirely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may remember you told me, when you was going to <hi>Pittſburgh,</hi> you would build a Fort againſt the <hi>French;</hi> and you told me that you wanted none of our Lands; our Couſins know this, and that you promiſed to go away as ſoon as you drove the <hi>French</hi> away, and yet you ſtay there, and build Houſes, and make it ſtronger and ſtronger every Day; for this Reaſon we entirely deny your Requeſt; you ſhall not have a Road this Way.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Requeſt did not ariſe from me; I only mentioned it, in order to oblige your Couſins, the <hi>Delawares,</hi> who defired a Trade with us, and I did it that they might have their Goods cheaper; but this is an indifferent Matter to me; it particularly concerns your Couſins, the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and the Weſtern <hi>Indians;</hi> and ſince the <hi>Six Nations</hi> diſapprove of our going up and down the Weſt Branch, and building Store Houſes there, I ſhall ſay nothing further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am glad to hear you, as you ſay it did not come from you, but that it came from our Couſins; I thought it had been your own Propoſal. I really quite wonder at my Couſins, that they did not tell me this; but ſince they have ſwallowed up all their own Land, and live to the Weſtward, I believe they are growing proud. The Lands do belong to me where they live; I conquered it with my Sword; but they are grown proud, and will, I ſuppoſe, not own us for their Uncles.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:009412_0031_0F7404EC37985878"/>
The Governor anſwered, that if he expreſſed himſelf in ſuch a Manner to them, as if the Application did come from himſelf, he was miſtaken; for that he meant to expreſs himſelf, that he did it in Conſequence of the <hi>Delawares</hi> deſiring a Trade with us, and that our Goods might come cheaper to them, and that he knew of no other Method of rendering them ſo, but by Means of a Water Carriage; and therefore he told the <hi>Delawares</hi> that he would apply to their Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> for Liberty to carry our Goods up the Weſt Branch of <hi>Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehannah;</hi> and he deſired that they ſhould not think the <hi>Delawares</hi> in Fault, on this Account, as they did not propoſe this Method to him; and that no Blame ſhould be imputed to them at all in this Affair; and that as he found it diſagreeable to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> he would ſay nothing further about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Governor then proceeded to ſpeak to the</hi> Six Nations <hi>at follows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Belt you deſired, that as there was no War now between you and us, and the Fort at <hi>Shamokin</hi> ſtood upon your Warriors Path, the Soldiers might be removed from that Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but that the Trading Houſe might ſtill continue, that your Hunter and Warriors might be ſupplied with Goods; and further deſired to know what Prices we ſet upon our Goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt be ſenſible, that though an End be happily put to the Was between the <hi>Indians</hi> and us, yet it ſtill continues as warm as ever between as and the <hi>French,</hi> and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out His Majeſty's expreſs Orders, at whoſe Inſtance you acknowledge it was built, by your own Conſent, I cannot remove the Soldiers from that Garriſon. I ſhall give particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the Commanding Officer, that the Soldiers behave very well, both to your War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors and Hunters, when they come there; and if the Waniors behave well on their Parts, and keep ſober, there can be no Differences between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You further deſire, by this Belt, that the Perſon who has the Care of the Provincial Store may be removed, and an honeſt Man put in his Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Agent at <hi>Shamokin</hi> has, ſo far as I know, ſupported the Character of an honeſt Man; but as it ſeems he is not agreeable to you, I will conſult with the Gentlemen who are joined with me in the Direction of that Store Houſe, when I return to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and give you an Anſwer at a proper Time.</p>
               <p>As to the Trading Houſe, it ſhall continue, for your Convenience and Accommodation; but it is not in my Power to fix any certain Price upon our Goods. You know we don't make the Goods ourſelves; they are made in <hi>England,</hi> and the tranſporting them over the Seas is dangerous in War Time, and very expenſive, ſo that they muſt come much dearer now than in Time of Peace, and their Prices change, as the Riſque and Demand for them is greater or leſs; but I am told, that they are ſold to you as cheap as they can be afforded, and cheaper than they can be purchaſed from private Traders, and Care will be taken that they be good in their Quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By this Belt you give it as your Opinion, that <hi>John Harris's</hi> Houſe, ſtanding on your War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors Path, would be a good Place for a Trading Houſe, for the Accommodation of your Warriors and Hunters, and deſire one may be erected there, and recommend <hi>John Harris</hi> to be Store-keeper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Relation you gave me at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> in 1758, when you was relating the Cauſes of the War, it appears that you were of Opinion, one of the principal Reaſons which made you join the <hi>French</hi> againſt us, was owing in a great Meaſure to the ill Treatment your Warriors met with in <hi>Virginia,</hi> in thoſe Places where your War Path paſſes through the ſettled Part of that Colony; and you have now deſired me to write to the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> that as there are Settlers on your War Path, whereby it is ſtopped, he would cauſe it to be opened.</p>
               <p>Now, Brethren, I muſt acquaint you, that all the Way from <hi>Harris's</hi> Ferry to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

And I muſt deſire you, for

               <p>As to the Application made by your Friends at <hi>Wighalouſin,</hi> with reſpect to Lands they lay Claim to beyond the Mountains, I am ſurprized this ſhould be mentioned to me by <hi>Tokabaion,</hi> after what paſſed at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> In the Year 1758, between me and the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> reſpecting thoſe Lands. Their Deed to the Proprietaries for thoſe Lands was then produced, and was acknowledged to have been executed by the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> ſome of whom were then preſent. They further added, that they had ſold the Land in Queſtion, and were honeſtly paid for it, and that the Land was theirs, and they would juſtify it; theſe were their Expreſſions. This being the Cafe, and we being unacquainted with any Rights they have, muſt refer them to you, and deſire you will ſettle this Matter among yourſelves.</p>

               <p>By this Belt you tell me, that your Grandfathers adviſed you to keep faſt Hold of the Chain of Friendſhip, and that you, the <hi>Mohawks, Oneidas, Senecas, Onondagoes, Cayugas,</hi> and <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caroras,</hi> have brought about the Peace; that you have more Brothers, Friends and Allies to the Weſtward, as far as the Sun ſets, ſo many that you cannot tell their Numbers; and in Behalf of them and yourſelves, who now make up fourteen Nations, you make our old Friendſhip new again, and brighten the Covenant Chain.</p>
               <p>

               <p>You know that when the Peace was concluded firſt between us, at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> as well as in ſeveral friendly Conferences held afterwards, we both of us took great Pains to ſend the Peace Belt among all your Nations, and among your Friends and Allies, to the moſt diſtant Parts; and we have heard you ſay with Pleaſure, and we have ourſelves likewiſe received Meſſages from ſeveral <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, that they were glad to hear we had made Peace together, and joined heartily in it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>We thank you for renewing your old Friendſhip; we very heartily join with you in it, and in brightening the Covenant Chain, and confirm our Words with this Belt. When you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Home, we deſire you will ſhew this Belt to your own People, and to all the Nations in your Alliance, and let them know how friendly your Brothers have received you; adviſe them not to hearken to any Stories that bad People may tell them, to our Prejudice; deſire them to ſtop their Ears to all ſuch Stories, and aſſure them that we ſhall, on all Occaſions, preſerve our Friendſhip with our <hi>Indian</hi> Brethren, and their Allies. And we hope, that both you and we ſhall be ſo careful as not to give the leaſt Occaſion of Difference, ſo long as the World laſts.</p>

               <p>I mentioned to you, the other Day, my Deſire that there ſhould be a Store Houſe kept at <hi>John Harris's,</hi> and that he might have the Care of the Store for the Warriors. I deſired, at the ſame Time, that the Road might be opened for the Warriors, to paſs through the back Settlements to the Southern <hi>Indians;</hi> you know we are, and always have been at War with them, and I ſhall now begin to ſtrike them. You told me, in Anſwer, that you thought it beſt that that Road ſhould be ſtopt up, left any Differences ſhould ariſe between your People and our Warriors; and deſired, if any Warriors did go to War, they would take the old Road that led to the Southward, under the Mountains; and I now tell you, that as you deſired that Road ſhould be ſtopt, it ſhall be ſo, and I will take the old Road. We don't now deſire a Store Houſe ſhould be kept at <hi>John Harris's</hi> for the Warriors, but that he may be ſupplied with Proviſions, and other Neceſſaries, for our Chiefs and old Men, as they paſs to and fro about the good Work of Peace. We know <hi>John Harris,</hi> and he is known among all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, and we deſire he may be the Man appointed for the Care of this Matter</p>
