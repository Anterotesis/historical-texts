            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE EXCURSION and RAVAGES, OF THE KING'S TROOPS, &amp;C.</head>
            <p>ON the nineteenth day of April one thousand, seven hundred and seventy five, a day to be remembered by all Americans of the present generation, and which ought and doubtless will be handed down to ages yet unborn, in which the troops of Britain, unprovoked, shed the blood of sundry of the loyal American subjects of the British King in the field of Lexington. Early in the morning of said day, a detachment of the forces under the command of General Gage, stationed at Boston, attacked a small party of the inhabitants of Lexington and some other towns ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, the detachment consisting of about nine hundred men commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Smith: The inhabitants of Lexington and the other towns were about one hundred, some with and some without fire arms, who had collected upon information, that the detachment had secretly marched from Boston the preceding night, and landed on Phips's Farm in Cambridge, and were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on their way with brisk pace towards Concord (as the inhabitants supposed) to take or destroy a quantity of stores deposited there for the use of the colony; sundry peaceable inhabitants having the same night been taken, held by force, and otherwise abused on the road, by some officers of General Gage's army, which caused a just alarm to the people, and a suspicion that some fatal design was immediately to be put in execution against them: This
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014269_0004_0F93572CD6653720"/>
small party of the inhabitants so far from being disposed to commit hostilities against the troops of their sovereign, that unless attacked were determined to be peaceable spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of this extraordinary movement; immediately on the approach of Colonel Smith with the detachment under his command they dispersed; But the detachment, seeming to thirst for BLOOD, wantonly rushed on, and first began the hostile scene by firing on this small party, in which they killed eight men on the spot and wounded several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before any guns were fired upon the troops by our men. Not contented with this effusion of blood, as if malice had occupied their whole soul, they continued the fire, until all this small party who escaped the dismal car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, were out of the reach of their fire: Colonel Smith with the detachment then proceeded to Concord, where a part of this detachment again made the first fire upon some of the inhabitants of Concord and the adjacent towns, who were collected at a bridge upon this just alarm, and killed two of them and wounded several others, before any of the Provincials there had done one hostile act: Then the Provincials (roused with zeal for the liberties of their country, finding life and every thing dear and valuable at stake) assumed their native valour and returned the fire, and the engagement on both sides began: Soon after which the British troops retreated towards Charlestown (having first committed violence and waste on public and private property) and on their retreat were joined by another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of General Gage's troops, consisting of about a thousand men, under the command of Earl Percy, who continued the retreat, the engagement lasted through the day, many were killed and wounded on each side, though the loss on the part of the British troops far exceeded that of the provincials: The devastation committed by the British troops on their retreat, the whole of the way from Concord to Charlestown, is almost beyond description, such as plundering and burning of dwelling houses and other buildings, driving into the street women in child-bed, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling old men in their houses unarmed: Such scenes of desolation would be a reproach to the perpetrators, even if committed by the most barbarous nations, how much more when done by Britons famed for humanity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness: And all this because these colonies will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the iron yoke of arbitrary power.</p>

by our troops so long as any of the provincials were to be seen. From thence we marched to Concord, on a hill near the entrance of the town, we saw another body of provincials assembled, the Light-Infantry companies were ordered up the hill to disperse them, on our approach they retreated towards Concord, the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers continued the road under the hill towards the town, six companies of light-infantry were ordered down to take possession of the bridge which the provincials retreated over; the company I commanded was one of the three companies of the above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment went forward about two miles, in the mean time the provincial troops returned to the number of about three or four hundred, we drew up on the Concord side the bridge, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials came down upon us, upon which we engaged and gave the first fire: This was the first engagement after the one at Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, a continued firing from both parties lasted through the whole day: I myself was wounded at the attack of the bridge, and am now treated with the greatest humanity and taken all possible care of, by the provincials at Medford,</p>
