            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MARRIAGE is an ordinance of God, early inſtituted, deſigned for his glory, and the ſocial comfort of mankind—that they might not only be help-meets to each other in this world, but that they might help one another forward in their Chriſtian courſe towards God's heavenly kingdom. But alas how thoughtleſs do many ruſh into the marriage ſtate, as thoughtleſs as if God was not to be honored there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as ſtupid as if they were not accountable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—But, notwithſtanding their inſenſibility and ſtupidity, God often over-rules it ſo, that ſuch a thoughtleſs pair often live comfortably in this world a ſure evidence that God's tender mercies are over all his works.—God deſigned the marriage union <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a moſt near relation between a man and his wife, when they come together as they ought: when they marry in the Lord. 1 Cor. vi. 29. If this union is not near and ſacred, would the Holy Ghoſt thus have indited the canticles! What endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions are there uſed, to ſet forth Chriſt and his church. Happy is the pair that thus meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether according to God's direction, when the nuptial bands are tied, they ſhall never fail of a bleſſing: They ſhall have every thing that is beſt for them in this world, and in the world to come everlaſting life; they ſhall live together as the heirs of the grace of life that their prayers be not hindred.</p>
            <p>We have an account in our text, where Jeſus was called, invited to a wedding, and where he wrought his firſt miracle, and turned water into wine: He graced the marriage with his preſence: The gueſts were aſtoniſhed at the good wine that was brought forth at the laſt.</p>
            <p>This is a ſure evidence that marriage is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and that God deſigns to be honored thereby; and thoſe that invite Jeſus to their marriage, ſhall find a bleſſing, ſhall taſte that love that is better than wine.</p>

               <p>When a couple are about to enter into the ſacred covenant of marriage, it is their duty to invite Jeſus to the wedding.</p>

To illuſtrate my doctrine, I ſhall,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. Shew what is implied in inviting Jeſus to a wedding.</item>
                  <item>II. That it is the duty of all when they marry ſo to do.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. Then, what is implied in inviting Jeſus to a wedding; there is many things implied in it. Perſons when they are about to marry are thinking about the gueſts they deſign to have at their wedding; they do not uſually invite any but their friends, but thoſe that are near to them. Sometimes perſons invite thoſe to wedding they do not really want, for fear of affronting them; ſo a perſon may invite Jeſus for fear of puniſhment—for fear they ſhall be ſent to hell, if they do not aſk the preſence of God, when they really do not want the preſence of God, when they really do not want the preſence of God there—but this is not a right way of inviting Jeſus, of calling him to the wedding. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is implied in inviting Jeſus to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; that when a perſon deſires to marry, he looks to Jeſus for direction; if perſons deſire Jeſus at the marriage, they will look to God for direction; that they may be directed to a ſuitable perſon—one that may be an help-meet to them—one of a ſuitable temper and diſpoſition—one who they may live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable with in this world—but eſpecially one who may be an help-meet to them, to help them forward towards the heavenly Canaan—one who is an heir of the grace of life, that they may ſo live together that their prayers may not be hindred. 1 P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

2. It implies that they themſelves are friends to Jeſus, and have a high eſteem of him, and love for him, that their whole dependance is upon God, and that they will be much in prayer to God for direction and counſel in this great affair; this is the greateſt affair that perſons tranſact in this world, with regard to themſelves, and worldly things; it is for life of one or the other. When they marry if they ſo come together, as to live as heirs of the grace of life; how great a bleſſing! but if otherwiſe, how great a curſe!—Therefore the perſon that deſires Jeſus at the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, will take his counſel and direction: When he is about to ſeek a partner of his <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>woes,</hi> he will be much in prayer to God for his bleſſing.</p>

                  </gap> when a couple are about to marry, it is their duty to call Jeſus, to invite Jeſus to the wedding; and this will appear plainly if we conſider a few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe marriage is an ordinance of God. Gen. ii. 18 and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> of all when they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to invite Jeſus to the wedding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the duty when perſons are about to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to invite Jeſus to the wedding, becauſe marriage, or the marriage covenant, repreſents Chriſt and his church, Tim. iii. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Turn, O backſliding chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043980_0006_101DADBC3174BC70"/>for then it was better with me than now. Iſai. lxii. 5. For as a young man marrieth a virgin, ſo ſhall thy ſons marry thee, and as the bridegroom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth over the bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoice over thee.</p>
               <p>The union between huſband and wife is ſo near, it repreſents Chriſt and his church, the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe of this union, this nearneſs, this love, throughout the whole of the divine Song of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to repreſent the myſtical marriage, love and union between Chriſt and his church. Eph. v. 30.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe they have no promiſe of living com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in this world, or of making an happy end at laſt, unleſs Jeſus be with them, unleſs they aſk his preſence, and invite him to the wedding. It is as much their duty to call upon Jeſus to come to this ordinance as any other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe there will be no true joy if Jeſus be not there, nothing but carnal meriment; there may be carnal meriment and carnal joys where Jeſus is not; but theſe are ſhort lived pleaſures which will bring bitterneſs in the latter end. At laſt they will bite like a ſerpent and ſting like an adder. But if Jeſus be there, there will be joy worth having. It is worth while to go to wedding where Jeſus is to taſte the good wine. Where Jeſus is, the children of the bride chamber cannot mourn; "Can the children of the bride chamber mourn, while the bridegroom is with them." Matt. ix. 15.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. and laſtly. Becauſe Jeſus will come and bleſs them if they invite him; he will not do as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043980_0007_101DADC198739138"/>do when they have been treated exceeding ill, though afterwards they may invite them to their wedding, yet they remember their former ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will not come. It is not ſo with Jeſus: However ill he has been treated time after time— been diſpifed and rejected by them; yet, if when they are about to marry, if they ſincerely invite him, if they deſire his preſence; he will remember none of his former ill treatment againſt them but will come and bleſs them; he will give them delicious fare! they ſhall taſte that love that is better than wine.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe this diſcourſe by addreſſing myſelf to ſeveral ſorts of perſons, and</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the bridegroom and the bride, who are now about to enter into the ſolemn covenant of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. My dear friends is our doctrine true, that when a couple are about to enter into the ſacred co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of marriage, it is their duty to invite Jeſus to the wedding Of what importance then is it that you have the preſence of Jeſus with you. I truſt and hope you have thought ſolemnly of this great tranſaction, before now, and looked to Jeſus for counſel, and given him a ſincere invitation to the wedding. If ſo you will have his preſence with you and bleſſing to attend you, and he will give you every needed bleſſing, every thing that is beſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is my hearty deſire and prayer to God for you that you may grow up into a family: a family of religion, a family that will always call upon God.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:043980_0008_101DADC49EEC8CB8"/>That you may have the good will of him that dwelt in the buſh: That you may live together as heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. May you ſo live together in this world, as to become a lively emblem of the bride, the Lamb's wife, and finally be admited to that ſtate and world, where there is neither marriage nor giving in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but where you will be as the angels of God in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall addreſs myſelf to the unmarried in this aſſembly. Is our doctrine true; is it the duty of all when they marry to invite Jeſus to the wedding. Of how much importance is it then that you become friendly to Jeſus! That you marry to him before you marry to one another, before you are married in this life—For as we have ſhewn, friendſhip to Jeſus, is implied in inviting him to the wedding. Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon him and love to him; ſeeking to God by prayer for direction and council in this great affair; this temper and diſpoſition of heart you muſt have, otherwiſe you will not call Jeſus to the wedding.</p>
               <p>O of what importance is it then, that you be united to Jeſus, in that covenant of which marriage is an emblem! And, if friendſhip to Jeſus is implied in inviting him to the wedding, of what vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is it, that when a friend to Jeſus ſeeks a wife or huſband, that they ſeek one that loves God; one that appears a friend to religion, one that loves their Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; one that loves to converſe about ſpiritual things; one that can ſympathize with them in their joys and ſorrows; be a partner of their ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043980_0009_101DADC621D8FE48"/>woes in a proper ſenſe: How ſhould they look to Jeſus for direction that they may have ſuch an one.</p>
               <p>You that are friends to Jeſus, if you do not ſeek ſuch for your partner, when your marriage day comes you will differ about about your gueſts. The bridegroom deſires to invite Jeſus— the bride does not love to (ſo <hi>vice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erſa</hi>) ſo your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſeems to begin before the marriage day. But how can you take one for your neareſt and deareſt friend, that doth not appear to love Jeſus; "for whom you have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and counted it but dung, that you might win Chriſt. Phil. iii. 8." You know Chriſt tells you, "he that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. He that loveth wife or children more than me is not worthy of me," &amp;c. Matt. x, 37. Luke xiv, 26. A perſon muſt forſake all, that intends to win heaven; therefore it ſeems neceſſary in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon of things, as well as from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that a friend to Jeſus ſhould not marry with one that appears to be an enemy to him, or in other words with an open immoral profane perſon, "For how can two walk together except they be agreed." There is no perſon that is not a friend in heart to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ever deſires his preſence at their wedding. They do not deſire that rejoicing he recommends, they do not like that meriment. Luke xv. 24, "And they began to be merry." No, they had rather have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mirth, they had rather not have Jeſus there. Therefore, it is of the greateſt importance, when a lover of God ſeeks a partner, to look to God for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and ſo marry in the Lord.</p>

3. I would turn the addreſs to the married in this aſſembly. Is marriage an ordinance of God. Is it emblematical of Chriſt and his church, as we have ſhewn; yes, ſurely it is, "marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled, but whore-mongers and adulterers God will judge." Then how ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried people live together and not profane that ſacred ordinance. How ſhould huſbands and wives live together in love and harmony, and be helps meet to one another, not only as to living in this world, but helps to each other in their Chriſtian race towards the heavenly Canaan. They ſhould ſo live as to be a lively emblem of Chriſt and his church.</p>
               <p>How much depends upon the example of parents with regard to their children. Example is more than precept. God is wont to bleſs the good examples and pious inſtruction of parents to their children. Saith God I know Abraham, he will command his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the ways of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Says Joſhua, "As for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord.</p>
               <p>O then let parents be exhorted to walk before their houſes with a perfect heart, and live together as heirs of the grace of life that their prayers be not hindered.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly and laſtly, I ſhall turn the addreſs to the whole aſſembly. Is it as we have heard, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt become friendly to Jeſus in order to have his preſence with them at the ordinance of marriage. It is ſo in this ordinance and all others, of what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:043980_0011_101DA2224A749AF0"/>then that all become friendly to Chriſt, that they be married to him. Without this no duty is acceptable to him; no duty done as God requires without this; no promiſe of life being comfortable in this world. No promiſe of future well being.</p>
               <p>From theſe motives let me exhort all to wed with the Lord Jeſus, to marry to him; conſider he is now courting a bride; he is offering to be married to ſinners; his voice is, Behold I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and fatlings are killed, all things are ready, come unto the marriage. Matt. xxii. 4.</p>
               <p>So Proverbs ix. begins, Wiſdom has builded her houſe, ſhe hath hewn out her ſeven pillars, ſhe hath killed her beaſts; ſhe hath mingled her wine, ſhe hath alſo furniſhed her table; ſhe hath ſent forth her maidens; ſhe crieth upon the high places of the city, whoſo is ſimple let him turn in hither, as for him that wanteth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhe ſaith to him, come eat of my bread and drink of the wine that I have mingled, forſake the fooliſh and live, and go in the way of underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Jeſus has every charming voice, and charming ſound, and charming invitation, to invite ſinners to come and marry to him Rev. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Spirit and the bride, ſay, Come And let him that heareth, ſay, Come. And let him that is a thirſt come: And whoſoever will, let him take of the wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of life freely—Jeſus invites ſinners to come one
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:043980_0012_101DADCF1AC33A10"/>marry to him, however poor, and wretched, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable they be; he will not reject them, if they come in ſincerity and truth. Rev. iii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
