            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In Obedience therefore to the Command of <hi>His Excellency</hi> our GOVERNOUR, and of the Gentlemen your <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> here, we have the Honour to preſent the following Sheets to <hi>Your Honourable Board;</hi> believing

that notwithſtanding all the <hi>Defects</hi> which Perſons of your Learning will eaſily ſee in them, yet they will find a <hi>candid</hi> Acceptance with You: And that the Knowledge of this Beginning of your <hi>Miſſion</hi> will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, as the <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> of Many to GOD, and their <hi>Prayers</hi> for the Progreſs of it under the Smiles of His Providence and Grace, ſo likewiſe the <hi>Charitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions</hi> of Some for the more effectual Support of it in Times to come.</p>
            <p>You have made us too much <hi>Parties</hi> in the glorious Deſign of your Incorporation, for Us to allow Our Selves to go into the <hi>Praiſes</hi> due to it, which muſt needs be in all the <hi>Churches</hi> of CHRIST, ſo long as the <hi>true Intention</hi> of the <hi>pious Donors</hi> is faithfully purſued, as we are confident it always will be by You, in the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Principles of the Chriſtian Proteſtant Religion in Places that <hi>moſt need</hi> the Knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and among People that are <hi>indeed periſhing</hi> for want of it.

Our Days are happily fallen in thoſe <hi>Times</hi> whereof the DIVINE SPIRIT ſpake to the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> when <hi>many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</hi> The BLESSED AND ONLY POTENTATE in theſe His Times is performing this by <hi>the Navigation of Great Britain,</hi> and other Kingdoms of <hi>Europe.</hi> For how eaſily and ſwiftly is the Knowledge of the <hi>True</hi> GOD, and of the <hi>Only</hi> SAVIOUR, communicated hereby from one End of the Earth to the other? And O that the <hi>Maritime Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Powers</hi> would more bring their <hi>Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> into the Adminiſtration of this Service! not only by granting their <hi>Letters Patents</hi> in Favour, of it to the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> in their Dominions that are well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed toward it, but alſo by Opening of Their Own <hi>Treaſures</hi> for its Support!

So near is the relation between CHRIST the Head, and the Members of His myſtical Body, that what is done to them, he takes as done to himſelf. 1 Cor. xii. 12. <hi>As the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: ſo alſo is Chriſt.</hi> Mat. xxv. 40. And now, trembling, he ſays, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> He knew not that JESUS was the <hi>promiſed Meſſiah,</hi> till he thus revealed himſelf to him.

               <head>DOCT. I. Our LORD JESUS CHRIST calls and ſends forth the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</head>
               <p>Ver. 16.—<hi>To make thee a Miniſter</hi>—ver. 17.—<hi>Unto whom I ſend thee.</hi> Indeed this <hi>Call</hi> was <hi>immediate,</hi> neither of Men, nor by Men; but by a glorious Appearance of CHRIST, and his Voice from Heaven: however, he continues to ſpeak to his People in his Word, and to declare his will; and therefore tho' Men may be the Inſtruments, yet when the Rules of the Goſpel of CHRIST are obſerv'd, the Call of Miniſters is from him. This Divine Perſon, GOD-Man-Mediator, is the glorious Head of his Church, whoſe Prerogative it is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Laws and Ordinances of his Houſe, and Officers that are to act under him in his viſible Kingdom on Earth. Accordingly, after his Reſurrection, He ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have commanded you,</hi> Mat. xxviii. 18,—20. And when our LORD aſcended on high, he received Gifts for Men, and he gave ſome <hi>Apoſtles</hi>—: and ſome, <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> Eph. iv 11. Now, that theſe ordinary Officers laſt mentioned, were appointed to ſucceed the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in the Work of the Miniſtry, is evident from the great deſign of this Gift and Inſtitution. It follows, ver. 12, 13. <hi>For the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> obſerves, <q>the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> declares how long the Work of the Miniſtry appointed by CHRIST for his Church's edification and advantage, was to continue; namely, to the End of the World, <hi>till all come</hi> &amp;c.</q> And this is further evident from the directions given in GOD's Word, reſpecting the Qualifications of ſuch Miniſters, and their Separation to this Work. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 2,—11. <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 5,—9. And whereas they ſtand in abſolute need of the Preſence of CHRIST with them, His moſt gracious Promiſe given when He commiſſion'd his Diſciples to teach in his Name, was not reſtrain'd to them, and the Age wherein they liv'd; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Goſpel Miniſters to the End of the World. Mat. xxviii. 20.—<hi>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World.</hi> And inaſmuch as the Great GOD our SAVIOUR makes Overſeers or Biſhops, and effectually calls his choſen People, <hi>by his Spirit, Act.</hi> xx. 28. <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 5, 6. He promis'd that the HOLY GHOST, who is alſo a Divine Perſon, ſhould be ſent from the Father in vertue of his Interceſſion, and that <hi>to abide with his People for ever,</hi> Joh. xiv. 16, 17. Upon the whole, we may conclude, that our LORD JESUS CHRIST continueth to call and ſend forth Goſpel Miniſters.</p>

And here give me leave to offer a few Hints.</p>
                  <p>Let there be a Compendium or Summary of Chriſtian Religion agreable to the Scriptures, and as ſhort and plain as may be, often inculcated, till the Natives ſhall have learned the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Doctrine of CHRIST.</hi> Declare to them the only true and living GOD, who made Heaven and Earth, and all things in them; and that He made Man upright, in His own Image. Shew them their vile and miſerable State by the Fall. Declare to them that this GOD, who is the FATHER and the SON and the HOLY GHOST, hath contriv'd a way in which they may be deliver'd from their Sin and Miſery. That in order to this, the Eternal SON of GOD hath taken our Nature, and became Man; that He was obedient to Death, the Death of the Croſs; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> again from the Dead, and lives in Heaven to intercede for his People. Declare to them, that this JESUS is the only Mediator between GOD and Man; and that they muſt pray to GOD in His Name only. Shew them the neceſſity of turning from all Sin to GOD in true Repentance; and of receiving the LORD JESUS CHRIST by Faith, and depending on His Righteouſneſs for Pardon and Juſtification. Declare to them that GOD alone hath power to forgive Sins. Shew them the nature and uſe of the holy Sacraments, and that thoſe which CHRIST hath inſtituted are only two, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper;</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to maintain in them an high eſteem of them. Shew them that they muſt be taught the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and ſubject themſelves to the Authority and Laws of CHRIST, before theſe may be adminiſtred to them: That if they would receive ſaving benefit by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> they muſt alſo ſeek the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the HOLY GHOST, for themſelves and their Offspring, that being born of Water and of the Spirit they may enter into the Kingdom of GOD. Teach them that the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> muſt be receiv'd by the Communicants in both Elements, Bread and Wine; and that 'tis contrary to Senſe Reaſon and Scripture, to imagine, that theſe are turn'd into the very Body and Blood of CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore that CHRIST, who is ſpiritually preſent with his People, muſt be apprehended and received by faith, if they would partake in the ſaving virtues of his Death. And take heed you never proſtitute theſe Sacred Myſteries of our holy Religion, by adminiſtring them to any under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Ignorance, under Romiſh Idolatry, or that live and allow themſelves in open and ſcandalous Immoralities.</p>
                  <p>Declare to them the Commandments of the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> That GOD only is the Object of Prayer, and all religious Worſhip. Tell them, foraſmuch as we are the Offspring of GOD, we ought not to think that the God-Head is like unto Gold, or Silver or Stone, graven by art, and Man's device: that it is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003723_0026_10024B3372A4DBE8"/>
a moſt hainous Crime to worſhip GOD by Images; and that He who is a jealous GOD, threatens to puniſh this Iniquity upon Parents and their Children, unto the third and fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Teach them to Sanctify the Sabbath Day; and in a word, the neceſſity of a ſober righteous and godly Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In particular, do all you can to convince them of the great Evil of that Sin which moſt eaſily beſets them, and to keep them from it; le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t they wholly forget GOD's Law, and quench every good motion of His SPIRIT: Solemnly warn them of the Deſtruction they are bringing upon themſelves by it, and how they are conſuming away under the deadly influence of it.</p>
                  <p>[However, I am inform'd that tho' they have a Name for GOD, yet they have no form of taking his Name in vain, in their own Language. Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens, and be horribly afraid! in that this preſumptuous Sin of profane Swearing is ſo common where the light of the Goſpel ſhines, and GOD's glorious and fearful Name is clearly reveal'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And let ſuch bold Tranſgreſſors know, that it will be more tolerable for bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Indians than for them, in the Day of Judgment; when the LORD ſhall make it appear, that He <hi>will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>But to return from this Digreſſion; Declare to them, that GOD alone can change their Hearts, enable them to hate Sin, and love his Law; and then direct them to ask of GOD His HOLY SPIRIT, to ſanctify them, and create them in CHRIST JESUS unto good Works. And ſhew them that when they have done all, they muſt Truſt in the Merits of JESUS CHRIST, and not preſume to think that they can merit by their good Works. But I forbear.</p>
                  <p>In your teaching, there muſt be precept upon precept, line upon line; here a little, and there a little. But how much skill and prudence do you need in this matter? Depend on GOD for all, and encourage your ſelves in Him, who ſaid on the firſt Day, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light;</hi> and can now more eaſily ſhine into their Hearts to give them the knowledge of the Goſpel, than you can ſpeak a word.

O that this Day of GOD's power might dawn and ſhine on a World ſitting in Darkneſs! O that the poor Indians might ſee the light of Life, and live!</p>
                  <p>But think it not ſtrange, if you meet with ſharp Trials from the Prince of Darkneſs, and ſuch as are under his power, while you are endeavouring to enlighten Men with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of JESUS CHRIST; and be ready to endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

            <p>Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> who had been choſen <hi>Moderator</hi> by the Reverend and Honourable <hi>Council,</hi> then took the <hi>Desk,</hi> and ſaid,</p>
            <p>IT is a rare and ſingular Occurrence in the Providence of GOD, that hath call'd this Great and Reverend <hi>Aſſembly</hi> together at this Time. And no doubt but many who are here preſent may deſire to be inform'd of the ſeveral Things, occurring in the Providence of a Glorious GOD, which have been the Occaſion of our preſent Meeting. And I think that I cannot better introduce the <hi>Solemn Action</hi> before us, in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of the Reverend and beloved <hi>Brethren</hi> here preſent, than by giving the following Account.</p>
            <q>
               <p>KNOW then,<note n="†" place="bottom">See a printed Account of <hi>the Society in Scotland.</hi> 1720.</note> that in the Year of our LORD 1701. a Number of private <hi>Gentlemen</hi> did uſually meet in the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for the Reformation of Manners; who reflecting on the Ignorance, Atheiſm, Popery and Impiety, that did ſo much abound in the <hi>High-lands</hi> and <hi>Iſles</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did juſtly reckon that they flow'd in a great Meaſure from the Want of ſutable Means of Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>THIS led 'em to engage by themſelves at firſt in a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Subſcription for Erecting <hi>Charity Schools</hi> in thoſe Places of Darkneſs and Irreligion. But upon Trial finding Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not able in their private Capacity to carry on ſo great and publick a Work, they apply'd their Thoughts to find out Methods for a <hi>Fund</hi> equal to the Deſign.</p>
               <p>IN purſuance of this they mov'd it privately to Members of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> that the Repreſentatives of <hi>the Church of Scotland</hi> might concur in the Work. And they had ſo much Succeſs that in the Year 1706. the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> took it under Conſideration, and recommended it to their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> who publiſhed <hi>Propoſals for the Propagating of Chriſtian Knowledge</hi> in their High-lands and Iſles, and alſo in Foreign Parts.</p>

That is, ſo long as there are <hi>Heathens</hi> to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelized, to be Converted to the Chriſtian Faith, to be Baptiz'd and gathered into Churches; ſo long do both the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of CHRIST and <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> require the Office, as well as in the primitive Times; and ſo long do they call aloud for Perſons duly qualified and ſpirited to be engaged in it, until <hi>all the Nations</hi> are Converted and gathered into Churches: and then indeed the <hi>End</hi> of their Office ceaſing, the <hi>Office</hi> will therefore fail, and no other Spiritual Officers remain but the <hi>Stated Paſtors</hi> of particular Churches.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>contrary narrow Conception,</hi> laying aſide <hi>thoſe Evangelical Officers</hi> and confining the <hi>Chriſtian Miniſtry</hi> to the <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Particular Churches,</hi> has not only a plain natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to hinder; but has alſo doubtleſs been a principal Mean of hindering the Propagation of the Goſpel thro' the World. To this it ſeems in a great meaſure owing, that the <hi>Religion of</hi> CHRIST has not made a much farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the <hi>Eaſtern Hemiſphere,</hi> than it had about 1400 Years ago, in the Days of CONSTANTINE the <hi>Great.</hi> Whereas had <hi>this Order of Miniſters,</hi> from thoſe ancient Times been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept up and emitted among the <hi>Heathen Nations;</hi> by the common Bleſſing of Heaven, it ſeems to be likely, that <hi>all the Ends of the Earth,</hi> in a far more extenſive Senſe than <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> is to be taken, had long before now been <hi>Evangeliz'd,</hi> and happily ſeen the Salvation of GOD.</p>
            <p>Nor can I imagine, that the Reformed and famous <hi>Churches,</hi> either of FRANCE or SCOTLAND ever intended to militate <hi>this ſort of Officers</hi> thus deſcribed: For tho' They diſcountenance a <hi>Vagous Miniſtry</hi>

            <p n="2">(2) From hence we likewiſe plainly ſee, that EVANGELISTS, or Preachers of the Goſpel and Gatherers of Churches among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> are <hi>much more properly and ſtrictly,</hi> the SUCCESSORS of the APOSTLES, than the <hi>ſtated Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches: the Office of the <hi>former</hi> much more reſembling that of the APOSTLES, than the Office of the <hi>latter.</hi>

(3) and laſtly, Theſe EVANGELISTS thus Preaching among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> Converting and Baptizing them, Gathering them into Churches and then Conſtituting <hi>ſtated Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> over them; They, the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> cannot therefore poſſibly be an Inferiour Order of Officers to thoſe <hi>Stated Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They thus ſet over the Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and gathered. Tho' their Ordaining ſuch <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> will on the other hand no more infer a Superiority in the <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> than <hi>one Stated Biſhop</hi> of a Church ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>another Biſhop,</hi> will infer a Superiority in the <hi>Ordainer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for your farther Satisfaction in the ſtrict Propriety of <hi>Laying our Hands</hi> upon, and <hi>Giving the Right Hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> to <hi>ſuch ſort of Officers</hi> as have been now ordained; I ſhall only obſerve theſe Two things—</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That they were <hi>ſuch ſort of Officers,</hi> upon whom HANDS WERE LAID in the primitive Times, when they were ſeparated to this peculiar Service.</p>
            <p>Thus we read of BARNABAS an EVANGELIST, as well as of PAUL an APOSTLE, in <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 1,—3. <hi>Now there were in the Church that was at</hi> Antioch, <hi>certain Prophets and Teachers</hi>—<hi>as they miniſtred to the</hi> LORD, <hi>and faſted, the</hi> HOLY GHOST <hi>ſaid,</hi> SEPARATE <hi>me</hi> BARNABAS <hi>and</hi> SAUL <hi>for the Work whereto I have called them: and when they had faſted and prayed, and</hi> LAID THEIR HANDS <hi>on them, they ſent them away.</hi> And ſo were the <hi>Hands of the Presbytery</hi> laid on TIMOTHY, another EVANGELIST, when the <hi>Gift</hi> of Preaching the Goſpel, which was at firſt among the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> was communicated to Him. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 14.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) That they were alſo <hi>ſuch ſort of Officers,</hi> to whom the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> gave the RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP; when they were going to Preach among the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf aſſures us, in <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 9. <hi>And when</hi> JAMES, CEPHAS <hi>and</hi> JOHN, <hi>who ſeemed to be</hi> PILLARS, <hi>perceived the Grace that was given to</hi> ME; <hi>they gave to</hi> ME <hi>and</hi> BARNABAS <hi>the</hi> RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP; <hi>that</hi> WE <hi>ſhould go to the</hi> HEATHEN <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we ſee that the <hi>Scripture Inſtances</hi> both of <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> and Giving the <hi>Right Hand of Fellowſhip,</hi> are <hi>firſtly</hi> in Favour of <hi>Such ſort</hi> of Officers; and are by <hi>Inference</hi> or <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> only, applied to <hi>Others.</hi>

            <p>For beſides, that thoſe <hi>Five</hi> Miniſters were then at JERUSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEM, the <hi>Seat</hi> of the principal Chriſtian Church in that Age and Part of the World; from whence were <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to Preach the Goſpel and gather Churches in all the Countries round about:—What I would chiefly obſerve is—(1) That this was done upon their <hi>Perceiving the</hi> GRACE <hi>of</hi> GOD given to <hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Barnabas</hi>—i. e. not only the Miniſterial Gifts and Graces of the HOLY SPIRIT, but alſo their evident Call of GOD to engage in this Office, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Inveſtiture therein.
