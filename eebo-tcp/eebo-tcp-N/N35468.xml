            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I thank my God upon every mention of you,

                     <hi>COLOSSE</hi> was a City of the <hi>Greater Phrygia,</hi> not far from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicéa</hi> and <hi>Hierápolis.</hi> Though St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached in many Parts of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> yet he never had been at this City. It had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Goſpel by the preaching of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who was with St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he wrote this Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were now in Danger of being ſeduced by thoſe who ſtrove to blend Judaiſm or Heathen Superſtitions with Chriſtianity: Pretending, that GOD, becauſe of his great Majeſty, was not to be approached but by the Mediation of Angels: And that there were certain Rites and Obſervances chiefly borrowed from the Law, whereby theſe Angels might be made our Friends.</p>
                  <p>In Oppoſition to them the Apoſtle, 1. Commends the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as more excellent than all other, and ſo entire and perfect, that no other Knowledge was neceſſary for a Chriſtian. He 2. ſhews, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is above all Angels, who are only his Servants; and that being reconciled to GOD through Him, we have free Acceſs to him in all our Neceſſities.</p>

                     <p>For yourſelves, brethren, know our entrance to you,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that it was not in vain: But even after we had ſuffered before, and had been ſhamefully treated at Philippi, as ye know, we were bold thro' our God to ſpeak to you the goſpel of God with much contention. For our exhortation <hi>is</hi> not of deceit,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nor of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> nor in guile. But as we have been approved of God to be intruſted with the goſpel, ſo we ſpeak, not as pleaſing men, but God who trieth our hearts. For neither at any time uſed we flattering words,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> as ye know, nor a cloak of covetouſneſs: God is witneſs:
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:046353_0036_10210EA81243C418"/>Nor ſought we glory of men,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burdenſome, as the Apoſtles of Chriſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> But we were gentle in the midſt of you, even as a nurſe cheriſheth her own children.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> So, loving you tenderly, we were ready to impart to you not only the goſpel of God, but our own ſouls alſo,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> becauſe ye were dear to us. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the goſpel of God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Ye <hi>are</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and God, how hoſtly and juſtly and unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we behaved among you that believe:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted every one of you, as a father his own children.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> And charged you to walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> For this cauſe alſo thank we God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, <hi>even</hi> becauſe when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us, ye received <hi>it,</hi> not <hi>as</hi> the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, who likewiſe effectually worketh in you that believe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God in Chriſt Jeſus, which are in Judea: for ye alſo ſuffered the ſame things from your own countrymen,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> as they likewiſe from the Jews: Who

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Wherefore we would have come to you (even I Paul) once and again,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> but Satan hindered us. For what is our hope,

                  <p>There are many Compariſons in this Epiſtle, which may be nearly reduced to Two Heads, 1. The Prophets, the Angels, Moſes, Joſhua, Aaron are great; but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is infinitely greater: 2. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Believers enjoyed high Privileges; but Chriſtian Believers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy far higher. To illuſtrate this, Examples both of Happineſs and Miſery are every where interſperſed: So that in this Epiſtle there is a Kind of Recapitulation of the whole Old Teſtament.

How much more may we glory in the Goſpel, which was given, not by the Miniſtry of Angels, but of the very Son of GOD? <hi>As he hath by inheritance a more excellent name</hi>—Becauſe He is the Son of GOD, He <hi>inherits</hi> that <hi>Name,</hi> in Right whereof he inherits <hi>all things.</hi> His inheriting that Name is more ancient than <hi>all worlds.</hi> His inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Things as ancient as <hi>all things: than they</hi>—This denotes an immenſe Pre-eminence.

The Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to whom, being conſummated, all Things are made ſubject: 2. The preceding Sufferings. Of theſe he treats expreſly, ver. 11—18. having before ſpoken of his Glory, both to give an Edge to his Exhortation, and to remove the Scandal of Sufferings and Death. A fuller Conſideration of both theſe Points, he interweaves with the following Diſcourſe on his Prieſthood. But what is here ſaid of our LORD's being <hi>made perfect through ſufferings,</hi> has no relation to <hi>our</hi> being ſaved or ſanctified by Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

                     <p>My brethren,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> count it all joy, when ye fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers temptations,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But let patience have <hi>its</hi> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If any of you want wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, let him aſk of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But let him aſk in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like a wave of the ſea,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:046353_0139_1021101E2F0B55C0"/>driven with the wind and toſſed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> For let not that man think that he ſhall receive any thing from the Lord.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> A double-minded man is unſtable in all his ways.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But the rich, in that he is made low; becauſe as the flower of the graſs he ſhall paſs away.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> For the ſun aroſe with a ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, and withered the graſs, and the flower fell off, and the beauty of its form periſhed: ſo alſo ſhall the rich man fade away in his ways. Happy <hi>is</hi> the man that endureth temptation:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> for when he hath been proved, he ſhall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Let no man who is tempted ſay, I am tempted of God a for God cannot be tempted with evil,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:046353_0140_10211020021979C0"/>his own deſire and inticed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Then deſire having conceived, bringeth forth ſin; and ſin being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, bringeth forth death.</p>
                     <p>Do not err,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableneſs neither ſhadow of turning.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firſt fruits of his creatures.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> my beloved brethren, let every man be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, ſlow to wrath.
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:046353_0141_10211021DD684260"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Therefore laying aſide all the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſuperfluity of wickedneſs, receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word which is able to ſave your ſouls.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only,

Wherefore St. <hi>James</hi> purpoſely repeating (ver. 21, 23, 25.) the ſame Phraſes, Teſtimonies and Examples which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had uſed, (<hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 17, 31.) refutes, not the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but the Error of thoſe who abuſed it. There is therefore no Contradiction between the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: They both delivered the Truth of GOD; but in a different Manner, as having to do with different Kinds of Men. On another Occaſion St. <hi>James</hi> himſelf pleaded the Cauſe of Faith (<hi>Acts</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Verſe is a Summary of what follows. <hi>What profiteth it,</hi> is enlarged on, ver. 15-17: <hi>tho' a man ſay,</hi> ver. 18, 19: <hi>can that faith ſave him?</hi> ver. 20. It is not <hi>Tho' he have faith;</hi> but, <hi>Tho' he ſay he hath faith.</hi> Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true, living Faith is meant. But in other Parts of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a dead, imaginary Faith. He does not therefore teach, that true Faith <hi>can,</hi> but that it <hi>cannot</hi> ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works. Nor does he oppoſe Faith to Works, but that empty Name of Faith, to real Faith working by Love, <hi>Can that faith which is without works ſave him?</hi> No more than it can profit his Neighbour.</p>

This is therefore no other than an Inſtance of the divine Condeſcenſion to our low Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. <hi>Elect</hi>—By the free Love and Almighty Power of GOD taken out of, ſeparated from the World. <hi>Election,</hi> in the Scripture Senſe, <pb n="157" facs="unknown:046353_0156_102107CC9C668DB8"/> is GOD's doing any thing that our Merit or Power have no Part in. The true Predeſtination, or Fore-appointment of GOD is, 1. He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, from the Guilt and Power of Sin. 2. He that endureth to the End, ſhall be ſaved eternally. 3. They who receive the precious Gift of Faith, thereby become the Sons of GOD: And being Sons, they ſhall receive the Spirit of Holineſs, to walk as <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo walked. Throughout every Part of this Appointment of GOD, <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> go Hand in Hand. All is free Gift; and yet ſuch is the Gift, that the final Iſſue depends on our future Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the heavenly Call. But other Predeſtination than this, either to Life or Death eternal, the Scripture knows not of. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is, 1. Cruel Reſpect of Perſons: An unjuſt Regard of one, and an unjuſt Diſregard of another. It is mere <hi>creature partiality,</hi> and not <hi>infinite Juſtice:</hi> 2. It is not <hi>plain</hi> Scripture-Doctrine (if true:) but rather, inconſiſtent with the expreſs written Word, that ſpeaks of GOD's univerſal Offers of Grace: His Invitations, Promiſes, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, being all <hi>general.</hi> 3. We are bid to chuſe Life, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for not doing it. 4. It is inconſiſtent with a State of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe that <hi>muſt</hi> be ſaved or <hi>muſt</hi> be loſt. 5. It is of fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; all Men being ready, on very ſlight Grounds, to fancy <hi>themſelves</hi> of the Elect Number. But the Doctrine of Predeſtination is entirely changed from what it formerly was. <hi>Now</hi> it implies nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith, Peace, nor Purity. It is ſomething that will do <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> them all. Faith is no longer, according to the modern Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian Scheme, a divine <hi>evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> wrought in the Soul by the immediate Power of the Holy Ghoſt: Not an <hi>evidence</hi> at all; but a <hi>mere nation.</hi> Neither is Faith made any longer a Means of Holineſs; but ſomething that will do without it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no more a Saviour <hi>from</hi> Sin; but a Defence, a Countenancer of it. He is no more a Fountain of ſpiritual Life in the Soul of Believers, but leaves his Elect inwardly <hi>dry,</hi> and outwardly <hi>unfruitful;</hi> and is made little more than a Refuge from the Image of the heavenly: even from Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>thro' ſanctification of the Spirit</hi>—Through the renewing and purifying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Spirit on their Souls: <hi>unto obedience</hi>—To engage and enable them to yield themſelves up to all holy Obedience, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all which is, the <hi>ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>— The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="175" facs="unknown:046353_0174_1021108C00311668"/>of our God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and of Jeſus our Lord; As his divine power hath given us all things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to life and godlineſs, through the knowledge of him that hath called us by glory and virtue. Thro' which he hath given us precious and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great promiſes;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that by theſe, having eſcaped the corruption which is in the world through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, ye may become partakers of the divine nature: For this very reaſon,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> giving all diligence, add to your faith courage, and to courage knowledge,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:046353_0175_10211091F9402890"/>And to knowledge temperance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and to temperance patience,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs love.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> For theſe being in you and abounding, make <hi>you</hi> neither ſlothful nor unfruitful in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> But I will endeavour, that ye may be able after my deceaſe to have theſe things always in remembrance.</p>
                     <p>For we have not followed cunningly deviſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> while we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Majeſty;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> For he received honour and glory from God the Father, when there came ſuch a voice to him from the excellent glory

If the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil of our fallen Nature he not daily mortified, it will, like an evil Humour in the Body, deſtroy the whole Man. But <hi>if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body</hi> (only ſo far as we do this) <hi>ye ſhall live</hi> the Life of Faith, Holineſs, Happineſs. The End and Deſign of Grace being purchaſed and beſtowed on us, is to deſtroy the Image of the earthly, and reſtore us to that of the heavenly. And ſo far as it does this, it truly profits us; and alſo makes Way for more of the heavenly Gift, that we may at laſt be filled with all the Fulneſs of GOD. The Strength and Well-being of a Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on what his Soul feeds on, as the Health of the Body depends on whatever we make our daily Food. If we feed on what is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Nature, we grow: if not, we pine away and die. The Soul is of the Nature of GOD, and nothing but what is according to his Holineſs can agree with it. Sin, of every Kind, ſtarves the Soul and makes it conſume away. Let us not try to invert the Order of GOD in his new Creation: We ſhall only deceive ourſelves. It is caſy to forſake the Will of GOD and follow our own; but this will bring Leanneſs into the Soul.

                  <p>THE great Similitude, or rather Sameneſs both of Spirit and Expreſſion, which runs through St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, and all his Epiſtles, is a clear Evidence of their being written by the ſame Perſon. In this Epiſtle he ſpeaks not to any particular Church, but to all the Chriſtians of that Age, and in them to the whole Chriſtian Church in all ſucceeding Ages.</p>
                  <p>Some have apprehended, that it is not eaſy to diſcern the Scope and Method of this Epiſtle. But if we examine it with Simplicity, theſe may readily be diſcovered. St. <hi>John</hi> in this Letter, or rather Tract (for he was preſent with Part of thoſe to whom he wrote) has this apparent Aim, To confirm the happy and holy Communion of the Faithful with GOD and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by deſcribing the Marks of that bleſſed State.</p>

                              <hi>And there are three that teſtify in heaven</hi>—The Teſtimony of the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, is by an eminent Gradation corroborated by Three, who give a ſtill greater Teſtimony, <hi>the Father</hi> —Who clearly teſtified of the Son, both at his Baptiſm, and at his Transfiguration, <hi>the Word</hi>—Who teſtified of himſelf, on many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, while he was on Earth: And again, with ſtill greater Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, after his Aſcenſion into Heaven: (<hi>Rev.</hi> i. 5. xix. 13.) <hi>And the Spirit</hi>—Whoſe Teſtimony was added, chiefly after his Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (ch. ii. 27. <hi>John</hi> xv. 26. <hi>Acts</hi> v. 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 16.) <hi>And theſe three are one</hi>—Even as thoſe two, <hi>the Father and the Son are one,</hi> (<hi>John</hi> x. 30.) Nothing can ſeparate the Spirit from the Father and the Son. If He were not one with the Father and the Son, the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought to have ſaid, <hi>The Father and the Word</hi> (who are one) <hi>and the Spirit are two.</hi> But this is contrary to the whole Tenor of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It remains, that theſe three are one. They are one in Eſſence, in Knowledge, in Will, and in their Teſtimony.</p>
                           <p>It is obſervable, the Three in the one Verſe are oppoſed not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly, but ſeverally to the Three in the other: As if he had ſaid, not only the Spirit teſtifies, but alſo the Father; (<hi>John</hi> v. 37.) Not only the Water, but alſo the Word: (<hi>John</hi> iii. 11. x. 41.) Not only the Blood, but alſo the Holy Ghoſt. (<hi>John</hi> xv. 26, &amp;c.) It muſt now appear to every reaſonable Man, how abſolutely neceſſary the eighth Verſe is. St. <hi>John</hi> could not think of the Teſtimony of the Spirit, and Water, and Blood, and ſubjoin <hi>The teſtimony of God is greater,</hi> without thinking alſo of the Teſtimony of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, yea and mentioning it in ſo ſolemn an Enumeration. Nor can any poſſible Reaſon be deviſed, why without <hi>Three teſtifying in heaven</hi>—he ſhould enumerate <hi>Three,</hi> and no more <hi>who teſtify on earth</hi>—The Teſtimony of all is given <hi>on earth,</hi> not <hi>in heaven,</hi> but <pb n="204" facs="unknown:046353_0203_102110EDFA0B5448"/> they who teſtify are part on Earth, part in Heaven; the Witneſſes who are on Earth teſtify chiefly concerning his Abode on Earth, though not excluding his State of Exaltation. The Witneſſes who are in Heaven teſtify chiefly concerning his Glory at GOD's Right Hand, though not excluding his State of Humiliation.</p>
                           <p>The ſeventh Verſe therefore, with the ſixth, contains a Recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of the whole Oeconomy of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from his Baptiſm to Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt: The eighth, the Sum of the divine Oeconomy, from the Time of his Exaltation.</p>
                           <p>Hence it farther appears, That this Poſition of the ſeventh and eighth Verſes, which places thoſe who teſtify <hi>on earth,</hi> before thoſe who teſtify <hi>in heaven,</hi> is abundantly pretetable to the other, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a Gradation admirably ſuited to the Subject.</p>

               <head>NOTES ON THE REVELATION OF <hi>JESUS CHRIST.</hi>
               </head>
               <div type="introduction">
                  <p>'TIS ſcarce poſſible for any that either love or fear GOD, not to feel their Hearts extremely affected, in ſeriouſly reading either the Beginning, or the latter Part of <hi>the Revelation.</hi> Theſe, 'tis evident, we cannot conſider too much: but the intermediate Parts I did not ſtudy at all for many Years: As utterly deſpairing of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them, after the fruitleſs Attempts of ſo many wiſe and good Men; and perhaps I ſhould have lived and died in this Sentiment, had I not ſeen the Works of the great <hi>Bengelius.</hi> But theſe revived my Hopes of underſtanding even the Prophecies of this Book: At leaſt many of them in ſome good Degree; for perhaps ſome will not be opened but in Eternity. Let us however bleſs GOD for the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Light we may enjoy, and improve it to his Glory.</p>
                  <p>The following Notes are moſtly thoſe of that excellent Man; a few of which are taken from his <hi>Gnomon Novi Teſtamenti,</hi> but far more from his <hi>Ekklarte Offenbarung,</hi> which is a full and regular Comment on <hi>the Revelation.</hi> Every Part of this I do not undertake to defend. But none ſhould condemn him, without reading his Proofs at large. It did not ſuit my Deſign to inſert theſe: they are above the Capacity of ordinary Readers. Nor had I Room to inſert the entire Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Book which contains near twelve hundred Pages.</p>
                  <p>All I can do is, partly to tranſlate, partly abridge the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of his Obſervations; allowing myſelf the Liberty to alter ſome of them, and to add a few Notes where he is not full. His Text, it may be obſerved, I have taken almoſt throughout, which I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:046353_0219_1021125935E45360"/>he has abundantly defended both in the <hi>Gnomon</hi> itſelf, and in his <hi>Apparatus</hi> and <hi>Criſis in Apocalypſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I by no means pretend to underſtand, or explain all that is contained in this myſterious Book. I only offer what Help I can to the ſerious Enquirer, and ſhall rejoice if any be moved thereby, more carefully to read and more deeply to conſider the Words of this Prophecy. Bleſſed is he that does this with a ſingle Eye. His La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall not be in vain.</p>

                              <hi>The Revelation</hi>—Properly ſo called; for Things covered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are here <hi>revealed</hi> or unveiled. No Prophecy in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has this Title: It was reſerved for this alone in the New. It is as it were a Manifeſto, wherein the Heir of all Things declares, That all Power is given Him in Heaven and Earth, and that He will in the End gloriouſly exerciſe that Power, maugre all the Oppoſition of all his Enemies. <hi>Of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>—Not, of <hi>John the Divine,</hi> a Title added in latter Ages. Certain it is, that Appellation, <hi>the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> was not brought into the Church, much leſs was it affixed to <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, till long after the Apoſtolic Age. It was St. <hi>John</hi> indeed who wrote this Book; but the Author of it is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. Which God gave unto him</hi>—According to his holy, glorified Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as the Great Prophet of the Church. GOD gave <hi>the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> made it known to his Servants. <hi>To ſhew</hi>—This Word recurs, ch. xxii. 6. And in many Places the Parts of this Book refer to each other. Indeed the whole Structure of it breathes the Art of GOD, comprizing in the moſt finiſhed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium, Things to come, many, various; near, intermediate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; the greateſt, the leaſt; terrible, comfortable; old, new; long, ſhort; and theſe interwoven together, oppoſite, compoſite; relative to each other at a ſmall, at a great Diſtance; and therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as it were diſappearing, broken off, ſuſpended, and afterwards unexpectedly and moſt ſeaſonably appearing again. In all its Parts it has an admirable Variety, with the moſt exact Harmony, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully illuſtrated by thoſe very Digreſſions which ſeem to interrupt it. In this Manner does it diſplay the manifold Wiſdom of GOD ſhining in the Oeconomy of the Church through ſo many Ages. <hi>His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>—Much is comprehended in this Appellation. 'Tis a great Thing to be a Servant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This Book is dedicated particularly to the Servants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia:</hi> But not excluſive of all his other Servants, in all Nations and Ages. It is one ſingle Revelation, and yet ſufficient for them all, from the <pb n="221" facs="unknown:046353_0220_102107D63037F6B0"/> Time it was written to the End of the World. Serve thou the LORD <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in Truth. So ſhalt thou learn his Secret in this Book. Yea, and thou ſhalt feel in thy Heart, whether this Book be divine or not. <hi>The things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs</hi>—The Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Prophecy did begin to be accompliſhed ſhortly after it was given; and the whole might be ſaid to <hi>come to paſs ſhortly,</hi> in the ſame Senſe as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>The end of all things is at hand;</hi> and our LORD himſelf. <hi>behold I come quickly.</hi> There is in this Book a rich Treaſure of all the Doctrines pertaining to Faith and Holineſs. But theſe are alſo delivered in other Parts of Holy Writ; ſo that <hi>the Revelation</hi> need not to have been given for the Sake of theſe. The peculiar Deſign of this is, <hi>To ſhew the things which muſt come to paſs.</hi> And this we are eſpecially to have before our Eyes, whenever we read or hear it.</p>

                              <hi>Happy is be that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophecy</hi>—Some have miſerably handled this Book. Hence others are afraid to touch it. And while they deſire to know all Things elſe, reject only the Knowledge of thoſe which GOD hath ſhewn. They enquire after any thing rather than this: as if it were written. <hi>Happy is be that doth not read</hi> this Prophecy. Nay, but <hi>happy is be that readeth, and they that hear and keep the words thereof:</hi> Eſpecially at this Time, when ſo conſiderable a Part of them is on the Point of being fulfilled.</p>
                           <p>Nor are Helps wanting whereby any ſincere and diligent Enquirer may underſtand what he reads therein. The Book itſelf is written in the moſt accurate Manner poſſible. It diſtinguiſhes the ſeveral Things whereof it treats by ſeven Epiſtles, ſeven Seals, ſeven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, ſeven Phials; each of which Sevens is divided into Four and <pb n="222" facs="unknown:046353_0221_1021111F171053D0"/> Three. Many Things the Book itſelf explains, as the ſeven Stars; the ſeven Candleſticks; the Lamb, his ſeven Horns and ſeven Eyes; the Incenſe; the Dragon; the Heads and Horns of the Beaſts; the fine Linen; the Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And much Light ariſes from comparing it with the ancient Prophecies, and the Predictions in the other Books of the New Teſtament.</p>
                           <p>In this Book our LORD has comprized what was wanting in thoſe Prophecies, touching the Time which followed his Aſcenſion, and the End of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Polity. Accordingly it reaches from the Old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the New, reducing all Things into one Sum in the exacteſt Order, and with a near Reſemblance to the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The Introduction and Concluſion agree with <hi>Daniel;</hi> the Deſcription of the Man-Child and the Promiſes to <hi>Sion</hi> with <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> the Judgment of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> Again, the Determination of Times with <hi>Daniel:</hi> the Architecture of the Holy City, with <hi>Ezehiel;</hi> the Emblems of the Horſes, Candleſticks, &amp;c. with <hi>Zechariab.</hi> Many Things largely deſcribed by the Prophets are here ſummarily repeated; and frequently in the ſame Words. To them we may then uſefully have Recourſe. Yet the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſuffices for the explaining itſelf, even if we do not yet underſtand thoſe Prophecies; yea, it caſts much Light upon them. Frequently likewiſe, where there is a Reſemblance between them, there is a Difference alſo; <hi>the Revelation</hi> as it were taking a Stock from one of the old Prophets, and inſerting a new Graft into it. Thus <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaks of two Olive-trees. And ſo does St. <hi>John;</hi> but with a different Meaning. <hi>Daniel</hi> has a Beaſt with Ten Horns. So has St. <hi>John;</hi> but not with quite the ſame Signification. And here the Difference of Words, Emblems, Things, Times ought ſtudiouſly to be obſerved.</p>
                           <p>Our LORD foretold many Things before his Paſſion; but not all Things: For it was not yet ſeaſonable. Many Things likewiſe his Spirit foretold in the Writings of the Apoſtles, ſo far as the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of thoſe Times required, now be comprizes them all in one ſhort Book; therein preſuppoſing all the other Prophecies, and at the ſame Time, explaining, containing, and perfecting them in one Thread. It is right therefore to compare them; but not to meaſure the Fulneſs of theſe by the Scantineſs of thoſe preceding.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when on Faith, foretold what would come to paſs in a ſhort Time; adding a brief Deſcription of the laſt Things. Here he foretells the intermediate Things; ſo that both put together, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute one compleat Chain of Prophecy. This Book is therefore not only the Sum, and the Key of all the Prophecies which preceded, but likewiſe a Supplement to all; the Seals being cloſed before. Of Conſequence it contains many Particulars, not revealed in any other Part of Scripture. They have therefore little Gratitude to GOD for ſuch a Revelation, reſerved for the Exaltation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who boldly reject whatever they find here, which was not revealed, or not ſo clearly in other Parts of Scripture. <hi>He that readeth and they that bear</hi> —St. <hi>John</hi> probably ſent this Book by a ſingle Perſon into <hi>Aſia,</hi> who <pb n="223" facs="unknown:046353_0222_10211125CC3D7410"/> 
                              <hi>read</hi> it in the Churches, while many <hi>heard.</hi> But this likewiſe in a ſecondary Senſe refers to all that ſhall duly read or hear it in all Ages. <hi>The words of this prophecy</hi>—It is a <hi>Revelation</hi> with regard to <hi>Chriſt</hi> who gives it, <hi>a prophecy</hi> with regard to <hi>John</hi> who delivers it to the Churches. <hi>And keep the things which are written therein</hi>—In ſuch a Manner as the Nature of them requires; namely, with Repentance, Faith, Patience, Prayer, Obedience, Watchfulneſs, Conſtancy. It behoves every Chriſtian, at all Opportunities to read what is written in the Oracles of GOD; and to read this precious Book in particular, frequently, reverently, and attentively. <hi>For the time</hi> of its Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be accompliſhed, <hi>is near</hi>—Even when St. <hi>John</hi> wrote. How much nearer to us is even the full Accompliſhment of this weighty Prophecy?</p>

                              <hi>John</hi>—The Dedication of this Book is contained in the 4th, 5th, and 6th Verſes: But the whole <hi>Revelation</hi> is a Kind of Letter. <hi>To the ſeven churches which are in Aſia</hi>—That Part of the Leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> which was then a <hi>Roman</hi> Province. There had been ſeveral other Churches planted here: but it ſeems theſe were now the moſt eminent. And it was among theſe that St. <hi>John</hi> had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured moſt during his Abode in <hi>Aſia.</hi> In theſe Cities there were many Jews. Such of them as believed in each were joined with the Gentile Believers in one Church. <hi>Grace be unto you and peace</hi>—The Favour of GOD with all temporal and eternal Bleſſings, <hi>From him who is, and who was, and who cometh,</hi> or <hi>who is to come</hi>—A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tranſlation of the great Name JEHOVAH: <hi>He was</hi> of old, he <hi>is</hi> now; he <hi>cometh;</hi> that is, will be for ever. <hi>And from the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are before his throne—Chriſt</hi> is He who <hi>hath the ſeven Spirits of God. The ſeven Lamps which burn before the throne are the ſeven Spirits of God. The Lamb hath ſeven horns and ſeven eyes, which are the ſeven Spirits of God. Seven</hi> was a ſacred Number. in th Jewiſh Church. But it did not always imply a preciſe Number. It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is to be taken figuratively, to denote Compleatneſs or Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By theſe <hi>ſeven Spirits,</hi> not ſeven created Angels, but the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is to be underſtood: The Angels are never termed <hi>Spirits</hi> in this Book: and when all the Angels <hi>ſtand up,</hi> while the four living Creatures and the four and twenty Elders <hi>worſhip him that ſitteth on the throne</hi> and the Lamb, <hi>the ſeven Spirits,</hi> neither ſtand up nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. To theſe <hi>ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> the ſeven Churches, to whom the Spirit ſpeaks ſo many Things, are ſubordinate: As are alſo their Angels, yea, and <hi>the ſeven Angels which ſtand before God.</hi> He is called <hi>The ſeven Spirits,</hi> not with regard to his Eſſence, which is one, but with regard to his manifold Operations.</p>

                              <label>V. 20.</label>  Write firſt <hi>the myſtery</hi>—The myſterious Meaning <hi>of the ſeven-ſtars</hi>—St. <hi>John</hi> knew better than we do, in how many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects theſe Stars were a proper Emblem of thoſe Angels: How nearly they reſembled each other, and how far they differed in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, Brightneſs, and other Circumſtances. <hi>The ſeven ſtars are angels of the ſeven churches</hi>—Mentioned in the 11th Verſe. In each Church there was one Paſtor or Ruling Miniſter, to whom all the Reſt were ſubordinate. This Paſtor, Biſhop, or Overſeer, had the peculiar Care over that Flock: On him the Proſperity of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in a great Meaſure depended: And he was to anſwer for all thoſe Souls at the Judgment-Seat of <hi>Chriſt. And the ſeven can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks are ſeven churches</hi>—How ſignificant an Emblem is this! For a Candleſtick, though of Gold, has no Light of itſelf: neither has any Church, or Child of Man. But they receive from <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Light of Truth, Holineſs, Comfort, that it may ſhine to all around them.</p>
                           <p>As ſoon as this was ſpoken St. <hi>John</hi> wrote it down, even all that is contained in this Firſt Chapter. Afterwards what was contained in the Second and Third Chapters, was dictated to him in like Manner.</p>
                           <p>Ch. ii. of the following Letters to the Angels of the ſeven Churches it may be neceſſary to ſpeak firſt, in general, and then particularly.</p>
                           <p>In general we may obſerve, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to receive the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they were firſt to be purified. And when the Kingdom of GOD was at Hand, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt prepared Men for it by Repentance. In like Manner we are prepared by theſe Letters for the worthy Reception of this glorious <hi>Revelation.</hi> By following the Directions given herein, by expelling incorrigibly wicked Men, and putting away all Wickedneſs, thoſe Churches were prepared to receive this precious Depoſitum. And whoever in any Age would profitably read or hear it, muſt obſerve the ſame Admonitions.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Letters are a Kind of ſeven-fold Preface to the Book. <hi>Chriſt</hi> now appears in the Form of a Man (not yet under the Emblem of a Lamb) and ſpeaks moſtly in proper, not in figurative Words. It is not all ch. iv. 1. that St. <hi>John</hi> enters upon that Grand Viſion which takes up the Reſidue of the Book.</p>

                                 </gap>l;</hi> but the other, which occurs here, implies much more. This Holineſs is the Sum of all praiſe, which is given to the Almighty Creator, for all that he does and reveals concerning himſelf, till the new Song beings with it new Matter of Glory.</p>
                           <p>This Word properly ſignifies <hi>ſeparated,</hi> both in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and other Languages. And when GOD is termed Holy, it denotes that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which is altogether peculiar to himſelf; and the Glory flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all his Attributes conjoined, ſhining forth from all his Works, and darkening all Things beſides itſelf, whereby he is, and eternally remains, in an incomprehenſible Manner <hi>ſeparate</hi> and at a Diſtance, not only from all that is impure, but likewiſe from all that is created.</p>
                           <p>GOD is <hi>ſeparate</hi> from all Things. He is, and works from himſelf, out of himſelf, in himſelf, thro' himſelf, for himſelf. Therefore He is the Firſt and the Laſt, the only One and the Eternal, Living and Happy, Endleſs and Unchangeable, Almighty, Omniſcient, Wiſe and True, Juſt and Faithful, Gracious and Merciful.</p>
                           <p>Hence it is, that Holy and Holineſs mean the ſame as GOD and Godhead; and as we ſay of a King, <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> ſo the Scripture ſays of GOD, <hi>His Holineſs. (Heb.</hi> xii. 10.) The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of GOD. When GOD is ſpoken of, he is often named, <hi>The Holy One.</hi> And as GOD ſwears by his Name, ſo he does alſo by his Holineſs, that is, by Himſelf.</p>
                           <p>This Holineſs is often ſtiled Glory; often his Holineſs and Glory are celebrated together. (<hi>Lev.</hi> x. 3. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> vi. 3.) for Holineſs is covered Glory, and Glory is uncovered Holineſs. The Scripture ſpeaks abundantly of the Holineſs and Glory of the Father, the Son <pb n="246" facs="unknown:046353_0245_10211175F3F2B0D8"/> and the Holy Ghoſt. And hereby is the Myſtery of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity eminently confirmed.</p>
                           <p>That is alſo termed <hi>Holy,</hi> which is conſecrated to Him, and for that End <hi>ſeparated</hi> from other Things. And ſo is that wherein we may be like GOD, or united to him.</p>
                           <p>In the Hymn reſembling this, recorded by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ch. vi. 3. is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>The whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> But this is deferred in <hi>the Revelation,</hi> till the Glory of the LORD (his Enemies being deſtroyed) fills the Earth.</p>

All this was repreſented to St. <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Patmos,</hi> in one Day, by way of Viſion. But the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it extends from that Time throughout all Ages. Writings ſerve to inform us of diſtant and of future Things. And hence Things which are yet to come, are figuratively ſaid, to be <hi>written in</hi> GOD's <hi>Book:</hi> So were at that Time the Contents of this weighty Prophecy. But the Book was ſealed. Now comes the opening and accompliſhing alſo of the great Things that are, as it were, the Letters of it. <hi>A book written within and without</hi>—That is, no Part of it blank, full of Matter, <hi>ſealed with ſeven ſeals</hi>—Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Seven Principal Parts contained in it, one on the Outſide of each. The uſual Books of the Ancients were not like ours, but were Volumes, or long Pieces of Parchment, rolled upon a long Stick, as we frequently roll Silks. Such was this repreſented, which was <hi>ſealed with ſeven ſeals.</hi> Not as if the Apoſtle ſaw all the Seals at once; for there were ſeven Volumes wrapt up one within another, each of which was ſealed: So that upon opening and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolling the firſt, the ſecond appeared to be ſealed up, till that was opened, and ſo on to the ſeventh. The Book and its <hi>Seals</hi> repreſent all Power in Heaven and Earth given to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> A Copy of this Book is contained in the following Chapters. By <hi>the trumpets</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the ſeventh <hi>ſeal,</hi>) the Kingdom of the World is ſhaken, that it may at length become the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> By <hi>the phials,</hi> (under the ſeventh Trumpet) the Power of the Beaſt, and whatſoever is connected with it, is broken. This Sum of all we ſhould have continually before our Eyes: So the whole <hi>Revelation</hi> flows in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Order.</p>

                           <p>The Contents, as of the Phials and Trumpets, ſo of the Seals, are ſhewn, by the Songs of Praiſe and Thankſgiving annexed to them.

We ſhould remember, that altho' the ancient Prophets wrote the Occurrences of thoſe Kingdoms only with which <hi>Iſrael</hi> had to do, yet <hi>the Revelation</hi> contains what relates to the whole World, through which the Chriſtian Church is extended. Yet, 3. We ſhould not preſcribe to this Prophecy, as if it muſt needs admit or exclude this or that hiſtory, according as we judge one or the other, to be of great or ſmall Importance. GOD <hi>ſeeth not as a man ſeeth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what we think great is often omitted, what we think little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, in Scripture-Hiſtory or Prophecy. 4. We muſt take care, not to overlook what is already fulfilled; and not to deſcribe as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled what is ſtill to come.</p>
                           <p>We are to look in Hiſtory for the fulfilling of the four firſt Seals, quickly after the Date of the Prophecy. In each of theſe appears a different Horſeman. In each we are to conſider, firſt, The Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himſelf; ſecondly, What he does.</p>
                           <p>The Horſeman himſelf, by an emblematical Proſopopoeia, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <hi>a ſwift Power,</hi> bringing with it either, 1. A ſlouriſhing State, or, 2. Bloodſhed, or, 3. Scarcity of Proviſions, or, 4. Public Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raities. With the Quality of each of theſe Riders, the Colour of his Horſe agrees. The fourth Horſeman is expreſsly termed <hi>Death;</hi> the Firſt, with his Bow and Crown, a Conqueror. The Second, with his great Sword, is a Warrior, or, as the <hi>Romans</hi> termed him, <hi>Mars:</hi> The Third, with the Scales, has Power over the Produce of the Land. Particular Incidents under this or that <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive enough to anſwer any of theſe Horſemen.</p>
                           <p>The Action of every Horſeman intimates farther, 1. Toward the Eaſt, wide ſpread Empire and Victory upon Victory; 2. Toward the <pb n="252" facs="unknown:046353_0251_1021118828E21080"/> Weſt, much Bloodſhed; 3. Toward the South, Scarcity of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; 4. Toward the North, the Plague and various Calamities.</p>

                              <hi>And I ſaw, and behold a white horſe, and he that ſat on him had a bow</hi>—This Colour, and the Bow ſhooting Arrows afar off, betoken Victory, Triumph, Proſperity, Enlargement of Empire, and Dominion over many People.</p>
                           <p>Another Horſeman indeed, and of quite another Kind, appears on a white Horſe, ch. xix. 11. But he that is ſpoken of under the firſt Seal muſt be ſo underſtood, as to bear a Proportion to the Horſemen in the ſecond, third, and fourth Seal.</p>

                              <hi>Nerva</hi> ſucceeded the Emperor <hi>Domitian</hi> at the very Time when <hi>the Revelation</hi> was written, in the Year of our LORD 96. He reigned ſearce a Year alone; and three Months before his Death, he named <hi>Trajan</hi> for his Colleague and ſucceſſor, and died in the Year 98. <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Acceſſion to the Empire ſeems to be the Dawning of the ſeven Seals. <hi>And a crown was given him</hi>—This, conſidering his Deſcent, <hi>Trajan</hi> could have no Hope of attaining. But GOD gave it him by the Hand of <hi>Nerva:</hi> and then the Eaſt ſoon felt his Power. <hi>And he went forth conquering and to conquer</hi>—That is, from one Victory to another. In the Year 108 the already victorious <hi>Trajan went forth</hi> toward the Eaſt, to <hi>conquer</hi> not only <hi>Armenia, Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Miſopotamia,</hi> but alſo the Countries beyond the <hi>Tigris,</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to a far greater Extent than ever. We find no Emperor like him for making Conqueſts. He aimed at nothing elſe: He lived only <hi>to conquer.</hi> Meantime in him was eminently fulfilled, what had been propheſied of the fourth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; (<hi>Dan.</hi> ii. 40. vii. 23.) That he ſhould <hi>devour, tread down,</hi> and <hi>break in pieces the whole earth.</hi>

                           <p>To this Horſeman <hi>there was given a great Sword</hi>—And he had much to do with it.

It is not a certain Rule, that every Part of the Text is fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, before the Completion of the following Part begins. All Things mentioned in the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> are not fully accompliſhed before the <hi>Seals</hi> are opened: Neither are all things mentioned under the <hi>Seals</hi> fulfilled, before the <hi>Trumpets</hi> begin.

So the ſeventh Trumpet begins earlier than the Phials, and yet extends beyond them all.—<hi>The ſeven angels which ſtood before</hi> GOD—a Character of the higheſt Emmence, <hi>and ſeven trumpets were given them</hi>—When Men deſire to make known openly a Thing of public Concern, they give a Token that may be ſeen or heard far and wide: and among ſuch none are more ancient than Trumpets, (<hi>Lev.</hi> xxv. 9. <hi>Numb.</hi> x. 2. <hi>Amos</hi> iii. 6.) The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in particular uſed them, both in the Worſhip of GOD and in War, therewith openly praiſing the Power of GOD, before, after, and in the Battle (<hi>Joſh.</hi> vi. 4. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> xiii. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And the Angels here made known by theſe Trumpets, the wonderful Works of GOD, whereby all oppoſing Powers are ſucceſſively ſhaken, till the Kingdom of the World becomes the Kingdom of GOD and his anointed.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Trumpets reach nearly from the Time of St. <hi>John.</hi> to the End of the World: And they are diſtinguiſhed by manifeſt Tokens. The Place of the four firſt is ſpecified, namely, Eaſt, Weſt, South, and North ſucceſſively: In the three laſt, immediately after the Time of each, the Place likewiſe is pointed cut.</p>
                           <p>The Seventh Angel did not begin to ſound, till after the going forth of the Second Wo: But the Trumpets were given to him and the other ſix together (as were afterward the Phials to the ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) And it is accordingly ſaid of all the Seven together, that <hi>they prepared themſelves to ſound.</hi> Theſe therefore were not Men, as ſome have thought, but Angels properly ſo called.</p>

                           <p>We are now come to a moſt important Period of Time. The <hi>New-chronos</hi> haſtens to an End.

                           <p>Let him who does not regard the being ſeized by the Wrath of the Devil, the falling unawares into the General Temptation, the being borne away by the moſt dreadful Violence into the Worſhip of the Beaſt and his Image, and conſequently drinking the unmixt Wine of the Wrath of GOD, and being tormented Day and Night for ever and ever in the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone: Let him alſo who is confident, that he can make his Way thro' all theſe, by his own Wiſdom and Strength, without Need of any ſuch peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative as the Word of this Prophecy affords: Let him, I ſay, go hence.

                           <p>GOD has not given this Prophecy, in ſo ſolemn a Manner, only to ſhew his Providence over his Church; but alſo that his Servants may know at all Times in what particular Period they are.

If we compare the Length of the third Wo, with the Period of Time which ſucceeds it in the twentieth Chapter, it is but a <hi>little time</hi> to that vaſt Space which reaches from the Beginning of the <hi>Non-chronos</hi> to the End of the World.</p>

About the Year 948 it was again ſettled in <hi>Denmark:</hi> In 965 in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Sileſia:</hi> In 980 through all <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> In 997 it was brought into <hi>Hungary;</hi> into <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> both before and after. <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> received it about 1000, and ſoon after, other Parts of <hi>Dacia.</hi>

I ſaid, I would ſee to whom the Right belonged—and give Sentence, which ſhould be preferred. <hi>Henry</hi> forbad this—Therefore I bind <hi>Henry</hi> and all his Favourers with the Bond of an Anathema, and again take from him all Regal Power. I abſolve all Chriſtians from their Oath of Allegiance, forbid them to obey <hi>Henry</hi> in any Thing, and command them to receive <hi>Rodulph</hi> as their King. Confirm this therefore by your Authority, ye moſt holy Princes of the Apoſtles, that all may now at length know, as ye have Power to bind and looſe in Heaven, ſo we have Power to give and take away on Earth, Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, and whatſoever Men can have."</p>
                           <p>When <hi>Henry</hi> ſubmitted, then <hi>Gregory</hi> began to reign without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. In the ſame Year 1077, on <hi>September;,</hi> he fixt a new Aera of Time called <hi>the Indiction;</hi> uſed at <hi>Rome</hi> to this Day.</p>
                           <p>Thus did the Pope claim to himſelf the whole Authority over all Chriſtian Princes. Thus did he take away or confer Kingdoms and Empires, as a King of Kings. Neither did his Succeſſors fail to tread in his Steps. It is well known, the following Popes have not been wanting to exerciſe the ſame Power, both over Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. And this the later Popes have been ſo far from diſclaiming, that three of them have ſainted this very <hi>Gregory,</hi> namely, <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. <hi>Paul</hi> V. and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here is then the Beaſt, that is, the King: in Fact ſuch, though not in Name; according to that remarkable Obſervation of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> "Antichriſt will govern the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, yet without the Name of <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror."

                           <p>Thus the Time of the Aſcent of the Beaſt is clear.

                           <p>This deadly Wound was given him on his <hi>firſt</hi> Head <hi>by the ſword,</hi> (ver. 14.) that is, by the bloody Reſiſtance of the ſecular Potentates, particularly the <hi>German</hi> Emperors. Theſe had for a long Seaſon had the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> with her Biſhop, under their Juriſdiction. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> determined to caſt off this Yoke from his own, and to lay it on the Emperor's Shoulders. He broke looſe and excommunicated the Emperor, who maintained his Right by force, and gave the Pope ſuch a Blow, that one would have thought the Beaſt muſt have been killed thereby, immediately after his coming up. But he recovered and grew ſtronger than before. The firſt Head of the Beaſt extends from <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. at leaſt to <hi>Innocent</hi> III.

                           <p>Two deadly Symptoms attended this Wound, 1. Schiſms and open Ruptures in the Church. For while the Emperors aſſerted their Right, there were from the Year 1080 to the Year 1176 only, five open Diviſions, and at leaſt as many Antipopes, ſome of whom were indeed the rightful Popes. This was highly dangerous to the Papal Kingdoms. But a ſtill more dangerous Symptom was, 2. The riſing of the Nobility at <hi>Rome,</hi> who would not ſuffer their Biſhop to be a ſecular Prince, particularly over themſelves. Under <hi>Innocent</hi> II. they carried their Point, re-eſtabliſhed the ancient Common-wealth, took away from the Pope the Government of the City, and left him only his epiſcopal Authority.

                     <p>And after theſe things I ſaw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great power, and the earth was enlightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a loud voice,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſaying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an habitation of devils, and an hold of every unclean ſpirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.

From the Series of the whole Book, repreſenting one continued Chain of Events: 2. From the Circumſtances which precede. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's bringing forth is followed, by the caſting of the Dragon out of Heaven to the Earth. With this is connected the Third Wo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Dragon through, and with the Beaſt, rages horribly. At the Concluſion of the Third Wo the Beaſt is overthrown and caſt into the <hi>lake of five.</hi> At the ſame Time the other grand Enemy, the Dragon, ſhall be bound and ſhut up. 3. Theſe thouſand Years bring a new, full, and laſting Immunity from all outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Evils (the Authors of which are now removed) and an Afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Bleſſings. But ſuch a Time the Church has never yet ſeen. Therefore it is ſtill to come. 4. Theſe thouſand Years are followed by the laſt Times of the World, the letting looſe of Satan, who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers together <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and is thrown to the Beaſt and falſe Prophet in <hi>the lake of fire.</hi> Now Satan's accuſing the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his Rage on Earth, his Impriſonment in the Abyſs, his ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and being caſt into the Lake of Fire, evidently ſucceed each other. 5. What occurs from ch. xx. 11. to ch. xxii. 5. manifeſtly follows the Things related in the xixth Chapter. The thouſand Years came between: whereas if they were paſt, neither the Beginning nor the End of them would fall within this Period. <pb n="328" facs="unknown:046353_0327_10211281382A5F48"/> In a ſhort Time thoſe who aſſert, that they are now at hand, will appear to have ſpoken the Truth. Mean Time let every Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what Kind of Happineſs he expects therein. The Danger does not lie, in maintaining, that the thouſand Years are yet to come, but in interpreting them, whether paſt or to come, in a groſs and carnal Senſe. The Doctrine of the Son of GOD is a Myſtery. So is his Croſs: And ſo is his Glory. In all theſe he is a Sign that is ſpoken againſt. Happy they who believe and confeſs him in all.</p>

How great Things theſe! And how ſhort the Time! What is needful for us? Wiſdom, Patience, Faithfulneſs, Watchfulneſs. It is no Time to ſettle upon our Lees. This is not, if it be rightly underſtood, an acceptable Meſſage to the Wiſe, the Mighty, the Honourable of this World. Yet that which is to be done, ſhall be done. There is no Counſel againſt the Lord.</p>

Who and how many theſe are, is not ſaid.

One Kind of Death, which was particularly inflicted at <hi>Rome,</hi> is mentioned for all, <hi>for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, and for the word of</hi> GOD—The Martyrs were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times killed <hi>for the word of</hi> GOD in general, ſometimes particularly <hi>for the teſtimony of Jeſus:</hi> the one, while they refuſed to worſhip Idols; the other, while they confeſſed the Name of Chriſt, <hi>and thoſe who had not worſhipped the wild beaſt nor his image</hi>—Theſe ſeem to be a Company diſtinct from thoſe who appeared, ch. xv. 2. Thoſe <hi>overcame,</hi> probably, in ſuch Conteſts as theſe had not. Before the Number of the Beaſt was expired, the People were compelled to worſhip him, by the moſt dreadful Violence. But when the Beaſt <hi>was not,</hi> they were only ſeduced into it, by the Craft of the falſe Prophet, <hi>and they lived</hi>—Their Souls and Bodies being re-united, <hi>and reigned with Chriſt</hi>—Not on Earth, but in Heaven. The <hi>reigning on earth,</hi> mentioned ch. xi. 15. is quite different from this, <hi>a thouſand years</hi>—It muſt be obſerved, That two diſtinct thouſand Years, are mentioned throughout this whole Paſſage. Each is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned thrice; the thouſand wherein Satan is bound, ver. 2, 3. 7. the thouſand wherein the Saints ſhall reign, ver. 4, 5, 6. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer end before the End of the World; the latter reach to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſurrection. So that the Beginning and End of the former thouſand, is before the Beginning and End of the latter. Therefore as in the ſecond Verſe, at the firſt Mention of the former, ſo in the fourth Verſe at the firſt Mention of the latter, it is only ſaid <hi>a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> Years: in the other Places, <hi>the thouſand</hi> (ver. 3. 5. 7.) that is, the thouſand mentioned before. During the former, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning the flouriſhing State of the Church (ch. x. 7.) ſhall be fulfilled. During the latter, while the Saints reign with Chriſt in Heaven, Men on Earth will be careleſs and ſecure.</p>

All the former Things will be done away, that all may become new (ver. 4, 5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 10, 12.) <hi>are paſſed away</hi>—But in the fourth Verſe, it is ſaid <hi>are gone away.</hi> There the ſtronger Word is uſed: for <hi>Death, mourning, and ſorrow, go away</hi> altogether; the former Heaven and Earth only <hi>paſs away,</hi> giving place to the New Heaven and the New Earth.</p>
