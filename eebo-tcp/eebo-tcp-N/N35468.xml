            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>For your≈øelves, brethren, know our entrance to you,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that it was not in vain: But even after we had ≈øuffered before, and had been ≈øhamefully treated at Philippi, as ye know, we were bold thro' our God to ≈øpeak to you the go≈øpel of God with much contention. For our exhortation <hi>is</hi> not of deceit,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nor of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> nor in guile. But as we have been approved of God to be intru≈øted with the go≈øpel, ≈øo we ≈øpeak, not as plea≈øing men, but God who trieth our hearts. For neither at any time u≈øed we flattering words,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> as ye know, nor a cloak of covetou≈øne≈øs: God is witne≈øs:
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:046353_0036_10210EA81243C418"/>Nor ≈øought we glory of men,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burden≈øome, as the Apo≈øtles of Chri≈øt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> But we were gentle in the mid≈øt of you, even as a nur≈øe cheri≈øheth her own children.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> So, loving you tenderly, we were ready to impart to you not only the go≈øpel of God, but our own ≈øouls al≈øo,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> becau≈øe ye were dear to us. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the go≈øpel of God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Ye <hi>are</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes, and God, how ho≈øtly and ju≈øtly and unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we behaved among you that believe:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted every one of you, as a father his own children.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> And charged you to walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> For this cau≈øe al≈øo thank we God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cea≈øing, <hi>even</hi> becau≈øe when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us, ye received <hi>it,</hi> not <hi>as</hi> the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, who likewi≈øe effectually worketh in you that believe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, which are in Judea: for ye al≈øo ≈øuffered the ≈øame things from your own countrymen,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> as they likewi≈øe from the Jews: Who
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:046353_0037_10210EAD29F91A18"/>both killed the Lord Je≈øus and their own prophets, and have per≈øecuted us: and they plea≈øe not God, and are contrary to all men;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Forbidding us to ≈øpeak to the Gentiles, that they may be ≈øaved, to fill up their ≈øins always: but wrath is come upon them to the uttermo≈øt.</p>
                     <p>But we,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> brethren, being taken from you for a ≈øhort time, in pre≈øence, not in heart, laboured with great de≈øire the more abundantly to ≈øee your face.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Wherefore we would have come to you (even I Paul) once and again,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> but Satan hindered us. For what is our hope,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not ye al≈øo before our Lord Je≈øus at his appearing?</p>

                     <p>I thank my God,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you towards Chri≈øt Je≈øus.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> by con≈øtraint, but willingly. And perhaps for this end was he ≈øeparated for a ≈øea≈øon, that thou mighte≈øt have him for ever;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> count it all joy, when ye fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers temptations,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But let patience have <hi>its</hi> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If any of you want wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, let him a≈øk of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it ≈øhall be given him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But let him a≈øk in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like a wave of the ≈øea,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:046353_0139_1021101E2F0B55C0"/>driven with the wind and to≈ø≈øed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> For let not that man think that he ≈øhall receive any thing from the Lord.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> A double-minded man is un≈øtable in all his ways.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But the rich, in that he is made low; becau≈øe as the flower of the gra≈øs he ≈øhall pa≈øs away.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> For the ≈øun aro≈øe with a ≈øcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, and withered the gra≈øs, and the flower fell off, and the beauty of its form peri≈øhed: ≈øo al≈øo ≈øhall the rich man fade away in his ways. Happy <hi>is</hi> the man that endureth temptation:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> for when he hath been proved, he ≈øhall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promi≈øed to them that love him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Let no man who is tempted ≈øay, I am tempted of God a for God cannot be tempted with evil,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of fir≈øt fruits of his creatures.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore,

<pb n="142" facs="unknown:046353_0141_10211021DD684260"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Therefore laying a≈øide all the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and ≈øuperfluity of wickedne≈øs, receive with meekne≈øs the ingrafted word which is able to ≈øave your ≈øouls.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> deceiving your≈øelves. For if any one be an hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a gla≈øs.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> For he beheld him≈øelf, and went away, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> But he that looketh diligently into the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect law, <hi>the law</hi> of liberty, and continueth <hi>therein,</hi> this man being not a forgetful hearer, but a doet of the work, this man ≈øhall be happy in his doing.

The true Prede≈øtination, or Fore-appointment of GOD is, 1. He that believeth ≈øhall be ≈øaved, from the Guilt and Power of Sin. 2. He that endureth to the End, ≈øhall be ≈øaved eternally. 3. They who receive the precious Gift of Faith, thereby become the Sons of GOD: And being Sons, they ≈øhall receive the Spirit of Holine≈øs, to walk as <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> al≈øo walked. Throughout every Part of this Appointment of GOD, <hi>Promi≈øe</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> go Hand in Hand. All is free Gift; and yet ≈øuch is the Gift, that the final I≈ø≈øue depends on our future Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the heavenly Call. But other Prede≈øtination than this, either to Life or Death eternal, the Scripture knows not of. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is, 1. Cruel Re≈øpect of Per≈øons: An unju≈øt Regard of one, and an unju≈øt Di≈øregard of another. It is mere <hi>creature partiality,</hi> and not <hi>infinite Ju≈øtice:</hi> 2. It is not <hi>plain</hi> Scripture-Doctrine (if true:) but rather, incon≈øi≈øtent with the expre≈øs written Word, that ≈øpeaks of GOD's univer≈øal Offers of Grace: His Invitations, Promi≈øes, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, being all <hi>general.</hi> 3. We are bid to chu≈øe Life, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for not doing it. 4.

It is of fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence; all Men being ready, on very ≈ølight Grounds, to fancy <hi>them≈øelves</hi> of the Elect Number. But the Doctrine of Prede≈øtination is entirely changed from what it formerly was. <hi>Now</hi> it implies nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith, Peace, nor Purity. It is ≈øomething that will do <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> them all.

But ≈øuch fickly Life, of Soul or Body, will end in Death, and every Day draw nigher to it. Health is the Means of both natural and ≈øpiritual Growth. If the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil of our fallen Nature he not daily mortified, it will, like an evil Humour in the Body, de≈øtroy the whole Man. But <hi>if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body</hi> (only ≈øo far as we do this) <hi>ye ≈øhall live</hi> the Life of Faith, Holine≈øs, Happine≈øs. The End and De≈øign of Grace being purcha≈øed and be≈øtowed on us, is to de≈øtroy the Image of the earthly, and re≈øtore us to that of the heavenly. And ≈øo far as it does this, it truly profits us; and al≈øo makes Way for more of the heavenly Gift, that we may at la≈øt be filled with all the Fulne≈øs of GOD. The Strength and Well-being of a Chri≈øtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on what his Soul feeds on, as the Health of the Body depends on whatever we make our daily Food. If we feed on what is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Nature, we grow: if not, we pine away and die. The Soul is of the Nature of GOD, and nothing but what is according to his Holine≈øs can agree with it. Sin, of every Kind, ≈øtarves the Soul and makes it con≈øume away. Let us not try to invert the Order of GOD in his new Creation: We ≈øhall only deceive our≈øelves. It is ca≈øy to for≈øake the Will of GOD and follow our own; but this will bring Leanne≈øs into the Soul.

                  <p>THE great Similitude, or rather Samene≈øs both of Spirit and Expre≈ø≈øion, which runs through St. <hi>John</hi>'s Go≈øpel, and all his Epi≈øtles, is a clear Evidence of their being written by the ≈øame Per≈øon. In this Epi≈øtle he ≈øpeaks not to any particular Church, but to all the Chri≈øtians of that Age, and in them to the whole Chri≈øtian Church in all ≈øucceeding Ages.</p>
                  <p>Some have apprehended, that it is not ea≈øy to di≈øcern the Scope and Method of this Epi≈øtle. But if we examine it with Simplicity, the≈øe may readily be di≈øcovered. St. <hi>John</hi> in this Letter, or rather Tract (for he was pre≈øent with Part of tho≈øe to whom he wrote) has this apparent Aim, To confirm the happy and holy Communion of the Faithful with GOD and <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> by de≈øcribing the Marks of that ble≈ø≈øed State.</p>
                  <p>The Parts of it are Three:

Nothing can ≈øeparate the Spirit from the Father and the Son. If He were not one with the Father and the Son, the Apo≈øtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought to have ≈øaid, <hi>The Father and the Word</hi> (who are one) <hi>and the Spirit are two.</hi> But this is contrary to the whole Tenor of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                           <p>It is ob≈øervable, the Three in the one Ver≈øe are oppo≈øed not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly, but ≈øeverally to the Three in the other: As if he had ≈øaid, not only the Spirit te≈øtifies, but al≈øo the Father; (<hi>John</hi> v. 37.) Not only the Water, but al≈øo the Word: (<hi>John</hi> iii. 11. x. 41.) Not only the Blood, but al≈øo the Holy Gho≈øt. (<hi>John</hi> xv. 26, &amp;c.) It mu≈øt now appear to every rea≈øonable Man, how ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary the eighth Ver≈øe is. St. <hi>John</hi> could not think of the Te≈øtimony of the Spirit, and Water, and Blood, and ≈øubjoin <hi>The te≈øtimony of God is greater,</hi> without thinking al≈øo of the Te≈øtimony of the Son and Holy Gho≈øt, yea and mentioning it in ≈øo ≈øolemn an Enumeration. Nor can any po≈ø≈øible Rea≈øon be devi≈øed, why without <hi>Three te≈øtifying in heaven</hi>‚Äîhe ≈øhould enumerate <hi>Three,</hi> and no more <hi>who te≈øtify on earth</hi>‚ÄîThe Te≈øtimony of all is given <hi>on earth,</hi> not <hi>in heaven,</hi> but <pb n="204" facs="unknown:046353_0203_102110EDFA0B5448"/> they who te≈øtify are part on Earth, part in Heaven; the Witne≈ø≈øes who are on Earth te≈øtify chiefly concerning his Abode on Earth, though not excluding his State of Exaltation. The Witne≈ø≈øes who are in Heaven te≈øtify chiefly concerning his Glory at GOD's Right Hand, though not excluding his State of Humiliation.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øeventh Ver≈øe therefore, with the ≈øixth, contains a Recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of the whole Oeconomy of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> from his Bapti≈øm to Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teco≈øt: The eighth, the Sum of the divine Oeconomy, from the Time of his Exaltation.</p>

               <div type="introduction">
                  <p>'TIS ≈øcarce po≈ø≈øible for any that either love or fear GOD, not to feel their Hearts extremely affected, in ≈øeriou≈øly reading either the Beginning, or the latter Part of <hi>the Revelation.</hi> The≈øe, 'tis evident, we cannot con≈øider too much: but the intermediate Parts I did not ≈øtudy at all for many Years: As utterly de≈øpairing of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding them, after the fruitle≈øs Attempts of ≈øo many wi≈øe and good Men; and perhaps I ≈øhould have lived and died in this Sentiment, had I not ≈øeen the Works of the great <hi>Bengelius.</hi> But the≈øe revived my Hopes of under≈øtanding even the Prophecies of this Book: At lea≈øt many of them in ≈øome good Degree; for perhaps ≈øome will not be opened but in Eternity. Let us however ble≈øs GOD for the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of Light we may enjoy, and improve it to his Glory.</p>
                  <p>The following Notes are mo≈øtly tho≈øe of that excellent Man; a few of which are taken from his <hi>Gnomon Novi Te≈øtamenti,</hi> but far more from his <hi>Ekklarte Offenbarung,</hi> which is a full and regular Comment on <hi>the Revelation.</hi> Every Part of this I do not undertake to defend. But none ≈øhould condemn him, without reading his Proofs at large. It did not ≈øuit my De≈øign to in≈øert the≈øe: they are above the Capacity of ordinary Readers. Nor had I Room to in≈øert the entire Tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Book which contains near twelve hundred Pages.</p>
                  <p>All I can do is, partly to tran≈ølate, partly abridge the mo≈øt nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary of his Ob≈øervations; allowing my≈øelf the Liberty to alter ≈øome of them, and to add a few Notes where he is not full. His Text, it may be ob≈øerved, I have taken almo≈øt throughout, which I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:046353_0219_1021125935E45360"/>he has abundantly defended both in the <hi>Gnomon</hi> it≈øelf, and in his <hi>Apparatus</hi> and <hi>Cri≈øis in Apocalyp≈øin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I by no means pretend to under≈øtand, or explain all that is contained in this my≈øterious Book. I only offer what Help I can to the ≈øerious Enquirer, and ≈øhall rejoice if any be moved thereby, more carefully to read and more deeply to con≈øider the Words of this Prophecy. Ble≈ø≈øed is he that does this with a ≈øingle Eye. His La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ≈øhall not be in vain.</p>

                           <p>In this Book our LORD has comprized what was wanting in tho≈øe Prophecies, touching the Time which followed his A≈øcen≈øion, and the End of the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Polity.

The Introduction and Conclu≈øion agree with <hi>Daniel;</hi> the De≈øcription of the Man-Child and the Promi≈øes to <hi>Sion</hi> with <hi>I≈øaiah;</hi> the Judgment of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> Again, the Determination of Times with <hi>Daniel:</hi> the Architecture of the Holy City, with <hi>Ezehiel;</hi> the Emblems of the Hor≈øes, Candle≈øticks, &amp;c. with <hi>Zechariab.</hi> Many Things largely de≈øcribed by the Prophets are here ≈øummarily repeated; and frequently in the ≈øame Words. To them we may then u≈øefully have Recour≈øe. Yet the <hi>Revelation</hi> ≈øuffices for the explaining it≈øelf, even if we do not yet under≈øtand tho≈øe Prophecies; yea, it ca≈øts much Light upon them. Frequently likewi≈øe, where there is a Re≈øemblance between them, there is a Difference al≈øo; <hi>the Revelation</hi> as it were taking a Stock from one of the old Prophets, and in≈øerting a new Graft into it. Thus <hi>Zechariah</hi> ≈øpeaks of two Olive-trees. And ≈øo does St. <hi>John;</hi> but with a different Meaning. <hi>Daniel</hi> has a Bea≈øt with Ten Horns. So has St. <hi>John;</hi> but not with quite the ≈øame Signification. And here the Difference of Words, Emblems, Things, Times ought ≈øtudiou≈øly to be ob≈øerved.</p>
                           <p>Our LORD foretold many Things before his Pa≈ø≈øion; but not all Things: For it was not yet ≈øea≈øonable. Many Things likewi≈øe his Spirit foretold in the Writings of the Apo≈øtles, ≈øo far as the Nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øities of tho≈øe Times required, now be comprizes them all in one ≈øhort Book; therein pre≈øuppo≈øing all the other Prophecies, and at the ≈øame Time, explaining, containing, and perfecting them in one Thread. It is right therefore to compare them; but not to mea≈øure the Fulne≈øs of the≈øe by the Scantine≈øs of tho≈øe preceding.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> when on Faith, foretold what would come to pa≈øs in a ≈øhort Time; adding a brief De≈øcription of the la≈øt Things. Here he foretells the intermediate Things; ≈øo that both put together, con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute one compleat Chain of Prophecy. This Book is therefore not only the Sum, and the Key of all the Prophecies which preceded, but likewi≈øe a Supplement to all; the Seals being clo≈øed before. Of Con≈øequence it contains many Particulars, not revealed in any other Part of Scripture. They have therefore little Gratitude to GOD for ≈øuch a Revelation, re≈øerved for the Exaltation of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> who boldly reject whatever they find here, which was not revealed, or not ≈øo clearly in other Parts of Scripture. <hi>He that readeth and they that bear</hi> ‚ÄîSt. <hi>John</hi> probably ≈øent this Book by a ≈øingle Per≈øon into <hi>A≈øia,</hi> who <pb n="223" facs="unknown:046353_0222_10211125CC3D7410"/> 
                              <hi>read</hi> it in the Churches, while many <hi>heard.</hi> But this likewi≈øe in a ≈øecondary Sen≈øe refers to all that ≈øhall duly read or hear it in all Ages. <hi>The words of this prophecy</hi>‚ÄîIt is a <hi>Revelation</hi> with regard to <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> who gives it, <hi>a prophecy</hi> with regard to <hi>John</hi> who delivers it to the Churches. <hi>And keep the things which are written therein</hi>‚ÄîIn ≈øuch a Manner as the Nature of them requires; namely, with Repentance, Faith, Patience, Prayer, Obedience, Watchfulne≈øs, Con≈øtancy. It behoves every Chri≈øtian, at all Opportunities to read what is written in the Oracles of GOD; and to read this precious Book in particular, frequently, reverently, and attentively. <hi>For the time</hi> of its Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be accompli≈øhed, <hi>is near</hi>‚ÄîEven when St. <hi>John</hi> wrote.

In each Church there was one Pa≈øtor or Ruling Mini≈øter, to whom all the Re≈øt were ≈øubordinate.

                                 </gap>l;</hi> but the other, which occurs here, implies much more. This Holine≈øs is the Sum of all prai≈øe, which is given to the Almighty Creator, for all that he does and reveals concerning him≈øelf, till the new Song beings with it new Matter of Glory.</p>
                           <p>This Word properly ≈øignifies <hi>≈øeparated,</hi> both in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and other Languages. And when GOD is termed Holy, it denotes that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which is altogether peculiar to him≈øelf; and the Glory flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all his Attributes conjoined, ≈øhining forth from all his Works, and darkening all Things be≈øides it≈øelf, whereby he is, and eternally remains, in an incomprehen≈øible Manner <hi>≈øeparate</hi> and at a Di≈øtance, not only from all that is impure, but likewi≈øe from all that is created.</p>
                           <p>GOD is <hi>≈øeparate</hi> from all Things. He is, and works from him≈øelf, out of him≈øelf, in him≈øelf, thro' him≈øelf, for him≈øelf. Therefore He is the Fir≈øt and the La≈øt, the only One and the Eternal, Living and Happy, Endle≈øs and Unchangeable, Almighty, Omni≈øcient, Wi≈øe and True, Ju≈øt and Faithful, Gracious and Merciful.</p>
                           <p>Hence it is, that Holy and Holine≈øs mean the ≈øame as GOD and Godhead; and as we ≈øay of a King, <hi>His Maje≈øty,</hi> ≈øo the Scripture ≈øays of GOD, <hi>His Holine≈øs. (Heb.</hi> xii. 10.) The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of GOD. When GOD is ≈øpoken of, he is often named, <hi>The Holy One.</hi> And as GOD ≈øwears by his Name, ≈øo he does al≈øo by his Holine≈øs, that is, by Him≈øelf.</p>
                           <p>This Holine≈øs is often ≈øtiled Glory; often his Holine≈øs and Glory are celebrated together. (<hi>Lev.</hi> x. 3. <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> vi. 3.) for Holine≈øs is covered Glory, and Glory is uncovered Holine≈øs. The Scripture ≈øpeaks abundantly of the Holine≈øs and Glory of the Father, the Son <pb n="246" facs="unknown:046353_0245_10211175F3F2B0D8"/> and the Holy Gho≈øt. And hereby is the My≈øtery of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity eminently confirmed.</p>
                           <p>That is al≈øo termed <hi>Holy,</hi> which is con≈øecrated to Him, and for that End <hi>≈øeparated</hi> from other Things. And ≈øo is that wherein we may be like GOD, or united to him.</p>
                           <p>In the Hymn re≈øembling this, recorded by <hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> ch. vi. 3. is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>The whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> But this is deferred in <hi>the Revelation,</hi> till the Glory of the LORD (his Enemies being de≈øtroyed) fills the Earth.</p>

They ≈øwiftly follow the Letters to the ≈øeven Churches, and all begin almo≈øt at the ≈øame Time. By the four former is ≈øhewn, That all the public Occurrences of all Ages and Nations, as <hi>Empire, War, Provi≈øion, Calamities,</hi> are made ≈øubject to <hi>Chri≈øt.</hi> And In≈øtances are intimated of the Fir≈øt in the Ea≈øt, the Second in the We≈øt, the Third in the South, the Fourth in the North and the whole World.</p>
                           <p>The Contents, as of the Phials and Trumpets, ≈øo of the Seals, are ≈øhewn, by the Songs of Prai≈øe and Thank≈øgiving annexed to them. They contain therefore <hi>the power, and riches, and wi≈ødom, and ≈øtrength, and honour, and glory, and ble≈ø≈øing,</hi> which the Lamb received. The four former have a peculiar Connexion with each other; and ≈øo have the three latter Seals. The former relate to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible Things, toward the four Quarters to which the four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures look.</p>
                           <p>Before we proceed, it may be ob≈øerved, 1. No Man ≈øhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrain either him≈øelf or another, to explain <hi>every thing</hi> in this Book. It is ≈øufficient for every one to ≈øpeak, ju≈øt ≈øo far as he under≈øtands. 2. We ≈øhould remember, that altho' the ancient Prophets wrote the Occurrences of tho≈øe Kingdoms only with which <hi>I≈ørael</hi> had to do, yet <hi>the Revelation</hi> contains what relates to the whole World, through which the Chri≈øtian Church is extended. Yet, 3. We ≈øhould not pre≈øcribe to this Prophecy, as if it mu≈øt needs admit or exclude this or that hi≈øtory, according as we judge one or the other, to be of great or ≈ømall Importance. GOD <hi>≈øeeth not as a man ≈øeeth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what we think great is often omitted, what we think little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted, in Scripture-Hi≈øtory or Prophecy. 4. We mu≈øt take care, not to overlook what is already fulfilled; and not to de≈øcribe as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled what is ≈øtill to come.</p>
                           <p>We are to look in Hi≈øtory for the fulfilling of the four fir≈øt Seals, quickly after the Date of the Prophecy. In each of the≈øe appears a different Hor≈øeman. In each we are to con≈øider, fir≈øt, The Hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man him≈øelf; ≈øecondly, What he does.</p>
                           <p>The Hor≈øeman him≈øelf, by an emblematical Pro≈øopopoeia, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents <hi>a ≈øwift Power,</hi> bringing with it either, 1. A ≈ølouri≈øhing State, or, 2. Blood≈øhed, or, 3. Scarcity of Provi≈øions, or, 4. Public Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raities. With the Quality of each of the≈øe Riders, the Colour of his Hor≈øe agrees. The fourth Hor≈øeman is expre≈øsly termed <hi>Death;</hi> the Fir≈øt, with his Bow and Crown, a Conqueror. The Second, with his great Sword, is a Warrior, or, as the <hi>Romans</hi> termed him, <hi>Mars:</hi> The Third, with the Scales, has Power over the Produce of the Land. Particular Incidents under this or that <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øive enough to an≈øwer any of the≈øe Hor≈øemen.</p>
                           <p>The Action of every Hor≈øeman intimates farther, 1. Toward the Ea≈øt, wide ≈øpread Empire and Victory upon Victory; 2. Toward the <pb n="252" facs="unknown:046353_0251_1021118828E21080"/> We≈øt, much Blood≈øhed; 3. Toward the South, Scarcity of Provi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; 4. Toward the North, the Plague and various Calamities.</p>

                              <hi>Wo to the earth and to the ≈øea</hi>‚ÄîThis is the fourth and la≈øt Denunciation of the Third Wo, the mo≈øt grievous of all. The Fir≈øt was only, the Second chiefly <hi>on the earth,</hi> A≈øia: The Third both on the Earth <hi>and the Sea,</hi> Europe. The Earth is mentioned fir≈øt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it began in <hi>A≈øia,</hi> before the Bea≈øt brought it on <hi>Europe. He knoweth he hath but a little time</hi>‚ÄîWhich extends from his ca≈øting out of Heaven to his being ca≈øt into the Aby≈øs.</p>
                           <p>We are now come to a mo≈øt important Period of Time. The <hi>New-chronos</hi> ha≈øtens to an End. We live in the <hi>little time</hi> wherein Satan hath great Wrath; and this <hi>little time</hi> is now upon the Decline. We are in the <hi>time, times, and half a time,</hi> wherein the Woman is <hi>fed in the wilderne≈øs;</hi> yea, the la≈øt Part of it <hi>the half time</hi> is begun. We are (as will be ≈øhewn) towards the Clo≈øe of the <hi>forty two months</hi> of the Bea≈øt; and when his Number is fulfilled, grievous Things will be.</p>
                           <p>Let him who does not regard the being ≈øeized by the Wrath of the Devil, the falling unawares into the General Temptation, the being borne away by the mo≈øt dreadful Violence into the Wor≈øhip of the Bea≈øt and his Image, and con≈øequently drinking the unmixt Wine of the Wrath of GOD, and being tormented Day and Night for ever and ever in the Lake of Fire and Brim≈øtone: Let him al≈øo who is confident, that he can make his Way thro' all the≈øe, by his own Wi≈ødom and Strength, without Need of any ≈øuch peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervative as the Word of this Prophecy affords: Let him, I ≈øay, go hence. But let him who does not take the≈øe Warnings for ≈øen≈øele≈øs Outcries and blind Alarms, beg of GOD, with all po≈ø≈øible Earne≈øtne≈øs, to give him his heavenly Light herein.</p>
                           <p>GOD has not given this Prophecy, in ≈øo ≈øolemn a Manner, only to ≈øhew his Providence over his Church; but al≈øo that his Servants may know at all Times in what particular Period they are. And <pb n="287" facs="unknown:046353_0286_102111FEC91CCB50"/> the more dangerous any Period of Time is, the greater is the Help which it affords. But where may we fix the Beginning and End of the <hi>little time?</hi> Which is probably four-fifths of a <hi>Chronos,</hi> or ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above 888 Years. This, which is the Time of the third Wo, may reach from 947 to the Year 1836. For, 1. The ≈øhort Interval of the ≈øecond Wo (which Wo ended in the Year 840) and the 777 Years of the Woman, which began about the Year 84<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>, quickly after which followed the War in Heaven, fix the Beginning not long after 864. And thus the third Wo falls in the tenth Century, extending from 900 to 1000, called the <hi>Dark,</hi> the <hi>Iron,</hi> the <hi>uhappy Age.</hi> 2. If we compare the Length of the third Wo, with the Period of Time which ≈øucceeds it in the twentieth Chapter, it is but a <hi>little time</hi> to that va≈øt Space which reaches from the Beginning of the <hi>Non-chronos</hi> to the End of the World.</p>

                              <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. It is one and the ≈øame Bea≈øt, having ≈øeven Heads, and ten Horns, which is de≈øcribed in this and in the xviith Chapter. Of Con≈øequence his Heads are the ≈øame, and his Horns al≈øo.</p>

                              <hi>P.</hi> 2. This Bea≈øt is a ≈øpiritually-≈øecular Power, oppo≈øite to the Kingdom of Chri≈øt. A Power not merely Spiritual or Eccle≈øia≈øtical, nor merely Secular or Political; but a Mixture of both. He is a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prince; for a Crown, yea and a Kingdom are a≈øcribed to him. And yet he is not merely Secular. For he is al≈øo a <hi>fal≈øe Prophet.</hi>

                           <p>This deadly Wound was given him on his <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Head <hi>by the ≈øword,</hi> (ver. 14.) that is, by the bloody Re≈øi≈øtance of the ≈øecular Potentates, particularly the <hi>German</hi> Emperors. The≈øe had for a long Sea≈øon had the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> with her Bi≈øhop, under their Juri≈ødiction. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> determined to ca≈øt off this Yoke from his own, and to lay it on the Emperor's Shoulders. He broke loo≈øe and excommunicated the Emperor, who maintained his Right by force, and gave the Pope ≈øuch a Blow, that one would have thought the Bea≈øt mu≈øt have been killed thereby, immediately after his coming up. But he recovered and grew ≈øtronger than before. The fir≈øt Head of the Bea≈øt extends from <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. at lea≈øt to <hi>Innocent</hi> III.

                           </p>
                           <p>Two deadly Symptoms attended this Wound, 1. Schi≈øms and open Ruptures in the Church. For while the Emperors a≈ø≈øerted their Right, there were from the Year 1080 to the Year 1176 only, five open Divi≈øions, and at lea≈øt as many Antipopes, ≈øome of whom were indeed the rightful Popes.

The ri≈øing of the Nobility at <hi>Rome,</hi> who would not ≈øuffer their Bi≈øhop to be a ≈øecular Prince, particularly over them≈øelves. Under <hi>Innocent</hi> II. they carried their Point, re-e≈øtabli≈øhed the ancient Common-wealth, took away from the Pope the Government of the City, and left him only his epi≈øcopal Authority.

The Danger does not lie, in maintaining, that the thou≈øand Years are yet to come, but in interpreting them, whether pa≈øt or to come, in a gro≈øs and carnal Sen≈øe. The Doctrine of the Son of GOD is a My≈øtery. So is his Cro≈øs: And ≈øo is his Glory. In all the≈øe he is a Sign that is ≈øpoken again≈øt. Happy they who believe and confe≈øs him in all.</p>
