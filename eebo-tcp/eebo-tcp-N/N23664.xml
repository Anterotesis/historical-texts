                  <note>Generally attributed to William Duane. Attributed by Evans to ---- Treziulney, on the basis of the following from the autobiography of Mathew Carey: "A Pole, by the name of Treziulney, who acted as book-keeper for Mr. Duane, wrote a pamphlet, the object of which was to prove the utter incapacity of General Washington, as displayed during the revolution." The present work, though harshly critical of Washington, does not discuss his competence during the Revolution.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE cauſe of Civil Liberty owes you much, and your country ſtill more; hitherto you have been conſidered as the man whom poſterity ſhould hold up as an example to every people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be free.</p>
            <p>Since the days of Columbus no man has appeared in a more conſpicuous and dignified character—glory collected round you, and, for a while, like the ſun in the centre of the univerſe, you influenced and attracted the admiration of mankind.</p>
            <p>To what cauſes muſt I attribute the alteration that has already taken place, in the ſentiments of the world concerning you?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:031315_0003_0FEC0ABDC7053208"/>
Had the French revolution commenced ten years later, or you retired to the ſhades of Mount Vernon four years ago, the friends of public virtue would ſtill proudly boaſt of one great man free from the breath of public diſpraiſe, and your fondly partial country, forbearing to enquire whether or not you were chargable with private aberrations, would vaunt in you the poſſeſſion of the phenix.</p>
            <p>But it is to be feared that the temper of your mind has been miſtaken by all but thoſe who, uniting evil with ambitious diſpoſitions, prevailed over your judgment to the prejudice of your reputation.</p>
            <p>This is the tender opinion of men warmly attached to you: but it is alſo alleged that the world has haſtily eſtimated your character from imperfect materials, and your addreſs of the 17th of September is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as an evidence of the fact, and as a phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in the political world even at this eventful era.</p>
            <p>That production has excited the moſt oppoſite emotions: on one ſide aſtoniſhment and affliction—on the other exultation and gladneſs: thoſe of the latter temper uniformly conſiſt of the avowed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of equal Liberty, the decided friends of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the open advocates of privileged and diſtinct claſſes, but what above all ſhould render ſuch joy ſuſpicious to you, is, that none are more loud than that numerous body among us, who, after embrewing their patricidal hands in the blood of our parents, relatives, and friends, were yet admitted in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous moment of our victory to a participation of that freedom which they had laboured to deſtroy, and upon equal terms with thoſe who achieved it!—When all theſe, and theſe only rejoice and extol your addreſs to the ſkies, I need not ſay who mourn in ſilence and ſhame!</p>
            <p>You are not inſenſible of that eſtimation in which you have been hitherto held by foreign nations, nor of the celebrity you were likely to obtain in hiſtory,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031315_0004_0FEC0AC106D18B60"/>neither have you been indifferent to fame; you know better than any other man the juſt extent of your claims to the affections of your country, and you cannot be inſenſible how full the meaſure of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude has been with which you have been conſtantly repaid.</p>
            <p>It is among the amiable errors of our nature, and already appears a too prominent feature in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our countrymen, to carry the generous ſenſe of gratitude for great ſervices, and admiration of ſplendid actions, into the extremes of confidence and devotion—to proſtrate reaſon at the altar of blind and undiſcriminating affections, and to ſacrifice or forſake principles at the inſtigations of zeal; thus it is that men, ſuffering veneration to miſlead their judgment, learn to ſanctify frailties and vices.</p>
            <p>This temper ſo innocent in its ſource, all hiſtory proves to have been moſt dangerous to the happineſs of nations; the influence of power in corrupting the human heart, is univerſally acknowleged; how few of thoſe who poſſeſs it are there, that can learn to doubt the wiſdom of their own meaſures, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for themſelves upon rules which they proſcribe for the adoption of mankind; in vain do we cheriſh in remembrance the magnaninity that called Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnatus from the plough, if we forget the cauſe and manner of his departure from Rome.</p>
            <p>That you have loſt ſome ſhare of your glorious celebrity is not to be denied, but lamented;—and as different paſſions prevail various cauſes will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for this extrordinary decadence:—it is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in which your country is moſt ſeriouſly intereſted, ſince it may ultimately influence her degeneracy or Freedom.</p>
            <p>You know that the obligations which bind the citizen to his country periſh at the moment he ceaſes to be free;—you know that as all men are equally intereſted in that Freedom, ſo perpetual watchfulneſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031315_0005_0FEC0AC2C0607F20"/>is equally the duty of every individual, in the hour wherein he conceives there is danger:—the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nations are laid in remote cauſes, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of opinion until it begins to operate, he who thinks he perceives the germ of a plague is bound to explore it, that men may be aware of their danger.</p>
            <p>Your addreſs in my mind is fraught with incalcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable evils to your country!—</p>
            <p>It affords a moſt ſerious leſſon indeed to the people of America, and to every other nation who <hi>may yet have to adopt a model</hi> in realizing their Liberties.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt acknowledge it painful—it is difficult to diſcuſs your ſentiments while the affections would fain palliate and commute the failings of age, and the errors of a virtuous man perhaps deceived, for ſubſtantial bleſſings and benefits ſecured under better auſpices.</p>
            <p>But Truth and Liberty, which are not the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a day or a generation, will not ſanction that weakneſs akin to vice, which would throw a veil over the errors even of the moſt perfect of mankind; juſtice however calls upon me to declare, that by me and every true American, your courſe of public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has always been viewed with the tendereſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; too young to have perſonally ſhared in the hazards and glories of the revolution, I am not yet ſo young as not to have partaken of its cares and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieties, and of that dear and durable ſympathy which is the concommitant of an intereſt in great perils and great achievements. In the liſping leſſons of infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and in the ardency of youth, we learned from the amiable praiſes of our mothers to lean fondly on your name; and the ſtranger who flies from the bondage and oppreſſion of Europe, hourly hears in the prevailing themes of domeſtic diſcourſe and the leſſons we teach our children, how cloſely the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of America cling around you. Yes! Sir; Truth unconſtrained but always juſt muſt place you
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031315_0006_0FEC0AC46A787B78"/>in an exalted rank among the great men whom hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry celebrates for the imitation of poſterity: But Truth diſowns a homage to your errors.</p>
            <p>In paying a fair and honeſt tribute of acknowleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your private and public virtues, extenſive in no common degree, you will perceive that I know the nature of the ground upon which I ſtand, while I venture from retirement, and without the ſanction of a name, to queſtion your meaſures, and to diſplay with bold but candid freedom what I ſee or think I ſee therein—of an alarming and pernicious tendency; to examine and diſplay ſentiments of yours, which I deem inconſiſtent with yourſelf, incompatible with the profeſſed ſincerity of your character, and repug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant to the pureſt maxims of liberality, wiſdom, and morals.</p>
            <p>Deeply impreſſed with theſe feelings, on the firſt peruſal of your addreſs, I determined to await the return of calmer emotions, till ſurprize and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion ſhould abate: cool reflection and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation have ſtrengthened the firſt impreſſions; I reſolved to await the public determination, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear opinion flowing from ignorant but honeſt affection, or haſtening on the wings of ſervility or party adulation, from all quarters of the Union;—but the period is arrived when your addreſs has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the tour of the States — I ſtop to mark the awful and emphatic ſilence! — Excepting the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary and inane cant of bookſellers, and the ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry voice of thoſe who <hi>"venture to approach you!"</hi> from <hi>Shepherds-town,</hi> a diſmal ſullen ſilence prevails! even the the public papers conſpicuous for their abject and humiliating praiſe, or on the other ſide for freedom and licenteouſneſs, have alike maintained the ſame ſurprizing and ſuſpicious forbearance!</p>
            <p>Certainly there muſt have been ſome potent cauſe to produce from ſuch diſcordant aſſimilations one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and continued ſilence — has it not forced a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031315_0007_0FEC0AC60DEE6BE8"/>ſigh from from your boſom, and told your unwilling apprehenſions <hi>there is ſomething wrong!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would to God you had obeyed the internal moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that prompted your too wavering ſenſe to ſpeak that faithful but ineffectual truth,—<hi>"Here perhaps I ought to ſtop!"</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Preſident's Addreſs Ormrod's Edition P. 6.</note>: the ſincere effuſions of tenderneſs, untinged by party colouring and irritation, would be treaſured up for ever and transferred without guile to our children, whoſe morning oriſons ſhould be, <q>unceaſing vows to heaven to continue the choiceſt tokens of beneficence,</q> which you wiſhed us <q>in the free conſtitution the work of your hands—that its adminiſtration in every department may be ſtamped with wiſdom and virtue—that in fine the happineſs of the people in thoſe ſtates, under the auſpices of LIBERTY may be complete by ſo careful a preſervation and ſo prudent a uſe of this bleſſing, as will acquire to them the glory of <hi>recommending it to every nation which is yet a ſtranger to it.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Had you ſtopped there, partiality would have ſtrove to bury, at leaſt in ſome degree the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of certain truths out of reſpect to you;—but the ſubſequent pages of your addreſs demand the examination which is the purpoſe of this letter: I at firſt propoſed to convey my remarks to you in a private manner; but conſidering the foundation of the evil effects which I apprehend from your addreſs, as already laid, I have judged it more proper to lay them before the people who are alone eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerned.</p>
            <p>You are ſo ſtrongly fixed in the affections of the greater part of my fellow citizens, and not without great right, except in that dangerous extreme which leads to imbibing the effects of your prejudices as the reſults of wiſdom, that I can expect to find but a minority willing to examine diſpaſſionately the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031315_0008_0FEC0AD1182A2070"/>obſervations which I offer: nevertheleſs, it would ill become me on ſuch an occaſion to ſhrink from the ſenſe of duty — ſince my opinions, if erroneous, are open to refutation, and can do you no injury; but in expreſſing them I ſhall ſpeak with the frankneſs of a Freeman, I ſhall not couch my ſentiments under a treacherous garb of words ſuſceptible of a double interpretation —a conduct that would ill become any man in a juſt cauſe, but particularly in his own cauſe or that of the public.</p>
            <p>Your addreſs, excluſive of that excellent intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction compoſing the firſt ſix pages, where you ought to have ſtopped, principally conſiſts of three branches, generally connected, but requiring for perſpicuity's ſake a diſtinct examination.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 What relates to the permanency and indiviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Union.</item>

               <item>3 The beſt policy with regard to foreign nations.</item>
            </list>
            <p>On the firſt of theſe heads you teſtify to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the national affection for Freedom, and juſtly conſider the unity of the government as a main pillar of our independence—of our internal tranquillity and external ſecurity—of our peace and proſperity—and of that Liberty we ſo highly prize; but from that point to the concluſion, there prevails a ſpirit of ambiguity and recrimination, blended with maxims good and evil, that are at variance with each other and that magnanimity and openneſs which would beſpeak conſcious virtue and become the true friend of Freedom; — which ſhould never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by the moral man and the hero of a free nation when dictating <hi>leſſens profeſſedly for the advantage of his fellow citizens, and calculated to make a ſtrong and laſting impreſſion"—"to moderate the fury of party rage"</hi>—"to warn againſt the miſchief of foreign intrigues"—and "to guard againſt the <hi>impoſtures</hi> of <hi>pretended</hi> Patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:031315_0009_0FEC0AD2AEF83350"/>
It is fit in this place to call to remembrance, that during the early part of your public life, candor has been the avowed rule of your public and private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and it is from that engaging quality above all others you have derived the unlimitted confidence of your country and the reſpect of other nations; not ſo much from being conſpicuous in you, but becauſe duplicity and reſerve, ſelf-ſufficiency and ſecrecy, have been heretofore the cloaks which covered the wily miſchiefs of politicians in all the governments of the old world.</p>
            <p>Within the laſt four years, at a period which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainable, but needing now no particular diſcuſſion ſince it will live in hiſtory, you departed from that precious rule, and the procedure and language of old politicians and politics have pervaded all your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſince. I ſhall barely notice one tranſaction, ſince that alone is a ſufficient evidence of the conduct to which I allude, and affords an example that ſhould be a conſtant warning to Freemen how they repoſe extenſive power in the hands of any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, however dignified by his ſervices or patriotiſm, for any conſiderable length of time: I mean your refuſal to grant to the juſt wiſhes of <hi>the people's repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives,</hi> to the joint wiſhes of <hi>hoth houſes,</hi> a peruſal of papers concerning the people's own affairs, and for whom you ſhould not have forgot you were but a reſponſible agent. I am aware, that under the fatal forms of <hi>ſtate ſecrecy, privilege of office,</hi> or powers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to belong to the preſidential character, which in fact are neither more nor leſs than the worſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graftments from <hi>Machiavelian policy,</hi> and the actual eſſence of <hi>monarchical prerogative;</hi> this conduct is affected to be juſtified, but by ſuch frail diſguiſes and foul adviſers you have been betrayed to withhold the correſpondence on the Britiſh Treaty, —to treat your country as an enemy, whom you wiſhed to overcome by ſtratagem, and like a ſkilful general
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031315_0010_0FEC0AD504397778"/>in the career of ſucceſs, dictated conditions which degraded the ſubjugated by leaving them the ſhew of deliberation without the means to deliberate, — when the conditions of ſurrender were already irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable! But from that fatal moment, when you liſtened to the ſeductions of your deadlieſt enemies, in oppoſition to the voice of Freedom which hates diſguiſe, the brightneſs of your countenance is ſaid to have faded, the glory that ſhone round you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in miſt, and like our firſt parents, you have borne about you the viſible evidences of internal regret, and the perturbations of virtue ſtruggling between pride and conſcious error; from that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py hour the enemies of Liberty and your Country called you <hi>their own,</hi> and the name of WASHINGTON ſunk from the elevated rank of the SOLONS and LYCURGUSES to the inſignificance of a <hi>Venetian Doge</hi> or a <hi>Dutch Stadtholder!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On that baleful day, the boaſted candor, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified openneſs, the communicative diſintereſtedneſs of patriotiſm, became more than equivocal, and the clouds of ſuſpicion hovered round you; American politics became diſcoloured with the jaundiced hue of deſpotiſm and cabinet cunning, and the world was brought once more to look upon the conſtant declaration of your moſt vociferous panegyriſts, that "<hi>pure</hi> republicaniſm is a <hi>fiction,</hi>" as a fatal truth, and the American States but as one more of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines calculated for management of a capricious or weak individual; the popular repreſentation from that period loſt is reſpectability, and was degraded into the character of an old French Parliament, kept only for the mere ceremony of receiving implicitly and regiſtering without the toleration of enquiry the <hi>edicts which the ſovereign wills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a more fatal effect reſults from this meaſure, in the precedent held out to your ſucceſſors, whoſe ambition may not be circumſcribed by age or the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031315_0011_0FEC0AD69CF8EA78"/>want of heirs, nor by the yet vigorous hatred which ſubſiſts upon experience againſt the evils of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: earneſtly as you warn your country againſt the dangers to be apprehended from deſpotiſm through faction, you in this inſtance left a breach, at which ambition may enter with trifold force and facility, where entrenched behind the authority of your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and aided by pliant inſtruments in public ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which it is feared our country already affords) they may machinate treaties and maintain correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, which in their conſequences may produce all the calamity in which weak or wicked ambitious men can involve a notion.</p>
            <p>Great labor is viſible in the conſtruction of your language!—I have not been an inattentive or a light obſerver of the concerns of my country, yet I find it not eaſy to fix upon the deſcription of men to whom you allude in that ſentence— <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 6.</note> 
               <q>it is eaſy to foreſee that from different quarters pains will be taken, and artifices employed to weaken in our minds the conviction, that union is the bond of our ſafety;</q> and again <q>frowning upon the firſt dawn of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the reſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There have been inſtances in which the ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of philoſophy have glanced at the future diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of America into a variety of ſtates, <hi>M. Linguet</hi> and the <hi>Abbe Raynal</hi> aſſumed to predict ſuch an event ere yet we became an independent nation.</p>
            <p>Great Britain has in her ſyſtem of colonization and policy, ſpeculated upon thoſe ſpeculations, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the ſpirit into her colonial arrangments in Canada; Dorcheſter and Simcoe acted upon it; and the Britiſh miniſters and ſenate have argued upon the deſirableneſs and practicability of dividing the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States into diſtinct governments and intereſts, to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031315_0012_0FEC0ADA8BD2FA40"/>be regulated by climate, ſituation, the <hi>natural lines of population,</hi> productions, manners, and <hi>religions,</hi> and all the genera of theoretic circumſtance; but in theſe conſiſts the difficulty which prevents my mind from fixing upon the perſons or party from whoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts <hi>you</hi> apprehend thoſe dangers to the Union; for when I compare the conduct you diſplayed on the ſubjects of Britiſh politics and connections, with theſe lively warnings, I cannot bring myſelf to believe that you could implicate that party in the dangers you deprecate; and what ſtill diſtracts my judgment in endeavouring to diſcover to whom you allude, are the ſtrange and ſtriking circumſtances, that the perſons among ourſelves who are loudeſt in declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of attachment to our country, are yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and faithful inmates and advocates of Britiſh men and meaſures, are thoſe who attempted openly and argumentively to recommend, and as it were prove, the neceſſity and utility of dividing the United States into two republics, to conſiſt of the New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland ſtates North and Eaſtward, and the other of all the Southern ſtates; but it is not this effort of theirs, nor their inceſſant clamour in favour of all things Britiſh and againſt all things French, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and leaves my opinion unſettled, but that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons very cloſely in your confidence, openly profeſs and defend theſe attachments; that this party com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your moſt ardent eulogiſts; that they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the conſtant and no leſs ardent eulogiſts of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged orders, the advocates of an eſtabliſhed Church, and the eulogiſts of a Britiſh form of government—Briſtiſh maxims in morals as well as politics are with them the ſtandard of human perfection, of which they do not heſitate to declare you to be a living ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample formed upon a ſuperior model.</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore conſiſtently conclude that this party with whom you ſtand ſo high, and who have partaken it muſt be confeſſed very largely of your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031315_0013_0FEC0AE428AF15B8"/>regards for three years paſt, could have been the objects of your warnings, however pointedly and circumſtantially the deſcription may be applied to them.</p>
            <p>There remains indeed the ſhadow of a ſurmiſe yet to notice; perſons in the weſtern countries it has been ſaid, expreſſed in the moment when they deemed themſelves aggrieved, the idea of ſeparation, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape oppreſſion—a moſt memorable occaſion! ſhould they be indeed the ſerious objects upon which you affect alarm, the veil of ambiguity is no longer impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable, and it remains only to be aſked how their circumſtances and population juſtify the fear? Who are their foreign neighbors? What advantage could they derive in effecting ſuch a purpoſe? And what motive could be ſufficiently ſtrong to urge them to ſuch a meaſure?</p>
            <p>Theſe queſtions require no diffuſive reaſonings no deep reſearch,—that their population is inadequate to ſupport independence—their reſources incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to their wants in ſuch a ſituation, the plain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the plaineſt man could determine; but you ſay <q>be deaf to ſuch as would ſever you from your brethren and connect you with <hi>aliens,</hi>
               </q>—theſe aliens muſt be their neighbours, of whom we have reaſon to be jealous? The Britiſh are their only neighbours, beſide the Indians and Spaniards, from both of whom freemen have little to apprehend; the Britiſh then remain; and that the deſcription ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to them alone, is fairly inferable from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we have had on numberleſs occaſions, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in their conduct while they kept poſſeſſion of the weſtern poſts; near which, neither towns nor habitations were ſuffered to be erected, the fertile earth was interdicted from culture, and even the erection of a ſolitary hut was rigidly obſtructed and forbidden; ſettlers were not only ſeduced by gifts of lands and various other temptations, but forced by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031315_0014_0FEC0AE9504C87F8"/>open violence to migrate from the American ſide of the boundary and ſettle on that of the Britiſh.</p>
            <p>But is there no latent motive in this warning? has the ſyſtem of exciſe, that hot-bed of patronage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, corruption, and oppreſſion, yet met any juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification other than the weſtern expedition?—or has that expedition met any juſtification, but in the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate but unexpected conſequence of its overturning the ſanguine expectations of thoſe whoſe ambition built proſpects moſt fruitful to their fell purpoſes upon the eſtabliſhment of an army of mercenaries, an eſtabliſhment which you in the genuine language of truth declare to be <q>always inauſpicious to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but particularly to Republican Liberty?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond head is irkſome to diſcuſs, becauſe not to do it without reſerve would be to deſert the moſt ſacred principles of truth and juſtice, which ſhould never give way to the warmeſt perſonal attachments. The foundation of Civil Liberty and the obligations of allegiance to governments founded on the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative baſis, require no new elucidation at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time, notwithſtanding the efforts of your vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent adulators, to diſparage the cauſe of Liberty by attempting under the cloak of <hi>literary dictatorſhip</hi> to perſuade <hi>unlettered</hi> men, that our conſtitution is not a <hi>democracy;</hi> fortunately for mankind the topic is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a vulgar one, within the compaſs of every man that can read his bible and underſtand common ſenſe, your ſolicitude to promulge new lights, however, would be commendable, conſidering that the occaſion was an intereſting one, and likely to carry with it an effect commenſurate with the magnitude of your influence on the public mind at the moment, had you adhered to the earneſt enforcement of principles upon their own merits, or even pointed out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of indifference or neglect, of a ſlaviſh or ſielent diſregard for their uſe or abuſe; if a rigid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to ſuch conduct were on any occaſion pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031315_0015_0FEC0AA5B6E80F90"/>and neceſſary, on this more than any occaſion was it called for; and in proportion to your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from that candid and magnanimous line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſo muſt your true friends have cauſe to regret, the friends of Liberty to deplore; and feeling that you have done ſo to a moſt alarming extent, the ſacred ſentiment of duty obliges me to point out wherein you have violated your own principles, by making your addreſs the vehicle of perſonal reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the indirect defence of weak and unjuſtifiable meaſures; where you have urged dogmas repugnant to free government, ſubverſive of the right of private judgment, and calculated to injure and impede the progreſs of morals and the happineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>Serious and afflicting are theſe truths, verified by numerous paſſages in your addreſs, upon which I ſhall remark as I proceed.</p>
            <p>"The baſe of our political ſyſtems is" you ſay, <q>the right of the people to make and alter their conſtitutions of government;</q> it is not becauſe this important principle diſplays the abſurdity or treachery of thoſe profeſſed friends of yours who never ceaſe railing at democracy, that I quote it; but becauſe the declaration of principles is too often the cloak for their violation; in every country from the decline of Roman Freedom to that of Poland, Sweden, and England,—from Auguſtus to George III. the profeſſion of love has been accompanied by the ſacrifice of Liberty! and there can be little doubt that ſome of thoſe tyrants blinded by ſelfiſh paſſions imagined that their moſt fatal meaſures were founded in wiſdom and conſiſtent with freedom: but neither the principles of free governments nor the allegiance due to them is the leſs ſacred for their abuſe, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger proceeds from obſcuring the bounds, or leaving them expoſed to the inroads of treachery.</p>
            <p>In this point of view the foregoing truth ſtanding alone is unaſſailable, but connected with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031315_0016_0FEC0AF2CC8DE5D0"/>unqualified illuſtration, is fraught with all that miſchief to which bad men can convert the maxims of great authority; you ſay <q>But the conſtitution which <hi>at any time exiſts,</hi> till exchanged by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and authentic act of the <hi>whole</hi> people, is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly obligatory upon all.</q> You indeed juſtly add, <q>the very idea of the power and the right of the people to eſtabliſh government, preſupppoſes the duty of every individual to obey the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed government.</q> From the general truth of theſe principles no friend of the federal conſtitution can diſſent; but if applied to a particular caſe, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain doctrines daily broached threaten to realize it, would render them unſafe and deſtructive, unleſs connected with other principles, marking the limits of official power, and ſhewing where aggreſſion on the part of the conſtituted authorities would render diſobedience the firſt of patriotic duties; I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the adminiſtration becomes inſenſibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of men devoted to monarchical government, ("and though the period may never arrive it ſhould not yet be kept out of ſight!") that by artful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, bold aſſumptions, or open and powerful hoſtility, they either alter the form by ſpecious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, or a direct perverſion of the principles of the conſtitution; what then would be the duty of the patriot citizen? How would the looſe doctrine you lay down apply—of obedience to <hi>any conſtitution that might hereafter exiſt!</hi> Strange but affecting truth, that power long poſſeſſed perverts the judgment, elſe we ſhould not have received ſo many admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the people, and ſo little on the dangers to be apprehended from that ſource whence tyranny has crept in all ages!</p>
            <p>But it is evident that in this part of your addreſs you were governed by feelings very ſeparate from thoſe of dipaſſionate and benevolent patriotiſm; this regard for the conſtitution, altho I doubt not of your
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031315_0017_0FED2E02E6DBD870"/>attachment to it, appears awkward when engaged in ſtimulating one ſide and depreſſing the other, and ſtill condemning party; the cauſe of truth ſhould never be debaſed into the inſtrument of reſentment, and your judgment muſt have been under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a moſt domineering prejudice when you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced an anathema againſt all combination and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, becauſe a few popular ſocieties of your countrymen <hi>dared to aſſert their own opinions</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>to yours</hi>—becauſe they differed from you on a queſtion which every day's experience ſince, and which every ſober conſideration now, and every probability in the future courſe of human affairs, tend to diſplay your error and their propriety.</p>
            <p>In this mixture of jealouſy reſentment and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pride, you forgot that it is to aſſociation, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret meetings, to the ſecrecy of great and juſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the United States owe this day the bleſſings of Independence; you forgot that whatever may have been the pernicious conſequences of ſome aſſociations in all parts of the world, that ſtill the ſum of good has been greater than the evil; you forgot that it is the indifference of a people towards their governors, and the meaſures they purſue, enables tyranny always to obtain an eſtabliſhment on the ruins of freedom, you overlooked that part of the natural character of mankind, which requires the indiſpenſible activity of his mind to the preſervation of his freedom; but ſtrangely, in the preſent progreſſion of ſcience and opinion, while you acknowledge the inherent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition you flie in the face of God and nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn both the author and the work. You never conſidered, that in commercial cities the deliterious poiſon of avarice has always been found deſtructive of Liberty, that connected with this fatal poiſon there is the great and weighty power of the Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile intereſt, circulating like foul blood through all parts of the ſtates, infecting our habits, dictating
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031315_0018_0FEC0AF8790E4ED8"/>to our manners, inſinuating itſelf into our Senate, and pervading every branch of our public offices; in denouncing the few but maſculine efforts of a little club, ſcarcely of ſufficient conſequence at any other time to excite ordinary notice, you have attempted to overwhelm every motive and diſpoſition to free and enlightened aſſociation, and labored with a moſt affecting perplexity to poliſh the ſting of your ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſo as ſtrike a very humble object home but ſure.</p>
            <p>It is the boaſt of Engliſhmen, Sir, that you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a decided partiality for their nation; until the perpetration of the Britiſh Treaty, no man would believe you capable of ſuch truly Chriſtian forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they obſerve, with the peculiar ſneer of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious exultation, that the ſentiments as well as the phraſeology of your official productions, have ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſwelled from their former ſimplicity into ſervile imitations of the pompous verbiage of the Britiſh adminiſtration; this was indeed diſputed, but in the EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES of <hi>hatred of Clubs,</hi> it is impoſſible not to diſcern the courſe of your ſtudies; and although you have not had equal reaſon to hate, nor as juſt motives as the Britiſh miniſter to fear the petty vengeance of petty clubs, yet your principles go as far, and your ſympathy of ſentiment falls no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of Mr. Pitt, on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <q>All obſtructions to the execution of the laws, ALL combinations and <hi>aſſociations</hi> under <hi>whatever plauſible</hi> character, with REAL DESIGN to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, control, counteract, or overawe the regular deliberation and action of the conſtituted autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, are deſtructive to this fundamental principle</q> that is of the allegiance of the people to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution at any time eſtabliſhed; But who, ſir, are to be the judges of this REAL DESIGN? Is the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men's intentions to be committed to agents of the powers that be, and deſigns preſumed without
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031315_0019_0FEC0AFA19908E40"/>regard to the forms of crimination preſcribed by the conſtitution? Theſe doctrines bear a moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate reſemblance of the meauſures and language of the Britiſh miniſtry a year ago! You continue, they ſerve to organize faction, to give it an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial force, to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, of a ſmall but enterprizing minority; and according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public adminiſtration the mirror of illconcerted and in congruous projects of faction, rather than the conſiſtent and wholeſome plans, digeſted by common counſels, and modified by mutual intereſts."</p>
            <p>This picture profeſſedly theoretical and proſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, preſents the real and melancholy retroſpect of thoſe fatal combinations under which that aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing meaſure, the Britiſh Treaty, was laboured into exiſtence: to no other event can it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, to no other tranſaction in our hiſtory does it ſo pointedly apply!—But, (obſerving, <hi>en paſſant,</hi> that the "<hi>delegated will</hi> of the nation," was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and deemed either unfit, incapable, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of previous counſel or ſubſequent delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſubject of the treaty!) in what degree does the force of this vindictive declaration attach as a pretext for reſtraining or fettering the opinions of the citizens of the United States? or for curbing the natural diſpoſition to aſſociation, and the free declaration of private judgment, on meaſures in which they are every one individually as much as you concerned? Are men to remain ſilent until called upon by their governmental agents? Who are they that the conſtitution appoints to reſtrain private deliberation, and mark the line beyond which freedom becomes ſedition? Where is the law that forbids the exerciſe of opinion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the conſcience from its honeſty? Or are we
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031315_0020_0FEC0AFBE0651B28"/>henceforward to conſider, in defiance of all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, — diſintereſtedneſs, wiſdom, and virtue, as inherent in the poſſeſſors of national power and truſt? Are the peaceable republican citizens of free America, the men who achieved the bleſſings we enjoy, to relinquiſh ſocial communion, and remain quieſcent ſpectators of the open activity of a party the moſt odious and inſolent that ever diſgraced a free ſociety—to ſee their cities thronged with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh emiſſaries—the deadly enemies of their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence—the oppreſſors of their trade, the pirates and executioners of their fellow-citizens—courted, cheriſhed, and ſtill inſulting us in our very ſtreets, mocking our tameneſs, and revileing us for our imbecility?— Muſt Americans, I ſay, become ſo baſe as to bend the neck in ſilence to the creatures of their will, while thoſe deadly enemies openly triumph over our perſons, trade, and politics, and daringly declare our retrogreſſion to thoſe evils we ſhook off when we became free? Shall this organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized faction, with the ſecret gold of Britain at their command, ſubſiſt, and the plain American whoſe only hope and glory is Freedom in perpetuity, muſt be ſilent! Good God! and are ſuch the doctrines offered by George Waſhington to his country!</p>
            <p>You are loſt, Sir, in the treacherous mazes of paſſion; you have given way to the jealouſy of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated feelings, before reflection could ſoften the violence of your choler; what avails it that you admit that ſuch combinations and aſſociations may now and then anſwer popular ends, when you add <q>they are likely in the courſe of time and things to become potent engines, by which unprincipled and ambitious men will be enabled to ſubvert the power of the people and uſurp the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</q> myſtery and equivocation are unworthy of you, as the reſentments and precepts which they are employed upon; for until men are filled with
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031315_0021_0FEC0B043A2DE7D8"/>that perfection which you ſay is not in their nature, the period or occaſion when aſſociation may be ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary muſt be left to the opinion of every free citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen; would you leave aſſociation to the diſcretion of men in power? then is your great name and our freedom diſgraced! There may be a criſis in our government, as we ſee in others, when corruption on one ſide, and miniſterial perfidy on the other, will render it the duty of every virtuous citizen to aſſociate—and who then ſhall mark the line which ſeperates grievance from juſtice! In a ſocial view, we have too little of community in the induſtrious branches of ſociety, we borrow too largely of the booriſh inhoſpitability produced by enormous taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in England, and of the ſelfiſhneſs produced by miſery and tyranny in Germany; among the idle and opulent, and in the official branches of ſociety we aſſume all the empty vanity, and more of the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than becomes us of the former nation; in our legal abuſes and ſtate policy it is the ſame; I have already noticed that parts of their politics have been adopted by yourſelf-particularly the ſecrecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and tenaciouſly aſſerted to be an eſſential part of adminiſtration, and which indirectly aſſerts the government to poſſeſs the only wiſdom of the nation, that the people are not fit to know their own affairs, or judge how they are adminiſtered, or that the nation is a dependant creature on the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Your profeſſions it is true are in many reſpects the ſame as thoſe of the moſt ardent lover of equal Liberty; your admonition againſt changes, and the diverſitude of hypotheſis, and injunctions to adhere by the preſent government until experience has proved or diſapproved its wiſdom, are equally ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but how far experience has already diſcovered blemiſhes in it, the principle of ſecrecy and ſanctity in public tranſactions, the conduct and <hi>quantum</hi> of

            <p>But without dwelling upon theſe, I cannot but remark one feature of your morality, and which in its full extent governs your politics, it is founded on a maxim which perhaps more than any other has tended to perpetuate the miſeries of ſociety and degrade and enſlave mankind; the baſis of tyranny temporal and ſpiritual, is the alleged innate depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of man; if there is that innate depravity, (which, however the long unhappy conſtruction of ſociety and the prejudices of ages may appear to ſanctify it, a cloſe obſervation of man, and the ſentiments of the greateſt moraliſts diſprove,) then indeed may your poſition, that the ſpirit of party is unfortunate and fraught with more than the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers you deſcribe, be maintained; but it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be proved that God created man naturally wicked, or that the inherent predominant dipoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to evil is really implanted in us, ſince if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant paſſions of man ſhould be found to be no other than the love of our kind, of participation, and the deſire of ſharing the bleſſings which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes in ſociety; contradiſtinguiſhed from corrupt deſpotiſm which maintains excluſive power in one

            <p>In this ſhort paragraph you have diſcharged the loathings of a ſick mind; you have collected the aggravating recollections of wounded pride, and warmed to the inveteracy of hatred, diſcharged the whole burthen of your blazing ſpirit at the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your perſonal diſlike, under the form of advice to your beloved country!</p>
            <p>O God! that you had ſtopped to weigh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of prudence in cool reflection—that you had ſhunned the ungracious track of indirect aſperſion —that you had conquered the remembrance of Mr. Randolph's Vindication—or balanced the ſecrets which he had manfully kept undiſcloſed, againſt that part of your conduct which you compelled him to diſcover!</p>
            <p>But let me examine the principles of this illfated charge againſt party, independent of their perſonal guile.</p>
            <p>Does party <hi>always</hi> diſtract public counſels—en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble the adminiſtrations—agitate ill-founded jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and falſe alarms?</p>
            <p>This charge, however it might have applied to the particular fact of the ſtruggle between thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031315_0026_0FEC0B16E33CF730"/>who wiſhed reſpectively to ſee the French and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh intereſts favored by unequivocal demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our regard and attachment; will not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear out the declaration that ſuch will always be its effects; neither is it true that illfounded jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and alarms are the invariable conſequences of popular aſſociations, although it is too frequently the effect of combinations among external enemies and a governmental party; in the ever memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and let me add deplorable occaſion above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, what was the conduct of the members of your own adminiſtration, and what was that of the popular party?</p>
            <p>The latter, influenced in no ordinary degree by your repeatedly avowed affection and regard for the French nation, by your attachment to her generals and remembrance of the ſervices which they had rendered us in ſecuring our Independence at a critical and more early period and with a leſs expence of our own blood; influenced ſtill more by the virtuous cauſe for which ſhe was then fighting, and in a degree ſtill more ſtrong and energetic by the ſenſe of the wrongs which the combined pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were inflicting on that nation, and not a little by the ſentiment that France was ſtrunggling againſt the very power that had ſought to enſlave us, and whoſe bloody progreſs is ſtill pictured in the minds of our citizens, in the ruins that ſtill call to painful remembrance the deep inflictions ot Britiſh feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the popular aſſociations were decidedly in favor of that oppreſſed people, the ſympathy of ſuffering virtue and magnanimity called for their warmeſt affections—our cauſe was the ſame—we muſt be worſe than monſters of brutality not to pray for their ſucceſs, not to glory in their triumphs!—how did the popular ſocieties act on this occaſion? they openly and like honeſt and free men, declared
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031315_0027_0FEC0B18AB9D7378"/>their opinions in the face of their country and all the world—perfidy itſelf cannot charge them with more?</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, they have been charged with ſtirring up the paſſions of the citizens to an equally explicit expreſſion of their ſentiments—what! was the love of Liberty the hatred of Tyranny, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the boſoms of a few popular ſocieties only, among all the citizens of the United States; and were the citizens at large ſo devoid of philanthropy and of every ſympathetic ſentiment, as not to be able to judge in ſo plain a caſe? Away with ſuch deteſtable deluſion, ſuch mockery of virtue, ſuch perverſion of truth and free opinion.</p>
            <p>But what was the conduct of the only <hi>party,</hi> which <hi>in truth exiſted, and drew forth that fermentation and alarm that really diſtracted the national counſels and diſgraced its character?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary to inſiſt on the preciſion of dates where facts are notorious; a ſhort time prior to the agitation of the Britiſh Treaty, it ſhould not be forgotten, that the Britiſh Cabinet had iſſued a ſecret order to their cruiſers to ſeize all American veſſels which they ſhould meet bound for France, that ſome hundreds of them were actually ſeized before the exiſtence of ſuch an order was known to our government, that the ſame period produced the denunciation againſt the <hi>republican form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> it ſhould likewiſe be well remembered that, at that period the French were reduced to a predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament wherein an accumulation of internal cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and an unexampled combination of external force appeared, in the opinion of weak men, ready to overwhelm that people and ſink them in the ſcale of nations for ever; the mode of her partition had already been <hi>formally agreed upon and guaranteed,</hi> and England eternally babbling on the balance of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and her faith in treaties—ſurrendered theſe max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031315_0028_0FEC0B1DC9660568"/>of ſtate and her faith plighted to Poland, as a ſolemn teſtimonial in the face of the world, of the ſincerity of her hatred againſt any government of the republican form!</p>
            <p>At this hour of fatal influence, and reproachful to our character as a free nation, when deſtruction ſeemed to let fall her hand on France—when Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was already ſacrificed—and Britain bloated with the rank inſolence of riches, the fruit of her Eaſtern ſpoils, as ſhe is wont to be at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of all her wars, and blindly confident of the ſpeedy annihilation of the only nation that curbed her luſt of univerſal domination, that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my already ſtaggering at her feet; at this period in contempt of the experience of an hundred wars againſt the ſeveral powers of Europe, the Britiſh government formed the deſign of profiting by the naked and defenceleſs ſtate of America, from the involvement of France, and rendering our ſtrength which ſhe had loſt by tyranny, ſubverſive to her am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition by the double means of threats and craft—a remembrance of the conduct of Britiſh ſhips on our coaſt, and Britiſh agents in our ports and ſtreets, and the clamourous threats of <hi>was or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> which reverberated in our ears on every ſide, will be ſufficient to mark the meaſures and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the party that prevailed at that time;—thoſe who think the ſubject worth a ſcrutiny, will be able to determine what ſhare Britiſh emiſſaries took in it, how faithful the Tories and Refugees proved to their old principles and old friends, and whether or not <hi>that party</hi> was <q>a ſmall but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing minority,</q> or the great body of friends to <hi>order, civilized government, and religion!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeizure of our ſhipping, the ſale of our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, the detention of our ſeamen, the ruin of our trade, after ſome time attracted the attention of our executive—(and here it is but equitable to aſk
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031315_0029_0FEC0B26133A5918"/>What would have been the conduct of Britain on experiencing ſuch aggreſſions?)—a private remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance was made, and the anſwer returned was to this effect, you may have a Treaty! And for this gracious condeſcenſion the embargo was taken off!</p>
            <p>How far the vain cry of war influenced you, ſir, is not neceſſary to enquire, ſince the effect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely anſwered all the calculations of the Britiſh party; ſince that party boaſted then of poſſeſſing the <hi>car</hi> of the greater number of thoſe who enjoyed your confidence, but as has ſubſequently appeared, who wholly engroſſed your counſels and led your judgment in ſilken bondage.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh Treaty has been already diſcuſſed, but a great part of its improvidence and diſregard of our national trade and honor remains yet unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; it requires a ſeparate expoſure; at no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote period it is plain to ſee, that public exigencies will drag it forth under public odium and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</p>
            <p>That treaty was the price of your fears and of the Weſtern poſts—and the ſacrifice of our relations with France was the return for the repeal of the Britiſh order of council, but without the effect of releaſing us from the obloquy of Britiſh violence and barbarity at ſea.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not break open the ſeal of cabinet ſecrecy, to unravel the myſtery of the proclamation of the 22nd. April 1793—time will commit that tale to hiſtory, when you ſhall be no more and my name forgotten—then hiſtory will develope the intrigues which dictated and directed the declaration and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction of the <hi>modern law of nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such were the effects <hi>of party,</hi> but of what party? They fully illuſtrate your doctrine, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand aloud of the people to reflect much, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with each other often, and forbear ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering away in faithleſs confidence, thoſe liberties
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031315_0030_0FEC0B28560A9FB8"/>which can only be endangered by weak or wicked men employed in the adminiſtration of their public affairs.</p>
            <p>I have but a few remarks farther to make on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſhall then proceed to examine thoſe parts of your addreſs which relate to foreign policy.</p>
            <p>Your examples of party influence are uniformly drawn from occaſions wherein your perſonal opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, your pride and paſſions, have been involved; in no particular more ſtrikingly is this diſcoverable than in your advice concerning the powers of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>"The ſpirit of encroachment" you ſay <q>tends to conſolidate the powers of all departments in one, and thus create, whatever the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, a real deſpotiſm.</q> This ſentence is a palpable alluſion to the proceedings in the houſe of Repreſentatives on the ſubject of the treaty, and thus again, Sir, under the garb of advice to the people you diſguiſe an attack on the Repreſentatives and an attempt to defend your own ſecrecy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy; when I conſider this conduct and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to which I have already alluded, and as you direct me, form an <q>eſtimate of that love of power and pronenſes to abuſe it, predominant in the human heart;</q> and I take into that eſtimate your refuſal of the juſt and proper demand of the Houſes for the correſpondence on the treaty, then Sir, I cannot but confeſs the truth of your poſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum —and I bleſs God!—I bleſs God, Sir, not on your account nor my own, but on that of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and my children's freedom, who in leaving you without the bleſſing of heirs, and making you with ſuch a diſpoſition, the powerful inſtrument in the hands of providence, for ſecuring our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, has releaſed us from the danger which we might elſe apprehend, thro that love you have gained in the honeſt and confiding hearts of our
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031315_0031_0FEC0B2A0BEBF8B0"/>countrymen, from reverting again to the odious and deteſtable condition of ſubjects —and carrying into effect thoſe maxims which appear to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a cloſe knowledge of your own diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>I forbear remarking on other points of blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded truth and ambiguity; but I cannot ſuffer the ſpirit of party rancour under the maſk of religion to overturn and annihilate the gratitude which this nation owes to that great man THOMAS PAINE, it is not for me to defend his writings on the ſubject of revelation; but however much I may diſallow the arguments he has produced againſt it, I am content that thoſe whoſe province it is to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſearch the ſcriptures, have been alive to their faith, anſwered his call, and ſatisfied the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all who doubted; but then if I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his belief, muſt I neceſſarily condemn him? alas! what is belief if it is not free!—what muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Jew, the ſavage, the Mahometan, the Idolator, upon all of whom the ſun ſhines equally, whom the ſame heat warms and the ſame cold chills, muſt I allow no virtue, no right of opinion on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which divide and have divided all mankind in all periods and times, upon which even we ourſelves are ſplit into countleſs ſects, and have in the courſe of every one of our own lives, who have dared to ſtep beyond the threſhold of education and to reflect on our being, been perhaps equally or more ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal than he; but you ſay "volumes would not trace "all the connections of religion with private and public happineſs"—granted, and this alſo is my opinion, but then does he ſpeak ſincerely or as a hypocrite? or are we to cloſe up the doors of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion againſt him, who deſires every man only to think for himſelf, and to diſregard his opinions where he gives no reaſons for them; to reject them, if in our own opinions they are not right; who loves God, and has proved his charity towards
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031315_0032_0FEC0B2D88FB4D18"/>all men;—but there is I fear, and the fear is now becoming general, a deſign to erect a national church among us, if ſuch ſhould be your view in attacking the well earned fame of Thomas Paine, God forgive you! I truſt to no ſpiritual inquiſitor; nor expect "the kingdom of Chriſt upon earth;" how far religion ſhould be national, would require a voluminous and ſeparate diſcuſſion, conſtitutionally it cannot be ours; on the ſubject of <hi>oaths</hi> which are ſo ſhockingly multiplied every where, there are many of the beſt moraliſts divided in opinion, and whatever the bounded wiſdom of <hi>Judge Ruſh, Mr. Swift,</hi> and yourſelf may ſuggeſt, we ſee in the conduct of that great body of virtuous men, the Quakers, how unneceſſary are oaths in the orderly regulation of ſociety; while in the Cuſtom-houſe perjuries, and thoſe of <hi>men in office</hi> and men profeſſing Chriſtianity of all deſcriptions, moſt powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt their efficacy. I have ſaid more on this delicate topic than I propoſed, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with juſtice to the cauſe of Liberty which PAINE has well ſerved, and the cauſe of truth which I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore above every partial conſideration, forbear to remark that an attack on that great aſſertor of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, comes from you with particular ungraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I cannot but openly apply to you the ſame charge which you unneceſſarily and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently lay againſt him.</p>
            <p>In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labour to ſubvert the great pillars of human happineſs, (religion and morality) the firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens:" without attempting a comment on the diſtinction which you have made in accuſing him of attempting to overturtrn <hi>both,</hi> I think it enough to remark, that you made it; but there is another particular in which the defence of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but eſpecially the <hi>Chriſtian religion,</hi> appears very
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031315_0033_0FEC0B37467292E0"/>awkward in your hands:—Would to God! you had retired to a private ſtation four years ago, while your public conduct threw a veil of ſanctity round you, which you have yourſelf raſhly broken down, you fame would have been ſafe, your country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach, and I ſhould not have the mortifiying taſk of pointing out the blind temerity with which <hi>you</hi> come forward to defend the religion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who exiſt in the violation of its <hi>moſt ſacred obligations,</hi> of the deareſt <hi>ties of humanity,</hi> and in <hi>defiance of the ſoverign calls of morality and liberty</hi>—by dealing in HUMAN SLAVES!—aggravated too by the ſad reflections, that neither neceſſity, ſelf preſervation, the want of fortune, nor the deſire of transferring riches to your deſcendants, could be urged even as plauſible or worldly motives in extenuation, but on the contrary, when your property, ample for the gratification of the moſt extravagant deſires—would would call loudly upon you to releaſe your ſpecies from their unchriſtian bondage and ignorance, were it but to preſent an example of diſintereſtedneſs—of that virtue—that morality—of the ſincerity of your love of liberty—of benevolence—of charity—of the love of God and the moſt benign religion, to you country, which you <hi>declare</hi> to be the main ſprings of every government, <q>the great pillars of human happineſs, and the firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having already exceeded the bounds which I propoſed, for this part of my letter, and having yet to offer ſome obſervations on the remaining ſubject of <hi>foreign relations,</hi> and a few concluding remarks, I ſhall omit what I purpoſed ſaying concerning taxation and finance, upon which there is ample room for pointed animadverſion.</p>
            <p>In what I have ſaid concerning party, I noticed the origin of the Treaty with Britain, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſituation in which we then ſtood, from
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031315_0034_0FEC0B3917643478"/>the diſtreſſed condition of France; it has been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, I know not with what degree of truth, that Britain gave the United States the alternative of a treaty or a war; upon a ſurmiſe it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to argue, further than the weight that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be derived from the wiſdom which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to have ſecured peace in ſuch a dilemma; but if peace was ſecured upon that occaſion upon ſuch conditions, we certainly ſhould not have been left ignorant of a fact ſo neceſſary for our future guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and for the regulation of the national judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the conduct of our public agents and allies. Whatever may have ſtimulated you to the execution of ſuch a treaty, it is evident the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you have here offered to your fellow citizens, with regard to foreign connexions, conveys a tacit condemnation of that meaſure, while it diſplays an attempt to defend your conduct, though deviating from the policy you recommend; your aim clearly is to bring over the nation to an unſettled and trimming policy, in order to cover your own error: but in this, as in former caſes, your mode of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence applies againſt you, and while you call up every effort of which you are capable to obliterate the gratitude and attachment due to France and the cauſe ſhe is engaged in, you only perſuade us with tenfold effect how conſcious you are of the faithleſs ſacrifices which have been made to Britain.</p>
            <p>After recommending the total forgetfulneſs of thoſe juſt and crying antipathies which the bloody ſcenes of Eſopus, Paoli, and the North River, muſt ever awake in the breaſts of feeling men, but which to attempt ſmothering while George III. is King of England, <hi>Alexander Wedderburne</hi> the keeper of <hi>his</hi> conſcience, <hi>Cornwallis</hi> his <hi>privy counſellor,</hi> one <hi>Arnold</hi> his friend, and <hi>Sir Charles Grey</hi> his favourite, is ſuch a folly as no experience could hope for, nor any thing but deſparation ſuggeſt, to the preſent
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031315_0035_0FEC0B3B05F27DD0"/>and the riſing generation; could you hope for the excluſion of the moſt honorable and endeared of the moral virtues from our hearts, or that we could take to our boſoms thoſe who butchered our fathers and brothers in cold blood, who diſhonored our daughters and ſiſters, who marked their paths thro our country by pillage, maſſacre, fire, and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the ſame moment baniſh from our minds and affections thoſe who, in the criſis of our fate, by a powerful interpoſition, reſcued us from the continuity of ſuch honors, ſecured to us our freedom, and to whom many of us now owe the exiſtence we enjoy?—He muſt be a ſturdy moraliſt whoſe nature can bend to <hi>ſuch</hi> regards for juſtice!</p>

               <q>The nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome degree a ſlave.</q> This, Sir, is a new mode of reaſoning batred of ſlavery into love of oppreſſors! Suppoſe this new political ſophiſm were generalized, and by reducing it to the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of common ſenſe, rendered intelligible;—in this way then it will ſtand thus—Virtue and Vice diſtinguiſh nations in various degrees, a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual fondeſs of the vices of a nation renders you in ſome degree a ſlave to thoſe vices, but if a nation is conſpicuous for virtues, a habitual love for thoſe virtue, is not to be called ſlavery, becauſe virtue and ſlavery cannot exiſt together. I venture to ſay, Sir, this applicatian of your dogma is ſtrictly in point, and it the moral regard of nations ſhould not go counter to thoſe of individuals, that there can exiſt no difficulty when we aſk, from what nation are we in moſt danger of infection by their vices? It will be granted, that it is not to the animal we become attached, but the qualities which diſtinguiſh nations as much as perſons from each other, the wiſdom, ſcience, talents, magnanimity, generoſity, diſintereſtedneſs, and ſacred devotion to Liberty,—the queſtion of love or hatred of nations then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031315_0036_0FED2DFFDE7057D8"/>a queſtion of morals, and our firſt enquiry will be what is the form and character of their Government?—When any one accuſes the Britiſh Government, and convicts it of one Virtue, it will be then time enough to urge a compariſon.</p>
            <p>But tho I paſs over ſome expreſſions calculated to warp the judgment and inſinuate away the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men, there is one truth which Freemen ſhould never ſuffer to be abſent from their minds—THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM IS THE CAUSE OF MANKIND! Applying it to the ſingle cauſe of France, and ſuppoſing her ſubjugated and diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—"blotted from the map of Europe;"—the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican form of government would then remain to undergo the ſame operation, the petty oligarchies of Italy and the then feeble remains of Batavian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm would ſcarcely demand the force of a ſingle member of the deſpotic confederation to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate them, and could we then expect to remain exempted from the univerſal proſcription? Let any man turn a moment's earneſt reflection on what muſt be our condition if France had been extinguiſhed! Could we expect a magnanimous forbearance from England? From whom then could we expect ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour? Surely not from the partitioners of Poland! But it will be ſaid, we have already proved ourſelves invincible to the power of Britain: Alas! precarious would be that Liberty which were to be placed on the riſk of ſuch a conteſt! When we fought for our Freedom all the world was with us; France fought for us; we had her navy to protect us, her valorous generals to direct us; we had not the experience and conſequent terrors of a ſavage and aſſaſſinating war, and of the treachery that put the poignard in the hand of our ext door neighbors, nor the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege which we now poſſeſs, that nearly one half of our fellow-citizens are decided partizans of the Britiſh and their form of government, a conſiderable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the friends of Liberty become ſo totally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031315_0037_0FED2DFE53DBF430"/>in worldly purſuits and confident of ſecurity, that danger at their doors can ſcarcely rouſe them—In ſuch a ſituation, what could the band of firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans do but die nobly, and leave their poſterity at the mercileſs mercy of their conquerors! That we have not taſted of this bitter cup is not the effect of your meaſures, every ſtep diſplayed the weakneſs that would invite domination. But thanks to the better genius of France, that in baffling deſpotiſm ſecured to us peace and Freedom ſo long as we ſhall be worthy of it! Looking to the future ſituation of Europe, how are we to appreciate your maxims? If France ſhould conclude a peace at the cloſe of the preſent campaign, what would be our ſituation with regard to that nation? In what manner could we juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify our uniform conduct toward her, our public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of admiration and attachment, our ſecret deſertion and treachery? Are we to propoſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation by a renewal or a complete dereliction of the diſregarded treaty—are we to throw ourſelves into the arms of Britain—are we (as they exclaim who ſupported the Britiſh Treaty to avoid war!) to go to war with France? No other path lies open but that of conceſſion, and that taſk you leave to your ſucceſſor in office!</p>
            <p>But let us look beyond theſe unpleaſant limits, and conſidering what France is—what ſhe promiſes to be, aſk wherein conſiſts the prudence or wiſdom of your maxims? After ten years of peace, under a republican government, with the fineſt and beſt ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated country in the univerſe, the moſt numerous and enlightened body of philoſophers that any nation ever poſſeſſed, the moſt numerous, intelligent, active, diſintereſted, and brave people the world has ever known; with theſe advantages, ſeeing what Colbert effected under circumſtances ſo much inferior, what will ſuch a country have to covet from us or to fear from all the powers of the earth and ſea!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:031315_0038_0FEC0B49EF712FF8"/>
But it has been urged by trimming politicians, that as England now holds the dominion of the ſea, we owe it to ourſelves to cultivate peace with her, ſince her trade employs our ſhipping, and her manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures engroſs three-fifths of our internal traffic— by this mode of argument it is, that the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of adherence to the faith of Treaties, and a ſteady aſſertion of national independence and neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, have been made odious by avarice and faction. and bellowed forth only as the treacherous whoop preluſive of war.</p>
            <p>Such were the proceedings and ſuch the mode of argument, that juſtified and effectuated the Britiſh alliance; I will not ſtop to remark minutely how powerfully all the arguments againſt the attachment to France might be employed againſt that with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it will be enough to ſtate the general circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of each; the government of Britain is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject deſerving the decided abhorrence of every moral man; that of France is repreſentative like our own; the perfidious policy of the former will conſtantly endanger us, if not ultimately involve us with one or other of the European powers whom ſhe hates or fears; in a commercial view ſhe will be neceſſarily dependant on us, for out ſtaples and the conſumption of her fabrics, which we can procure cheaper in other countries; France can have nothing to fear from our enmity nor to court from our warmeſt love, her population and the genius of her people will enable her to underſed all the manufacturers of Europe, and trade will follow cheapneſs; England on the contrary deriving all her conſequence from abroad, and daily ſinking under the burden of her ambitious, oppreſſive, and corrupt government at home, cannot hope for future proſperity or reſpectability in Europe, only in a Revolution and Republican government (an event that would render your meaſures perfectly ridiculous) or by wily machinations drawing in America, as
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031315_0039_0FEC0B4B9DD65610"/>an old Bawd drags her daughter to proſtitution, as the only ſource of ſupport under the weight of turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and age. Our detached and diſtant ſituation invited and enabled us to purſue the courſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial juſtice without fear of war from Great Britain or interference in behalf of France; that faith which is pledged by the nice obligations of gratitude, honor, and Liberty ſhould have <hi>directed</hi> us to this unerring point.</p>
            <p>"Why" I repeat after you <q>forego the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſo particular a ſituation? Why by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaving our deſtiny (again with England who would enſlave us) entangle our peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the toils of (Britiſh) ambition, rivalſhip, intereſt, humour, or caprice?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the trembling anxiety of your apprehenſions you betray a ſolicitude for the exculpation of your paſt conduct, that ſpeaks more than the moſt minute examination of your ſentiments; having mentioned the Britiſh treaty with applauſe, you recollect in the ſequel that you have deprecated foreign alliances: you therefore find it neceſſary to create the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between commercial and political alliances, as if the former were not to all intents and purpoſes of the latter deſcription, when the privileges of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored nation are ſacrificed on one ſide, and inſult and oppreſſion ſubmitted to on the other; but fearful that even this ſhould be inſufficient you further warn us againſt <q>
                  <hi>permanent alliances,</hi> ſo far I mean as we are now at liberty to do it, for let me not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as capable of <hi>patronizing</hi> infidelity to exiſting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.</q> This extrordinary advice is fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in your departure from the ſpirit and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the treaty with France, which was declared to be permanent, and exhibits this very infidelity you reprobate in a moſt ſtriking and lamentable light.</p>
            <p>In forming the treaty with Britain, one of two modes of conduct was purſued, equally regardleſs of ſubſiſting obligations; there was either a relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031315_0040_0FEC0B4D5FEE06C8"/>or ſacrifice of particular conditions ſecured by treaty to France, or a neglect or diſregard of the juſtice which was due to that contract; or in other words we have derived the moſt ſignal advantages from the aſſiſtance of France particularly in the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Cornwallis, that obligation has never been repaid,—our treaty with France from this cauſe and from the attachment of the philoſophical characters of the French nation through whoſe powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we acquired the alliance, and by whoſe advice in conjunction with our own philoſophical agents, the treaty was formed,—was it not conſidered as a great ſtep towards the amelioration of the laws of nations, and which we have adopted in every treaty we have entered into ſince excepting that with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? national conſiſtency, therefore, as well as the impreſſive principles of generoſity and juſtice ſhould have bound us on that particular occaſion to have regarded principles primarily eſtabliſhed by our own example.</p>
            <p>There was ſtill another circumſtance of particular delicacy in negociating the Britiſh treaty, which a Republic jealous of her reputation, as the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruous woman, ſhould not have neglected;—that the negociation was commenced and concluded during the exiſtence of a war between the moſt favored nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in alliance with America, and the former enemy of America, then at war with the moſt favored nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>under all theſe circumſtances</hi> it ſhould appear to be a moſt indiſpenſible obligation on America not to accede to any conditions propoſed by Britain incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with thoſe already enjoyed by France—or at leaſt if America granted <hi>all</hi> that France enjoyed, to grant <hi>no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the queſtion on neutral bottoms was ever diſcuſſed or not, is a matter not now to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but ſpeaking in the ſpirit of charitable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, the ignorance, or indifference, or imbecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031315_0041_0FEC0B55D756A7B8"/>of our ambaſſador on that occaſion, ſurpaſſed every thing of the kind in the annals of diplomatic affairs, and placed our national <hi>faith</hi> in the ſame rank with that of ancient Carthage.</p>
            <p>Having freely diſcuſſed the leading points of your addreſs, there ſtill remains a conſiderable ſhare, which might be employed in corroborating with great force the general charge of deviation in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of your adminiſtration from the ſpirit and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of your former profeſſions, and the proper and true intereſts of your country; wherein your advice for the future is but a defence for the paſt,—where your warnings againſt party appear but as the reſult of party ſpirit—your leſſons upon foreign politics but props for paſt meaſures—where you have diſplayed the conſciouſneſs of error—attempted to diſguiſe the acrimony of perſonal reſentment under the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of public virtue—vainly diſplaying morals as the ſpring of Freedom, and betraying the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of reſentment, and intolerance of ſuperſtition, while exhibiting the moſt fatal example of your diſbelief or contempt of the morality and religion you defend, and that Freedom which they uphold; —but in doing all theſe you are perfectly conſiſtent with the views, practices, and principles,—nay even with the hatreds of the Britiſh party!</p>
            <p>The principles that lead men to virtue ſhould be well underſtood by Freemen, if Freedom is a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Slavery a curſe, then whatever conduces to the Freedom of Man is Virtue:—Is the love of Liberty implanted in our nature or not? Your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſeem to ſanction that cheriſhed maxim of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, that man is naturally depraved; the moral and phyſical conſequencs of ſuch a principle are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calculable, but confining the conſideration to its effect on freedom, we find that in all deſpotic Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments it is the great argument for violence, for ſanguinary puniſhments, for grinding laws; nor can
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031315_0042_0FEC0B5A521BA2A8"/>it be denied, that if God could be ſo unjuſt as to create man predominantly prone to depravity, then we ſhould no longer condemn deſpotic governments becauſe they would be only the neceſſary reſult and counterpoiſe of that vicious conſtitution.</p>
            <p>But if the numerous virtues of which men are in the conſtant exerciſe, and which are in perfect uniſon with the attributes of God, diſclaim indignantly the accurſed ſtigma; or that at leaſt innate depravity is a queſtion in morals; your ſupport of ſuch an opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion was at leaſt imprudent, and on an occaſion favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the propagation of any doctrine you might chuſe, wears an appearance that I do not wiſh to countenance; but the love of your country and of morals ought to have prevailed with you at ſuch a time, ſince you cannot be ignorant that vicious men are ever ready to charge their errors to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſtep-motherly beheſts of nature, rather than to their own wilful agency: this ſelfiſhneſs is the parent of many errors, thro' it we diſguiſe to others and accommodate to our own ſtarting conſciences, acts of vice and oppreſſion that religion loudly forbids and morals cannot tolerate nor endure.</p>
            <p>In attacking Thomas Paine, you acted raſhly; an eminent philoſophical Engliſh biſhop has acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that his writings were dictated in ſincerity, you do not queſtion that—yet you not only wiſhed to diſgrace him for that ſincerity, but to deprive him of the title to patriotiſm which he had juſtly obtained joined with you in the great conteſt for Freedom; his doctrines I do not defend, but ere you became his cenſor (honeſty is the beſt policy,) you ſhould have conſidered <hi>how morality was affected at home!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion ſhould be kept apart from politics;— temporal eſtabliſhments are never bettered by ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual influence; they have always corrupted each other, and ſlavery has been the fate of all who have fallen within their united jurisdiction: ſtrange that while
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031315_0043_0FEC0B5C190EF678"/>the whole world is divided into numberleſs religions, and theſe each into ſects, the body is ſubjected to puniſhment for the involuntary honeſty of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; it is a maxim in literature that truth is never more ſecure than when expoſed to dicuſſion; it would appear to be the rule moſt conſonant with reaſon to leave mind unreſtrained by the trammels of laws or the egotiſm and caprice of authority; there ever will be ſuſpicion where there is myſtery, and nothing contributes more to ſtrengthen ſcepticiſm than the jealouſy of believers; beſides it is groſsly inconſiſtent with the meek religion of Chriſt, which prays for all, to uſurp dominion over the intellects of men: were we conſpicuous over every other religion, which is not the caſe, or did our lives exhibit examples of our precepts, we might be in ſome degree excuſed; but our faith would rank very low indeed if it were to be <hi>judged by our works!</hi> No one would diſpute the right of a man to beſtow a thouſand dollars of his own property, nor of another to refuſe it; is opinion then which tyranny vainly interdicts, proſcribed by you? Men who rail at religion, judge by the wickedneſs practiſed in its name, or under the hypocritical profeſſion of it, and thence to think it is a deluſion foſtered by fear, and cauſing depravity; that if men were extricated from it, virtue would be loved for its own ſake, they would become better, and the laws which are neceſſary notwithſtanding the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of religion, would then have to do only what is now required of them; ſuch is their way of thinking, and their acting under ſuch impreſſions is no more objectionable in a rational view, than the efforts of the miſſionaries to convert the Indians, or your own plans for introducing the arts of civilization among them—the <hi>motive of each is the ſame, and ariſes from the innate diſpoſition to promote human bappineſs,</hi> which we never ceaſe to purſue unleſs biaſſed by ſome private prejudice or error of education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:031315_0044_0FEC0B5E51C0E430"/>
Equally objectionable are your doctrines when you declare <q>it is not for one nation to expect diſintereſted favors from another;</q> this alſo ſtrikes at the root of morals, and is founded on the baleful examples of the worſt governments, and the ſuppoſed depravity of man; but altho our conduct towards France too forcibly maintains the affirmative, I cannot admit the maxim to be any other than Machiavelian, diſproved by various exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from hiſtory, and in a very forcible manner by France, which, in beſtowing ſomething more than what you ſtrangely term <hi>nominal favors,</hi> and aſking of us no ſacrifice in return, as ſhe juſtly might have done, may very fairly reproach us for having given NO MORE THAN <hi>"the equivalents of nominal favors!"</hi>— for real benefits beſtowed.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, "in the duty of holding a neutral po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition" your country and France herſelf and the world at large agreed, that it was a juſtly <q>predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant motive with you to gain time to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to ſettle and mature its recent inſtitutions, and to progreſs without interruption to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſtrength and conſiſtency which is neceſſary to give it, humanly ſpeaking, the command of its fortunes;</q> and theſe were truly powerful arguments that called upon you for a rigid adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the neutral principle.</p>
            <p>But, however willingly every man muſt allow theſe obligations and objects to have been binding and wiſe, I apprehend I have already ſhewn that you have not adhered to that rigid and neutral juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which you profeſs—every conceſſion to Britain in prejudice of France was a deviation from neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and above all, every neglect of juſtice to our own rights and character as a nation was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the ſpirit and baſis of the neutral principle—for independent of our own diſgrace in exhibiting our imbecility at the moment when we
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031315_0045_0FEC0B61F5EACBA0"/>poſſeſſed the certain means of preſerving our peace and dignity—we were wounding an ally in the criſis of her diſtreſs, by confeſſing our deſpair of her cauſe in a puſilanimous indifference for our own commerce and national character; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was the more ignominous on our part, in that the orders of the Britiſh government for the ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure of American ſhips, were iſſued at the ſame time, and formed part of the ſyſtem that declared hoſtility againſt <hi>the Republican form of government;</hi> a declaration which is well known to have glanced at America, and expreſſed the intentions of Britain when ſhe ſhould obtain that ſucceſs with the idea of which ſhe was then blindly intoxicated.</p>
            <p>That we might have preſerved our honor and avoided war, is within the judgment of every man acquainted with the nature of the Britiſh trade,—that a non-importation of their manufactures would have done this, is within the compaſs of proof; and knowing that it was neither the deſire nor would it have been the intereſt of France that we ſhould take a ſhare in the war, ſo in theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſpects muſt we ſubmit to the juſt cenſure which belings to our meaſures, and as your addreſs is but an indirect defence thereof, it muſt remain with time to develope motives, that can reſcue your name from reproach.</p>
            <p>Freedom like this, Sir, you have not been uſed to; againſt a man ſo long and deſervedly elevated into the firſt truſt of a nation, it is painful to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it; there will, however, be found many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ready to give your words a colour or qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which they are in ſome meaſure ſuſceptible; others more attached to you than the Liberties of their country, will either not diſcern that departure from your long profeſſed character which I allege, or conſidering you as the conſummation of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wiſdom and moral perfection, they will haſten
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031315_0046_0FEC0B67FAAA3BF8"/>to heap obloquy on him who queſtions your infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; they will find in my comment on your text a new proof of the <hi>ingratitude of Republics,</hi> while my obſcure voice will not be heard in the clamer, tho' I ſpeak in the plainneſs of truth, that the great error of Republics has been, too much confidence placed in the virtues and talents of individuals, too much faith in their profeſſions, and power confided ſo long in their hands, that by its exerciſe the favorite has been deluded into a belief of that perfection artfully attributed to him, and learned to look upon his equals as the creatures of his will.</p>
            <p>Poſterity will in vain ſearch for the monuments of wiſdom in your adminiſtration; they will on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry find one of the moſt afflictive of political diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes inoculated on the conſtitution, in the funding ſyſtem—they will ſee the exciſe, a ſpecies of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equally odious and incongruous with freedom, giving birth to the firſt military effort of Freemen againſt their fellow citizens; a tax founded in the breach of domeſtic ſecurity, and engrafting on the municipal trunk the ſeeds of civil hate, diviſion, and corruption;—in vain will they ſeek for traces of eſtabliſhments or inſtitutions calculated to ſecure the perpetuity of freedom on the ſtrong baſis of education and moral equality;—examining in order to diſcover the true features of your character, the declarations of your former enemies and preſent friends will be minutely examined, who aſſert that your attachment to the revolution was not the reſult of a love of republican freedom, but of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ambition,—that had you obtained promotion, as you expected for the ſervices rendered after Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's defeat, your ſword would have been drawn againſt your country: comparing theſe aſſertions with ſad exiſting facts, they will diſcover that the great champion of American Freedom, the rival of Timoleon and Cincinnatus, twenty years after the eſtabliſhment of the Republic, was poſſeſſed of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031315_0047_0FEC0B6EAA1C4218"/>FIVE HUNDRED of the HUMAN SPECIES IN SLAVERY, enjoying the FRUITS OF THEIR LABOUR WITHOUT REMUNERATION, OR EVEN THE CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION—that he retained the barbarous uſages of the feudal ſyſtem, and kept men in LIVERY—and that he ſtill affected to be the friend of the Chriſtian Religion, of civil Liberty, and moral equality—and to be withal a diſintereſied, virtuous, liberal and unaſſuming man.</p>
            <p>I hen the foreign political incendiary, that <hi>feeds upon your praiſe,</hi> and the inſiduous native ſycophant, who <hi>battens</hi> on your ſhame, will have ſunk to their congenial home, and the ſcrutinizing eye of hiſtory will try you, as the ancient Egyptians were wont to do with their kings, and determine upon the merits of your life, by laws that ſpurn alike the meretricious evidence of incenſe and tinſel.</p>
            <p>I have done, Sir, what I deem a duty; you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily fond of flattery; indirect praiſe is to you the language of ſincerity; the ingenuity without the vehemence of truth, will offend: in preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my opinions, my earneſt wiſh is to expoſe the PERSONAL IDOLATRY into which we have been heedleſsly running—to awaken my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to a ſenſe of our true ſituation—and to ſhew them in the fallibility of the moſt favored of men, the neceſſity of thinking for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Should any one blame me for the plain truths here declared, and make any attempt to controvert or explain them away, I ſhall be governed in any attention I may beſtow thereon, by the degree of candor and temper they may diſplay; if I have miſtaken a fact, I ſhall not be backward to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, becauſe I have not ſtated a ſentiment but upon conviction of its rectitude—notice of any other kind ſhall be beneath mine.</p>
