            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Things that we have the Hiſtory of in this Book of <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſeem to be inſerted into the cannon of the Scripture eſpecially on two Accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt was of Ruth's Poſterity. The Holy Ghoſt thought fit to take particular Notice of that Marriage of Boaz with Ruth, whence ſprang the Savior of the World. — We may often obſerve it, that the Holy Spirit that indited the Scriptures often takes Notice of little Things, minute Occurrences, that do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe this Hiſtory ſeems to be typical of the Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gentile Church, and indeed of the Converſion of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer. Ruth was not originally of Iſrael, but was a Moab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iteſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Alien from the Common-wealth of Iſrael: But ſhe forſook her own People, and the Idols of the Gentiles, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the God of Iſrael, and to join herſelf to that People: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe ſeems to be a Type of the Gentile Church, and alſo of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſincere convert. Ruth was the Mother of Chriſt; he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">III Happineſs is no where elſe to be had, but in <hi>their God,</hi> &amp; with <hi>their People.</hi> There are that are called God's many, and Lords many. Some make Gods of their Pleaſures; ſome chooſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008589_0007_102F8AA580622CD0"/>
Mammon for their God; ſome make Gods of their own ſuppoſed Excellencies, or the outward Advantages they have above their Neighbours; ſome chooſe one thing for their God, and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: But Men can be happy in no other God but the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He is the only Fountain of Happineſs. Other Gods can't help in Calamity; nor can any of them afford what the poor empty Soul ſtands in Need of. Let Men adore thoſe other Gods never ſo much, and call upon them never ſo earneſtly, and ſerve them never ſo diligently, they will nevertheleſs remain poor, wretched, unſatisfied, undone Creatures. All other People are miſerable, but that People whoſe God is the Lord.—The World is divided into two Societies: There are the People of God, the little Flock of Jeſus Chriſt, that Company that we read of Rev. 14.4. <hi>Theſe are they which were not defiled with Women; for they are Virgins: Theſe are they which follow the Lomb whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth: Theſe were redeemed from among Men, being the firſt Fruits unto God and to the Lamb.</hi> And there are thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Kingdom of Darkneſs; that are without Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, having no Hope, and without God in the World. All that are of this latter Company, are wretched and undone; they are the Enemies of God, and under his Wrath and Condemnation: They are the Devil's Slaves, that ſerve him blindfold, and are befool'd and enſnared by him, and hurried along in the broad Way to eternal Perdition.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. When thoſe that we have formerly been converſant with, are turning to God, and to his People, <hi>their Example</hi> ought to influence us. Their Example ſhould be looked upon as the Call of God to us, to do as they have done. God, when he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Heart of One, calls upon Another; eſpecially does he loudly call on thoſe that have been their Friends and Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.—We have been influenced by their Examples in Evil, and ſhall we ceaſe to follow them when they make the wiſeſt Choice that ever they made, and do the beſt Thing that ever he did? If we have been Companions with them in Worldlineſs, in Vanity, in unproffitable and ſinful Converſation, it will be an hard Caſe, if there muſt be a parting now, becauſe we be not willing to be Companions with them in Holineſs, and true Happineſs. Men are greatly influenced by ſeeing one another's Proſperity in other Things. If thoſe that they have been much converſant with, grow rich, and obtain any great earthly Advantages, it awakens their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eager Deſire after the like Proſperity: How much more ſhould they be influenced, and ſtirred up to follow them, and be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008589_0008_102F8AA8AF0A09B8"/>
like them, when they obtain that ſpiritual and eternal Happineſs that is infinitely more worth than all the Proſperity and Glory of this World.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Our Reſolutions to cleave to and follow thoſe that are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and joining themſelves to his People, ought to be fixed and ſtrong, becauſe of the great Difficulty of it. If we will cleave to them, and have their God for our God, and their People for our People we muſt mortify and deny all our Laſts, and croſs every evil Appetite and Inclination, and forever part with all Sin. But our Luſts are many and violent. Sin is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally exceeding dear to us; to part with it is compared to pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our right Eyes. Men may refrain from wonted Ways of Sin for a little While, and may deny their Luſts in a partial Degree, with leſs Difficulty; but 'tis heart rending Work final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to part with all Sin, and give our deareſt Luſts a Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, utterly to ſend them away. But this we muſt do if we would follow thoſe that are truly turning to God: Yea, we muſt not only forſake Sin, but muſt, in a Senſe, forſake all the World, Luke 14.33 <hi>Whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> That is, he muſt forſake all <hi>in his Heart</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and muſt come to a thorough Diſpoſition and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, <hi>actually</hi> to quit all for God, and the glorious ſpiritual Privileges of his People, whenever the Caſe may require it; and that without any Proſpect of any Thing of the like Nature, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldly Thing whateſover to make Amends for it; and all to go into a ſtrange Country, a Land that has hitherto been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen; like Abraham, who being called of God, <hi>went out of his own Country, and from his Kindred, and from his Father's Houſe, for a Land that God would ſhew him, not knowing whither he went.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it was a hard Thing for Ruth to forſake her native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and her Father and Mother, her Kindred and Acquaintance, and all the pleaſant Things ſhe had in the Land of Moab, to dwell in the Land of Iſrael, where ſhe had never been.— Naomi told her of the Difficulties once and again. They were too hard for her Siſter Orpha; the Conſideration of them turned her back after ſhe was ſet out. Her Reſolution was not firm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to overcome them. But ſo firmly reſolved was Ruth that ſhe break through all; ſhe was ſteadfaſt in it, that let the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be what it would, ſhe would not leave her Mother-in law. So Perſons had need to be very firm in their Reſolution to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Difficulties that are in the Way of cleaving to them that are indeed turning from Sin to God.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Our cleaving to them, and having their God for our God,
