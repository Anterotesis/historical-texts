            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE natural increaſe of people upon the Britiſh continent of North-America is ſo great as to make it highly probable that in a few generations more a mighty Empire will be formed there.</p>
            <p>The riſe and progreſs of the ſeveral Colonies, of which this Empire will be conſtituted, will be ſubjects of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſpeculative and ingenious minds in diſtant ages.</p>
            <p>He who reſcues from oblivion intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hiſtorical facts is beneficial to poſterity as well as to his contemporaries, and the proſpect thereof to a benevolent mind cauſes that employment to be agreeable and pleaſant which otherwiſe would be irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and painful.</p>

            <p>The author of that Hiſtory was poſſeſſed of many other ancient and very curious original papers, which are irrecoverably loſt by an unfortunate event, ſufficiently known.</p>

               <head>Generall conſiderations for the plantation in New England, with an anſwer to ſeveral objections.</head>
               <p>FIRST, it will be a ſervice to the church of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to carry the goſpell into thoſe parts of the world, and to raiſe a bulwarke againſt the kingdom of Antichriſt which the Jeſuits labour to rear up in all places of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all other churches of Europe are brought to deſolation, and it may be juſtly feared that the like judgment is coming upon us; and who knows but that God hath provided this place to be a refuge for many whom he meanes to ſave out of the general deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the land growes weary of her inhabitants, ſo that man, which is the moſt precious of all creatures, is here more vile and baſe than the earth they tread upon; ſo as children, neighbours and friends, eſpecially of the poore, are counted the greateſt burdens which, if things were right, would be the higheſt earthly bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Fouthly. Wee are growen to that exceſs and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in all exceſs of riot as no meane eſtate almoſt will ſuffice to keep ſaile with his equals, and he that fayles in it muſt live in ſorrow and contempt. Hence it comes to paſſe that all arts and trades are carried in that deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner and unrighteous courſe as it is almoſt impoſſible for a good upright man to maintayne his chardge and live comfortably in any of them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. The ſchools of learning and religion are ſo corrupted, as (beſides the unſupportable chardge of this education) moſt children, (even the beſt wittieſt and of fayereſt hopes) are perverted, corrupted and utterly over powered by the multitude of evill examples and licentious governors of thoſe ſeminaries.</p>
               <p>Sixthly. The whole earth is the Lord's garden and hee hath given it to the ſons of Adam to bee tilled and improved by them, why then ſhould we ſtand ſtarving
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011300_0017_0F89727B7B74F280"/>
here for places of habitation (many men ſpending as much labour and coſt to recover or keepe ſometymes an acre or two of lands, as would procure him many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of acres, as good or better in another place) and in the meane tyme ſuffer whole countryes as profitable for the uſe of man, to lye waſte without any improvement?</p>
               <p>Seventhly. What can bee a better worke and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy a chriſtian, than to helpe to raiſe and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a particular church while it is in its infancy, and to join our forces with ſuch a company of faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as by a tymely aſſiſtance may grow ſtronger and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and for want of it may be put to great hazzard if not wholly ruined?</p>
               <p>Eightly. If any ſuch as are known to bee godly and live in wealth and proſperity here, ſhall forſake all this to joyn themſelves with this church, and runne in hazard with them of hard and meane condition, it will be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of great uſe both for the removing of ſcandall and ſiniſter and worldly reſpects, to give more lyfe to the faith of God's people in their prayers for the plantation and alſo to encourage others to joyne the more willingly in it.</p>
               <div type="objections">
                  <head>OBJECTIONS.</head>
                  <p>Object. 1. It will be a great wrong to our owne church and country to take away the beſt people; and we ſtill lay it more open to the judgments feared.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. 1ſt The number will be nothing in reſpect of thoſe that are left. 2dly, Many that live to no uſe here, more than for their own private familyes may bee employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a more common good in another place. 3dly, Such as are of good uſe here may yett be ſo employed as the church ſhall receive no loſſe. And ſince Chriſt's coming the church is to be conceived as univerſall without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of countryes, ſo as he that doth good in any one place ſerves the church in all places, in regard of the unitye. 4thly, It is the revealed will of God that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhould be preached to all nations, and though we know not whether the Indians will receive it or not, yet
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011300_0017_0F89727B7B74F280"/>
it is a good worke to obſerve God's will in offering it to them; for God ſhall have glory by it though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 2. Wee have feared a judgment a long tyme, but yet we are ſafe; therefore it were better to ſtay till it come, and either we may flie then, or if we be overtaken in it wee may well be content to ſuffer with ſuch a church as ours is.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. It is likely that this conſideration made the churches beyond the ſeas as the Palatinate and Rochel, &amp;c. to ſit ſtill at home, and not look out for ſhelter while they might have found it, but the wofull ſpectacle of their ruine may teach us more wiſdome to avoid the plague while it is foreſeene, and not to tarry as they did till it overtooke them. If they were now at their former liberty wee may be ſure they would take other courſes for their ſafety. And though moſt of them had miſcarried in their eſcape, yet it had not been halfe ſo miſerable to themſelves, or ſcandalous to religion, as this deſperate backſliding and abjuring the truth, which many of the antient profeſſors among them, and the whole poſterity that remayne are plunged into.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 3. Wee have here a fruitfull land with peace and plenty of all things.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. Wee are like to have as good conditions there in tyme; but yet we muſt leave all this abundance, if it bee not taken from us. When we are in our graves, it will be all one whether we have lived in plenty or in penury, whether we have dyed in a bed of downe or lockes of ſtraw. Onely this is the advantage of the meane condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is a more freedom to dye. And the leſſe comfort any have in the things of this world, the more liberty they have to lay up treaſure in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 4. Wee may periſh by the way or when wee come there, having hunger or the ſword, &amp;c. and how uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable will it be to ſee our wives and children and friends come to ſuch miſerie by our occaſion?</p>
                  <p>Anſ. Such objections favour too much of the fleſh. Who
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011300_0018_0F89727C7AB85940"/>
can ſecure himſelfe or his from the like calamities here? If this courſe be warrantable, we may truſt God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for theſe things. Either he will keepe thoſe evils from us, or will diſpoſe them for our good and enable us to beare them.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 5. But what warrant have we to take that land, which is and hath been of long tyme poſſeſſed of others the ſons of Adam?</p>
                  <p>Anſ. That which is common to all is proper to none. This ſavage people ruleth over many lands without title or property; for they incloſe no ground, neither have they cattell to maintayne it, but remove their dwellings as they have occaſion, or as they can prevail againſt their neighbours. And why may not chriſtians have liberty to go and dwell amongſt them in their waſte lands and woods (leaving them ſuch places as they have manured for their corne) as lawfully as Abraham did among the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites? For God hath given to the ſons of men a two-fould right to the earth; there is a naturall right and a civil right. The firſt right was naturall when men held the earth in common, every man ſowing and feeding where he pleaſed: Then, as men and cattell increaſed, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated ſome parcells of ground by encloſing and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manurance, and this in tyme got them a civil right. Such was the right which Ephron the Hittite had to the field of Machpelah, wherein Abraham could not bury a dead corpſe without leave, though for the out parts of the countrey which lay common, he dwelt upon them and tooke the fruite of them at his pleaſure. This appears alſo in Jacob and his ſons, who fedd their flocks as bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Canaanites land, for he is ſaid to be lord of the country; and at Dotham and all other places men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted nothing their owne, but that which they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated by their own induſtry, as appears plainly by Abimelech's ſervants, who in their own countrey did often contend with Iſaac's ſervants about wells which they had digged; but never about the lands which they occupied. So likewiſe betweene Jacob and Laban; he would not
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011300_0018_0F89727C7AB85940"/>
take a kidd of Laban's without ſpeciall contract; but he makes no bargaine with him for the land where he fedd. And it is probable that if the countrey had not been as free for Jacob as for Laban, that covetuous wretch would have made his advantage of him, and have upbraided Jacob with it as he did with the reſt. 2dly, There is more than enough for them and us. 3dly, God hath conſumed the natives with a miraculous plague, whereby the greater part of the country is left voide of inhabitants. 4thly, We ſhall come in with good leave of the natives.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 6. We ſhould ſend our young ones and ſuch as can beſt be ſpared, and not of the beſt of our miniſters and magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. It is a great worke, and requires more ſkilfull ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers to lay the foundation of a new building, than to uphold and repayre one that is already built. If great things be attempted by weake inſtruments, the effects will be anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 7. Wee ſee that thoſe plantations that have been formerly made ſucceeded ill.</p>

The fruit of any public deſigne is not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the imediate ſucceſs: it may appear in tyme, that they were all to good uſe. 2dly, There were great fundamental errours in others, which are like to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this: for 1ſt there mayne end and purpoſe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and not religious. 2d, They aymed chiefly at profitt and not at the propagation of religion. 3d, They uſed too unfitt inſtruments, a multitude of rude and ungoverned perſons, the very ſcums of the land. 4th, They did not ſtabliſh a right fourme of government.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE Company of New England, conſiſting of many worthy gentlemen in the citty of London, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and other places, ayming at the glory of God, the propagation of the goſpell of Chriſt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Indians, and the enlargement of the King's Majeſty's dominions in America, and being authoriſed by his royal letters patents for that end, at their very great coſts and charges, furniſhed 5 ſhips to go to New England, for the further ſettling of the Engliſh plantation that they had already begun there.</p>
               <p>The names of the 5 ſhipps were as followeth.</p>
               <p>The firſt is called the Talbot, a good and ſtrong ſhip of 300 tunnes, and 19 pieces of ordinance, and ſerved with 30 mariners. This ſhip carried about an 100 planters, 6 goates, 5 great pieces of ordinance, with meale, oatemeale, peaſe, and all manner of munition and proviſion for the plantation for a twelve monthe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond the George, another ſtrong ſhip alſo, about 300 tunnes, 20 pieces of ordinance, ſerved with about 30
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011300_0019_0F89727CF4046BE8"/>
mariners; her chiefe carriage were cattell, 12 mares, 30 kyne, and ſome goates: Alſo there gad in her 52 planters and other proviſion.</p>
               <p>The third is called the Lyon's Whelpe, a neat and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhip of 120 tunnes, 8 pieces of ordinance, carrying in her many mariners and about 40 planters, ſpecially from Dorceſter and other places thereabouts, with proviſion, and 4 goats.</p>
               <p>The 4th is called the Four Siſters, as I heare, of about 300 tunns, which ſayme ſhip carried many cattell, with paſſengers and proviſion.</p>
               <p>The 5th is called the Mayflower, carrying paſſengers and proviſion.</p>
               <p>Now amongſt theſe 5 ſhips, the George having the ſpecial and urgent cauſe of haſtening her paſſage, ſet ſayle before the reſt about the middle of April. And the Four Siſters and the Mayflower, being not thoroughly furniſhed, intended, as we heard, to ſet forth about 3 week after us: But we that were in the Talbot and the Lyon's Whelpe, being ready for our voyage, by the good hand of God's providence, hoyſted our ſayle from Graves-end on Saturday the 25th of April, about 7 o'clock in the morning. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a faynt wynd we could not go farre that day, but at night we arrived againſt Leigh, which is 12 miles from Graves-end, and there we reſted that night, and kept Sabbath the next day.</p>
               <p>On Monday (the 27th) we ſat forward and came to the flatts, a paſſage ſomewhat difficult by reaſon of the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the channel and ſhallownes of the water; and going over this we were in ſome daunger: for the ſhip being heavy laden and drawing deepe water was ſenſibly felt of us all to ſtrike 3 or 4 tymes on the ground: but the wind blowing ſomewhat ſtrong we were carried ſwiftly on, and at laſt by God's bleſſing came ſafe to ancre at Gorin roade.</p>
               <p>Tueſday (28th) we went a little further, and ancred over againſt Margret downe, ſtaying for a wind for the Downes.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday (29th) we came ſafely through with much turning and tacking thorow the gullies into the Downes, and ſtayed that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:011300_0020_0F89727DB30F1F08"/>Thurſday (30th) Fryday and Saturday (May 1ſt &amp; 2d) the wind blew hard from ſouth weſt and cauſed our ſhip to daunce, and divers of our paſſengers and my wiffe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially were ſea ſicke. Here the King's ſhip called the Aſſurance, preſſed 2 of our mariners. Here we ſaw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny porpuſes playing in the ſea, which they ſay is a ſigne of fowle weather.</p>
               <p>(May 3.) Sabbath day, a windye day and could: We kept Sabbath ſtaying ſtill at the Downes.</p>
               <p>Monday (4th) God ſent us a fayre gale of winde, North N. Eaſt, whereby we came merrily from the Downes, and paſſing Dover we ſaw 6 or 7 ſaile of Dunkirkers wafting after us; but it ſeemed they ſaw our company was too ſtrong for them, for then we had with us 3 or 4 ſhips that went for the Streights: So they returned backe from purſuing us any longer. But ſayling with a good wind we went ſpeedily, and at night came neere the Iſle of Wight, but being darke, we durſt not put into the channell, but put backe for ſea-roome 4 houres, and then other 4 houres ſayled backe agayne the ſame way.</p>
               <p>Tueſday (5th) early in the morning we entered the channell, the wind being weake and calme, and paſſed by Portſmouth very ſlowly; but in the afternoone the wind quickened, and we were forced to ancre a little on this ſide Cowcaſtle, but the wind growing more favourable, we weighed and came to ancre againe, right againſt Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, thinking to ſtay that night, the wind being very calme. Here I and my wiffe and my daughter Mary, and 2 maids, and ſome others with us, obtained of the maſter of the ſhip to go a ſhoare to refreſh us, and to waſh our linnens, and ſo we lay at Cowes that night. But the wind turning when we were abſent, they hoyſted ſayle and left us there, and ancred 8 miles further, over againſt Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, about 8 of the clocke at night.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday (6th) betyme in the morning the ſhalope was ſent from the ſhip to fetch us to Yarmouth; but the water proved rough and our women deſired to be ſett on ſhoare 3 miles ſhort of Yarmouth, and ſo went on foote by land and lodged in Yarmouth that night.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Saturday (9th) we went to board againe; and this day we had 2 other men preſſed to ſerve the King's ſhip; but we got one agayne by intreaty.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath next day (10th) we kept the ſhip, where I preached in the morning; and in the afternoone was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to preach at Yarmouth, where Mr. Meare and Captain Borley entertained us very kyndly, and earneſtly deſired to be ſatisfied of our ſafe arrivall in New England, and of the ſtate of the country.</p>
               <p>Monday morning (11th) blew a fayre wind from E.S.E. and the Lion's Whelpe having taken in all her proviſion for paſſengers, about 3 of the clocke in the afternoone we hoyſed ſayle for the Needles, and by God's guidance ſafely paſſed that narrow paſſage a little after 4 a clocke in the afternoone. And being entred into the ſea, from the top of the maſt, we diſcerned 4 ſayle of ſhips lying ſouthward from us. But night coming on we tooke in our long boate and ſhalope. And the next day (12th) we had a fayre gale of eaſterly wind that brought us towards night as farre as the Lizzard.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday (10th) the wind ſtill houlding eaſterly, we came as farre as the land's end, in the utmoſt part of Cornwall, and ſo left our deare native ſoyle of England behind us; and ſayling about 10 leagues further we paſſed the Iles of Scillic and launched the ſame day a great way into the maine ocean. And now my wiffe and other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers began to feele the toſſing waves of the weſterne ſea, and ſo were very ſea ſicke,</p>
               <p>And this is to be noted, that all this while our paſſage hath beene upon the coaſt of England, ſo ought truly to be accounted the firſt day of our parting with Ould England.</p>
               <p>Thurſday (14th) the ſame eaſterly wind blew all day and night, and the next day (15th) ſo that ſome of the ſeamen thought we were come by this tyme 200 leagues from England, but toward night the wind was calme.</p>

                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:011300_0021_0F89727E7555A408"/>Saturday (16th) we were be calmed all day. This day met us a little ſhip that came from Chriſtopher iſlands.</p>
               <p>Sabbath (17th) being the firſt Lord's day we held at ſea was very calme, eſpecially in the morning, but we were diſturbed in our morning ſervice by the appearance of a Biſcayners ſhip, a man of warre, that made towards us, and manned out his boate to view us: But finding us too ſtrong for him he durſt not venture to aſſault us, but made off.</p>
               <p>This day my two children Samuel and Mary began to be ſicke of the ſmall pocks and purples together, which was brought into the ſhip by one Mr. Browne who was ſicke of the ſame at Graves-end, whom it pleaſed God to make the firſt occaſion of bringing that contagious ſicknes among us, wherewith many were after afflicted.</p>
               <p>Monday (18th) calme ſtill, the wind being N.W. blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little towards evening, but contrary to our courſe.</p>
               <p>Tueſday (19th) wind S. W. as little helpfull as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and blowing very weake. This day the maſter of the ſhip, myſelfe and another went aboard the Lion's Whelpe, where Mr. Gibs made us welcome with bountifull enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. And this day towards night my daughter grew ſicker, and many blew ſpots were ſeene upon her breaſt, which affrighted us. At the firſt we thought they had beene the plague tokens; but we found afterwards that it was only an high meaſure of the infection of the pocks, which were ſtrucke agayne into the child, and ſo it was God's will the child dyed about 5 of the clocke at night, being the firſt in our ſhip that was buried in the bowells of the great Atlantic ſea; which, as it was a griefe to us her parents and a terrrour to all the reſt, as being the beginning of a contagious diſeaſe and mortality, ſo in the ſame judgment it pleaſed God to remember mercy in the child, in forcing it from a world of miſery wherein other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe had lived all her daies. For being about 4 years ould, a yeare ſince, we know not by what meanes, ſweyed in the backe, ſo that it was broken and grew crooked, and the joynts of her hipps were looſed and her knees went crooked, pittiful to ſee. Since which ſhe hath had a moſt

lamentable payne in her belly, and would oft tymes cry out in the day and in her ſleep alſo, my belly! which declared her extraordinary diſtemper. So that in reſpect of her we had cauſe to take her death as a bleſſing from the Lord to ſhorten her miſerie.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday (20th) a wet morning, the wind was W.S.W. and in the afternoone N.W. by W. both being contrary to our courſe, which was to ſaile W.byS. Thus it pleaſed God to lay his hand upon us by ſicknes and death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds; and ſtirred up ſome of us to make the motion of humbling ourſelves under the hand of God by keeping a ſolemn day of faſting and prayer unto God, to beſeech him to remove the continuance and further increaſe of theſe evills from us, which was willingly condeſcended unto as a duty very fitting and needful for our preſent ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>Thurſday (21ſt) there being two miniſters in the ſhip, Mr. Smith and myſelfe, we endeavoured, together with others, to conſecrate the day as a ſolemn faſting and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation to Almighty God, as a furtherance of our preſent worke. And it pleaſed God the ſhip was becalmed all day, ſo that we were freed from any encumbrance: And as ſonne as we had done prayers, ſee and behold the goodnes of God, about 7 a clock at night the wind turned to N.

I heard ſome of the mariners ſay, they thought this was the firſt ſea-faſt that ever was kept, and that they never heard of the like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed at ſea before.</p>
               <p>Fryday (22d) the wind fayre, and eaſt northerly, and for our purpoſe for New England. It did blow ſtrongly and carried us on amayne with toſſing waves, which did affright them that were not wonted to ſuch ſights.</p>

This day Mr. Goffe's great dog fell overboard and could not be recovered.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday (27th) the wind ſtill N. and calme in the morning, but about noone there aroſe a So. wind, which encreaſed more and more, ſo that it proved to us that are landmen a ſore and terrible ſtorme; for the wind blew mightily, the rayne fell vehemently, the ſea roared and the waves toſſed us horribly; beſides it was fearefull darke and the mariners mait was afraid; and noyſe on the other ſide with their running here and there, lowd crying one to another to pull at this and that rope. The waves powred themſelves over the ſhip that the 2 boats were filled with water, that they were fayne to ſtrike holes in the midſt of them to let the water out. Yea by the violence of the waves the long boats roape which held it was broken, and it had like to have been waſhed overboard, had not the mariners with much payne and daunger recovered the ſame. But this laſted not many hours; after which it became a calmiſh day. All which while I lay cloſe and warme in my cabine, but farre from having liſt to ſleepe with Jonah; my thoughts were otherwiſe employed as the tyme and and place required. Then I ſaw the truth of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Pſal. 107. from the 23d to the 32d. And my feare at this tyme was the leſſe, when I remembred what a loving friend of myne, a miniſter accuſtomed to ſea ſtormes ſaid to me that I might not be diſmayed at ſuch ſtormes, for they were ordinary at ſea, and it ſeldome falls out that a ſhip periſheth at them if it have ſea-roome.

               <p>Sabbath day (31ſt) being the 3d Lord's day, fayre and calme; we ſaw abundance of grampus fiſhes, 2 or 3 yards long, and a body as bigg as an oxe.</p>
               <p>Monday (June 1) the wind weſterly and calme: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our being ſtayed by contrary winds we begun to find the temperature of the ayre to alter and to become more ſoletry and ſubject to unwholſome foggs. For coming now to the height of the Weſterne Ilands, ſome of our men fell ſicke of the ſcurvie and others of the ſmall pockes, which more and more increaſed: Yet thankes be to God none dyed of it but my owne child mentioned. And therefore, according to our great need, we appointed another faſt for the next day.</p>
               <p>Tueſday (2d) we ſolemnly celebrate another faſt. The Lord that day heard us before we prayed and gave us an anſwer before we called; for early in the morning the wind turned full eaſt, being as fitt a wind as could blow. And ſitting at my ſtudy on the ſhip's poope I ſaw many bonny fiſhes and porpuſes purſuing one another, and leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of them a yard above the water. Alſo as we were at prayers under the hatch, ſome that were above ſaw a whale puffing up water not farre from the ſhip. Now my wiffe was pretty well recovered of her ſea-ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday (3d) a fayre day and fine gale of full Eaſt wind. This day myſelfe and others ſaw a large round fiſh ſayling by the ſhip's ſide, about a yard in length and roundeth every way.

This day a fiſh very ſtraunge to me, they call it a carvell; which came by the ſhip ſide, wafting along the top of the water. It appeared at the the firſt like a bubble above the water as bigg as a man's fiſt, but the fiſh itſelfe is about the bignes

We ſaw a mountayne of ice ſhining as white as ſnow like to a great rocke or clift on ſhoare, it ſtood ſtill and therefore we thought it to be on ground and to reach the bottome of the ſea. For though there came a mighty ſtreame from the north yet it moved not, which made us ſound, and we found a banke of 40 fathom deepe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we judged it to reſt: and the height above was as much. We ſaw alſo 6 or 7 pieces of ice, floating on the ſea, which was broken off from the former mountayne. We alſo ſaw great ſtore of water fowle ſwimming by the ſhipp within muſket ſhott, of a pyde colour and about the bigneſs of a wild duck, about 40 in a company. The mariners call them hag birds. Towards night came a fogge, that the Lions Whelp was loſt till morning. And now we ſaw many bony fiſh porpuſes and grampuſes every day more and more.</p>
               <p>Fryday (12th) Foggie and calmiſh, the wind northerly in the morning, but about noon it came S. E. a dainty loome gale which carried us 6 leagues a watch.</p>
               <p>Saturday (13th) the ſame wind till night, and we ſaw great ſtore of porpuſes and grampuſes.</p>
               <p>The 5th ſabbath, (14th) the ſame wind, towards noon it began to be foggie, and then it rained till night, we went 4 or 5 leagues a watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:011300_0023_0F89727FF52210E8"/>Monday (15th) a fayre day but foggie, the ſame wind blowing but with freſh gales carried us 7 leagues a watch. In the afternoon it blew harder, ſo the ſea was rough, and we loſt the ſight of the Whelpe: it being foggie we drummed for them, and they ſhot of a great piece of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but we heared not one another.</p>
               <p>Tueſday (16th) wind S. by E. foggie till about 10 a clocke. While we were at prayers it cleared up about an houre, and then we ſaw the Lion's Whelpe, diſtant about 2 leagues ſouthward, we preſently tackt about to meet her, and ſhe did the ſame to meet us, but before we could get together a thick fogge came, that we were long in finding each other. This day we ſounded divers tymes, and found ourſelves on another banke, at firſt 40 fathom, after 36, after 33, after 24. We thought it to have been the bank over againſt Cape Sable, but we were deceived, for we knew not certainly where we were becauſe of the fogge. After 3 or 4 hours company we loſt the Lion's Whelpe agayne, and beate the drum and ſhot of a great piece of ordinance, and yet heard not of them. But perceiving the banke to grow ſtill ſhallower we found it 27 and 24 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms. Therefore, being a fogg, and fearing we were too neare land we tackt about for ſea-roome for 2 or 3 watches, and ſteered ſoutheaſt.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday (17th) very foggie ſtill, and wind S. by W. and ſounding found no bottome that we could reach.</p>
               <p>Thurſday (18th) wind full W. and contrary to us. This day a notorious wicked fellow that was given to ſwering and boaſting of his former wickednes, bragged that he had got a wench with child before he came this voyage, and mocked at our daies of faſt, railing and jeſting againſt puritans, this fellow fell ſick of the pockes and dyed. We ſounded and found 38 fathom, and ſtayed, for a little while, to take ſome cod fiſh, and feaſted ourſelves merrily.</p>
               <p>Fryday (19th) wind Weſt ſtill, a very fayre cleare day. About 4 a clock in the afternoone ſome went up to the top of the maſt, and affirmed to our great comfort they ſaw land to the northeaſtward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:011300_0024_0F897280B8F9E448"/>Saturday (20th) wind S. W. a fayre gale. We ſounded and found 40, 30, 22, and a little after no ground.</p>
               <p>Sabbath (21ſt) being the 6th Lord's day; wind norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but fayre and calm.</p>
               <p>Monday (22d) wind eaſterly, a fayre gale. This day we ſaw a great deal of froth not farre from us: we feared it might be ſome breach of water againſt ſome rockes, therefore the maſter of our ſhip hoiſted out the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop and went with ſome of the men to ſee what it was; but found it onely to be a froath carried by the ſtreame.</p>
               <p>Tueſday (23d) the wind N. E. a fayre gale.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday (24th) wind N. E. a fayre day and cleare; about 9 a clocke in the morning we eſpied a ſhipp about 4 leagues behind us; which proved to be the Lions Whelpe, which had been a weeke ſeperated from us, we ſtoped for her company. This day a child of good man Clarke, which had a conſumption before it came to ſhipp, died. This day we had all a cleare and comfortable ſight of America, and of the Cape Sable that was over againſt us 7 or 8 leagues northward. Here we ſaw yellow gilliflowers on the ſea.</p>
               <p>Thurſday (25th) wind ſtill N. E. a full and freſh gale. In the afternoon we had a cleare ſight of many iſlands and hills by the ſea ſhoare. Now we ſaw abundance of mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, a great ſtore of great whales puffing up water as they goe, ſome of them came neere our ſhipp: this creature did aſtoniſh us that ſaw them not before; their back appeared like a little iſland. At 5 a clocke at night the wind turned S. E. a fayre gale. This day we caught mackrill.</p>
               <p>Fryday (26th) a foggie morning, but after cleare and wind calme. We ſaw many ſcools of mackrill, infinite multitudes on every ſide our ſhip. The ſea was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſtored with rockweed and yellow flowers like gilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers. By noon we were within 3 leagues of Capan, and as we ſayled along the coaſts we ſaw every hill and dale and every iſland full of gay woods and high trees. The nearer we came to the ſhoare the more flowers in abundance, ſometymes ſcattered abroad, ſometymes joyned
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011300_0024_0F897280B8F9E448"/>
in ſheets 9 or 10 yards long, which we ſuppoſed to be brought from the low meadowes by the tyde. Now what with fine woods and greene trees by land, and theſe yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low flowers paynting the ſea, made us all deſirous to ſee our new paradiſe of New England, whence we ſaw ſuch forerunning ſignals of fertilitie afarre off. Coming neare the harbour towards night we takt about for ſea-roome.</p>
               <p>Saturday (27th) a foggie morning; but after 8 o'clocke in the morning very cleare, the wind being ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary at So. and by Weſt, we tackt to and againe with get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting little; but with much adoe, about 4 o'clock in the afternoone, having with much payne compaſſed the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and being ready to enter the ſame, ſee how things may ſuddenly change! there came a fearfull guſt of wind and rayne and thunder and lightning, whereby we were borne with no little terrour and trouble to our mariners, having very much adoe to looſe downe the ſayles when the fury of the ſtorme held up. But God be praiſed it laſted but a while and ſoone abated agayne, And hereby the Lord ſhewed us what he could have done with us, if it had pleaſed him. But bleſſed be God, he ſoone removed this ſtorme and it was a fayre and ſweet evening.</p>
               <p>We had a weſterly wind which brought us between 5 and 6 o'clock to a fyne and ſweet harbour, 7 miles from the head point of Capan. This harbour 20 ſhips may eaſily ryde therein, where there was an iſland whither four of our men with a boate went, and brought backe agayne ripe ſtrawberries and gooſeberries, and ſweet ſingle roſes. Thus God was merciful to us in giving us a taſt and ſmell of the ſweet fruit as an earneſt of his bountiful goodnes to welcome us at our firſt arrivall. This harbour was two leagues and ſomething more from the harbour at Naim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kecke, where our ſhips were to reſt, and the plantation is already begun. But becauſe the paſſage is difficult and night drew on, we put into Capan habour.</p>
               <p n="28">(28th) The Sabbath, being the firſt we kept in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and the 7th Lord's day after we parted with England.</p>
               <p>Monday (29th) we came from Capan, to go to Naim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kecke,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011300_0025_0F897281725B9A00"/>
the wind northerly. I ſhould have tould you before that the planters ſpying our Engliſh colours the Governour ſent a ſhalop with 2 men on Saturday to pilot us. Theſe reſted the Sabbath with us at Capan; and this day, by God's bleſſing and their directions, we paſſed the curious and difficult entrance into the large ſpacious harbour of Naimkecke. And as we paſſed along it was wonderful to behould ſo many iſlands repleniſhed with thicke wood and high trees, and many fayre greene paſtures. And being come into the harbour we ſaw the George to our great comfort then being come on Tueſday which was 7 daies before us. We reſted that night with glad and thankful hearts that God had put an end to our long and tedious journey through the greateſt ſea in the world.</p>
               <p>The next morning (30th) the governour came aboard to our ſhip, and bade us kindly welcome, and invited me and my wiffe to come on ſhoare, and take our lodging in his houſe, which we did accordingly,</p>
               <p>Thus you have a faithful report collected from day to day of all the particulars that were worth noting in our paſſage.</p>
               <div type="remarkable_things">
                  <head>NOW in our paſſage divers things are remarkeable.</head>
                  <p>FIRST, through God's bleſſing our paſſage was ſhort and ſpeedy, for whereas we had 1000 leagues, that is 3000 miles Engliſh, to ſaile from Ould to New England, we performed the ſame in 6 weeks and 3 dayes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our paſſage was comfortable and eaſie for the moſt part, having ordinarily fayre and moderate wind, and being freed for the moſt part from ſtormie and rough ſeas, ſaving one night only, which we that were not uſed thought to be more terrible than indeed it was, and this was Wedneſday at night May 27th.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our paſſage was alſo healthfull to our paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, being freed from the great contagion of the ſcurvie
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011300_0025_0F897281725B9A00"/>
and other maledictions, which in other paſſages to other places had taken away the lives of many. And yet we were in all reaſon in wonderful danger all the way, our ſhip being greatly crowded with paſſengers; but through God's great goodneſs we had none that died of the pockes but that wicked fellow that ſcorned at faſting and prayer. There were indeed 2 little children, one of my owne and another beſide; but I do not impute it meerely to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; for they were both very ſickly children, and not likely to have lived long, if they had not gone to ſea. And take this for a rule, if children be healthfull when they come to ſea, the younger they are the better they will endure the ſea, and are not troubled with ſea-ſicknes as older people are, as we had experience in many children that went this voyage. My wiffe indeed, in toſſing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was ſomething ill by vomiting, but in calme weather ſhe recovered agayne, and is now much better for the ſea ſicknes. And for my owne part, whereas I have for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yeares paſt been very ſickly and ready to caſt up what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have eaten, and was very ſicke at London and Graveſend, yet from the tyme I came on ſhipboard to this day, I have been ſtraungely healthfull. And now I can digeſt our ſhip diett very well, which I could not when I was at land. And indeed in this regard I have great cauſe to give God praiſe, that he hath made my coming to be a method to cure me of a wonderful weake ſtomacke and continual payne of melancholly wynd from the ſplene: Alſo divers children were ſicke of the ſmall pockes, but are ſafely recovered agayne, and 2 or 3 paſſengers towards the latter end of the voyage fell ſicke of the ſcurvie, but coming to land recovered in a ſhort tyme.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, our paſſage was both pleaſurable and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. For we received inſtruction and delight in behould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wonders of the Lord in the deepe waters, and ſometimes ſeeing the ſea round us appearing with a terrible countenance, and as it were full of high hills and deepe vallyes; and ſometimes it appeared as a moſt plain and even meadow. And ever and anon we ſaw divers kynds of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011300_0026_0F89728301D0FF10"/>
fiſhes ſporting in the great waters, great grampuſes and huge whales going by companies and puffing up water-ſtreames. Thoſe that love their owne chimney corner, and dare not go farre beyond their owne townes end ſhall neever have the honour to ſee theſe wonderfull workes of Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, we had a pious and chriſtian-like paſſage; for I ſuppoſe paſſengers ſhall ſeldom find a company of more religious, honeſt and kynd ſeamen than we had. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſerved God morning and evening by reading and expounding a chapter, ſinging, and prayer. And the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was ſolemnely kept by adding to the former, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twiſe and catechiſing. And in our great need we kept 2 ſolemne faſts, and found a gracious effect. Let all that love and uſe faſting and praying take notiſe that it is as prevaileable by ſea as by land, whereſoever it is faithfully performed. Beſides the ſhip maſter and his company uſed every night to ſett their 8 and 12 a clocke watches with ſinging a pſalme and prayer that was not read out of a booke. This I wryte not for boaſting and flattery; but for the benefit of thoſe that have a mynd to come to New England hereafter, that if they looke for and deſyre to have as proſperous a voyage as we had, they may uſe the ſame meanes to attayne the ſame. So letting paſſe our paſſage by ſea, we will now bring our diſcourſe to land on the ſhoare of New England, and I ſhall by God's aſſiſtance endeavour to ſpeake nothing but the naked truth, and both acquaint you with the commodities and diſcommodities of the country.</p>

                  <p>NOW for the preſent condition of the plantation what it is. When we came firſt to Naimkecke, now called Salem, we found about half a ſcore houſes built: and a fayre
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011300_0026_0F89728301D0FF10"/>
houſe newly built for the governour, and we found alſo abundance of corne planted by them, excellent good and well liking. We brought with us about 200 paſſengers and planters more, which now by common conſent of all the ould planters are all now combyned together into one body politique under the ſame governor. There are with us in all ould and new planters 300, whereof 200 are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at Naimkecke, now called Salem, and the reſt plant themſelves at Maſſachuſets bay, being to build a towne there called Charleſton or Charleſtowne; we that are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at Salem make what haſte we can to build, ſo that within a ſhort tyme we ſhall have a fayre towne. We have great ordnance whereof we doubt not but to fortifye ourſelves in ſhort tyme, to keepe out a potent adverſarye. But that which is our greateſt comfort and means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence above all others, is, that we have here the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and holy ordinances of almighty God amongſt us. Thanks be to God we have plenty of preaching and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent catechiſing, with ſtrict and carefull exerciſe of good and commendable orders to bring our people to chriſtian converſation, which whilſt we do we doubt not but God will be with us, and ſo Rom. 8.31. what ſhall we then ſay to theſe things. If God be with us who can be againſt us?</p>

                  <head>Some brief collections out of a letter that Mr. Higginſon ſent to his friends at Leiceſter.</head>
                  <p>THERE are certainly expected here the next ſpring the coming of 60 familyes out of Dorcetterſhire, who have by letters ſignified ſo much to the Governour to deſyre him to appoint them places of habitations; they bringing their miniſters with them. Alſo many families are expected out of Lincolnſhire and a miniſter with them, and a great company of godly chriſtians out of London. Such of you as come from Leiſter, I would counſell you to come quickly, and that for two reaſons. 1ſt, if you lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger too long, the paſſages of Jordan through the malice of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011300_0027_0F897284137FF180"/>
Sathan may be ſtopped; that you can not come if you would. 2dly, Thoſe that come firſt ſpeed beſt here, and have the priviledge of chooſing choiſe places of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Little children of 5 years ould may by ſetting corne one month be able to get their owne maintenance abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. Oh what a good worke might you that are rich do for your poore brethren, to helpe them with your purſes onely to convey them hither with their children and families, where they may live as well both for ſoule and body as any where in the the world. Beſides they will recompenſe the coſt by helping to build houſes and plant your ground for a tyme; which ſhall be difficult worke at the firſt, except you have the helpe of many hands. Mr. Johnſon out of Lincolnſhire and many others have helped our godly chriſtians hither, to be employed in their worke for a while, and then to live of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We have here about 40 goats that give milke, and as many milch kyne; we have 6 or 7 mares and an horſe, and do every day expect the coming of half a ſcore mares more, and 30 kyne by two ſhipps that are to follow us. They that come let them bring mares, kyne and ſheepe as many as they can: Ireland is the beſt place to provide ſheepe, and lyes in the way. Bring none that are in lambe, nor mares in foale; for they are in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to periſh at ſea. Of all trades carpenters are moſt needful, therefore bring as many as you can. It were a wiſe courſe for thoſe that are of abilityes to joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and buy a ſhipp for the voyage and other merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize. For the governor would that any man may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his ſtocke in what merchandiſes he pleaſe, excepting onely beaver ſkins, which the company of merchants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to themſelves and the managing of the publique ſtocke. If any be of the mynde to buy a ſhipp, my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin Nowells counſell would be good. Alſo one Mr. — a very godly man and the maſter of the ſhip we went in, and likewiſe one Mr. Graves the maſter's maite, dwelling in Wapping, may herein ſtaund you in ſteed.

                  <p>No man hath or can have a houſe built for him here unleſſe he comes himſelfe, or elſe ſends ſeruants before to do it for him. It was an errour that I now perceive both in myſelfe, and others did conceive by not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the merchaunts meaning. For we thought that all that put in their money into the common ſtocke ſhould have a houſe built for them, beſides ſuch a portion of land; but it was not ſo. They ſhall indeed have ſo much land allotted to them when they come to take poſſeſſion of it and make uſe of it, but if they will have houſes they muſt build them. Indeed we that are miniſters, and all the reſt that were entertained and ſent over and maintained by the reſt of the company, as their ſervants, for ſuch a tyme in ſuch employments, all ſuch are to have houſes built them of the companies charge and no others nor otherwiſe. They that put money into the ſtocke, as they do a good worke to helpe forwards ſo worthy a plantation, ſo all the gayne they are like to have, is according to the increaſe of the ſtocke at 3 yeares end, by the trade of beaver, beſides the lands which they ſhall enjoy when they will.</p>
                  <p>All that come muſt have victualls with them for a twelve month, I meane they muſt have meale, oatmeale and ſuch like ſuſtenaunce of food, till they can gett increaſe of corne by their owne labour. For, otherwiſe, ſo many may come without proviſion at the firſt, as that our ſmall beginnings may not be ſufficient to maintayne them.</p>
                  <p>Before you come be carefull to be ſtrongly inſtructed what things are fitteſt to bring with you for your more comfortable paſſage at ſea, as alſo for your huſbandrey oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions when you come to the land. For when you are once parted with England you ſhall meete neither with taverns nor alehouſe, nor butchers, nor groſers, nor apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries ſhops to helpe what things you need, in the midſt of the great ocean, nor when you are come to land, here
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011300_0028_0F897284724E5778"/>
are yet neither markets nor fayres to buy what you want. Therefore be ſure to furniſh yourſelves with things fitting to be had before you come; as meale for bread, malt for drinke, woollen and linnen cloath, and leather for ſhoes, and all manner of carpenters tooles, and a good deale of iron and ſteele to make nailes, and lockes for houſes and furniture for ploughs and carts, and glaſſe for windowes, and many other things which were better for you to think of them there than to want them here.</p>

               <p>I Did expect to have beene with you in perſon at the court, and to that end I put to ſea yeſterday and was driven back againe the wind being ſtiffe againſt us. And there being noe canoe or boate at Saguſt I muſt have beene conſtrained to goe to Miſtick and thence about to Charles town, which at that time I durſt not be ſo bold, my bodie being at this preſent in an ill condition to wade or take cold, and therefore I deſire you to pardon mee.

I left myne there this winter to doe Mr. Skelton a pleaſure to keepe his for him here at Salem that he might have the benefit of their milk. And I underſtand by

Wincoll that they have been ill tended and he ſaith almoſt ſtarved. Beſides they have fed on acornes and they cannot digeſt them for that they vomitt exceedinglie and are ſo bound in their bodies that he is faine to rake them and to uſe all his ſkill to maintaine life in them. I have willed him to be there till he can bring them to ſome ſtrength againe if it be poſſible. And I have given him malt to make them maſhes of licoris and annis ſeedes and long pepper and ſuch other things as I had to drench them. I could wiſh when Manning hath recovered his ſtrength that you would free him, for he will never doe you or Mr. Hewſon ſervice, for when he was well he was as negligent as the worſt of them. Mr. Skelton, myſelfe and the reſt of the congregation deſire to be thankfull to God and yourſelfe for your benevolence to Mr. Haughtons child. The Lord reſtore it you. I prevailed with much adoe with Sir Richard for an old debt heere, which he thought was deſperate, to contribute it, which, I hope I ſhall make good for the child. I think Mr. Skelton hath written, to you, whome he thinks ſtand moſt in neede of contribution of ſuch proviſions as you will be pleaſed to give amongſt us of that which was ſent over. The yeele potts you ſent for are made, which I had in my boate, hoping to have brought them with mee. I cauſed him to make but two for the preſent, if you like them and his prices (for he worketh for himſelfe) you ſhall have as many as you deſire. He ſelleth them for 4 ſhillings a peece. Sir, I deſired the rather to have beene at court becauſe I heare I am much complayned on by goodman Dexter, for ſtrikeing him. I acknowledge I was too raſh in ſtrikeing him, underſtanding ſince that it is not lawfull for a juſtice of peace to ſtrike. But if you had ſeene the manner of his carriadge with ſuch daring of mee with his armes on kembow, &amp;c. It would have provoked a very patient man. But I will write noe more of it but leave it till we ſpeak before you face to face. Onely thus farre further that he hath given out if I had a purſe he would make mee empty it, and if he cannot have juſtice heere he will doe wonders

in England, and if he cannot prevale there hee will trie it out with mee heere at blowes. Sir, I deſire that you will take all into conſideration. If it were lawfull to trie it at blowes and hee a fitt man for mee to deale with, you ſhould not heare mee complaine, but I hope the Lord hath brought mee off from that courſe. I thought good fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wryte what my judgment is for the diſmiſſing of the court till corne be ſett. It will hinder us that are farre off exceedingly, and not further you there. Mens labour are precious heere in corne ſetting tyme, the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations being yet ſo weak.

                  <p>WHEREAS his Majeſty hath lately been informed of great diſtraction and much diſorder in the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the parts of America called New-England, which if they be true, and ſuffered to run on, would tend to the diſhonour of this kingdom, and utter ruine of the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for prevention whereof, and for the orderly ſetling of government, according to the intentions of thoſe patents which have been granted by his Majeſty and from his late royal father king James, it hath pleaſed his Majeſty that the Lords and others of his moſt honorable Privy Council ſhould take the ſame into conſideration. Their Lordſhips in the firſt place thought fitt to make a committee of this Board to take examinations of the matters informed. Which committee having called divers of the principal adventurers in that plantation, and heard thoſe that are complainants againſt them, moſt of the things informed being denied, and reſting to be proved, by parties that muſt be called from that place, which required a long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time, and at preſent their Lordſhips finding, they were upon diſpatch of men, victuals and merchandize for

my ſalvation: Howſoever God dealt otherwiſe with my coſigne Suckey, and which might give unto ſome whom it nearly concerned a ſeaſonable advertiſement, yet I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it was in much faithfulneſſe to hir, that God took her away to prevent the diſquietneſſe and diſcouragement of her ſpirit, which the evills enſueinge, evills haſteninge upon the towne, would have brought upon hir: The Lord is wiſe and gracious, and knoweth how to deliver his, out of the houre of temptation; bleſſed for ever be his name in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The queſtions you demand, I had rather anſwer by word of mouth, than by letter, yet I will not refuſe to give you account of my brother Hookers removall and mine owne, ſeinge you require a reaſon thereof from us both. We both of us concurre in a 3 fold ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval. 1. God havinge ſhut a doore againſt both of us from miniſtringe to him and his people in our wonted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and calling us by a remnant of our people, and by others of this countrye to miniſter to them here, and opening a dore to us this way, who are we that we ſhould ſtrive againſt God and refuſe to follow the concurrence of his ordinance and providence together, callinge us forth to miniſter here. If we may and ought to follow Gods callinge 3 hundred myles, why not 3 thouſand? 2. Our Saviors war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is in our caſe, that when we are diſtreſſed in our courſe in one country (nequid dicam gravius) we ſhould flee to another. To chooſe rather to bear witnes to the truth by impriſonment than by baniſhment, is indeede ſometimes Gods way, but not in caſe men have ability of body and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to remove, and no neceſſary engagement for to ſtay. Whilſt Peter was young he might gird himſelfe and goe wither he would, Joh. 21.8. but when he was old and unfitt for traveyle, then indeed God called him rather to ſuffer himſelfe to be girt of others, and led along to priſon, and to death. Nevertheles in this point I conferred with the chefe of our people, and offered them to beare witnes to the truth I had preached, and practiſed amongſt them
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011300_0031_0F897286B3F1B2F0"/>
even unto bonds, if they conceived it might be any confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to their fayth and patience; but they diſwaded me that courſe, as thinking it better for themſelves, and for me, and for the church of God, to withdraw my ſelfe from the preſent ſtorme, and to miniſter in this country to ſuch of their towne as they had ſent before hither, and ſuch others as were willinge to goe alonge with me, or to follow after me; the moſt of the  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  chooſing rather to dwell in the [obliterated]
there. What ſervice my ſelfe, and brother Hooker might doe to our people or other bretheren in priſon (eſpecially in cloſe priſon which was feared) I ſuppoſe we both of us (by Gods helpe) doe the ſame, and much more, and with more freedom from hence, as occaſion is offered: Beſides all our other ſervice to the people here, which yett is enough, and more than enough to fill both our handes, yea and the hands of many brethren more, ſuch as your ſelfe, ſhould God be pleaſed to make way for your comfortable paſſage to us. To have tarryed in England for the end you mention, to appear in defence of that cauſe for which we were queſtioned, had been (as we conceyve it in our caſe) to limitt witneſſe-bearing to the cauſe (which may be done more ways than one) to one onely way, and that ſuch a way as we doe not ſee God callinge us unto. Did not Paul beare witneſſe againſt the Levitical ceremonyes, and yett chooſe rather to depart quickly out of Hieruſalem, becauſe the moſt of the Jews would not receyve his teſtimony concerninge Chriſt in that queſtion (Acts 22.18.) than to ſtay at Hieruſalem to bear witneſſe to that cauſe unto priſon and death? Not that we came hither to ſtrive againſt ceremonyes (or to fight againſt ſhadowes) there is noe neede of our further labor in that courſe; our people here deſire to worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth, and our people left in England know as well the groundes and reaſons of our ſuffering againſt theſe things, as our ſufferings themſelves, which we beſeech the Lord to accept and bleſſe, in our bleſſed Savior. How
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011300_0031_0F897286B3F1B2F0"/>
farre our teſtimony there hath prevayled with any others, to ſearch more ſeriouſlye into the cauſe, we doe rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in thankfullneſſe and ſilence, than ſpeake of to the prejudice of our bretheren.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath been noe ſmall inducement to us, to chooſe rather to remove hither, than to ſtay there, that we might enjoy the libertye, not of ſome ordinances of God, but of all, and all in purity. For though we bleſſe the Lord with you for the gracious meanes of ſalvation, which many of your congregations doe enjoy (whereof our owne ſoules have founde the bleſſinge, and which we deſire may be for ever continued, and enlarged to you) yet ſeeing Chriſt hath inſtituted no ordinance in vayne (but all to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferringe of the body of Chriſt) and we know that our ſoules ſtand in neede of all to the uttmoſt, we durſt not ſo farre be wanting to the grace of Chriſt, and to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our owne ſoules, as to ſitt downe ſome where elſe, under the ſhadowe of ſome ordinances, when by two monthes travayle we might come to enjoy the libertie of all.</p>
               <p>To your 2d queſtion, how farre miniſters are bound to beare wittneſſe againſt corruptions caſt upon the face of Gods ordinances, it is too large a point for me to give anſwer to in the heele of a letter. But thus much briefly, wittnes is to be borne againſt corruptions. 1. By keeping a mans owne garments cleane; I meane his owne outward practice. Rev. 16.15. 2. By declaringe the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God to his people, not ſhunninge any part of it, as reaſonable occaſion is offered, to prevent ſinne in them. Acts 20.26.27. 3. By avoyding appearances of evill, as well as evill it ſelfe. 1 Theſſ. 5.22. Eleazerus durſt not eate mutton, or bread, or any other cleane foode, when it had an appearance of eateing ſwines fleſh, but choſe death rather than deliverance by ſuch meanes. 2 Maccab. cap. 6. ver. 21. to 25. whoſe ſtory though it be apochry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, yet the example authenticall, as being ratifyed by the apoſtles teſtimonie amongſt the reſt of like nature. Heb. 11.35. where by the others he ſpeaketh of he meaneth not other women, but other men, for the word is <gap reason="foreign">

maſculine. Howſoever, Peters diſſemblinge is evidently blamed by Paul in a like caſe, when by his example he countenanced the impoſinge of ceremonyes upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to whom God never gave them. Gal. 2.11. to 14.4. By contendinge for the truth in an holy manner, when others contend with us againſt it. Jude 3.4. By givinge account of our fayth before magiſtrates, if they call us to it publiquely, requireing to be informed of our doctrine and manner of life. 1 Pet. 3.15. Otherwiſe, if they call us to knowe our opinions in private (intending to bringe us into trouble) or publiquely, rather as captions queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts than judiciall governors, in ſuch a caſe, I ſuppoſe we may conceale our mindes, and put our adverſaryes upon proofe, as our Savior did, John 18.19, 20, 21. But why doe I ſpend time and wordes to you in theſe thinges, who know them as well as I can tell you, I rather deſire you may be kept in a peaeable way of bearinge wittneſſe to the truth (if the will of God be ſuch) than expoſed to hazards by ſuch confeſſions as mighte prejudice your liberty. My poore requeſts are to heaven for you, as I deſire you might not forgett me and mine, and all us here. Now the God of peace and power guide and ſupport your ſpirit, in all your holy endeavours, bleſſe and proſper your labors, and keepe you as a choſen veſſell in the ſhadowe of his hande, through him that hath loved us.</p>

                  <salute>Honourable Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT hath pleaſed God further to crowne our poore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with ſucceſs graciouſly as you ſhall largely and punctually underſtand by Capt. Patrick, to whome I leave
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011300_0034_0F897288F226AF20"/>
the relation wholly, ſeeing a lively voyce will do it: and therefore I entreat your favour for this omiſſion; ſpecially becauſe it is late in the night and a faire wind attends us. Surely there have been ſo many ſingular providences as are worthy of due obſervance and eternall prayſe. And allbeit we have not the whole of our deſires, yet O that we could extoll him for what we have and waite for more. Much is done, but not all, and if ought be well done I deſire we may not be weary thereof but proceed as God ſhall miniſter new occaſions. Capt. Patrick can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you of our intentions for the future: both for Block Iſland, Long Iſland, Indians beyond Puillipioak, &amp;c. Allſo if it ſhall appear uſefull, and pleaſing to you we will ſome of us come march through Neepenet: I earneſtly deſire the worke may be thoroughly done, and ſee we and our friends will ſuffer much by ſcattered wretches, if they be not cloſely followed. But I ſhall write more fully ſuddenly, and do deſire to underſtand your pleaſures: For we will prefer your minds before ours: But 'tis clear ſome muſt reſide here or hereabouts. It is beyond my abilities for the preſent to reſolve you which is beſt in all things, or particularly about planting Pecot. For tho' the place be ſubſiſtable, and an excellent harbour, and abundance of corne, and the ſame ground ready for Engliſh grayne forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, which is a great help to planters, yet the providence of God guided us to ſo excellent a country at Quaillipioak<note n="†" place="bottom">New-Haven.</note> river and ſo all along the coaſt as we travelled, as I am confident we have not the like in Engliſh poſſeſſion as yet, and probable 'tis the Dutch will ſeaze it if the Engliſh do not. It is conceived generally far more worthy than Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid notwithſtanding the former conſiderations. It is too good for any but friends, Capt. Patrick can informe you the full. I heartily thanke you for your loving care of us about neceſſaries and do acknowledge your kind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our poore imperfect indeavours, craving your prayers for more grace that we may ſo increaſe in loyal faithfullneſs and fruitfullneſs, ſuch as may be God's honor

               <head>Libertye and the Weale Publick reconciled: In a briefe and cleare declaration of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion of ſome grieved mindes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge the lawfull and orderly proceedings of the late Court of Elections at Newtown, the 17th of the 3d month, 1637.<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſachuſets Hiſtory Vol. I p. 61.</note>
               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The complaint is, that the peoples libertye was reſtrained, by ſuch as withſtood the reading of a petition ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered before the elections made.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR clearing hereof it is to be conſidered, 1. What the libertye is which they deſire to have preſerved: That I take to be this, viz. That the people may not be ſubjected to any lawe or power amonge themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent; whatſoever is more than this, is neither lawfull nor durable, and inſtead of libertye may prove bondage or licentiouſneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this libertye be at any tyme reſtrayned by the people themſelves, they are guilty of their owne harme; if any be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If ſuch reſtraint be not redreſſed, upon any ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity, when lawfully it may, they can blame none ſo much as themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the power of a popular ſtate being unlimited in its owne nature, and being by free conſent and wiſe
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011300_0035_0F89728A79239FE0"/>
adviſe, brought into a methode; and ſo bounded, in order onely, not in power, it is more ſafe to be ſo continued and exerciſed (though with offence or perhaps damage to ſome particulars in ſome tranſient caſes, the original power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill inviolate) than to be putt out of its ſettled courſe, upon every pretence, or occaſion, of publick grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: ſeeing every deviation in the verye forme of any ſuch government is allways attended with much trouble, and ſome danger.</p>
               <p>Anſw. If we examine the paſſages of the court, we ſhall ſee where the error was.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that the proper buſineſs of this court was matter of election, and it is alſo obviouſe, that it hath obtained, by cuſtom, the firſt place in that day (except ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of freemen) and where it was objected, that in the court 1635, the petition in Mr. Endecotts caſe, was heard and anſwered before election: It is not true: For I can ſhew by that which hath been faithfully kept of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of that court, among other, that all petitions were rejected till the elections were paſſed; and many can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that when that caſe was heard, Mr. Heynes ſate governour, who had been elected that court.</p>
               <p>It is objected againe, that the court might yet have heard the petition firſt, and ſeeing it was for the peoples libertye, why was it ſtopped? To this it may be anſwered, that it is true, they might, if they had ſo pleaſed: But firſt they would not, and their refuſal was lawfull upon theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It had been no point of wiſdom to break order, without preſſing neceſſity, or for ſome prevalent advantage, neither of which could the court then apprehend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the queſtion was, whether petition or election ſhould be firſt, 1 one could give anſwer there, but the court it ſelfe, which was the whole bodye of freemen (for none of the magiſtrates had any more influence in that court than any other freeman) ſo as here was no other way to knowe the minde of the court but by putting it to vote, and by numbering either ſide, to decide the queſtion; this
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011300_0035_0F89728A79239FE0"/>
was done, and the major part being for election, it may truely be ſayde, that the people or the court did order that election ſhould proceed before the petition ſhould be heard: And now let any wiſe man judge, who hath done the people wronge, or what reſtraint hath been putt upon their liberty. For if the people would have had the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firſt heard, who could have judged it, or what expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition did any make againſt it, otherwiſe than is lawfull for any freeman to doe, by ſhewing his diſlike and giving reaſon for it?</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that a great parte of the people did not conſent: I anſwer, there was not one freeman there but his conſent was to it: for it is an inſepparable inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all bodyes politick, which are compoſed of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary members, that every one (in his admiſſion) gives an implicite conſent to whatſoever the maior parte ſhall eſtabliſhe, not being againſt religion or the weale publick, and this they are further bound unto by their oathe: yea if the oath be diſputable, yet their conſent is in it, till it be cleared, and the error of the maior part convinced by plain arguments: otherwiſe no ſuch ſocietye would long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: neither could peace be at all preſerved in it; for it is hardly poſſible, to eſtabliſhe any thinge (except of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature) that ſhall pleaſe every man: and if one or more in any ſociety may be at libertye, when the reſt are reſtrayned, it can neither be equal nor ſafe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It had been meere injuſtice, for the people then aſſembled to have concluded any publick buſineſſe by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular vote. The reaſon is apparent. Becauſe thoſe towns, which by lawful order, upon publick conſiderations, ſent their proxies for elections, and their deputyes for other affaires, had been iniuriouſly ſurprized, and deprived of their due intereſt to diſcerne of thoſe things, which did no leſs concerne them than the reſt who were preſent. And upon this grounde, whatſoever the freemen then preſent had concluded had been meerely voide and no man bound to ſubmit to it: for, beſides the manifeſt iniurye to ſuch as had been ſo unduly kept awaye, it might have fallen out,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011300_0036_0F89728B75195E58"/>
that, beinge preſent, they might have given ſuch reaſons as might have altered the judgment of the reſt of the court.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the petition had contained any matter of grievance which had neceſſarily required the helpe of the people to redreſſe it (as in ſome caſes it may fall out) yet why this might not as well have been done after the election as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not appeare: for the people muſt have ſtayed as long tyme, for diſpatch of bothe, whichſoever had firſt been handled, petitions or elections: And if they had unadviſedly elected any unworthy perſon, they might ſoone have removed him: and the juſt diſgrace upon ſuch an one had more than recompenced the ſhort tyme it would have required.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So the generall court at Boſton, in the 3. mo. 1634, when the people eſtabliſhed a reformation of ſuch things as they judged to be amiſſe in the government, they then ſettled an order, that in the court of elections they ſhould leeve their deputyes to manage all other affaires.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is verye difficult and dangerous for ſo great a people and of ſo different apprehenſions, to give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a cauſe of right or wronge, being ſuddainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to them: and if we ſhould growe to ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude as (through Gods bleſſing) we may ſoone be, it will be impoſſible it ſhould be well carried.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is eaſye to judge, that 30 or 40 diſtinct men, choſen out of all the countrye, and by all reaſon as free from partialitye or preiudice as any other, may give a more juſt ſentence in any ſuch cauſe (upon deliberation and quiet diſcourſe) than a whole multitude upon the ſuddaine, when many may be thought not to heare what is propoſed, and others not to underſtand it, and perchance the greater part in a heate and tumult, and when the weakeſt and worſt member of the common-wealth adds as much weight to the ſentence as the moſt godly and judicious.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The people (in the ſaid court 1634) having (by ſearious advice of ſuch as they beſt knew, and that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be much lovers of their libertye) given power to their deputyes, for future tyme, to doe whatſoever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011300_0036_0F89728B75195E58"/>
might (ſave in matters of elections) order requires they ſhould firſt referre the redreſſe of their grievances to their deputyes, and the people not to entermeddle, except the deputyes ſhould firſt fayle, and that apparently and previouſly: which is ſeldom like to fall out in a popular ſtate, where nothing but force can deprive them of their libertye, except they ſhall wittinglye and willinglye give them away, and then <hi>volunti non fit injuria,</hi> a man cannot blame another for the harme he does to himſelfe.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR clearing of ſuch ſcruples as have ariſen about this order, it is to be conſidered, firſt, what is the eſſentiall forme of a common weale or body politic ſuch as this is, which I conceive to be this—The conſent of a certaine companie of people, to cohabite together, under one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for their mutual ſafety and welfare.</p>
               <p>In this deſcription all theſe things doe concurre to the well being of ſuch a body, 1 Perſons, 2 Place, 3 Conſent, 4 Government or Order, 5 Wellfare.</p>
               <p>It is clearely agreed, by all, that the care of ſafety and wellfare was the original cauſe or occaſion of common weales and of many familyes ſubjecting themſelves to rulers and laws; for no man hath lawfull power over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by birth or conſent, ſo likewiſe, by the law of proprietye, no man can have juſt intereſt in that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to another, without his conſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:011300_0037_0F89728BF3A8C310"/>From the premiſes will ariſe theſe concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No common weale can be founded but by free conſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perſons ſo incorporating have a public and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative intereſt each in other, and in the place of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation and goods, and laws, &amp;c. and in all the means of their wellfare ſo as none other can claime priviledge with them but by free conſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The nature of ſuch an incorporation tyes every member thereof to ſeeke out and entertaine all means that may conduce to the wellfare of the bodye, and to keepe off whatſoever doth appeare to tend to theire damage.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The wellfare of the whole is to be put to apparent hazard for the advantage of any particular members.</p>
               <p>From theſe concluſions I thus reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we heere be a corporation eſtabliſhed by free conſent, if the place of our cohabitation be our owne, then no man hath right to come into us &amp;c. without our conſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If no man hath right to our lands, our government priviledges, &amp;c. but by our conſent, then it is reaſon we ſhould take notice of before we conferre any ſuch upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we are bound to keepe off whatſoever appears to tend to our ruine or damage, then may we lawfully refuſe to receive ſuch whoſe diſpoſitions ſuite not with ours and whoſe ſociety (we know) will be hurtfull to us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is lawfull to take knowledge of all men before we receive them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The churches take liberty (as lawfully they may) to receive or reject at their diſcretion; yea particular towns make orders to the like effect; why then ſhould the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale be denied the like liberty and the whole more reſtrained than any parte?</p>
               <p n="5">5. If it be ſinne in us to deny ſome men place &amp;c. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, then it is becauſe of ſome right they have to this place &amp;c. for to deny a man that which he hath no right unto is neither ſinne nor injury.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If ſtrangers have right to our houſes or lands, &amp;c. then it is either of juſtice or of mercye; if of juſtice let them plead it, and we ſhall know what to anſwer: but if
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011300_0037_0F89728BF3A8C310"/>
it be only in way of mercye, or by the rule of hoſpitality, &amp;c. then I anſwer 1ſt, A man is not a fit object of mercye except he be in miſerye. 2d, We are not bound to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe mercye to others to the ruine of ourſelves. 3d, There are few that ſtand in neede of mercye at theire firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hither. As for hoſpitality, that rule doth not bind fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than for ſome preſent occaſion, not for continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A family is a little common wealth, and a common wealth is a greate family. Now as a family is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man (otherwiſe than by way of hoſpitality) no more is a common wealth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is a generall received rule, <hi>turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur hoſpes,</hi> it is worſe to receive a man whom we muſt caſt out againe, than to denye him admittance.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The rule of the Apoſtle, John 2.10. is, that ſuch as come and bring not the true doctrine with them ſhould not be received to houſe, and by the ſame reaſon not into the common weale.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Seeing it muſt be granted that there may come ſuch perſons (ſuppoſe Jeſuits, &amp;c.) which by conſent of all ought to be rejected, it will follow that this law (being only for notice to be taken of all that come to us, without which we cannot avoyd ſuch as indeed are to be kept out) is no other but juſt and needfull, and if any ſhould be rejected that ought to be received, that is not to be imputed to the law, but to thoſe who are betruſted with the execution of it. And herein is to be conſidered, what the intent of the law is, and by conſequence, by what rule they are to walke, who are betruſted with the keeping of it. The intent of the law is to preſerve the wellfare of the body; and for this ende to have none received into any fellowſhip with it who are likely to diſturbe the ſame, and this intent (I am ſure) is lawful and good. Now then, if ſuch to whom the keeping of this law is committed, be perſuaded in theire judgments that ſuch a man is likely to diſturbe and hinder the publick weale, but ſome others who are not in the ſame truſt, judge otherwiſe, yet they are to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011300_0038_0F89728CB2D0ED28"/>
follow theire owne judgments, rather then the judgments of others who are not alike intereſted: As in tryall of an offender by a jury; the twelve men are ſatisfied in their conſciences, upon the evidence given, that the party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves death: but there are 20 or 40 ſtanders by, who conceive otherwiſe, yet is the jury bound to condemn him according to their owne conſciences, and not to acquit him upon the different opinion of other men, except theire rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can convince them of the errour of theire conſciences, and this is according to the rule of the Apoſtle, Rom. 14.5. Let every man be fully perſuaded in his own mynde.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that ſome prophane perſons are received and others who are religious are rejected, I anſwer 1ſt, It is not knowne that any ſuch thinge hath as yet fallen out. 2, Such a practice may be juſtifiable as the caſe may be, for younger perſons (even prophane ones) may be of leſſe danger to the common weale (and to the churches alſo) than ſome older perſons, though profeſſors of religion: for our Saviour Chriſt when he converſed with publicans, &amp;c. ſayth that ſuch were nearer the kingdom of heaven than the religious phariſees, and one that is of large parts and confirmed in ſome erronious way, is likely to doe more harme to church and common weale, and is of leſſe hope to be reclaymed, then 10 prophane perſons, who have not yet beene hardened, in the contempt of the meanes of grace.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Whereas it is objected that by this law, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject good chriſtians and ſo conſequently Chriſt himſelfe: I anſwer 1ſt, It is not knowne that any chriſtian man hath beene rejected. 2, A man that is a true chriſtian, may be denyed reſidence among us, in ſome caſes, without reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, as admitt a true chriſtian ſhould come over, and ſhould maintaine community of goods, or that magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates ought not to puniſh the breakers of the firſt table, or the members of churches for criminal offences: or that no man were bound to be ſubject to thoſe lawes or magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates to which they ſhould not give an explicite conſent, &amp;c. I hope no man will ſay, that not to receive ſuch an one, were to reject Chriſt; for ſuch opinions (though being
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011300_0038_0F89728CB2D0ED28"/>
maintained in ſimple ignorance, they might ſtand with a ſtate of grace yet) they may be ſo dangerous to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick weale in many reſpects, as it would be our ſinne and unfaithfullneſs to receive ſuch among us, except it were for tryall of theire reformation, I would demand then in the caſe in queſtion (for it is booteleſſe curioſity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayne openeſſe in things publick) whereas it is ſayd that this law was made of purpoſe to keepe away ſuch as are of Mr Wheelwright his judgment (admitt it were ſo which yet I cannot confeſſe) where is the evill of it? If we conceive and finde by ſadd experience that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are ſuch, as by his own profeſſion cannot ſtand with externall peace, may we not provide for our peace, by keeping of ſuch as would ſtrengthen him, and infect others with ſuch dangerous tenets? and if we finde his opinions ſuch as will cauſe diviſions, and make people looke at their magiſtrates, miniſters and brethren as enemies to Chriſt and Antichriſts, &amp;c. were it not ſinne and unfaithfullneſs in us, to receive more of thoſe opinions, which we all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready finde the evill fruite of: Nay, why doe not thoſe who now complayne joyne with us in keeping out of ſuch, as well as formerly they did in expelling Mr. Williams for the like, though leſſe dangerous? Where this change of theire judgments ſhould ariſe I leave to themſelves to examine, and I earneſtly entreate them ſo to doe, and for this law let the equally mynded judge, what evill they finde in it, or in the practice of thoſe who are betruſted with the execution of it.</p>

A common-wealth is a certaine companie of people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to cohabit together under one government, for their mutual ſafetye and wellfare. In which deſcription this maine faulte is founde. At the beſt it is but a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a common-wealth at large, and not of ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth as this (as is ſaid) which is not only chriſtian but dependant upon the grante alſo of our Souveraigne; for ſo are the expreſſe words of that order of court to which the whole countrey was required to ſubſcribe.</p>
               <p>Now if you will define a chriſtian common-wealth, there muſt be put in; ſuch a conſent as is according to God;<note place="margin">Prov 8.5. Iſai. 6.7.</note> a ſubjecting to ſuch a government as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto Chriſt. And if you will define a corporation, incorporated by vertue of the grante of our Souveraigne, it muſt be ſuch a conſent as the grante re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and permitts and in that manner and forme as it preſcribes, or elſe it will be defective. The common-wealth here deſcribed, may be a companye of Turkiſh pirates as well as Chriſtian profeſſors, unleſſe the conſent and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be better limitted than it is in this definition; for ſure it is, all Pagans and Infidels, even the Indians here amongſt us, may come within this compaſſe. And is this ſuch a body politicke as ours, as you ſay? God forbid. Our common-wealth we feare would be twiſe miſerable, if Chriſt and the King ſhould be ſhut out ſo. Reaſons taken from the nature of a common-wealth, not founded upon Chriſt, nor by his Majeſtyes charters, muſt needs fall to
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011300_0039_0F89728D79D22790"/>
the ground, and faile thoſe that relye upon them. In the application of the deſcription, and the concluſions inferred, all things are not currant, all things doe not agree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cauſes of common-wealths as is affirmed. There are 7 ſeveral opinions of this matter, which writers ſpeak of, though this be not ſo material. Members of a common-wealth may not ſeeke out all meanes that may conduce to the wellfare of the body, but all lawful and due meanes, according to the charter they hold by, either from God or the King, or from both: Nor may they keepe out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth appeare to tend to theire damage (for many things appeare which are not) but ſuch, as upon right and evident grounds, doe ſo appeare, and are ſo in truth. Thus farre concerning that which hath beene touched may for the preſent ſuffice.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thinge is the reaſons, which we ſhall ſett downe and anſwer.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon of the equity of the order is this, <q>If we be a corporation eſtabliſhed by free conſent, if the place of our habitation be our owne, then no man hath right to come unto us without our conſent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. We do not know how we that ſtand a corporation, by vertue of the Kings charter, can thus argue; yet to avoyd diſpute, ſuppoſe the antecedent ſhould be granted, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence doth not follow. This is all that can be inferred, that our conſent regulated by the worde, and ſutable to our patent ought to be required, not this vaſt and illimitted conſent here ſpoken off, our conſent is not our owne, when rightly limitted, 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. An unlawful diſſent can hinder no man, though a lawful may.</p>
               <p>The 2d reaſon runs thus,
<q>If no man hath right to our lands, our government privilegdes, &amp;c. but by our conſent, then it is reaſon we ſhould take notice of men before we conferre any ſuch upon them</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Beſydes the doubtfulneſs of the truth of the ſuppoſition, the queſtion here is changed; for ſo moſt ſtates doe in takeing the names of ſuch as come to dwell among them, but the queſtion is whether the admitting or
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011300_0040_0F89728E340590E0"/>
rejecting of perſons ſhould depend upon ſuch unlimitted and unſafe a rule, as the will and deſcretion of men, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe magiſtrates or others not regulated.</p>
               <p>The 3d reaſon is thus framed, <q>If we are bound to keepe off whatſoever appeares to tende to our ruine and damage, then may we lawfully refuſe to receive ſuch whoſe diſpoſitions ſuite not with ours, and whoſe ſocietye we know will be hurtefull unto us, and therefor it is lawful to take knowledge of men before we doe receive them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. This kinde of reaſoning is very confuſed and fallacious, for the queſtion here is not only changed, but there is this further deceite of wrapping up many queſtions in one, and beſides if it were put into a right forme, the aſſumption would be falſe.</p>
               <p>The queſtion is not, as was ſaid before, whether know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may not be taken of men, before they be received, nor whether magiſtrates may refuſe ſuch as ſuite not with their diſpoſitions, or ſuch whoſe ſocietye they know will be hurteful to them; though the ſecond of theſe is not, nor cannot be proved; but whether perſons may be rejected, or admitted, upon the illimitted conſent or diſſent of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. The aſſumption alſo would be falſe, for men are not to keepe off whatſoever appeares to tend to their ruine, but what really doth ſo; Eliah appeared to Ahab, and, no doubt, to his counſell of ſtate, a troubler of the common-wealth, one that brought 3 yeares famine, enough to ruine the whole ſtate: Yet the Jewiſh magiſtrates ought not to have rejected him and all thoſe of his frame and judgment, becauſe thus it appeared; for in truth Elijah was the horſemen of Iſrael and the chariots thereof. It appeared alſo to the chiefe prieſts and phariſees, that if our bleſſed Saviour were let alone, it would tend to their ruine, John 11.47, 48. and therefore uſed meanes to keep it off by rejecting Chriſt and his goſpel, and yet we hope you will not ſay they were bound to doe ſo. Laſtly, it appeares to the Natives heere (who by your definition are compleat common-wealths among themſelves) that the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011300_0040_0F89728E340590E0"/>
cohabitation of the Engliſh with them tends to their utter ruine, yet we beleeve you will not ſay they may lawfully keepe us out upon that grounde, for our cohabitation with them may tend to theire converſion and ſo to theire eternal ſalvation, and then they ſhould doe moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and ſinnefully. Let us then doe unto our brethren at leaſt as we would deſyre to be done unto by Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which is not to be rejected, becauſe we ſuite not with the diſpoſition of theire Sechem, nor becauſe, by our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God takes them away and troubles them, and ſo, to theire appearance, we ruine them.</p>
               <p>The 4th argument ſtands thus, <q>The churches take libertye (as lawfully they may) to receive or rejecte at their diſcretion; yea particular townes make orders to ſuch effect, why then ſhould the commonwealth be denied the like libertye, and the whole more reſtrained than any part?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Though the queſtion be here concluded, yet it is farre from being ſoundly proved, yea, in trueth, we much wonder that any member of a church ſhould be ignorant of the falſeneſs of the ground worke upon which this concluſion is built; for ſhould churches have this power, as you ſay they have, to receive or rejecte at their diſcretion, they would quickely grow corrupt enough. Churches have no libertye to receive or rejecte, at their diſcretions, but at the diſcretion of Chriſt, whatſoever is done in word or deed, in church or common-wealth, muſt be done in the name of the Lord Jeſus. (Coll. 3.17.) Neither hath church nor common-wealth any other than miniſteriall power from Chriſt (Eph. 5.23.) who is the head of the church, and the prince of the kings of the earth. (Rev. 1.5.) After that Cornelius and his companye had received the holy ghoſt, whereby the right which they had to the covenant was evidenced, it is not now left to the diſcretion of the church whether they would admitte them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto or not. But can any man forbid them water faith Peter, he commanded them to be baptized. (Acts 10.47, 48.) There is the like reaſon of admiſſion into churches,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011300_0041_0F89728EF40513E0"/>
when Chriſt opens a door to any theres none may take libertye to ſhut them out. In one word, there is no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye to be taken neither in church nor commonwealth but that which Chriſt gives and is according unto him, Gal. 5.1.</p>
               <p>The 5th reaſon produced is, <q>If it be ſinne in us, to denye ſome men place amongſt us, then it is becauſe they have ſome right to our place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. The queſtion is heere againe changed, for it is not whether ſome may be denyed, but whether any or all ſuch as the magiſtrates illimitted diſſent ſhall rejecte. But beſydes this, we ſay, that the kings chriſtian ſubjects have right by his majeſties pattent, to come over and plante in places not inhabited, for a double end, 1ſt, to enlarge his majeſties dominions, 2dly, for the converſion of the Pagans. And ſince his majeſtie hath given them right for theſe ends, we may not denye them, unleſs they forfeite it, either by denyeing the land which they inhabite to be an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his majeſties dominions, or becoming ſuch diſſolute and prophane perſons as rather doe harden the Indians than be a meanes of their converſion, for by ſo doing we ſhall exceed the limitts of his majeſties grante, and forfeite the priviledges, government and lands which we challenge to be our owne.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we may not denye reſidence, to any of his majeſties ſubjects without juſt grounds, except we will doe injury both to the king and his ſubjects, who have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured both theire eſtates and lives to enjoye thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and libertyes, which he hath granted them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes the law doth not only prohibite thoſe whom the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhall diſlike to plante in thoſe places uninhabited, though in an orderly manner, but to make their abode in friends houſes, either given or ſold, or hyred, which are lawful meanes of obtaineing right. Now if the kings majeſtie give me right, if title be procured by donation, purchaſe, farmeing, &amp;c. If now this ſtate at theire plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, take this away and expell men from the ſame, what were this but to exerciſe robbery, and to vex the poore
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011300_0041_0F89728EF40513E0"/>
and the needy, and oppreſſe the ſtranger wrongfully, a ſinne forerunning deſolation, (Ezek. 22.29.) and ſuch an one as will more ruine the ſtate by the execution thereof, than thoſe perſons (whom the law intend to expell) were the law aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>The 6th reaſon aſſigned is this,
<q>If ſtrangers have right to our houſes or lands, &amp;c. then it is either of juſtice or mercye,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Anſw. The queſtion ſtill is changed, but in anſwer to this we ſay, ſuch may the ſtranger be as have true right of cohabitation, and ſojourning with us, as hath beene ſhewed, and that of juſtice, by his majeſties pattent, for they are fellow ſubjects to one and the ſame prince, they are alſo of the ſame nation, and if they be chriſtians they are in a farre nearer relation than all theſe, even fellow brethren, and coheires of all the bleſſings layd up for them in Chriſt Jeſus, and in all theſe conſiderations have right of cohabitation and reſidence with us.</p>
               <p>The 7th reaſon is this, <q>A familye is a little common-wealth and a common-wealth is a great familye, now a familye is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man, otherwiſe than by way of hoſpitalitye, no more is a common-wealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Here againe the queſtion is much changed, it ſhould not have been proved that we are not bound to receive all comers nor all good men, but rather no comers at all, unleſſe it be upon the unlimitted conſent of the magiſtrates. Although it be true, that there is ſome proportion betweene a familye and a common-wealth, yet there is a great diſparitye in this matter. A maiſter of a familye hath another kinde of right to his houſe and eſtate than this common-wealth hath to all the houſes and lands within this patent. The maiſter of a familye may bequeath his whole eſtate to his wife and children, and ſo may not the body of this common-wealth to theires. The king will looke for ſome right, nor may we blame him, if he doe. Many are no members of the common-wealth, and yet have good right both to houſes and lands here, many members of this ſtate agree not to this law, but have
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011300_0042_0F89728FB40BB718"/>
proteſted againſt it as ſinnfull and unwholeſome, and yet we hope the reſt have not as good right to their houſes goods and lands as the maiſter of the familye hath to his. If the ſtate ſhould take upon them ſuch a right, I pray you conſider whether it would not prove a greater wronge, even like to that of Labans toward Jacob, who told him that all were his, Gen. 31.43. It is to be feared ſuch pleas of right will worke more trouble to this ſtate, if they be noyſed abroad, than the entertainment of thoſe people againſt whom this law is made.</p>
               <p>Eighthly it is thus reaſoned, <q>It is a generall rule, <hi>turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur hoſpes,</hi> it is worſe to receive a man whom we muſt caſt out, than to deny him admittance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Let any man reſolve theſe words, and they will be farre from proveing the equitye, though they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the intent of the courts order. The thinge which from hence is concluded will only amount to this. That it is worſe for a common-wealth to receive a man whom they muſt caſt out againe, than to deny him admittance. The reaſon is taken from humane authoritye, but what is this to the pointe in controverſye, why ſhould men thus argue, and their concluſions ſo farre from the marke, yet as we ſaid perhaps this may ſhew the courts intent, for this intimation we have from hence, That the intent of the common-wealth is to caſt out all ſuch as have beene received in tymes paſt, who are of the ſame judgment with them, whom the magiſtrates will not admitt but caſt out, though with a greate deale more diſhoneſtye, for <hi>turpius ejicitur,</hi> &amp;c. which if it muſt be, the Lords will be done.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Vane's adherents were afterwards baniſhed. See <hi>Maſſ. Hiſt. Vol. p.</hi> 75.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, it is thus further argued, <q>The rule of the Apoſtle, John 2.10. is, that ſuch as come and bring not the true doctrine with them ſhould not be received to houſe, and by the ſame reaſon not into the com.wealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The queſtion is ſtill wonderfully changed, for if the order now in queſtion were but conformable to this rule of the Apoſtle none would oppoſe it, but the order is
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011300_0042_0F89728FB40BB718"/>
therefore ſcrupelled, becauſe it ſetts downe no rule for the magiſtrates to walke by in that admittance or rejection of ſuch as come, but leaves it to their illimitted conſent or diſſent, nay ſuch were the expreſſions of the ſame, in the court, who had a hand in this law, as cleares it to us that this law oppoſeth directly this rule; for ſuch as doe bring the doctrine intended in the text, are the perſons which are aymed at to be denyed reſidence, as ſad experience alſo in the execution hath given us in parte to ſee already, and wee feare in the future will yet doe more.</p>
               <p>The 10th and laſt reaſon is this in effect, <q>Such may not come into the land as by the conſent of all are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and therefore it is lawful to take notice of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We much marvaile that it ſhould be ſo often ſaid, the law is only for takeing notice, is it not plaine that ſuch are to be fined who receive them whom the magiſtrates allow not? and cannot notice be taken of men without ſuch a courſe as this? Why ſhould any in higher place ſpeake in open court—Let us have their money firſt?— What meanes the words immediately following which ſpeake of rejecting and keeping out by vertue of this order, if it were only made to take notice of ſuch? It would have done very well to have kept to the queſtion, and not argue ſo farre diſtant from the purpoſe as this doth. What if ſome come into the land and are to be rejected, are any therefor to be rejected in an undue and ſinnful way? In the enlargement of this reaſon the law is excuſed, if it be not rightly executed, and they which are to execute it are likewiſe defended, if they follow their judgments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. The law is excuſed becauſe it hath a good intent, but good intents do not make a law or action good, what was intended the execution doth declare. Now is it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for thoſe who are betruſted with the execution of this law to follow their perſwaſions, judgments, and conſciences, except they be rightly ruled by the word of trueth? Paul was perſwaded that he ſhould doe thoſe things which he did againſt Jeſus of Nazareth, Acts 26.9. They which kill Gods children may thinke they doe God good ſervice,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011300_0043_0F8972907214F028"/>
John 16.1. but in ſo doeing, neither the one nor the other are to be excuſed. It is not a full perſwaſion that makes a thinge lawfull from the rule Rom. 14.5. but a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion upon good grounds. All the actions of chriſtians muſt be according to the rule Chriſt gives them to walke by, Gal. 6.6.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. Some prophane perſons are received, and others who are religious are rejected. To which you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer there is no ſuch thing knowne to be done, and if it were it might be juſtified, becauſe prophane perſons may be leſſe dangerous, than ſuch as are religious, of large parts, confirmed in ſome erroneous way, our Saviour converſed with publicans, &amp;c. and ſayd they were nearer the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven than religious phariſees. This is the ſumme. As for the objection which is made, it is your owne; for any thing we know, we would not object in this manner. It is not the refuſing of ſome religious perſons againſt which we except, but againſt the libertye which is given by this law of rejecting thoſe, that are truly and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly religious, if the magiſtrates doe not like them, which is already put in practice, as farre as may be judged. If you deny any thing to be done, there are divers wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes will affirme the contrarye. If you ſay it be more dangerous to accept ſuch than prophane perſons you need not much confutation, ſuch ſhall be bleſſings whereſoever they come, Gen. 12.2. they will not need to be bound to the peace or good behaviour as ſome that are admitted by authoritye by their blaſphemous and quarrelling ſpeeches. As for ſcribes and phariſees wee will not pleade for them, let them doe it who walke in their way; nor for ſuch as are confirmed in any way of errour, though all ſuch are not to be denyed cohabitation, but are to be pitied and reformed, Jude 22, 23. Iſhmael ſhall dwell in the preſence of his brethren, Gen. 16.12.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. It is objected that by this law we reject good chriſtians and ſo conſequently Chriſt himſelfe, and it is made of purpoſe to keepe away ſuch as are of Mr. Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights judgment. To the former parte of this objection
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011300_0043_0F8972907214F028"/>
you ſay, it is not knowne that any chriſtian man hath been rejected, and that chriſtians in ſome caſes may be rejected, holding ſome pernicious errors. This is the ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwer that diverſe chriſtians have been already rejected ſo farre, as they are not allowed to make any abode amongſt us, but for a ſhort limitted tyme, and by the law they may be rejected for ever. All the tyme ſuch are rejected Chriſt is rejected, Luke 10.16. Acts 9.4. Suppoſe ſome chriſtians may be refuſed and Chriſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed (which is not yet proved) that is nothing to the law nor to the preſent execution of it. If you deale with ſuch make it appear. To the latter parte of this objection you anſwer, that you cannot confeſſe that it is made againſt them of Mr. Wheelwights judgment, and if it were, where is the evil of it, ſeeing that the opinions are ſuch as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth cannot ſtand with external peace, and will cauſe diviſions, and will make the people looke at their magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, miniſters and brethren, as enemyes to Chriſt and antichriſtian, more dangerous than the opinion of Mr. Williams? We omitt divers words for brevityes ſake and change not the matter. To this we replye, that though you cannot confeſſe it, yet it doth appeare by your examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them you refuſe, for preſent demanding of them whether they know him, and wiſhing of them to diſclaime his doctrine, and excepting againſt them becauſe they are allyed to them of the ſame judgment, as likewiſe by the courts proceeding againſt him, that there is ſome ſuch thing; though indeed we would not make this objection, though ſome of the like kinde.</p>
               <p>Now whereas you grante this by way of conceſſion, and give reaſons to juſtifie the ſame, they are either weak or greate miſtakes. Firſt you finde fault with his opinions, becauſe he ſaid they could not ſtand with externall peace. He affirmed indeed that the preaching of the goſpell could not ſtand with externall peace, and doth not the word of God hold this forth? Our Saviour came not to ſend peace but a ſword, Matth. 10.34. That chapter ſpeakes fully to the purpoſe, and when news of Chriſt comes, Herod
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011300_0044_0F897291F9E968B0"/>
and all Jeruſalem is troubled, Matth. 2.3. Paul and Silas were accuſed for turneing the world upſyde downe, Acts 17.5. We queſtion not but he will grante that the Lord can and doth ſometymes give his church reſt, Acts 9.31. but this will not ſtand nor continue, which we know to be his meaneinge. A man cannot be Chriſt's diſciple but he muſt meete with croſſes, Matth. 16.24. Eſau and Jacob wreſtled together in their mothers wombe, Gen. 25.22. In the 2d place you except againſt his opinions, becauſe they make deviſions. The goſpell which he or any man holds forth will cauſe deviſions by accident, Matth. 10.34.35. If he be blamed for this, Chriſt cannot be excuſed. The 3d thing you alledge is that his opinions make people looke at their magiſtrates, miniſters and brethren as antichriſtians, enemies to Chriſt, but we know no ſuch doctrine which he taught, all which he delivered concerning this matter, was a deſcription of the way of workes and antichriſtianiſme, and ſo farre as magiſtrates and miniſters walke in that way they are to be looked at as antichriſtian, John 4.1, 2, 3. Laſtly, it is ſaid that his opinions are more dangerous than thoſe of Mr. Williams which, if it be true, then is the doctrine of the goſpell more dangerous than that for which Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams was baniſhed; for as yet we know nothing which Mr. Wheelwright helde diſſonant from the goſpell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he beene confuted, though condemned, and it is not our judgments ſo much as the cauſe which is changed.</p>
               <p>Theſe objections and anſwers being viewed, and what is unſound refuted, we come to the concluſion, wherein we are deſyered to judge what evill we finde in the law, and this we will doe faithfully by the helpe of Chriſt. This law we judge to be moſt wicked and ſinnefull, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe this law doth leave theſe weightye matters of the common-wealth, of receiving or rejecting ſuch as come over to the approbation of magiſtrates, and ſuſpends theſe things upon the judgment of man, whereas the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Gods, Deut. 1.17. This is made a ground worke of groſſe popery. Prieſts and magiſtrates are to judge, but
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011300_0044_0F897291F9E968B0"/>
it muſt be according to the law of God, Deut. 17.9, 10, 11. That law which gives that without limittation to man, which is proper to God, cannot be juſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe here is libertye given by this law to expell and reject thoſe which are moſt eminent chriſtians, if they ſuite not with the diſpoſition of the magiſtrates, whereby it will come to paſſe, that Chriſt and his members will finde worſe entertainment amongſt us than the Iſraelites did amongſt the Egyptians and Babilonians, than Abram and Iſaack did amongſt the Philiſtines, than Jacob amongſt the Shechemites, yea even than Lott amongſt the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites. Theſe all gave leave to Gods people, to ſit downe amongſt them, though they could not clayme ſuch right as the Kings ſubjects may. Now that law, the execution whereof may make us more cruell and tyrannicall over Gods children than Pagans, yea than Sodomites, muſt needs be moſt wicked and ſinnefull.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This law doth croſſe many lawes of Chriſt, Chriſt would have us render unto Caeſar the things that are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, Math. 22.21. But this law will not give unto the Kings majeſty his right of planting ſome of his ſubjects amongſt us, except they pleaſe them, Chriſt bids us not to forget to entertaine ſtrangers, Heb. 13.2. But here by this law we muſt not entertaine, for any continuance of time, ſuch ſtranger as the magiſtrates like not, though they be never ſo gracious, allowed of both by God and good men, except we will forfeite unto them our whole eſtates, it may be and much more than our eſtates comes unto. Chriſt commands us to do good unto all, but eſpecially to them of the houſehold of faith. Many other lawes there are of Chriſt, which this law daſheth againſt, and therefore is moſt wicked and ſinnefull.</p>

               </head>
               <p>COntentions among brethren are ſad ſpectacles, among the churches of Chriſt, eſpecially when they come once to ſavour of bitterneſſe, which would have diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me from publiſhing the former declaration, if I could have expected ſuch an anſwer: And in that reſpect I ſhould willingly have ſitten downe under my reproach, if the cauſe of truth and juſtice had not called me againe to this taſke; wherein, if I deale more ſharply, than myne owne diſpoſition leads me, the blame muſt fall upon him, who puts ſuch occaſions upon me, as I cannot otherwiſe ſhunne.</p>
               <p>Many faults doth the Anſwerer find in my declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. which I muſt examine as thay come in order. The <q>1ſt is, that in deſcribing a common wealth (ſuch as ours is) I do not deſcribe it, as it is chriſtian, nor as it is founded upon the grant of our King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I replye 1ſt, the defininition or deſcription of the genus may be applyed to all the ſpecies, reſerving the ſpecificall differences: To define a man to be a reaſonable creature is a true definition of any man, whether rich or poor, chriſtian or heathen: and when I deſcribe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth in general or in a more civil or politicke reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte, the churches or chriſtians which are in it, fall not into conſideration, as to the being of it, for it may be a true body politicke, though there be neither church nor chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in it.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſayd for the forme of government, whether it be by patent or otherwiſe yet it is a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo the deſcription is ſafe and true.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. The deſcription which I make doth include all that which he doth complaine to be wanting. The words
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011300_0045_0F89729304165748"/>
are theſe. A company of people, conſenting to cohabite under one government, for their mutual ſafety and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Now let ours be layd to this deſcription and the truth will appeare. We A.B.C. &amp;c. conſented to cohabite in the Maſſachuſetts, and under the government ſet up among us by his Majeſty's patent or grant for our mutual ſafety and wellfare, we agreed to walke according to the rules of the goſpell. And thus you have both a chriſtian common weale and the ſame founded upon the patent, and both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within my deſcription.</p>
               <p>I will adde only what I conceive from this and other like paſſages in his anſwer, viz. that he makes this exception rather to ſhelter himſelf under pretence of his renderneſs of the kings honour and right, than out of any ignorance of the true latitude of my deſcription; and withall he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers how little he regardeth what jealouſyes he put us under, ſo he may ſhelter his owne parties. The Lord give him to ſee his ſecret underminings, that it may be forgiven him. Having thus faulted my deſcription, he taketh upon him to teach me a better; and for this he refers me, by a marginal quotation to Proverb 8.5. the text is this, Oh ye ſimple underſtand wiſdome and ye fools be ye of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding heart; and to Iſai. 6.7. And he layd it upon my mouth and ſayd loe this hath touched thy lipps &amp;c. How theſe places will prove his deſcription of a chriſtian common wealth, founded upon the kings patent is beyond my reach, but it ſuits well with a practiſe now in uſe, to ſpeak nothing but what they bring ſcripture for; ſo ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be alledged it matters not how impertinent they be.</p>
               <p>As for your deſcription it ſelf, I have no more to ſay againſt it, but that it was not requiſite, to that which I projected, to expreſſe thoſe particulars; and our lawyers will tell you that <hi>expreſſio eorum quae tacitè inſunt nihil operatur:</hi> My intent was to prove the proprietye and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a common weale which may alſo belong to ſuch government among Turkes and Pagans, ſo far as they may fall within my deſcription without any prejudice to the moſt chriſtian government, that is, as if I ſpeake of one
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011300_0046_0F897293749326F8"/>
that is an honeſt man, and ſay that he goeth upright, ſpeakes, laughs, &amp;c. when a Turke or a Pagan doth the ſame.</p>
               <p>His next exception is, that I ſay <q>that ſuch a body politic may uſe all meanes, which may conduce to their wellfare, and do not reſtrain it to lawful meanes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I reply, that it is according to ſcripture phraſe, and our common ſpeach. When we call upon a ſicke man, to uſe meanes for his recoverye, we are well enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, though we put not the word lawful: I may do all things, ſaith Paul, and give all diligence ſaith Peter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſſing lawful, which the Anſwerer would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood well enough, if he had not beene minded to ſeeke a knot in a ruſh; only I ſee not why he ſhould paſſe over thoſe many things which he ſaith are queſtionable in my ground worke, and take up thoſe which will afford ſo little advantage.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds to examine the reaſons which I layd downe to prove the equitie of this law.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is this, "If we be a corporation eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by free conſent, if the place of our habitation be our owne—then no man hath right to come in to us, without our conſent."</p>
               <p>To this he anſwers, that "he knoweth not how we who ſtand a corporation by the Kings patent can thus argue." To this I replye then. I will tell him, that which the King is pleaſed to beſtow upon us, and we have accepted, is truly our owne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He denyeth the conſequence by a diſtinction of a conſent regulated, and a vaſt and illimited conſent.</p>
               <p>Replye: To ſpeake of conſent in general, implyeth alwayes a conſent ſuitable to the power or intereſt of him who is to give it; as when we ſay, a child may not marrye without conſent of parents, we know it is regulated, yet when a father pleads it, he doth not neede to expreſſe all the limitations.</p>
               <p>Thus he runs on in a frivolous diſcourſe, and in the end falls upon this falſe concluſion, "An unlawful diſſent can hinder no man," So that if he had need to borrow my
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011300_0046_0F897293749326F8"/>
horſe, and I ought by the rule of love to lend him to him, though I refuſe to conſent to his requeſt herein, yet he may take him, becauſe my diſſent is unlawfull; ſo by this concluſion a wife, a childe, a ſervant may doe any thinge that is lawfull, though the huſband, father, or maiſter deny their conſent. If this ſpeed well, the next concluſion will be an anarchie.</p>
               <p>After this diſcourſe I expected ſomewhat to have taken away the conſequence of my argument, but I finde not a word to that purpoſe, he is ſuddainly fallen upon my ſecond reaſon, which is this,</p>
               <p>"If no man hath right to our land, &amp;c. but by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then it is reaſon we ſhould take nottice of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conferre any ſuch upon them."</p>
               <p>This he partly grants, but complaines of the change of the queſtion, to which I replye that I did not propound any reaſons in a ſyllogiſticall frame, but by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and that which this argument tends unto was only to ſhew why ſome were not preſently allowed, but a time taken, wherein we might gayne ſome nottice and tryall of them, and there was no need why the anſwerer ſhould ſo often complaine of the change of the queſtion; for if he takes my reaſons together he cannot denye but the queſtion itſelfe is argued and concluded, as will appeare by the ſequell, I will therefore paſſe by all that he ſtrives about, upon this ſuppoſed fallacie, and joyne with him in the queſtion, as he ſtates it, viz.</p>
               <p>Whether the admitting or rejecting of perſons ſhould depend upon the diſcretions of men, which he calls an unlimitted and unſafe rule and their diſcretion not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, though they ſhould be magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>To this I replye, or rather anſwere, firſt, That which he takes for granted, and wherein lyes the whole ſtrength of his defence is untrue, viz. That the magiſtrates will and diſcretion in our caſe is not regulated, for 1ſt, the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are members of the churches here and, by that covenant, are regulated to direct all their wayes by the rule of the goſpell, and if they faile in any thinge, they are ſubject to the churches correction. 2dly. As they are
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011300_0047_0F89729432B6F0D0"/>
freemen, they are regulated by oath, to direct their aymes to the wellfare of this civill body. 3dly. As they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, they are ſworne to doe right to all, and regulated by their relation to the people, to ſeeke theire wellfare in all things; ſo as here is no ſuch irregulated diſcretion as is ſuppoſed, and it ſeems to me an improper ſpeech and ſavouring of contradiction; for diſcretion alwayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a rule for its guide. And herein I have occaſion to take in his anſwere to my 4th reaſon drawne from the practice of our churches, and ſome towns where matters of admitting or rejecting are ordered by diſcretion. And here it is made a wonder that I ſhew ſo much ignorance. I muſt confeſſe my ignorance is greate, and I cannot hide it, being expoſed ſo much as I am to publick view: Yet that will not cover the anſwerers blindneſs, from prejudice in this greate wonder, which is ſuch as he cannot diſcerne the voyce and will of Chriſt diſpenced in the diſcretion of his ſervants and people, and yet tells us not how it ſhould be knowne otherwiſe. Did he never heare. that our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is, that none are propounded to the congregation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be firſt allowed by the elders,<note n="*" place="bottom">This muſt needs render the influence of the Clergy very great under the old Conſtitution. No body could be propoſed to the Church for a Member unleſs the Miniſter allowed it. No body could be admitted a freeman unleſs he was a Member of the Church.</note> and is not this to admitt or reject by diſcretion? Did he never heare of a chriſtian man rejected by the church, or put off at leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a brother hath profeſſed want of ſatisfaction? Hath he never heard that the diſſent of ſome few brethren may, by rule, (as hath beene ſayd) cauſe the rejection of a man, whom all the reſt of the brethren ſhall approve of? And where is Chriſts voyce to be heard now, if he will have diſcretion ſhut out of the church. So ſays the inſtance of townes matters (which he wiſely declines and gives no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to) he well knowes that within the towne of Boſton it is an eſtabliſhed order, that none ſhould be received into cohabitation there, except they be allowed by certain men appointed to judge of their fitneſs for church-fellowſhip. And ſo, whereas the way of God hath alwayes beene to gather his churches out of the world; now, the world, or
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011300_0047_0F89729432B6F0D0"/>
civill ſtate, muſt be raiſed out of the churches. And yet the anſwerer can finde nothing of wonder of ignorance here. And if he had enquired of our neighbours at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, they could have tould him that their practice hath beene upon the like law, for many yeares, I mean in referring it to the diſcretion of the magiſtrates to receive and reject ſuch as come to them. And if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of a rule in the law of Moſes, he ſhould finde that there is power given to a huſband or father to allow or make void any vow of a wife or childe at their diſcretion, yet I hope he will not call this a vaſt and unlimitted rule.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the word diſcretion ſeems ſo offenſive and unſafe, let us trye it by the ballance of the ſanctuarye, if we can finde it to hold weight there, ſure it will prove a good meaſure for civill affaires.</p>
               <p>The word in ſcripture is ſometymes taken for ſound reaſon, as Pſal. 112.5. He will order his affaires by diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo Pro. 11.12. Sometymes for underſtanding, as Pro. 19.11. Iſai. 28.26. Sometymes for ſkill, as Pro- 2.11. Pro. 3.21. Sometymes for judgment, Phill. 1.9. And in all places in a good ſence, for it is a gift of God wherein he deſpenſeth his own wiſdome in all the affairs of men, both in church and common wealth; all lawes are made by diſcretion, and the equitie of them is found out and applyed to particular caſes by diſcretion; by it (being guided by the ſpirit of God) the mynde and will of God is found out in his word, Acts 5.8 and Acts 8.23. Acts 15.38. Acts 21.23. Levit. 27.8, 12. So for judgment in civil cauſes; by diſcretion did Solomon judge betweene the harlots. It is not poſſible to provide a law that in the letter of it ſhall reach every caſe which may fall out, as we ſee by the law of God it ſelfe in the ſame place of Levit. 27.8. then it muſt reſt in the diſcretion of the judge to diſcerne, ſo doth the Lord himſelfe appointe, Deut. 17.8.9. &amp;c. they are to do as the judge ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and that which he ſhall declare for law, that muſt they obey, otherwiſe there could be no determination in hard and doubtful caſes. As for theſe ſcriptures which the Anſwerer alledgeth about Chriſt his ſouerainty, &amp;c.
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:011300_0048_0F897294F4B5FCF0"/>
they are nothing to the queſtion; for the prerogative authority of Chriſt in all affaires in church and common wealth, doth not hinder the manner of his diſpenſations of the miniſtry of his ſervants, and in the improvement of ſuch gifts of his, of wiſdome, diſcretion, &amp;c. as he is pleaſed to exerciſe his authority in, according to the rule of his word.</p>
               <p>My 5th reaſon is, that it is no ſinne or injury to deny a man that which he hath no right unto, therefore we may denye ſome men place amongſt us. In the anſwer, there is againe complainte of changing the queſtion, becauſe I go about to prove that ſome men may be rejected, which he ſeemeth to grant, and if ſo then that which he maketh the maine queſtion will eaſily be cleared, for if we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſome, then the care of this muſt be committed to ſome perſons, for to ſpeak of diſcerning Chriſt his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in church or common wealth, otherwiſe than as it is diſpenſed in the miniſtry of men, is a meer idea or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſye. If then it muſt be committed to ſome perſons, to whom may it more properly than to the fathers of the common wealth? And if it cannot be foreſeene who are to be received and who to be rejected, thoſe perſons muſt be truſted with the tryall of them, and if no certaine rule can be ſet downe which may be ſufficient to diſcerne of every man, then muſt it be committed to their diſcretion, regulated by the word of God, and the dutye of their place, which they are bound to obſerve. And whereas the Anſwerer cryes out againſt this courſe as vaſt, illimitted, ſinefull and injurious, and yet will not (and cannot) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe us a better, neither in his anſwer, nor at the court when he oppoſed the makeing of this law, may we not ſafely judge that ſuch oppoſition and thoſe reproachful termes as are caſt from it, upon an ordinance of God, in the faces of thoſe whom he would have to be had in honor for his ſake, proceed rather from diſtemper of minde, than from any juſt cauſe of offence?</p>
               <p>Now here I might ſtrike him with his owne weappon, for when he ſeekes to prove that any of the kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, have right by our patent to come and plant in places
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:011300_0048_0F897294F4B5FCF0"/>
not inhabited, he changes the queſtion indeed, for both the law and our diſpute have beene about entertaining into houſes and townes, and not into places not inhabited. That queſtion may fall to be diſcuſſed upon ſome other occaſion.</p>
               <p>Againe (that we may take notice how his zeale for the cauſe outrunes his judgment) he gives to all the kings chriſtian ſubjects a right to plant among us, by vertue of our patent, and ſuch a right as by miſuſage whereof they may forfeit the patent, and here he might fitly have brought in his vaſt and illimitted termes, had he not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed them, for haſt, for there was never ſeene ſuch a vaſt patent of incorporation as ſhould comprehend all the kings chriſtian ſubjects, which is as large as if he had ſaid all his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>But that others may ſee his errour, if he himſelfe will not, let the patent be peruſed, and there it will be found, that the incorporation is made to certaine perſons by name, and unto ſuch as they ſhall aſſociate to themſelves, and all this tract of land is granted to them and their aſſociates: And after this he gives leave to any of his ſubjects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of his other dominions to this place: So then the caſe ſtandeth thus, the 10 men of Boſton allow a ſtrainger to ſit downe among them, yet this gives him no right to any mans houſe or land, nor to any lot in the towne, till it be granted him, nor to any privilege there till he be made free; we muſt have a new ſort of reaſon to make this a good argument; the King gives a man leave to inhabite in the incorporate colony of the Maſſachuſets, <hi>ergo,</hi> he hath hereby right to the lands there. His diſcourſe about the matter of general right by patent is ſo confuſed and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, as I ſhould but waſte tyme and paper to follow him in it, <hi>valeat ut valere poteſt.</hi> I finde nothing in it which may endainger my argument, except it be put out of countenance, by a falſe clamour of robbery, vexation, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, &amp;c. as if the ſtate here went about to take from men their lawful right and expell them from their houſes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The 6th reaſon is this, if ſtraingers have right to our houſes, &amp;c. then it is either of juſtice or of mercye, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:011300_0049_0F897295B403DF48"/>The anſwerer, after his wonted prejudice of change of the queſtion, undertakes to prove,
<q>that ſome ſtraingers have right in juſtice by the Kings patent,</q>
only he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth it to cohabitation and ſojourning (which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing for him, ſeeing this law doth not ſhutt out all ſtraingers) The reaſons he bringeth are three, the 1ſt, becauſe they are fellow-ſubjects, 2dly, becauſe they are of the ſame nation, 3dly, becauſe they are chriſtians.</p>
               <p>To this I replye, that I have alreadye cleared this pointe in laying open the extent and meaneing of the patent, and this I may ſay further, that I have reade over all the lawes of England and all the general cuſtomes and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Kings ſubjects there, but I have not found any thinge that may give the leaſt colour for ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as is pretended.</p>
               <p>As for that of chriſtianitye I have granted in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that there is a right of hoſpitalitye, but for other right of cohabitation or ſojourning it muſt be conſidered in ſuch ſpecial caſes, as may fall out and cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by general rule.</p>
               <p>My 7th reaſon is drawne from the proportion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance that a common-wealth hath to a familye, which is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man, otherwiſe than by way of hoſpitalitye.</p>
               <p>The anſwerer (his complainte of changing the queſtion premiſed) ſeekes to diſprove the proportion, by <q>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between the right which the maiſter of a familye hath to his houſe, &amp;c. and the right which this common wealth hath to all the houſes, &amp;c. within this paient.</q> This he amplyfyes by particular inſtances. <q>1. in power of bequeathing them to his wife and children. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the King's right. 3. In reſpect of ſuch as are no members, &amp;c. and yet have right to their houſes, &amp;c. 4. In regard to ſuch as have proteſted againſt this law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I replye, that it is not needful they ſhould hold proportion in all reſpect. It is ſufficient if they hold in that which is intended, viz. libertye to receive or reject; which being knowne to all and confeſſed by the anſwerer,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:011300_0049_0F897295B403DF48"/>
in granting that ſome may be rejected, is ſufficient to make good the argument drawne from this ſimilitude: yet to make it more cleare, I replye to theſe inſtances.</p>
               <p>To the firſt I ſay, that a bodye politicke may leave their houſes, &amp;c. to their ſucceſſors, which are in the place of their children. 2. For the Kings right, that being para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, hinders no more in a common-wealth than it doth in a familye, for he hath the ſame intereſt in the houſes, &amp;c. of the father of a familye. 3. For ſuch as are no members they are as ſojourners in a familye, who though they have right to be in the familye themſelves, yet may not receive in any to reſide in their particular chambers, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the maſter of the familye. 4. For ſuch as proteſted againſt this law, that proteſtation cometh too late (except they firſt convince us of the injuſtice of the law) ſeeing they formerly gave an implicite conſent to all the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome lawes and orders of the body; neither need we feare to proclaime our right to our houſes, &amp;c. againſt all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, more than particular perſons and corporations may do in England, notwithſtanding his Majeſties intereſt in them alſo. Such objections are not worth any anſwer.</p>
               <p>In his anſwer to my 8th reaſon, viz. <q>Turpius eijcitur quam non admittititur hoſpes,</q> he ſaith it is of humaine authority, and that my concluſions are farr from the marke.</p>
               <p>To this I replye, that though this ſentence be humaine, yet the equitye of it is ſtrengthened by divine truths: It had been leſſe griefe to Abraham not to have received Hagar to his bed then it was after to caſt her out; and it was <hi>turpius</hi> for Tobija and his ſtuffe to be caſt out of the temple, then it would if he had not been received in. Now that it may appear how farre my concluſion is from the marke, I will thus lay downe the argument. That law which ſhuts out ſuch as being received in, ſhall be worthy to be caſt out is honeſt and of good reporte, but this law doth ſo, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The major propoſition is proved by the examples of Hagar and Tobija, the minor I prove thus; the law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides to have ſuch kept out as will diſturbe the peace here,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011300_0050_0F897296769937F8"/>
rightly eſtabliſhed by the rules of Gods word, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c. except the argument may be avoyded, the concluſion will hitt the marke.</p>
               <p>But the Anſwerer ſaith that, <q>1. Such ones as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be kept out, are no diſturbers of our peace. 2. That the law doth not declare who are to be kept out and who not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe I replye firſt, for brevitys ſake let the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie and the remonſtrance, with the coppie of the whole ſermon (which himſelfe delivered into the court) be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and examined, and they ſhall decide the queſtion, if you will ſtand to it.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond I replye, that yourſelfe confeſſes who the law intended to keepe out; and though ſuch a preamble as might have expreſſed the full intent, was (for want of time) omitted (which was indeed a defect) yet ſuch as were of the court, and did well know, can make no ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, ſeeing the magiſtrates have other rules to guide them in the execution of it; and ſo it is warranted by ſcripture examples as that of our ſaviour Math. 16.19. and 18.18. whatſoever you binde on earth ſhall be bound in heaven &amp;c. yet he doth not there tell them, who they ought to binde or looſe.</p>
               <p>The 9th argument is taken from that of the 2 John 10. Such as bring not the true doctrine are not to be received to houſe, and conſequently not into the common wealth.</p>
               <p>The Anſwerer (after his uſual complainte of the change of the queſtion) acknowledgeth, that if the order had been made againſt ſuch it would not have been oppoſed; but affirmeth that it appears (by the ſame expreſſions in the court, and by the execution of the law in part) that this law is made to keepe out ſuch as bring the true doctrine of the goſpell, ſo that now he hath brought the queſtion to this ſtate, whether the opinions ſpread in the country. and oppoſed by the magiſtrates and elders, be the doctrines of the goſpell or not, which ſeeing it is to be decyded by the ſynod aſſembled, it will be beſt to attend the iſſue thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:011300_0050_0F897296769937F8"/>In his anſwer to the 10th reaſon, he doth only diſcourſe and finde fault with a concluſion which is of his own fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for I do not conclude that the law was only for taking notice of ſuch as come to us, but I add alſo the ende of ſuch notice, viz. for avoyding ſuch as are to be kept out) which being all included in one parenteſis, it is more than a ſlip thus to miſtake it.</p>
               <p>And whereas he chargeth me, as if I grounded the law upon no better foundation than a good intent, the reader may eaſily judge that it is a meere ſlander: For I lay down the order of the law to be, that ſuch ſhould not be received into our fellowſhip who are likely to diſturbe the ſame; and thence I inferre that this intent is lawfull and good.</p>
               <p>The like caſt he hath at the perſuaſion and conſcience of ſuch as are to execute this law: And here I muſt make bold to aſke him this queſtion, viz. Seeing you are bound by your oath in all cauſes wherein you are to give your vote for elections, &amp;c. to goe according to your conſcience, if then one be propounded to be choſen a magiſtrate, and you are perſuaded in your conſcience, by the beſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you can get of him, that he is not fitt for that place, whether are you to give your vote for him or not? When you have anſwered this queſtion, I will replye further to you: And with all I deſyre the anſwerer to take this along with him; that this law concerning the freemens oath, whereunto all the godly of this common-wealth conſented, (and which referrs the judgment of perſons and churches in that cauſe to the conſcience and perſuaſion of chriſtian men) was never yet held to be a vaſt and illimitted rule.</p>
               <p>The Anſwerer proceeds to the objections, and leaſt his arguments ſhould not reach his ayme, he ſpeakes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the readers judgment, by averring much unſoundnes, &amp;c. beforehand, but I muſt intreate him to make a better diſcovery ere it be yeelded.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt objection is, that ſome profane perſons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and others who are religious are rejected.</p>
               <p>The anſwerer diſclaymes this objection as none of theirs, which matters not greatly. I know from whome I heard
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:011300_0051_0F86A008DA5107B0"/>
it, though he did not; yet he might as well owne it, as offer to prove that ſuch as are truly and chriſtianly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious have been rejected, except he will denye ſuch to be religious: But I affirme ſtill, as I did before, that I know of none ſuch, who have been rejected, nor any ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers or quarrellers (as he ſpeakes of) to have been received.</p>
               <p>In his anſwer to my ſolution of this objection, I only obſerve this, that whereas my argument is by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſion <q>betweene a younge prophaine perſon and an elder profeſſor confirmed in ſome errour,</q> he gaine ſaith the compariſon by introduction of Abraham, who was a bleſſing to others; but alledgeth not any oppoſite member; but ſure he was in a greate ſtreight, otherwiſe he would not have held forth the father of the faithfull as ſuch an one, as he muſt produce to anſwer my compariſon; but it well accords with his owne tenent, that he muſt have leave to advance his owne partie, whatever danger or damage befall others by it.</p>
               <p>After this he takes upon him to prove, <q>that all ſuch as are confirmed in any way of errour, are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed cohabitation, but are to be pittyed and reformed, for this he alledgeth two places of ſcripture, Jude 22, 23. Gen. 16.17.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I replye 1ſt, Let it be obſerved how this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers my argument. I endeavoured to prove that ſome profeſſors were to be denyed cohabitation, rather than ſome prophaine ones, for this reaſon, viz. becauſe they may be more dangerous. His anſwer is, that all ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in any way of errour are not to be denyed, &amp;c. and omitts that wherein the weight of the argument lies, viz. their being dangerous to publick peace. 2dly, I denye that theſe ſcriptures prove his propoſition, for that in Jude ſpeakes nothinge of cohabitation, or confirmation in errour, nor ſpeakes he to magiſtrates, or ſuch as had power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or reject, &amp;c. and if he will bring that place to his purpoſe it will inferre this concluſion, that no compaſſion is to be had of ſuch as we may denye cohabitation unto.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011300_0051_0F86A008DA5107B0"/>
As for that, Gen. 16.12. it is as little to the purpoſe. Iſmaell dwelt in the houſe of his brethren, but not among them; ſo, by our law, ſuch as we hold not fitt to dwell among us are not denyed to dwell by us.</p>
               <p>Another objection is, "that by this law we reject true chriſtians, and ſo conſequently Chriſt himſelfe."</p>
               <p>The ſolution of this objection is, that in ſome caſes a man that is a true chriſtian may be rejected or denyed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, and yet Chriſt not rejected; for proof whereof I inſtance in diverſe particulars, all which he paſſeth by, without any directe anſwer; but concludes, that is nothing to the law; which I muſt leave to the reader to judge of, ſeeing he brings neither reaſon nor ſcripture againſt it, to which I may replye.</p>
               <p>After this he comes to the particular occaſion of the law, and here he layes about him in earneſt, and ſtrikes all that come in his way, magiſtrates, elders, and all that doe walk in that way which Mr. Wheelewright hath deſcribed to be a way of a covenant of workes, and holds them forth as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts; and for proof hereof alledges that in 1 John 4.1, 2, 3. where the Apoſtle, giving a rule to diſcover falſe ſpirits by, gives this as the marke, they confeſſe not that Jeſus Chriſt came in the fleſh, and ſuch a ſpirit is of Antichriſt. How this place proves his aſſertion I am not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne: Sure I am that ſuch, as he caſts under a covenant of workes, doe confeſſe that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, but then I ſee that hereby he hath brought the cauſe, which he is ſo zealous for, into ſuch a toyle as all the ſkill he hath cannot extricate, unleſſe (as before) he will draw in Abraham into the ſame eſtate of antichriſtianiſm; ſeeing by that doctrine he walked in the ſame way of a covenant of workes, 14 yeares together, viz. while he kept Hagar, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For his anſwer in defence of Mr. Wheelewright his opinions, I will make no replye, but waite the ſucceſſe of the conference among the churches now aſſembled.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place he bringeth diverſe reaſons to prove "that this law is moſt wicked and ſinnefull."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:011300_0052_0F86A00B86F0D330"/>His 1ſt reaſon is, this law giveth that, without limitation, to men, which is proper to God; and ſo is a ground of groſſe popery; for proofe he cites Deut. 1.17. and 17.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that I have proved already that the magiſtrates are limitted both by their church covenant and by their oath, and by the dutye of theire places, to ſquare all their proceedings by the rule of Gods word, for the advancement of the goſpell and the weale publick; neither doth it croſſe either of the places mentioned, for whatſoever ſentence the magiſtrate gives, according to theſe limitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the judgment is the Lords, though he do it not by any rule particularly preſcribed by civill authority. As for that other place in Deut. 17.9. it ſtrengthens our law, and reflects ſharply upon ſuch as doe oppoſe it; for it ſtreightly commands all perſons to ſubmitt to the ſentence of the judge, and to receive the expoſition of the law from his mouth; ſo as ſuch gaineſayers ſtand guilty of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in oppoſeing the ſentence of the judges, before they have clearely convinced them that their ſentence is contrary to the law of God.</p>
               <p>As for that aſperſion of popery, &amp;c. it will draw no blood; his earneſtnes in the cauſe makes him thus to caſt dirt upon his oppoſers, when he hath ſpent his ſhott.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His 2d reaſon againſt this law is, that it gives libertye to the magiſtrates to expell and reject thoſe who are moſt eminent chriſtians, if they ſuite not with the magiſtrates diſpoſition; and thence concludes that Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers will finde worſe entertainment among us than the Iſraelites did among the Egyptians and Babilonians, han Abraham and Iſaack among the Philiſtines, than Lott among the Sodomites, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. His earneſtnes confounds his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye; he knows well, that this law gives no power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell any, neither doth it make the magiſtrates diſpoſition the rule for rejecting any; but this ſlander hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed before. 2. For a brother in church covenant and a fellow member of ſuch a civill body as ours, to conclude
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:011300_0052_0F86A00B86F0D330"/>
ſo peremptorily of his fellow brethren, favours of much arogance and deſperate prejudice. If his charity can hope no better of us, but that we will deale worſe with Gods people than the Pagans (and that before he hath ſeene any experience of it) it is no marvaile if he favour ſuch as have ranked us with the ſame before; onely herein he deales fairely with us, in giving us tymely warneing what to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the imbittered mynde of ſuch a brother; but for his argument it ſelfe thus it ſtands: The Egyptians, &amp;c. gave leave to Gods people, to ſett downe amongſt them: But the magiſtrates will not give leave, &amp;c. <hi>ergo,</hi> they are worſe than the Egyptians, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, howſoever the magiſtrates cannot ſtopp his fury, yet we ſhall free the law from the force of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For except he had aſſumed thus, the magiſtrates muſt or may &amp;c. for it is nothing to the law, that they will doe ſo, ſeeing a magiſtrates will may tranſgreſſe a good law, and if they ſhould doe ſo, yet I denye that it is by the liberty of the law, which I ſhall not need further to prove, ſeeing my denyall will bear as much weight as his affirmation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His 3d reaſon is, this law doth croſſe many lawes of Chriſt. This he proves by enumeration of 3 particulars, Matt. 22.21. Heb. 13.2. Gal. 6.10.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, and 1. to that of Matt. 22.21. Give unto Ceſar the things which are Ceſars. The reaſon lyes thus: The King hath right to plant any of his ſubjects among us; but we denye to let him plant ſome of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects among us, unleſſe they pleaſe us; <hi>ergo,</hi> we denye to Ceſar, &amp;c. The propoſition is falſe; for I have proved before, that the King haveing given all the land within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine limitts to the patentees and their aſſociates, cannot ſend others to poſſeſſe that which he hath granted before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for that in Heb. 13. it is nothing to the purpoſe; This law of the court hinders not the entertainment of ſtraingers ſo farre as the rule of hoſpitalitye requires; and there is no other intended in that place.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:011300_0053_0F86A00BF6714568"/>3. For that in Gal. 6. I confeſſe the houſhold of faith are principally to be regarded; and it is apparent that the care of their wellfare was the only occaſion and ground (next the glory of God) of the making of this law: For, the court, taking nottice how the hearts of the faithfull were ſadded by the ſpreading of diverſe new and unfound opinions, and the uncharitable cenſures which they laye under by occaſion of them, how brotherly love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion decayed, how the ordinances of religion were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the faithfull diſpenſers thereof (ſometimes more precious than fine gold) ſlighted and reproached, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole countrey, they found it needfull to provide remedye in tyme, that it might goe well with the houſhold of faith, and though the execution of this law ſhould turne to the damage of ſome of this houſhold, yet better it is ſome member ſhould ſuffer the evill they bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than that, by indulgence towards them, the whole familye of God in this countrey ſhould be ſcattered, if not deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>His laſt argument (by which we may ſee that he ment not to quitt the cauſe, ſo long as his breath would hold) is this, This law daſheth againſt many other lawes of Chriſt <hi>ergo,</hi> it is moſt wicked and ſinnefull.</p>
               <p>To which my anſwer may be ſhort, and yet ſufficient to withſtand the force of his argument. This law daſheth not againſt any law of Chriſt; <hi>ergo,</hi> it is juſt and good.</p>

               <p>I Thank you for your continued offices of love in your counſaile to my ſervant, while the Lord granted him health, and your kindnes and reſpect to him in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; as the Lord ſhall offer me opportunitie you ſhall ever find me ready to performe the like or any other fruit of well affection for you or yours.

I ſhall deſire that thoſe cattle that are in your hands or any others may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as they were till next ſpringe, when I ſhall, if the Lord grant life, take order for them. I wrote to you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning powder that was left in the bay, the ſtore we had here grows ſhort, but I hope we ſhall have noe need till next ſpringe, until when I leave it alſo, only I directed my man that if he ſaw it decaying, haveing been long kept, (though that we have here holds yet well) he ſhould ſell 8 or 10 barrels of it. Concerning the laſt part of your letter I can yet ſay little, only thus much that whatſoever tends to mutual defence and ſhall conduce to the ſettling and maintaining unfained love, you may expect from me and all thoſe who are intreſted in this place. For other matters, as they are of great conſequence and near concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to others as well as myſelf, I can at preſent ſay thus much only, that if there be any thing betwixt you and the townes above, about bounds, whatſoever is concluded without us heare I ſhall account invalid and muſt proteſt

But the little time there is allotted me to write I muſt ſpend in requeſting your worſhips counſel and favour. My father in law Ward, ſince his ſonne came over, is varey deſirous that wee might ſett down together, and ſo that he might leave us together if God ſhould remove him from hence. Becauſe that it cannot be accompliſhed in this town, is verey deſirous to get mee to remove with him to a new

If your worſhip have heard any relation of the places, wee ſhould remaine thankful to you, if you would bee pleaſed to counſel us to any of them. Further, I would entreate for adviſe in this: The towne gave mee the ground (100 acres) upon this condition, that I ſhould ſtay in the towne 3 yeeres, or elſe I could not ſell it: Now my father ſuppoſes it being my firſt heritage (my father having none in the land) that it is more than they canne doe to hinder mee thus, when as others have no buſineſs, but range from place to place, on purpoſe to live upon the countrey. I would entreate your counſel whither or noe I canne ſell it. Further: I am ſtrongly ſett upon to ſtudye divinitie, my ſtudyes elſe muſt be loſt: for phyſick is but a meene helpe.

               <p>HAD not the Almighty (who is righteous in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of mans unrighteouſnes) ſtirred up certaine malicious and ſlanderous perſons to defame me with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, falfe and ſhameles reports, to my no ſmall griefe and trouble, I had been with you before this day, knowing right well how comfortable the face of a friend is in ſuch ſad conditions as yours at preſent. How I have been and am affected with thoſe loſſes and croſſes as are befallen you by your unfaithful ſervant, he that made the heart beſt knoweth. But when I conſider how unhappy a man may be, in the fulleſt and moſt plentiful enjoyment of worldly treaſures, then I judge you neerer happines in the loſſe of them; not doubting but our gracious God will ſanctifie his hand unto you, aſſuring myſelfe it will be good for you in the end. How prone would Gods people be to have their hearts enſnared and taken up with the world and the riches and honors thereof, if he ſhould not ſometimes ſhew us their vanity. He that brought Job ſo low (after he was humbled before him) bleſſed his latter daies more than his former. We have to doe with the ſame God: He can doe what he will, and let this be our comfort, he will doe what is beſt for us: Therefore let us ſhew forth his praiſe by patient ſubmitting to his hand, joining therewith a diligent enquiry after the cauſe twixt him and ourſelves. I have too often uſed a fooliſh proverb, I had rather be envyed than pittyed: But I finde by lamentable experience Gods word true, That none can ſtand before envy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prefer your condition farre before mine owne, whom I conceive to be compaſſed about with friends.

               <p>YOUR pious and good letter I received; for which I humbly thanke you. Your judicious counſel therein I lovingly imbrace, as concurring fully with mine owne judgment: Hence have I not troubled the people at all with church diſcipline, or conſtitutions of churches, &amp;c. but have bent my whole ſtuddies to ſhew them their miſerable and loſt eſtate without Chriſt, &amp;c. Nor have I enveyed, in the leaſt meaſure, againſt the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (to my remembrance) but have been (and ſtill am) very fearefull to give one word of diſtaſt about thoſe things, but altogether do ſeek to gaine them to Chriſt. True, I do acknowledge that after I had been here for the ſpace of a month or 6 weeks, and perceiving them very ſuperſtitious, (performing mans invention rather than the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011300_0059_0F86A0139C713060"/>
inſtituted worſhip of God) now, that I might gaine their good eſteeme of Gods pure ordinances, and make them ſee the evill and folly of their ſuperſtition and will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I made choiſe of Pſ. 19. and 7. to handle it at large: And, in one of the uſes of reproof, I bent myſelfe as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I could againſt the religion of the Papiſts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned thoſe practices, which I ſaw the people here were ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to, in that uſe againſt the Papiſts; whoſe religion I ſhewed, at large, conſiſted either of a new inſtructed worſhip not mentioned in the law of God, or of Gods inſtituted worſhip miſerably abuſed, either by their additions or diminutions; and ſhewed the particulars wherein. Now (I heartily thank God for it) it took a generall good impreſſion, excepting Mr. Vines and one more who told me I ſtruck at the church of England, though I mentioned her not. Whereupon he preſſed me to diſpute with him about one part, of baptizing infants with godfathers and godmothers; the which I was very loth to diſpute about; yet I ſaw that either I muſt, or elſe ſit downe with ſhame, for he had called together his whole family to heare it. Now, it pleaſed God ſo to ſtrengthen me (through the riches of his mercy) that he was utterly ſilent; and ſince that time hath manifeſted more reſpect and love to me and my maſter than formerly, and doth take notes of the ſermons dayly, and repeateth them in his family very orderly, as I am informed.</p>
               <p>Thus, ſweet Sir, I make very bold to enforme your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the truth of things, though not worth the writing.</p>
               <p>I have been ſolicited both from the inhabitance of Stratens plantation and from thoſe of Caſkoe, to be a meanes to helpe each of them to a godly miniſter; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do make bold to intreat your worſhip to do your endeavour to furniſh them both.</p>

               <p>I Am glad that La Tour hath not ayd from us; and I could wiſh hee might not have any from the ſhipps: For as long as La Tour and Daulney are oppoſites they will weaken one another. If La Tour ſhould prevail againſt him we ſhall undoubtedly have an ill neighbour. His father and himſelfe, as I am informed, have ſhed the blood of ſome Engliſh already, and taken away a pinnace and goods from Mr. Allerton. It were (I think) good, that that buſines were cleared before hee had either ayd or libertie to hire ſhipps, yea, or to depart.</p>
               <p>Sir, it is not the manner abroad to ſuffer ſtraingers to view forts or fortifications, as it ſeems theſe French have done. I muſt needs ſay, that I feare we ſhall have little comfort in having any thing to doe with theſe idolatrous French. The countrey hereabouts is much troubled that they are ſo entertayned and have their libertie as they have to bring their ſoldiers aſhore, and to ſuffer them to trayne their men. And great jealouſies there are, that it is not Daulney that is aymed at; ſeeing ſuch a ſtrength will neither ſute ſuch a poore deſigne, and La Tour a man of weake eſtate, as it is ſaid. Wherefore, other mens hands are employed, and purſes too, for ſome other ſervice. But I leave all theſe things to your ſerious conſiderations, deſireing the Lord to guide you therein to the glorie and peace of the churches here, to whoſe grace I commit you and humblie reſt,</p>

                  <salute>Much honoured in the Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THough we doe, and may truly, profeſſe ourſelves to be both unfit and unwilling to interpoſe in a matter of ſuch ſtate and weight, as we conceive this French af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to bee, yet the honour we owe to the religion we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, the loyalty we beare to our native country, eſpecially in its preſent condition and the reference wherein it ſtands to the kingdome of France, out of reſpect to the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our government and governors, our tender care of the ſouls and lives of ſuch as are committed to the truſt thereof, the eye of care we ought to have upon our friends in the eaſt, our regard to our chriſtian confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, ſo lately combined with us, in confidence of our piety and wiſdome, and the religious diſcharge of our own conſciences and duties, will not permit us to be ſilent, ſo long as there is any roome left for us to ſpeake. We have littel hope to revoke reſolutions ſoe farre tranſacted and ripned, but we preſume it ſhall not be taken amiſſe, if we labour to waſh our hands wholly of this deſigne, and what ill conſequences ſoever it may produce. The reaſons moving us hereto, are our deepe feares that the ſtated rules of undertaking warres, either by proper and direct enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, or by lending ayd, have not been ſo duly obſerved, as we could wiſh.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The grounds of warre ought to be juſt and neceſſary. For the juſtice of this warre by la Tour agaynſt Daulnay, we conceive that all the light and information New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath, or may probably receive, cannot be ſufficient for us to determine it poſſitively; we underſtand it hath beene variouſly judged in the courts of France, one while for Daulnay, another while for la Tour, and it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that la Tour hath now rather outfriended than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded Daulnay; we ſhall therefore runne into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:011300_0061_0F86A0175875FE50"/>
premunire of preſumption if we reſolve upon ſuch an enterprize with an irreſolved faith, <hi>in cauſâ dubiâ bellum non eſt ſuſcipiendum.</hi> For the neceſſity of it, it muſt either be in point of charity towards de la Tour or upon ſome engageing intereſt of our owne. For any bond of charity, we conceive the ſpeech of the prophet to Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat, 2 Chron. 19.2. and of Solomon, Proverbs 26.17. not only diſcharge but ſtrongly prohibite us. 1. For our owne intereſt, if it be cleare that Daulnay hath offered us ſuch great wrong, as invites us to a warre (which we much queſtion, for it muſt be <hi>atrox injuria)</hi> we ſuppoſe it would ſtand more with the honor of our religion and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to proceed profeſſedly and orderly againſt him, then for us Engliſh to become but margent notes upon a French text, which to us is as yet but apocripha; and to undertake him upon more certaine grounds, and at a more ſeaſonable time when he doth leſs expect us, and is not ſo well provided for us as now he is. Warrs are extreme remedies and are not to be enterpriſed unleſſe their cauſes will beare out all manner of effects and conſequences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſonall or nationall, which may enſue. And what may not enſue, if either of the nations to whom we belong will comment upon our action in a ſtate language? And how apt a time this is for miſconſtructions we cannot be ignorant. The ſpirit of warre is ſcholaſtick and jeſuitical, traverſing the very poſitions and principles, which peace hath held both dogmatical and irrefragable, even to the wonderment of rational men. We are informed that Daulnay deſires our friendſhip, and we are inclined to believe that if it did as well become him to appeal to our judgment as it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemes us to expect it, he would not refuſe to caſt himſelf upon our compromiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Warres ought not to be undertaken without the counſell and command of the ſupreame authority, whence expeditions iſſue. It is not hard to ſay, the preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the kingdomes of England and France conſidered, that the ſubjects of the one ought not to wage warre againſt the other without a publick commiſſion of
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:011300_0061_0F86A0175875FE50"/>
ſtate, unleſſe it be in defence upon a ſudden aſſault: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we yet heare that La Tour himſelf hath any ſuch commiſſion for this his action; though if he had it were little to us. It is a rule obſerved amongſt confederates, that during any league of peace betweene them, one friend may not ayd another againſt any part of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, till that part be proſcribed by the authority of a generall aſſembly whereof it is a member, and the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates aſſured thereof in a ſtate way. The breach of this rule is a breach of league. Publick actions of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity worke farre and wide, having their national and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federal influences and conſequences. The daggers we draw here may happly prove ſwords in Chriſtendome for ought we know.</p>
               <p>But this deſigne, whatever the cauſe was, ſeemed ſhy even of our New-Engliſh Counſel to warrant and guide it: How cloſely it concernes the peace and ſafety of the whole plantation may eaſily be conjectured, and how farre it declined the advice thereof in a repreſentative courſe we are very ſorry to conſider or mention.</p>
               <p>We dare not ſo much impeach the honour of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſours as to think they would vaile the action with this, that they only permit and give way to volunteirs; for who knows not this to be a rule of ſtate, that Not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, when there is notice and power, is to bidd.</p>
               <p>This were alſo to proclaime our weaknes, in proſtrating our government to nothing; for who is ignorant that To permit voluntiers to iſſue out in ayd of a friend is never done without an act of ſtate, where any ſtate is?</p>
               <p>Daulnay, nor France, are not ſo feeble in their intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals as to deeme it no act of ſtate, when, upon conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with ſome of our chiefe perſons, our men are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, if not incouraged, to goe forth with our proviſion and munition upon the deſigne: We do therefore wonder that our people, having no warrant from authority, will, of their own heads, runne ſuch a hazzard of their ſoules and lives, as can neither looke for any prayers or thankes for their good ſucceſſe, nor any ſuccours if it ſares ill, and
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011300_0062_0F86A0182AC40750"/>
as it may fall out, rather call for the curſes of their friends from whom they went, and of poſterity yet unborne, and yet theſe poore men preſume that if Daulnay ſhould ſay, as the King of Egypt to Joſiah, what have I to do with thee, thou King of Judah? I come not out againſt thee this day, but againſt the houſe with whome I have warre, or if they ſhould ſhed innocent blood or feel their owne ſoules dropping ſuddenly into hell, they had their warrant from the Counſel and countenance of thoſe upon whom they might and ought to confide. It were to be wiſhed they had been taught the Germane proverb, which ſayth, He that loſeth his life in an unneceſſary quarrel dyes the Devill's martyr. Had they had the voyces of the people with them, it had beene better than nothing; but that wind ſeemes to us to blow ſtrong in the teeth of their voyage. We ſhall preſume to propound theſe queſtions. 1. If Daulnay or France ſhall hereafter demand any of them from us as enemies, or murtherers, whether will our court protect or deliver them? 2. If any of the parents or wives ſhall require their lives at our hands, who ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them? 3. If any of their widdowes or children ſhall require ſuſtenance, or any maimed ſouldier in this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion call for maintenance, who ſhall give it them? or if taken captive and made ſlaves, who ſhall reſcue or redeem them?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ends of warre ought to be religious: What glory is intended hereby to God we ſee not, and how our peace ſhall hereby be ſettled we foreſee not, but ſuſpect it will rather be a beginning than an end of our troubles and feares, if we doe not wholly ſuppreſſe Daulnay, we may be ſure of it. He is already very ſtrong, and if our ſhips and munition fall into his hand, it will deminiſh from us, and incourage, exaſperate and ſtrengthen him.</p>
               <p>If La Tour prevaile he is like to cavill with our men for ſome miſcarriages, or we with him for non-payment. The paſſage of our ſhips to and from England hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beene quiet and ſafe, in regard of the French, but we cannot ſo expect it hereafter, if they ſhall meete with any of La Tours or Daulnayes ſpecial friends, or at leaſt with
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:011300_0062_0F86A0182AC40750"/>
the friends of ſuch of them as we ſhall ſeeme to wrong. <hi>Bellum contra hoſtem non eſt ſuſcipiendum cum periculo rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Undertakings of warrs ought to be probably feaſable, but this ſeemes not ſoe to us. We learne out of the Eaſt, be an eye witneſſe, that Daulnay is very ſtrong, in artillery, men and munition, at land, and very well provided at ſea, inſomuch that ſome of the Eaſt have conſulted to repayre to him in his ayd, leaſt he ſhould upon revenge annoy and ruine them; he is reported to be a valiant, prudent and experienced ſouldier and commander, and defendants have great advantages of aſſaylants, ſoe that, we feare, our ſheep have haſtned to their ſlaughter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The manner of enterpriſing warre calls for many rules, according to ſcripture and the cuſtome of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and ingenuous nations, as to ſummon and give warning before they ſtrike: To heare what the defendant can pleade for the juſtice of his cauſe, to offer termes of peace with equal articles, and to give ſpecial cautionary commiſſions and commands how farre to perſiſt in ayd, and when to deſiſt; but we neither can ſend fitt men for ſuch charges, nor can we preſcribe ſuch directions, without a profeſſed imbarquing ourſelves in the action; which, it ſeems, is wholly declined on our parts.</p>
               <p>We therefore trouble you no further, only we itterate our proteſtation that we are and deſire to be held cleare and innocent of this undertakeing, and</p>

               <p>I Finde that your troubles are many, and eſpeciallie about this French buſines. The Lord in mercie ſupport you. I am much grieved to heare what I heare; and I ſee more of the ſpirits of ſome men than ever I thought I ſhould ſee. The Lord rebuke Satan. Sir, be of good comfort, I doubt not but our God that is in heaven will carry you above all the injuries of men; for I know you would not permitt any thinge, much leſs act in any thinge that might tend to the leaſt damage of this people, and this I am aſſured of, that moſt of Gods people here about us are of the ſame minde. The rumours of the countrey, you know, they riſe out of ignorance principallie, and much out of fears; wherefore, I pray you, let there be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction given as ſoone as you convenientlie can, in the way you wrote me of; for I finde the ſpirits of of men in this countrie are too quick and forward. I cannot excuſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet I bleſſe God, not to wronge you, but according to the information and light I received from you, I acted publiquelie ſo farre forth as to break downe all prejudices againſt yourſelfe or the reſt that adviſed with you. Our prayers here are publiquely and privately for a good iſſue of it, and that continually. I hope God will looke upon your ſinceritie in mercie and will heare our requeſts.</p>
               <p>I ſee no good uſe of ſuch proteſtations as I heare of, but they may prove more dangerous than the French bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines by farre, if our God hinder not. However, it will be of uſe (God directing) to make a holy uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Touching my coming to Boſton about the Dutch bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, I cannot ſee how it will be of any uſe: For the meſſenger cannot have a determinate anſwer till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall court, and to morrow we have appointed many of the towne for the working of the fort, which, unleſs I be there, there will not any thing be done, and I received not your letter till this day after our lecture.</p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:011300_0063_0F86A018B55ED398"/>I conceive, if you doe any thing about Mr. Oateleys buſines, that you alſo will be pleaſed to appoint ſome day and grant ſome ſummons to him, that hee may bring in his witneſſes, that there may not be any juſt ground of exceptions given: For hee ſpeakes as if hee were much wronged in all the teſtimonies taken againſt him, and that he can diſprove them, &amp;c.</p>

                  <salute>Gentlemen and beloved brethren,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is not unknowne to you, that (through the Lords gracious aſſiſtance) I have thankfully imbraced and ſubmitted unto the wiſe and loveing adviſe and admonitions of any of my brethren; and truly it is ſtill my deſire ſo to doe: And this (I hope) may well ſtand (upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion) with the maintenance of what is good and righteous in our cauſe, about this French buſines, and with that faithfulnes that is againe required of me towards you all, whom I love honour and reverence in the Lord. And though I have lately written to you about this matter, yet that which I have ſince received from you calls upon me for ſome addition and anſwer alſo; which I do not with any purpoſe to contend, but in diſcharge of my conſcience and duty of my place, and let the Lord do what ſeemes good in his eyes.</p>
               <p>The proteſtation, which was directed to myſelfe firſt, but came to me through many hands (and ſo it ſeemes it
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011300_0064_0F86A019B66D0F48"/>
was intended by you, being ſent unſealed) was entertained of me as proceeding from your zealous care for the publick ſafety: But, conſidered in itſelfe, it is an act of an exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant nature, out of rule, out of ſeaſon, and of dangerous conſequence. Such proteſtations are publique and judicial acts, and therefore muſt be warranted by ſome authority, which appears not in this. I know no law, order, cuſtome or &amp;c. that can give power to 3 aſſiſtants, by any ſuch publick inſtrument, to contradict the proceedings of a greater number, the Governor alſo being one of them; and how it will conſiſt with the obligation of a freeman is alſo conſiderable. Suppoſe now, 3 other aſſiſtants and ſo many elders ſhould proteſt againſt your proteſtation, it would be of equal force, and as warrantable for ought I knowe. Againe, it comes not like Solomons apples of gold if plates of ſilver; it is <hi>conſilium poſt factum:</hi> Whereas, if you had ſent it in ſeaſon, it might perchance have ſtopped thoſe proceedings which you ſo much complaine againſt; whereas, at preſent (you know and may ſee) you do but beate the ayre, and ſtrive for that which (you are ſure) you cannot reach. It is alſo of dangerous conſequence in theſe reſpects. 1. It may be a preſident for others to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the like in any caſe; for you take upon you the ſole judgment of your owne act, and if others may have the like liberty, they may countenance their oppoſition to authority, as well in evill cauſes as in good. 2. It blowes a trumpet to diviſion and diſſention amongſt ourſelves, magiſtrates proteſting againſt magiſtrates, elders againſt elders, blameing, condemning, expoſeing brethren to the peoples curſes, and caſting them down to hell itſelfe; and all this muſt be indured, while we walk after the light God affords us from his owne word, and the preſidential acts of former times, and of our owne generall court (as will be expreſſed hereafter) whereas the way of God, and of order, and of peace, had beene to have referred your grievance to the generall court, and not by ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable proteſtation and outcry againſt your brethren, to incite the people againſt them; whereof, if any evill
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:011300_0064_0F86A019B66D0F48"/>
effect ſhould follow, your proteſtation of innocencie would afford you little comfort or defence. 3. This is the ready way to haſten upon us the evill ſo much feared: For if Daulnay underſtand our diviſions to be ſuch, as he is like to have a party amongſt ourſelves, (as you declare your intelligence to be) this may imboulden him to attempt that againſt us which, otherwiſe, he dared not have done. It is alſo againſt the rule of juſtice, your owne plea on Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nays behalfe, for you paſſe ſentence and publiſh it without calling us to anſwer: If may be one or two of you have accidentally heard us ſpeake ſomewhat about it, but did you ever enquire of us, if we had any more to ſay for our ſelves, why judgment &amp;c. For you will find we have more to ſay for our ſelves than you formerly heard, and it is a neceſſary conſequence, if you had power to be our judges, you had the ſame to require our anſwer. I intreate you to call to mind that beaten rule of equity, <hi>Qui aliquid ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit parte inauditâ alterâ,</hi> &amp;c. We are condemned in court, in country, by private tongues and by publick edict, and never aſked, Why have you done this? and all this ſo carryed on, and unſeaſonably diſpenſed as no man can tell (nor do yourſelves propound) what you would have, or how it may tend to any publick good or prevention of that great danger which you ſuppoſe to hang over us; except it may be conceived that, either Daulnay will be pacified with a proteſtation, or the people will be ſtirred up to ſacrifice ſome of us to make their owne peace. You ſay, indeed, you will hereby be innocent of all the evill that may inſue, &amp;c. Amen, ſay I; but ſurely wiſe men will not believe that ſuch a proteſtation will acquit you, either before God or men: No more than if one of the magiſtrates <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

And truly (brethren) you might have dealt a little more tenderly with us, for ſuch ſaileings as you have apprehended in our counſells, being the fruite but of a few houres conſultation; ſeeing yourſelves, (upon ſo many weekes deliberation) could not
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011300_0065_0F86A01A34D3AA98"/>
free your owne acts from ſuch miſcarriage as you ſee your proteſtation, out of date and out of courſe, doth hould forth.</p>
               <p>This I thought needfull to tender to your wiſe and chriſtian conſideration, concerning your proteſtation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: Somewhat I muſt ſay to your arguments, beſides what may concerne them in my former writings. But, firſt, you may pleaſe to conſider, that it cannot be denyed but that the Governor, aſſiſted with ſome of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, may take order for ſuch ſudden affaires of the ſtate as either need not, or cannot, ſtay the aſſembling of the general court; of which ſort, we conceived this was (the reaſons you may ſee in my former writing) and when, in ſuch caſes, we have proceeded according to our beſt ſkill and judgment, we are to be excuſed, and ſo it was wont to be: And the generall court ſeemes lately to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged this truſt, when, by the order of (4) 1641, it gives power, out of court, to any 3 magiſtrates to do that which may occaſion a warre, with the Indians, as likely as this with the French: For they may give commiſſion to any maſter to right himſelfe upon the Indians, for his fugitive ſervant. By like authority it was that ſome of us diſarmed the Indians and impriſoned ſome of them, upon the late ſuſpicion: And although it was conceived to be full of danger, and proved troubleſome and chargeable, yet wee were not reproved for it. Other inſtances might be brought, but in thoſe times, indeed, when ſuch proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were not in uſe. Now, in this caſe of the French, wherein the onely doubt was, not whether wee ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage ourſelves in a warre with La Toure againſt Daulney, or not; for, we know that neither the magiſtrates nor the generall court it ſelfe could determine that,<note n="*" place="bottom">No War could be declared without the conſent of the united Colonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> but whether it were ſafer or more juſt and honourable for us to ſtop the courſe of God's providence, offering us opportunity to ſave a diſtreſſed neighbour, to weaken a dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my without our chardge or engagement, or to ſuffer it to go on freely in its owne courſe. Of theſe two we judged the laſt to be beſt, &amp;c. And of this opinion ſome of us ſhall ſtill be untill we ſee ſtronger arguments againſt it, than as yet we have met with.</p>

                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:011300_0065_0F86A01A34D3AA98"/>Now for your arguments, (whereof ſome concerne the preceedings, others the conſequences) I will paſſe by that of Jehoſaphat as no parallel to our caſe; and ſee if I can free us from that of Prov. 26. And here it may be firſt obſerved, that he ſpeaks of one that paſſeth by, viz. that had no calling or invitation to deale in it. But 2, I will ſhew that this ſtrife betweene La Tour and Daulnay doth neerly concerne us: and firſt in point of duty, in that our diſtreſſed neighbour calls to us for help; a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God and his owne good opinion of our chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, brought him to us, for ſome ends, and no other appearing to us, it was our duty to attend his; nor were we in this caſe to ſtand upon the juſtice of the quarrell betweene them, no more than Abraham did when Lot and the Sodomites were in preſent diſtreſſe; nor than any man would doe, if he ſaw his neighbour under foote and in danger to be killed, he would firſt reſcue him from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ere he enquire of the cauſe. And how we might withould ſuch helpe from La Tour which that providence which brought him hither, might here offer him in his apparent diſtreſſe and danger of utter ruine, I profeſſe I ſee no warrant.</p>
               <p>For cleareing of this point I deſire you ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider an argument or two. 1, He is either a neighbour or no neighbour. If he be not a neighbour, then is he in no relation to us by the ſecond table, and then we may rob, beate, or kill him without breach of any commandment. But if he be a neighbour then muſt we do to him in his diſtreſſe, as we would have others do to us in ours. 2dly, If he be one of thoſe ALL, to whom by the rule of the Apoſtle we muſt doe good (as he muſt needs be, if he be either of the houſhould of faith or out of it) then that is the good we muſt do to him, which he hath moſt preſent neede of; and that we may not withould from him, when it is in our hands to give it him, Prov. 3.27. I pray you conſider the place. 3dly, If my neighbours or mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies oxe be in that ſtate as he cannot get to his place without my helpe, I muſt helpe him to his place, Exod.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011300_0066_0F86A01D75A54E90"/>
23.4. much rather my neighbour himſelfe; and therefore La Tour and his company being now before us in that condition, we ought to helpe him hence. Theſe are plain and general rules and will not beare diſtinctions of proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and papiſt: For the morall law being given to man by nature was given to him as man, not as man ſo and ſo qualifyed, and therefore when it requires duty from him, it requires it as from a man ſimply; and when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds man as an object of this duty, it propounds him alſo ſimply conſidered without diſtinction of good or bad, chriſtian or heathen, &amp;c. and our Saviour inforceth this by propounding the example of our heavenly father, who cauſeth the ſun to ſhine upon the juſt and unjuſt, &amp;c. and commands us to follow his example. And the goſpell makes this difference only, that in queſtion of priority, or neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of neglect of one, the faithfull muſt be preferred. Therefore let us ſee ſomething of like authority to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with theſe rules, or elſe we muſt conclude, that this (ſo farr as we deale in it) is a thing that concernes us. 2dly, As it concerns us in point of duty, ſo doth it alſo in point of danger. I have ſhewed in my former writing, how Daulnay hath dealt with us and our neighbours, when he was weak, what principles he is acted by, and what pretences he hath againſt us; and all hiſtories teach us that the ambition and covetouſnes of conquerours and ſpoylers, hath always increaſed with their power: And ſhall we not believe that Daulnay onely will be more calmed and moderated by acceſſe of 200 ſoldiers, and 4 or 5000<abbr>l.</abbr> yearely revenue: Let the latin proverb be attended as well us the Germaine, and that will tell us that <hi>res noſtra agitur, paries cum proximus ardet.</hi> I may ſtrengthen this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment by a late Germaine hiſtory. When the biſhop of Spiers had begun to raiſe a ſtrong fortification upon his owne territories, the late Palatine of Rhine demoliſhed it by force of armes in a time of peace, becauſe it might be dangerous to him if warr ſhould ariſe. And the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians being in league with the Athenians (their owne city being unwalled) would not ſuffer the Athenians to
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:011300_0066_0F86A01D75A54E90"/>
wall theirs, becauſe it concerned them in point of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And it hath beene uſual for the States of Europe to interpoſe in quarrells of their neighbour States, when they have concerned them but in point of danger onely. Now for your diſcourſe about our diſtinction betweene commanding and not forbidding, let the diſtinction be rightly ſtated as it concerns our practiſe, and not as you would put upon us, and we hope it will hould ſo well, as neither the adviſers nor the actors ſhall neede to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to owne it. We diſclaime to have any hand in yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leave to any of ours to go make warr upon Daulnay, but this we owne and no more, that we gave leave to ſuch as could be hyred, &amp;c. to accompany La Tour and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to his owne place. And ſuch a permiſſion at this (though it were a commiſſion to this purpoſe) we ſtand ſtill to maintaine is no undertaking of warr, nor act of hoſtility, but a meere liberty of commerce, and if any blood ſhed ſhould follow upon it, it is accidentall and not depending uppon this as any cauſe of it. Nor is it any juſt provocation of warr, or any breach of peace, nor ſo accounted among civil ſtates. I ſhall cleare it by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two both private and public. If I have a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour within a few miles of me ſuſpected to be a robber, if I ſend my ſervant to beate him and he doth ſo, I am a treſpaſſer; if he kill him, I am a murderer. But if a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller comes by and tells me that he hath a chardge about him, and he is afraid to goe alone on his journey for feare of ſuch man, and deſires me to let my ſervant go with him (if he be willing) though it may be dangerous to his life, and may alſo prove danger to mee or mine from ſuch robber: And if the traveller be now ſett upon by this robber and my ſervant kills him, we may both juſtify it.</p>
               <p>I will give another inſtance. A merchant of Spaine being in London, by leave of the King of England, hires a London ſhip to tranſport him and his goods into Spaine; upon the way, a Holland man of war meetes and fights with him, and men are ſlaine on both ſides, yet without any breach of peace on either ſide, or any act of hoſtility in
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:011300_0067_0F86A01EA58C2EC0"/>
the King of England, as it would have beene if he had granted a commiſſion to aſſault the Hollander: So that you may ſee there is a wide difference betweene giveing commiſſion to fight and giveing leave to be hyred to guard or tranſport. So as you muſt needs have beene miſtaken in the right ſtatinge of the diſtinction, or elſe I cannot conceive what your apprehenſions ſhould be of the Engliſh and Iriſh and Scottiſh, who in ſo greate numbers, for theſe many years, have ſerved the States againſt the Spaniards, and the Spaniards againſt the States, the Swedes againſt the Emperor, and <hi>e contra,</hi> without any breach of the peace between thoſe nations. But, admit ſuch a permiſſion were againſt a rule of ſtate; yet, if that rule of ſtate be againſt the rule of charity, it will not be hard to judge which muſt give place. I will conclude this argument with that which I touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my former writing. That which is lawful for a private perſon to do, in the way of his calling, the magiſtrate (if he judge it expedient, or not hurtfull to the commonwealth) ought to furder, or not to hinder him in it. But it is lawful for the owners and maſters of ſhipps, and is in the way of their calling, to be hyred by La Tour, to convey him to his rightfull habitation, and we judge it no way hurtfull but advantagious to this commonwealth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we did well, according to the duty of our office, in yielding leave to them, and in not hindering them. And it is no ſufficient plea againſt it, to ſay that we know not the juſtice of his cauſe; for that will not concerne us in this caſe (and yet we do know it in good meaſure) But if our ſhipps ſhall be oppoſed in their lawfull courſe, the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their cauſe will lye in that: As for example: A man travaileing in a waggon in England, and carrying his goods with him, his creditor ſets upon the waggon to take his debtors goods from him by force, the waggoner may defend him and his goods, being now in his charge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to the former ingagement; for the juſtice of his cauſe ariſeth upon another ground. Neither is there any need to ſend to Daulnay before they goe (no, though they went of purpoſe to fight with him) for beſides divers
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:011300_0067_0F86A01EA58C2EC0"/>
examples in ſcripture to warrant the forbearance of it, the rule in Deut. 20.10. gives other direction: When thou comeſt <hi>neere to</hi> a city to fight againſt it, thou ſhalt ſend to offer peace, &amp;c. This point being thus cleared, that we have not enterpriſed any warre in this our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, all your complaints againſt us, and all your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments tending that way do fall to the ground. This is not the caſe, neither are we the men, and therefore I ſhall not need to examine your reaſons and allegations againſt ſuch; nor am I willing to mention theſe paſſadges wherein our power ſeemes to be ſo much ſlighted. I dare not believe that you intended all that is held forth in them. I looke at your queries alſo as raiſed upon the ſame miſtaken grounds, which being now cleared to you, you will eaſily reſolve yourſelves about them. And yet this I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to your conſideration, which may be a full anſwer to them all in the moſt knotty conſtruction, viz. If our brethren ſhould erre in theire way and thereby bring them ſelves into diſtreſſe, yet (if we muſt pardon them upon their repentance) ſure we may not deſert them, nor hide our eyes from theire miſery. If any of our confederates (through humane infirmity) ſhould, againſt their covenant, bring a juſt warre upon themſelves, yet if they call to us for helpe, and tender themſelves to equall ſatisfaction, we muſt not leave them to deſtruction. No relation amongſt men could ſtand or be uſefull, if meere errour (which we are all continually ſubject to) might diſſolve it, or obſtruct the vitall ſpirit which ſhould breathe in it.</p>
               <p>Whereas you object that, in this permiſſion, we make the ſtate but a cypher: I anſwer, the ſtate hath the ſame influence into this which it hath into other merchants voyages, by a general and implicit conſent, which may be ſufficient in ſo free a ſtate as ours is; where there is no reſtraint upon perſons or ſhips (but upon ſpeciall occaſion) they goe and come at their liberty.</p>
               <p>Now for the point of danger. I conceive, firſt, the rule of the Apoſtle Peter will hould even in this caſe; while we do well we are not to be frighted with any terrour. Againe, there is no courſe or voyage undertaken by us, but
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:011300_0068_0F86A01F22F96A38"/>
it may expoſe the undertakers to perill, and may occaſion diſpleaſure and danger to us from abroad; but ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have not hitherto deterred us from any probable way of our ſafety or advantage; nor have we ſuſtained any harme hitherto, by caſting ourſelves upon the Lord and his good providence, in ſuch caſes. I will remember you of ſome. When we firſt ſet up reformation in our church way, did not this expoſe us to as greate an hazard as we could run, both from abroad and at home? Did not our friends in England, many of them, forewarne us of it ere we came away? Did not others ſend letters after us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre us from it? Did not ſome among ourſelves (and thoſe no meane ones) inculcate our inevitable dangers at home, from no ſmall company left out of church fellowſhip, and civill offices, and freedome hitherto? Yet we truſted in God (though there appeared no meanes of ſafety) and went on our way; and the Lord hath ſtill preſerved us and fruſtrated all councells and attempts againſt us. Againe, when upon grievous complaints againſt us to the Lords of the Privy Counſel, of ſuch civil innovations amongſt us as we could not juſtify by the laws of that ſtate, a ſtrict order and command was ſent to us to deliver up our patent, or elſe to expect to have it fetched by force, what greater danger could be towards us than appeared in not obeying of this command? Yet we had then courage enough to returne an anſwer without our patent. When we undertooke a warre againſt the Pequots, which no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity put us upon, but only in point of conſcience (they had done us no injury) on others behalfe, there were more objections (in point of dangerous conſequences) againſt that, than againſt this; our friends of Plimouth complained of it, and wrote to us accordingly; ſo did our friends of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticot, laying forth the dangers we had expoſed them unto by it, wiſhing we had forborne to a fitter ſeaſon; but neither of them proteſting againſt it: Yet, in due time, the Lords hand appeared in it, to the good of the whole country, and we felt but little of thoſe great dangers which were juſtly to be feared. Our intelligence was believed, which we heard long ſince, and hath been more certainly

confirmed of late, that the jeſuitical State<note n="*" place="bottom">They were in great fear of the French when they ſettled, under Richlieu, at Port Royal and afterwards, when D'Aulnay came to Penobſcot. See <hi>Maſſa. Hiſtory, V.

In the treaty about our confederacie, the doubtful conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in England, the danger from a General Governor (eſpecially in regard of our brethren of Plimouth) the neceſſity of our being involved in the quarrel with the Dutch, on the behalfe of our brethren of Hartford, were taken notice of by the generall court and many of the elders, &amp;c. yet neither would the court be deterred from entring into that brotherly league, nor were our elders or people troubled with feare of thoſe dangers. And now, lately, when we received Pumham and Sawconoco in to our juriſdiction, the generall court conſidered how offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive it would be to the Naraganſets, and ſo likely to ingage us in a warre with them; yet, the thing being lawful and expedient for us, and giving hope of opening a doore to the converſion of ſome of them, they would not let ſlipp the opportunity of ſuch advantages, for the feare of doubtful dangers. More I might add: All amounts to this ſumme, the Lord hath brought us hither, through the ſwelling ſeas, through perills of pyrates, tempeſts, leakes, fires, rocks, ſands, diſeaſes, ſtarvings, and hath here preſerved us theſe many yeares from the diſpleaſure of Princes, the envy and rage of Prelates, the malignant plots of Jeſuits, the mutinous contentions of diſcontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the open and ſecret attempts of barbarous Indians, the ſeditious and undermineing practiſes of hereticall falſe brethren; and is our confidence and courage all ſwallowed up in the feare of one D'aulnay? Admit we ſhould have ſtepped aſide out of our way, doth the favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our God wholely depend upon our perfect walking? Were we never out of our way before, under all our former mercies and deliverances? Did Abraham,

Iſaack, Jacob, David, Jehoſaphat, the people of Iſrael, Judas, and others, never find protection and deliverance, when, by infirmity, they were found to be out of their way? If they did, why may not we ſtill ſeeke and hope for the like, ſeeing the Lords mercies indure for ever? For my part (if there were not other ſins, which God may have a controverſie with us for) I ſhould little feare any harme from this. If any breach were made in our peace, this is not the way to make it up. We may bring more diſpleaſure and danger upon ourſelves, by the diviſions and breaches of rule which may be occaſioned by our unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſtriveings about that which is now paſt remedie, than would otherwiſe ariſe from any miſcarriage in the buſines it ſelfe, in the worſt conſtruction that can be made thereof.</p>

               <p>THE moſt conſiderable part of the Engliſh colonies profeſſe they came into theſe parts of the world with deſire to advance the kingdome of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to enjoy his precious ordinances with peace; and (to his praiſe they confeſſe) he hath not failed theire expectation hitherto, they have found ſafety, warmth and refreſhing under his wings, to the ſatisfaction of theire ſoules. But they know and have conſidered that theire Lord and Maſter is King of righteouſnes and peace, that he gives anſwerable lawes, and caſts his ſubjects into ſuch a mould and frame, that (in theire weake meaſure) they may hould forth his vertues in theire courſe and carriage, not onely with the nations of Europe, but with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous natives of this wildernes. And accordingly, both in their treaties and converſe, they have had an awfull reſpect to divine rules, endeavouring to walke uprightly and inoffenſively, and in the middeſt of many injuries and inſolencies, to exerciſe much patience and long ſuffrance towards them.</p>
               <p>The Pequotts grew to an exceſſe of violence and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and proudly turned aſide from all wayes of juſtice and peace, before the ſword was drawne or any hoſtile attempts made againſt them. During thoſe warres, and after the Pequotts were ſubdued, the Engliſh colonies were carefull to continue and eſtabliſh peace with the reſt of the Indians, both for the preſent and for poſterity, as by ſeverall treatyes with the Narrowganſet and Mohiggin Sagamores may appeare. Which treaties, for a while,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:011300_0072_0F86A021DE2168D0"/>
were in ſome good meaſure duely obſerved by all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; but, of late, the Narrowganſets, and eſpecially the Nyanticks theire confederats, have many wayes injuriouſly broken and violated the ſame, by intertaineing and keeping amongſt them, not onely many of the Pequot nation, but ſuch of them as have had theire hands in the blood and murther of the Engliſh, ſeizing and poſſeſſing at leaſt a part of the Pequot country; which, by right of conqueſt, appertaines to the Engliſh; by allowing or harbouring and withhoulding ſeverall Pequot captives fled from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and making proud and inſolent returnes when they were redemanded. And, more lately, the Engliſh had manie ſtrong and concurrent Indian teſtimonies from Long Iſland, Uncoway, Hartford, Kinnibeck, and other parts, of Miantonimoes ambitious deſignes, travelling through all the plantations of the neighbouring Indians, and, by promiſes and gifts, labouring to make himſelfe their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Sagamore or commander, perſuadeing and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, at once, to cut off the whole bodie of the Engliſh in thoſe parts. Which treacherous plotts were confirmed by the Indians generall preparations in meſſages, inſolencies and outrages againſt the Engliſh and ſuch Indians as were ſubjects or friends to them; ſo that the Engliſh colonies, to theire greate charge and damage, were forced to arme, to keep ſtrong watch, day and night, and ſome of them to travell with convoyes from one plantation to another, and when Miantonimo, in his circular travell, was queſtioned at Newhaven concerneing theſe things, inſtead of other and better ſatisfaction, he threatned to cutt off any Indians head that ſhould lay ſuch a charge upon him to his face.</p>
               <p>The commiſſioners, by the premiſſes, obſerved Mianto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoes proud and treacherous diſpoſition, yet thought not fitt to proceed againſt him in that reſpect, till they had collected more legall and convinceing prooſe.</p>
               <p>But while theſe things were under deliberation, Mian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimo was brought priſoner by Uncas to Hartford, and the caſe being opened and cleared as followeth, he craved the commiſſioners adviſe how to proceed with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:011300_0073_0F86A02274C6C1E8"/>It appeared that in a treatie made with the Engliſh, at the Maſſachuſetts Anno 1637, Miantonimo engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not to fight with any of the Indians, and particularly not to invade Uncas without the Engliſh conſent; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a tripartite agreement made and concluded at Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford betwixt Miantonimo and Uncas with reference to the Engliſh, Anno 1638, in which one of the articles runns, That though either of the ſaid Indian Sagamores ſhould receive injury from the other, yet neither of them ſhall make or begin warre, untill they had appealed to the Engliſh, and till their grievances were firſt heard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and if either of them ſhould refuſe, the Engliſh might aſſiſt againſt, and compell the refuſeing and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate partie.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding which, Miantonimo and his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates have both forcibly and openly plotted and practiſed againſt the life of Uncas not at all acquainting the Engliſh or adviſing with them; but more eſpecially of late, ſince the forementioned plotts and deſignes were in hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Pequott Indian, one of Uncas his ſubjects, in the ſpring 1643, ayming at Uncas life, ſhot him with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row through the arme, and preſently fled to the Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſetts or their confederates, boaſting in the Indian plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that he had killed Uncas. But when it was known that Uncas (though wounded) was alive, the Pequot (taught as was ſuppoſed) changed his note, affirming that Uncas had cut through his owne arme with a flint, and had hired him to ſay he had ſhott and killed him.</p>
               <p>Miantonimo, being ſent for by the governour of the Maſſachuſetts upon another occaſion, brought this Pequott with him and would have covered him with the former diſguiſe, but when the Engliſh, out of his own mouth, found him guilty and would have ſent him to Uncas his Sagamore, Miantonimo earneſtly deſired he might not be taken out of his hands, promiſing he would ſend him ſafe to Uncas to be examined and puniſhed.</p>
               <p>But feareing (as it ſeems) his own treachery would be diſcovered in a day or twoe, he ſtopped the Pequotts mouth by cutting off his heade; but at parting he tould
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:011300_0073_0F86A02274C6C1E8"/>
the governour in diſcontent that he would come no more to Boſton.</p>
               <p>After this ſome attempts were made (as is reported) to take away Uncas life by poyſon, and by forcery; theſe faileing, ſome of Sequaſſons companie (an Indian Sagamore allyed unto and an intimate confederate with Miantonimo) ſhott at Uncas, with an arrow or two, as he was goeing downe Connecticut river.</p>
               <p>Uncas, according to the forementioned treatie (1638) complained, and the Engliſh, by mediation, ſought to make peace, but Sequaſſon expreſſing his dependance on Mian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimo refuſed, and choſe warre. They fought and Uncas had the victory.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Miantonimo, without any provocation from Uncas (unleſs the diſappointment of former plotts provoked) and ſuddenly, without denouncing warre, came upon the Moheg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with 900 or 1000 men, when Uncas had not halfe ſo many to defend himſelfe. Uncas, before the battle, tould Miantonimo that he had many wayes ſought his life, and for the ſparing of bloud offered by a ſingle combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves to end the quarrell. But Miantonimo preſuming upon his number of men, would have nothing but a battle. The iſſue fell contrary to expectation, his men were routed, divers of conſiderable note ſlaine, and himſelfe taken priſoner.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being duely weighed, the commiſſioners judged that Uncas could not be ſafe while Miantonimo lived: Wherefore, they thought he might juſtly put ſuch a treacherous and blood-thirſty enemy to death; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to doe it in his owne juriſdiction, without torture or cruelty.<note n="*" place="bottom">The beſt that can be ſaid of this advice is, that it was politick. Miantonimo was a man of great ſpirit. The Engliſh were in more fear of him than of any other Indian upon the continent.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And Uncas, having hitherto ſhewed himſelfe a friend to the Engliſh, and in this and former outrages (according to the treatie) craveing theire adviſe, if the Narrowganſetts or their confederates ſhould, for his juſt execution, unjuſtly aſſault him, the commiſſioners for the colonies promiſed to aſſiſt and protect him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:011300_0074_0F86A025A44C09B8"/>Uncas hereupon ſlew an ennemie, but not the enmity againſt him. The Narrowganſetts ſoon fell to new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements. They pretended they had payd a ranſome for theire Sachems life, and gave in particulars to the value of about fourty pounds. This, for a while, call an imputation of foule and unjuſt dealing upon Uncas: But, in September 1644, the Engliſh commiſſioners, meeting at Hartford, ſent for the Narrowganſett Sachems, or theire deputies, deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might be inſtructed to make good theire charge.</p>
               <p>Uncas came himſelfe; they ſent theire deputies. But after due examination it appeared, though ſome looſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had paſſed that, for ſuch quantities of waompum and ſuch parcells of other goods, to a greate value, there might have been ſome probability of ſpareing his life, yet no ſuch parcells were brought, and the Narrowganſett deputies did not alledge, much leſſe prove, that any ranſome was agreed, nor ſo much as any ſerious treatie begun to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme theire impriſoned Sachem; and as for the waom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum and goods ſent, as they were but ſmall parcells, and ſcarce conſiderable for ſuch a purpoſe, ſo they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by Miantonimo himſelfe, to ſundry perſons, for curteſies received during his impriſonment, and upon hope of further favour.</p>
               <p>The Narrowganſett deputies ſaw theire proofes fell farre ſhort of former pretences, and were ſilent. The commiſſioners promiſed that, upon better evidence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, they ſhould have due ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Whereupon a truce was made, and both parties were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged that all hoſtility ſhould ceaſe till planting time 1645, and after that they would give thirty dayes warning either at the Maſſachuſetts or Hartford before the truce ſhould ceaſe. Yet in February laſt, the Narrowganſetts by meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers ſent to Boſton, declared that unleſs Uncas would render 160 fadom of waompum, or come to a new heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within ſix weekes they would begin the warre.</p>
               <p>This croſſed the former agreement, and the ſeaſon was ſuch that neither the commiſſioners could be adviſed with, nor could Uncas travel if notice had been given. After which about or before planting time Tantaqueiſon a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hegin
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:011300_0074_0F86A025A44C09B8"/>
captaine who took Miantonimo priſoner was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and treacherouſly wounded, at night, as he ſlept in his wigwam, and other hoſtile arts were on both parts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in a private and underhand way, as they could take advantage one againſt the other.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Narrowganſetts have at ſeveral times open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invaded Uncas ſo that Connecticut and New-Haven were forced, according to ingagement, to ſend men from thoſe colonies for his preſent defence, but with expreſſe direction not to begin any offenſive warre againſt the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowganſetts or their confederates till further order.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, meſſengers were ſent to the Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſetts from the generall court in the Maſſachuſetts ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeing the commiſſioners meeteing, promiſing their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances ſhould be fully and juſtly heard; and requiring a ceſſation of warre in the meane time, but they refuſed; and heareing, probably, that the Engliſh from the Weſterne colonies were returned, they made a new aſſault upon Uncas, and have done him much hurt.</p>
               <p>The commiſſioners being met ſent meſſengers, the ſecond time, both to the Narrowganſetts and Moheggin Indians, minding them of the former treatie and truce, deſiring them to ſend their deputies inſtructed and furniſhed with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to declare and open the grounds of the warr, to give and receive due ſatisfaction, and to reſtore and ſettle peace.</p>
               <p>At firſt, the Narrowganſett Sachem gave a reaſonable faire anſwer, that he would ſend guides with them to the Moheggins, and if Uncas permitted he would ſend his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the commiſſioners, and, during eight dayes, hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhould ceaſe; but he ſoone repented of his moderation, tould the Engliſh meſſengers his mind was changed, ſent private inſtructions to the Nyantick Sachem, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of which there was nothing but proud and inſolent paſſages; the Indian guides which the Engliſh meſſengers brought with them from Pumham and Soconoco, were by frownes and threatning ſpeeches diſcouraged, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; no other guides could be obtained, though much preſſed; they knew (as they expreſſed themſelves) by the courſe held at Hartford the laſt yeare, that the commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:011300_0075_0F86A02639AD59B0"/>
would mediate and preſſe for peace, but they were reſolved to have no peace without Uncas his head, it mattered not who began the warre, they were reſolved to continue it; the Engliſh ſhould withdrawe theire gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon from Uncas, or they would take it as a breach of former covenants, and would procure as many Moquakes<note n="*" place="bottom">Maquas or Mohawks.</note> as the Engliſh ſhould affront them with; that they would lay the Engliſh cattle on heapes as high as theire houſes; that no Engliſh man ſhould ſtepp out of his houſe to piſſe, but he ſhould be killed.</p>
               <p>They reviled Uncas, charged him with cutting through his owne arme, and ſaying the Narrowganſetts had ſhott him; affirmed, that he would now murder the Engliſh meſſengers, as they went or returned, (if he had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) and lay it upon the Narrowganſetts.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh meſſengers, upon this rude and uncivill uſage, wanting guides to proceed, and fearing danger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Narrowganſetts, acquainted Peſicus with the former paſſages, and deſired guides from him, he (in ſcorne, as they apprehended it) offered them an ould Pequot ſquawe, but would afford no other guides. There alſo they conceived themſelves to be in danger, three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians with hatchets ſtanding behind the interpreter in a ſuſpicious manner, whilſt he was ſpeaking with Peſicus, and the reſt frowneing and expreſſing much diſtemper in theire countenance and carriage. The Engliſh meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, not hopeing for better ſucceſſe at that time, departed; telling Peſicus, that if he would returne any other anſwer, he ſhould ſend it to the Engliſh tradeing houſe, where they intended to lodge that night. In the morning, he invited them to returne, and promiſed them a guide to Uncas, but would grant no ceſſation of armes. When they came to Providence, they underſtood that, in their abſence, a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowganſett Indian had been there, and faineing himſelfe to be of Connecticot, ſpake in that dialect, but could not put off the Narrowganſett tone. He tould Benedict Arnolds wife (who well underſtands the Indian language) that the Engliſh meſſengers ſhould not paſſe to the Moheggins;
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:011300_0075_0F86A02639AD59B0"/>
he knew they ſhould have no guides, but ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in the woods, as they travelled towards Uncas.</p>
               <p>Thus the Engliſh meſſengers returned, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, under his hand and upon his oath, related the former paſſages, with others leſſe materiall, more largely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams, by the meſſengers, wrote to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, aſſureing them that the country would ſuddenly be all on fire, meaneing by warre; that, by ſtrong reaſons and arguments, he could convince any man thereof that was of another mind; that the Narrowganſetts had been with the plantations combined with Providence and had ſolemnly treated and ſettled a neutrality with them, which fully ſhewes their councells and reſolutions for warre.</p>
               <p>Thus while the commiſſioners, in care of the public peace, ſought to quench the fire kindled amongſt the Indians, theſe children of ſtrife breath out threatnings, provocations and warre againſt the Engliſh themſelves. So that unles they ſhould diſhonor and provoke God, by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating a juſt ingagement, and expoſe the colonies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and danger from the Barbarians, they cannot but exerciſe force, when no other meanes will prevaile, to reduce the Narrowganſetts and theire confederates to a more juſt and ſober temper.</p>
               <p>The eyes of other Indians, under the protection of the Maſſachuſetts and not at all ingaged in this quarrell, are (as they have expreſſed themſelves to the Engliſh meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) faſtned upon the Engliſh with ſtrict obſervation, in what manner and meaſure they provide for Uncas ſafety. If he periſh, they will charge it upon them, who might have preſerved him; and no Indians will truſt the Engliſh, if they now breake ingagement, either in the preſent or ſucceeding generations. If Uncas be ruined in ſuch a cauſe, they foreſee theire heads, upon the next pretence, ſhall be delivered to the will of the Narrowganſetts, with whom therefore they ſhall be forced to comply as they may, for theire future ſafety, and the Engliſh may not truſt an Indian in the whole country. The premiſſes being duely weighed, it clearely appeares that God calls the coloniſts to a warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:011300_0076_0F86A027089674B0"/>The Naraganſetts and theire confederates reſt on their numbers, weapons and opportunities to doe miſchief, and probably as of ould, Aſhur, Amalek, and the Philiſtines, with others, did confederate againſt Iſrael, ſo Satan may ſtirre upp and combine many of his inſtruments againſt the churches of Chriſt: But their Redeemer is the Lord of Hoaſtes, the mighty one in battaile, all the ſhieldes of the earth are in his hands, he can ſave by few or by weake meanes, as well as by many and greate.

               <p>WHEREAS you Sergeant Major Edward Gibbones are appointed commander in chiefe of all ſuch forces as are or ſhall be ſent forth of the ſeverall colonies, as by your commiſſion bearinge the date of theſe preſents doth more fully appeare, and whereas there is joyned to you by the ſame authority, as a councell of warre, divers of your chiefe officers, perſons of approved worth and fidelity, as in the ſaid commiſſion they are more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: And whereas the cauſe and ſcope of this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not onely to ayde the Moheggins, but to offend and invade the Narrowganſetts, Nyanticks, and other theire confederates, who, upon making warre upon Uncas the Moheggin Sachem, contrary to theire ingagements, are become as well our enemies as his: Yet it being the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of the commiſſioners, if it may be obtained with juſtice, honour and ſafety, to procure peace, rather than to proſecute warre; it is firſt commended to your good diſcretions to take any fitt occaſion, or (if with ſafety you may without any conſiderable delay or danger to your proceedings) to uſe meanes to drawe on ſuch a peace,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:011300_0078_0F86A02ADF968858"/>
which you have hereby power to treate and conclude, wherein you are to take due conſideration of the charges the colonies have expended in the warre, which you may eſtimate by the numbers of men ſent forth at ſeveral times, by their continuance abroad, with wages and proviſions appertaineing. And of the damage which Uncas hath ſuſtained ſince the warre began, wherein it were meete (if it may be done with conveniency) he were conſulted with, that both the colonies and he may receive juſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and repaire; which if the Narrowganſetts cannot preſently make, a conſiderable part may be paid in hand, and the reſt by a yearely tribute; but withall, according to our ingagements, you are to provide for Uncas his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſafety, that his plantations be not invaded, that his men and ſquawes may attend their planting, fiſhing and other occaſions, without feare or injury; and that Oſſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mekin, Pumham, Soconoco, Cutchamekin, and other Indians, friends or ſubjects to the Engliſh, be not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, which will diſturb the peace and draw on further charge and inconvenience. But a peace well framed will hardly be ſecured, unleſs either ſome of the chiefe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems deliver their ſoones as hoſtages, or that ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of theire country be yeelded to the Engliſh for plantations, wherein there may be forts built by the Engliſh and maintained (at leaſt in part) by a tribute from the Narrowganſetts, to ſecure the agreement. And it might probably conduce to the ſettling or preſerving of peace, if a trade were ſettled betwixt the colonies and them; by which they might be ſupplied with neceſſaries, but peeces and powder kept backe, which other traders furniſh them with. If you cannot conclude a peace with them, upon the termes above mentioned (to prevent greater inconvenience) you may abate ſomewhat of our charges, and of the damage Uncas hath ſuſtained: But much care muſt be taken to ſecure both our and his future peace, which, if it may be done by raiſing forts and keeping gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons in the Narrowganſett and Nyantick countries, at theire charge, though we require hoſtages as above, they may be reſtored when the fortifications are finiſhed and
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:011300_0078_0F86A02ADF968858"/>
theire payments made; and the articles are to be agreed and confirmed by the commiſſioners for the united colonies at theire next meeting, otherwiſe to be of no force. But if peace may not be obtained in ſuch a way as is before expreſſed, you are then with all prudent celerity to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute with force of armes the ſaid Narrowganſetts and Nyanticks, and all ſuch as ſhall aſſiſt them, until you may (through the Lords aſſiſtance) have ſubdued them or brought them to reaſon. And if the neceſſity of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhall require a further ayde of men or proviſions (be it one hundred, more or leſſe) upon your letters of adviſe to the Governors of the ſeverall colonies, ſupplies ſhall be ſpeedily ſent to you, according to the proportion agreed.</p>
               <p>You are to make faire warres, without exerciſing cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and not to put to death ſuch as you ſhall take captive, if you can beſtowe them without danger of your owne. You are to uſe your beſt indeavours to gaine the enemies canowes, or utterly to deſtroy them, and herein you may make good uſe of the Indians our confederates, as you may doe upon other occaſions, having due regard to the honour of God, who is both our ſword and ſhield, and to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is to be obſerved betwixt Chriſtians and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems ſtrange that men who profeſſed to believe that God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, ſhould ſo early and upon every occaſion, take care to preſerve this diſtinction.

All other of our countrymen, carrying themſelves peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and inoffenſively, ſhall be in peace by you, and if you have occaſion to make uſe of any of their boates or veſſels, cattle, proviſion or other goods, you ſhall be very tender of endamaging them, and you ſhall give them a ticket whereby they may receive due ſatisfaction from the colonies, or ſome of them.</p>

               <p>We doubt not but yourſelfe and your councell knowing well how precious the lives and healths of our men are among all our colonies, and how greate charge this warre is like to bring upon us, will be very careful in preſerving and huſbanding both to the beſt advantage; ſo as we ſhall not need to give you any inſtructions and directions about the ſame, but ſhall reſt ſatisfyed in the confidence we have of your wiſdome and faithfulnes to be improved, through the Lords aſſiſtance and bleſſing upon you, in this ſervice, for his owne glory and his peoples ſafety and proſperity in this wildernes.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Honored Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOURS I long ſince received in anſwer of my requeſt in behalf of my friend Mr. Sherley and thanke you for your readines herein. Sir, I had written to you long ſince, but the truth is I could neither have content in ſilence or writing, by reaſon of ſome unworthy paſſages in our laſt generall court, to the great offence of our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Mr. Prence, myſelfe, and ſundry others. In the middle of October we had two courts ſucceſſively, the firſt being the laſt ſeſſion of our election court, the other our ordinary quarter court, and both generall courts. Before either of theſe two, at a court of aſſiſtants, other things giving opportunity, the Governor, Mr. Collier, Capt. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, and myſelfe being there, took into conſideration a matter of great concernment, as we apprehended, and agreed mutually in the thing as neceſſary to propound it to the generall court, which was the laſt ſeſſion of our election court: Accordingly it was propounded, and after a whole daies agitation it was allowed and entred in the waſte booke, there being but one deputy againſt it, and he not direct; ſave onely, as he thought, it did not properly concerne that court. The next weeke, being in courſe another of our generall courts, came more of our magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that live remote and were not with us either at the court of aſſiſtants or the foregoing generall court, where this act was done; And after a tumultuous manner except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the entry of that order, as pernicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the weale of the government, with very many unſeemly termes concerning others, &amp;c. which exception of his was ſtrengthned by 3 other magiſtrates, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had joyned with us twice before and now againſt his own act, bat made beforehand by the firſt excepter as well as the other two and many of the deputies: They cried
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:011300_0080_0F86A02C8B78F748"/>
out to have it defaced and croſſed. The Governor Mr. Prence, and myſelfe, would not allow it, or any other act, (Mr. Collier being abſent to our greefe) to be defaced; but if hereafter it ſhould be found prejudiciall, it might be repealed by another act, but not otherwiſe. In briefe (for I am aſhamed to mention particulars, eſpecially to write them) a promiſe was made that it ſhould reſt till the next generall court and nothing be done in it: And then, when court and country had duly thought of it, if they thought meet to repeale it they might. After this, the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter having been obſerved to tender the view of a ſcroule from man to man, it came at length to be tendered to my ſelfe, and withall, ſaid he, it may be you will not like this. Having read it, I told him I utterly abhorred it as ſuch as would make us odious to all chriſtian commonweales: But at length he told the Governor he had a written propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be propounded to the court, which he deſired the court to take into conſideration, and according to order, if thought meet, to be allowed: To this the deputies were moſt made beforehand, and the other three aſſiſtants, who applauded it as their Diana; and the ſum of it was, To allow and maintaine full and free tollerance of religion to all men that would preſerve the civill peace and ſubmit unto government; and there was no limitation or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Turke, Jew, Papiſt, Arian, Socinian, Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laytan, Familiſt, or any other &amp;c. But our Governor and divers of us having expreſſed the ſad conſequences would follow, eſpecially myſelfe and Mr. Prence, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it was required, according to order, to be voted: But the Governor would not ſuffer it to come to vote, as being that indeed would eate out the power of godlines, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By this you may ſee that all the troubles of N. E. are not at the Maſſachuſets. The Lord in mercy looke upon us, and allay this ſpirit of diviſion that is creeping in amongſt us. You would have admired to have ſeen how ſweet this carrion reliſhed to the pallate of moſt of the deputies! What will be the iſſue of theſe things our all-ordering God onely knows. Only we know, without him
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:011300_0080_0F86A02C8B78F748"/>
it ſhall never be; and thats our greateſt comfort: But if he have ſuch a judgment for this place, I truſt, we ſhall finde (I ſpeake for many of us that groane under theſe things) a reſting place amongſt you for the ſoales of our feet.</p>
               <p>I had not thought to have been ſo long; but if you have heard of the particulars and the perſons, eſpecially the ringleader of this rout (if a rout might be in a lawfull aſſembly) by this generall you may gather the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the particulars. Thus, ſaluting you and all yours, deſireing my due reſpects may be tendered to your Governor, Mr. Endecott, Mr. Pelham, Mr. Bellingham, Mr. Saltonſtall, Mr. Nowell, Mr. Hibbins, and Mr. Flint, deſireing your prayers, take leave and remaine,</p>

A kind reſpective friend he hath beene to me, he ſaith he deſires correſpondencie with you off New-England, and many able to come hither, as by my letters may appeare; I may be miſtaken, but love thinks noe ill and yet not blind.</p>
               <p>I am here engaged to preach only for the preſent, the manner how I refer you to Mr. Wilſon, to whome I have wrote and Mr. Cotton.</p>
               <p>The iſland ſuites very well with my temper hitherto, through bountie, it is now and like to be very wealthy, full of ſugar, cotton, indigo, and ginger, ſome have made this yeare off one acre off canes about 4000 weight of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ordinarily 3000. Much drought now oppreſſeth, and I wonder, in the eye off argument, at Gods greate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſo profaine a people for ſwearing and drinking as the vulgar be. It muſt certenly, in my apprehenſion, be ſome ſtrong hand muſt reforme them.</p>
               <p>I would not be tedious to you. There hath this yeare beene brought over 3 commiſſions, one from the Earle of Warwicke and commiſſioners with him to command this government to profeſs themſelves for the parliament, and to lay aſide their neutralitie. But this they ſeem not to embrace, but have anſwered it thus, profeſſing their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to be ſerviceable to the kingdome, their honour for the parliament, but their yet allegiance to the King, therefore deſired to be ſpared a little till things be ſettled.</p>
               <p>There were one other for libertie of conſcience, that they have thus anſwered, that they are not unwilling not to preſs any mans conſcience in matters of ceremonie, only in regard there are many ſects that under pretence off liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may take occaſion to denie all ordinances, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Lords day, therefore this they would require of all, to come to the publick preaching, and that ſhall be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>There is a 3d, and that is to call the Governor and ſome off the Councill into queſtion for ſome pretended acts off injuſtice here paſt. And theſe things to be examined by inferiour perſons here, and that not off the beſt in matter of opinion, and that ſeems to exaſperate.</p>
               <p>

The magiſtrates are by pattent and election of the people, the ſtanding counſell of the commonwealth in the vacancie of the generall courte, and accordingly to act in all caſes according to the pattent (pertaining to government) and laws made by the ſaid generall courte of this juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This anſwer is grounded upon ſundry paſſages in the ſaid pattent, as p. 10. where it is ſaid that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:011300_0093_0F86A03B98AE2168"/>
Deputie Governor and Aſſiſtants ſhall apply themſelves to take care of the beſt diſpoſeing and ordering of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall affaires and buſineſſes of for and concerning the lands and premiſſes and the plantations thereof, and the government of the people there. Alſoe p. 11. it is ſaid that the Governor, Deputie Governor and Aſſiſtants, or anie number of them as is expreſſed, ſhall be a full and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient courte for the handling, ordering and diſpatching of all ſuch buſineſſes and occurrences as ſhall from time to time happen touching and concerning the ſaid company or plantation. And it is ſaid p. 12. that it is in the power of the generall courte to make laws and ordinances for the good and wellfare of the companie, and they may make and eſtabliſh wholeſome laws, ſtatutes and ordinances for the ſettling of the forms and ceremonies of government and magiſtracie, and for managing and ſettling all ſorts of officers, ſuperiour and inferiour, and for the diſtinguiſhing and ſetting forth the ſeverall duties, powers and limmitts in every ſuch office and place. 2dly. We doe not find that by the pattent they are expreſsly directed to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God, but we underſtand that by a law or libertie of the country, they may act in caſes wherein as yet there is no expreſſe law, ſoe that in ſuch acts they proceed according to the word of God.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. Whether the Governor and Aſſiſtants have anie power by pattent to diſpence juſtice in the vacancie of the generall courte, without ſome law or order of the ſame to declare the rule?</p>
               <p>A. We doe not find in this commonwealth now conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by this pattent that the Governor and Aſſiſtants have any power to diſpence juſtice in the vacancie of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall courte, without ſome law or order of the ſame, as the rule of theire adminiſtration, which we conceive were meete to be expreſſed for the regulateing of all particulars as far as may be, when ſuch cannot be ſupplyed by generall rules.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. Whether anie generall courte hath not power in particular caſes to chooſe any commiſſioners, either aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants or freemen, exempting all others, to give theire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:011300_0093_0F86A03B98AE2168"/>
to ſett forth theire power and places by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe, we meane in all things, and in thoſe of all the officers the commonwealth ſtands in need of between elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and election, not taking away the peoples liberties in election, nor turneing out any officer ſoe elected by them without ſhewing cauſe?</p>
               <p>A. If the tearmes (all thinges) intend or imply all caſes of conſtant judicature and counſell, we anſwer negatively, viz. that the generall courte hath not power by pattent in all caſes to chooſe anie officers, as commiſſioners, either aſſiſtants or freemen, exempting that is excluding all others, to give them commiſſion, to ſet forth theire power and places, becauſe it would then follow, that the magiſtrates might be excluded from all caſes of conſtant judicature and counſell which are theire principall worke, whereby alſoe the end of the peoples election would be made fruſtrate. 2dly. But if theſe tearms (all things) imply and intend caſes, whether occaſionall or other, belonging neither to conſtant judicature nor counſell, we anſwer affirmatively, viz. The generall courte hath power by pattent in ſuch particular caſes to chooſe anie officers and commiſſioners, either aſſiſtants or freemen, exempting all others, to give them commiſſion, to ſett forth theire power and places, which yet we underſtand with this diſtinction, viz. that if the affaires committed to ſuch officers or commiſſioners be of generall concernment, we conceive the freemen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pattent are to chooſe them, the generall courte to ſett forth theire power and places; but if the affaires committed to ſuch officers or commiſſioners be meerely of particular concernment, then we conceive the generall courte may both chooſe them and ſett forth theire power and places. Whereas we give places of conſtant judicature and counſell to the magiſtrates, we thus interpret the word (counſell) Counſell conſiſts of care and action; in reſpect of care they are not to be limited, in reſpect of action they are to be limited by the generall courte as the ſupreme counſell. Finally, it is our humble requeſt that if anie difference grow in the generall courte betweene
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:011300_0094_0F86A03C13E2B2C0"/>
magiſtrates and deputies, either in theſe or anie the like weighty caſes which cannot be preſently iſſued with mutual peace, then both parties will be pleaſed to deferre the ſame to further deliberation, for the honour of God and of the courte.</p>
               <p>Q. 1. Whether the deputies in general courte have judiciall and magiſtraticall authoritie?</p>
               <p>Q. 2. Whether by pattent the generall courte, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of magiſtrates and deputies, as a generall courte, have judiciall and magiſtraticall authoritie?</p>
               <p>A. 1. The pattent in expreſſe words giveth full power and authoritie, as to the governor and aſſiſtants ſoe to the freemen alſoe aſſembled in generall courte, p. 11. 2dly, Whereas there is a 3 fold power of magiſtraticall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, legiſlative, judicative, and conſultative or directative, of the publique affaires of the commonwealth, for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and protection. The 1ſt of theſe, namely, legiſlative, is expreſſely given to the freemen joyntly with the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and aſſiſtants, p. 12. Conſultative or directative power of the publique affaires of the commonwealth, for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and protection, is alſo granted by the pattent unto the freemen as to the governor and aſſiſtants, p. 13. But now for the judicature, if we ſpeake of the conſtant and uſuall adminiſtration hereof, we doe not find that it is granted to the freemen or deputies in the generall courte, either by the pattent or by the election of the people, or by anie law of the country. But if we ſpeake of the occational adminiſtration thereof we find the power of judicature adminiſtrable by the freemen joyntly with the governor and aſſiſtants, upon a double occaſion, 1. In caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or delinquency of a magiſtrate we find the whole generall courte of governor, deputy governor, aſſiſtants and freemen may proceed to remove him, p. 12. 2dly. If by the law of the countrey there lye anie appeale to the general courte or any other ſpecial cauſes referred to theire judgement, it will neceſſarily inferre that in ſuch caſes, by ſuch laws, the freemen joyntly with the governor
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:011300_0094_0F86A03C13E2B2C0"/>
and aſſiſtants have power of judicature touching the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeants and cauſe, the appeale and thoſe reſerved caſes. What we ſpeake of the power of freemen, the ſame may be ſaid of deputies, ſoe far forth as the power of the freemen is delegated to them by order of law.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. Whether we may warrantably preſcribe penalties to offences which may probably admitt of variable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of guilt?</p>
               <p>Q. 4. Whether a judge be bound to pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as a poſitive law preſcribes, in caſe it be apparently above or beneath the merit of the offence?</p>
               <p>A. 1. Certaine penalties may and ought to be preſcribed to capitall crimes, although they may admitt variable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of guilt, as in caſe of murder upon prepenſed malice and upon ſudden provocation there is preſcribed the ſame death in both, though murder upon a prepenſed malice be a farre greater guilt than upon ſudden provocation, <hi>Num.</hi> 35, 16, 17, 18. with ver. 20 21. alſoe in crimes of leſſe guilt, as in theift, though ſome theift be of greater guilt than other (as for ſome men to ſteale a ſheepe that hath leſſe nede is of greater guilt than for another who hath more nede) the Lord preſcribed one ſame meaſure of reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to both, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1. 2dly, In caſe variable circumſtances of an offence doe ſoe much varie the degrees of guilt, as that the offence is raiſed to a higher nature, then the penaltie muſt be varied to an higher anſwerable proportion; the ſtrikeing of a neighbour may be puniſhed with ſome pecuniary mulct, when the ſtrikeing of a father may be puniſhed with death; ſoe any ſin committed with an hie hand, as the gathering ſticks of the Sabbath day may be puniſhed with death, when a leſſer puniſhment might ſerve for gathering ſticks privily and in ſome need. 3dly, In caſe circumſtances doe ſoe varie a ſinne as that many ſinnes are complicated and wrapped up in it, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie is to be varied according to the penaltie of thoſe ſeverall ſinnes. A ſingle lye may be puniſhed with a leſſe mulct than if it be tould before the judgement ſeate, or
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:011300_0095_0F86A03CB81F1890"/>
elſewhere to the damage of any perſon, whether in his good name by ſlander, or in his eſtate by detriment in his commerce, in which caſe a lye aggravated by circumſtances is to be puniſhed with reſpect both to a lye and a ſlander, and to the detriment which another ſuſtaineth thereby. 4thly, In caſe that the circumſtances, which varie the degrees of guilt, concerne only the perſon of the offender (as whether it were his firſt offence, or cuſtomarie, whether he was inticed thereto or the inticer, whether he was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall or acceſſary, whether unadviſed or wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, &amp;c.) there it were meete that the penaltie ſhould be expreſſed with a latitude, whereof the loweſt degree to be expreſſed, ſuppoſe 5<abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> or as the caſe may be 5 ſtripes, and the higheſt degree 20<abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> or 40<abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> or ſtripes more or leſs, within which compaſs or latitude it may be free to a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to aggravate or mitigate the penaltie as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances doe require or alleviate the offence. Yet we would have care be taken that a magiſtrate attend in his ſentence to a certaine rule, as much as may be in thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, leſt ſome perſon whoſe ſins be alike circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated with another, if his puniſhment be not equall the one with the other, one may thinke himſelfe more unequally dealt withall than another. 5thly, In thoſe caſes wherein a judge is perſwaded in conſcience that a crime deſerved a greater puniſhment than the law inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he may lawfully pronounce ſentence according to the preſcript penaltie of the law, becauſe he hath noe power committed to him by law to goe higher; but where the law may ſeem to the conſcience of the judge to inflict a greater penalty than the offence deſerveth, it is his part to ſuſpend his ſentence till by conferrence with the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers he hath liberty, either to inflict the ſentence or to mitigate it. 6thly, The penalties of great crimes may be ſometimes mittigated by ſuch as are in cheife power, which in this country is the generall courte, out of reſpect to the publique good ſervices which the delinquent hath done to the ſtate in former times; ſo Solomon mittigated the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:011300_0095_0F86A03CB81F1890"/>
of Abiathar for his ſervice done to his father formerly, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.26, 27.</p>
               <p>Q. 1. Whether the diſtinction of power and authoritye in magiſtrates, and only libertie of counſell in the people, be according to the pattent, with reſpect of the magiſtrates and deputies in the generall court?</p>
               <p>A. We conceive by the pattent, as the people have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of counſell, ſoe they have alſoe other power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as we have expreſſed in our anſwer to the two firſt queſtions ſent unto us by our honoured magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. Whether the generall courte, conſiſting of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and deputies, be not the chiefe power of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and to deſcribe the power of magiſtracy, and to preſcribe laws to all, and doe all other acts which belong to ſuch a power?</p>
               <p>A. The generall courte, conſiſting of magiſtrates and deputies, is the chiefe civill power of this commonwealth, ſoe as to preſcribe the power of magiſtracy and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in a civill way lawes unto all, not repugnant unto the lawes of God, nor to the pattent, nor to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall lawes and liberties eſtabliſhed in this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and accordingly may doe all other acts which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to ſuch a power, as namely, both acts of counſell tending to the proviſion and protection and wellfare of the whole body, and alſoe acts of judgement, ſoe far as (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our anſwer to the two former queſtions of our honoured magiſtrates) is by the pattent or choice of the people or lawes of the commonwealth reſerved to them and ſeated in them.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. Whether our government be a pure ariſtocracie or mixt with a democracie? If mixt, whether it ſhould not be mixt in all the adminiſtrations of the ſame?</p>
               <p>A. 1. Our government is not a meere ariſtocracy, but mixt of an ariſtocracy and democracy, in reſpect of the generall courte. 2dly, Notwithſtanding it be mixed in the generall courte, yet it followeth not neceſſary thereupon,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:011300_0096_0F86A03D84B830E0"/>
that it ſhould be mixed in all other courtes and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, becauſe our forme (as all other formes of civill government) is the ordinance of man, therefore as it was free to make it mixed or ſimple, ſoe alſoe to make it mixed in the generall courte and united in others accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pleaſures of the ordeiners thereof. Accordingly our pattent, notwithſtanding it hath made our government mixed in reſpect of the generall courte, yet it ſeemes to have inſtituted ſubordinate adminiſtrations of juſtice to be ariſtocratically diſpenſed by the courte of aſſiſtants; yet even in theſe courtes there is ſome place for a democratical diſpenſation in reſpect of the jurors.</p>
               <p>It was voted that all the anſwers given in by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Elders to the ſeverall queſtions, were approved juſt and true anſwers to ſatisfaction, except ſuch as are not put to vote.</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. That the aſſiſtants have noe power to act in judicature without ſome law of the generall courte to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the rule.</p>
               <p>Elders. That the aſſiſtants have noe power to act in judicature without ſome law, either particularly expreſſed, or in generall tearms, in defect thereof, enacted by the generall courte as the rule of their adminiſtrationes.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. That the generall court conſiſting of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and deputies is the chiefeſt power of this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and may act in all things belonging to ſuch a power concerning counſell and judicature, namely for making laws, receiving appeals, queſtioning and ſentencing the higheſt officers, and conſulting about the weightieſt affaires of the common wealth and in all other caſes which in their wiſdome they thinke meet to take cognizance of.</p>
               <p>Elders. That the general court conſiſting of magiſtrates and deputies is the chiefeſt power of this common wealth, and may act in all things belonging to ſuch a power, both concerning counſell in conſulting about the weighty
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:011300_0096_0F86A03D84B830E0"/>
affairs of this common wealth and concerning lawes, alſoe concerning judicature in orderly impeaching, ſentanceing and removing officers, even the higheſt according to law, likewiſe in receiving appeales, whether touching civill or criminall caſes wherein appeales are or ſhall be allowed by the generall court.</p>
               <p>Prop. 3. That the magiſtrate hath not power to vary from the penalties of any law either to mitigate or exceed the ſame.</p>
               <p>Elders. That the magiſtrate hath not power to vary from the penaltie of any law either to mitigate or exceed the ſame without conſent of the general court.</p>
               <p>Prop. 4. That the patent in expreſſe words giveth full power and authority as to the governor and aſſiſtants ſoe to the freemen alſo aſſembled in general court.</p>
               <p>Elders. That the patent in expreſſe words giveth full power and authority as to the governor and aſſiſtants ſoe to the freemen alſo aſſembled in general court, or thus, that the full power which is preſcribed by the patent and graunted by the general court is not only to the governor and aſſiſtants, but alſo to the freemen there aſſembled and acting with common conſent.</p>
               <p>Prop. 5. That certaine penalties may and ought to be preſcribed in caſes although the offences admit of variable degrees of guilt.</p>
               <p>Elders. That certaine penalties may and ought to be preſcribed in caſes although the offences admit of variable degrees of guilt.</p>

The Remonſtrance and humble Petition of us whoſe names are underwritten, in behalfe of ourſelves and divers others within this juriſdiction, humbly ſheweth,</opener>
               <p>THAT we cannot but with all thankfulnes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your indefatigable paines, continuall care and conſtant vigilancy, which, by the bleſſing of the Almighty, hath procured unto this wilderneſs the much deſired fruits of peace and plenty: While our native land, yea the chriſtian world, is ſharply afflicted with the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſword and the ſad conſequents of inteſtine wars. And further, that you whom the Lord hath placed at the helme of theſe plantations and endowed with eminent gifts fitt for ſuch honourable callings, are beſt able to foreſee the clouds which hang over our heads, the ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts which threaten this poor handfull here planted, and timouſly to amend them. Notwithſtanding thoſe who are under decks, being at preſent unfit for higher employments, may perceive thoſe leaks which will inevitably ſink this weake and ill compacted veſſell, if not by your wiſdomes opportunely prevented. We who, in behalfe of ourſelves and divers of our Countrymen, laying our hands upon our breaſts and ſeriouſly conſidering that the hand of our good God, who through his goodneſſe hath ſafely brought us and ours through the great ocean and planted us here, ſeems not now to be with us, yea rather againſt us, blaſting all our deſigns, though contrived with much deliberation, undertaken with great care, and proceeding with more than ordinary probability of ſucceſsfull events, by which many of
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:011300_0097_0F86A03E6D41F3E8"/>
good eſtates are brought to the brink of extreame poverty, yea at this time laying his juſt hand upon our familyes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many away to himſelf, ſtriking others with unwonted malignant ſickneſſes, and with ſome ſhameful diſeaſes, have thought it convenient with all reſpectiveneſſe to preſent theſe our ſincere requeſts and remonſtrances to this honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed court, hoping we have found out thoſe ſpeciall leaks, which concurring with many and great ſins of this place (which our conſciences know and our brethren of England are not ignorant of) are the ſpeciall cauſes of the Lords turning his face from us, leaving us to ourſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to ſtrife, contention, unfaithfulneſſe, idlenes, and of lamentable faylings, not bleſſing us in any of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, ſo as to give us any great hopes of ſtaple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and conſequently of comfortable ſubſiſtance, though we, to the utmoſt of our power, theſe many years, even to the exhauſting of our eſtates and ſpirits, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured the ſame; but contrariwiſe, all things grow worſe and worſe, even to the threatning (in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) of no leſs than ſmall ruine; not doubting but you will receive them with the ſame candour of mind which we, not ayming at novelty or diſturbance, but at the glory of God, our allegiance to the ſtate of England, and good of theſe poor plantations (if our hearts deceive us not) preſent them unto you, though for want of ſkill and other neceſſary helpe roughly drawn up; and hope that you will be more diligent in amending than we in ſearching out the cauſes of theſe our preſent calamities, &amp;c. Not to trouble you who are employed in the moſt ſerious affairs of theſe plantations with many words, we ſhall briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them to theſe heads, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas this place hath been planted by the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, next under God, of letteris patents given and granted by his Majeſty of England to the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with many privileges and immunities, viz. Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a company, liberty of chooſing governors, ſetling government, making lawes not repugnant to the lawes of England, power of adminiſtring the oath of allegiance to
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:011300_0098_0F86A03F9F137990"/>
all, &amp;c. as by the ſaid letters patents more largely appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Notwithſtanding, we cannot, according to our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſcerne a ſetled forme of government according to the lawes of England, which may ſeeme ſtrange to our countrymen, yea to the whole world, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are all Engliſh. Neither do we ſo underſtand and perceyve our owne lawes or libertyes, or any body of lawes here ſo eſtabliſhed, as that thereby there may be a ſure and comfortable enjoyment of our lives, libertyes, and eſtates, according to our due and naturall rights, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne ſubjects of the Engliſh nation. By which, many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences flow into plantations, viz. jealouſies of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing arbitrary government, which many are prone to beleeve, conſtruing the procraſtination of ſuch ſetled lawes to proceed from an overgreedy ſpirit of arbitrary power (which it may be is their weaknes) ſuch proceedings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deteſtable to our Engliſh nation, and to all good men, and at preſent a chief cauſe of the inteſtine warre in our deare country: Further, it gives cauſe to many to thinke themſelves hardly dealt with, others too much favored, and the ſcale of juſtice too much bowed and unequally bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced: From whence alſo proceedeth feares and jealouſies of illegall committments, unjuſt impriſonments, taxes, rates, cuſtomes, levyes of ungrounded and undoing aſſeſſments, unjuſtifiable preſſes, undue fynes, unmeaſurable expences and charges, of unconceyvable dangers through a negative or deſtructive vote unduly placed, and not well regulated, in a word, of a non certainty of all things we enjoy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lives, liberties or eſtates; and alſo of undue oaths, being ſubject to expoſition, according to the will of him or them that gives them, and not according to a due and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowed rule of law, which is the true interpreter of all oathes to all men, whether judge or judged.</p>
               <p>Wherefore our humble deſire and requeſt is, that you would be pleaſed to conſider of our preſent condition and upon what foundation we ſtand, and unanimouſly concurr to eſtabliſh the fundamentall and wholeſome lawes of our native country, and ſuch others as are no wayes repugnant

Neither can we tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord hath bleſt many in theſe parts with ſuch eminent politicall gifts, ſo as to contrive better lawes and cuſtomes than the wiſeſt of our nation have with great conſideration compoſed, and by many hundred yeares ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience have found moſt equall and juſt; which have procured to the nation much honour and renowne amongſt ſtrangers, and long peace and tranquility amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

Whereas there are many thouſands in theſe planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the Engliſh nation, freeborne, quiett and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, righteous in their dealings, forward with hand, heart and purſe, to advance the publick good, knowne friends to the honorable and victorious Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lovers of their nation, &amp;c. who are debarred from all civill imployments (without any juſt cauſe that we know) not being permitted to bear the leaſt office (though it cannot be denyed but ſome are well qualifyed) no not ſo much as to have any vote in chooſing magiſtrates, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains or other civill and military officers; notwithſtanding they have here expended their youth, borne the burthen of the day, waſted much of their eſtates for the ſubſiſtence of theſe poore plantations, paid all aſſeſſments, taxes, rates, at leaſt equall, if not exceeding others, yea when the late warre was denounced againſt the Narrowganſet Indians, without their conſent, their goods were ſeized on for the ſervice, themſelves and ſervants eſpecially forced and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to ſerve in that warre, to the hazarding of all

things moſt dear and near unto them, whence iſſue forth many great inconveniences, ſecret diſcontents, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, rents in the plantations, diſcouragements in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, unſettlednes in their minds, ſtrife, contention, and the Lord only knows to what a flame in time it may kindle; alſo jealouſies of too much unwarranted power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on the one ſide, and of perpetual ſlavery and bondage on the other, and which is intollerable, even by thoſe who ought to love and reſpect them as brethren.</p>
               <p>We therefore deſire that civill liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truely Engliſh, equall to the reſt of their countrymen, as in all plantations is accuſtomed to be done, and as all freeborne enjoy in our native country; (we hoping here in ſome things to enjoy greater liberties than elſewhere, counting it no ſmall loſſe of liberty to be as it were baniſhed from our native home, and enforced to lay our bones in a ſtrange wildernes) without impoſing any oathes or covenant on them, which we ſuppoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be warranted by the letters patent, and ſeeme not to concur with the oath of allegiance formerly enforced on all, and later covenants lately impoſed on many here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by the honorable houſes of parliament, or at leaſt to detract from our native country and lawes, which by ſome are ſtiled foreign, and this place termed rather a free ſtate, than a colonie or corporation of England; all of us being very willing to take ſuch oathes and covenants as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our deſires of advanceing the glory of God and good of this place, and of our dutyes to the ſtate of England, and love to our nation, being compoſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the lawes and cuſtomes of other corporations of England; but all of us are exceeding unwilling by any pollicies whatſoever to be rent from our native country, though far diſtant from it, valuing our free derivations, the immunities and privileges which we and our poſterity doe and we hope ſhall alwayes enjoy above the greateſt honors of this country, not cemented to the ſtate of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and glory to be accounted though but as ruſhes of that land, yet that we may continue to write that we and

Further, that none of the Engliſh nation, who at this time are too forward to be gone, and very backward to come hither, be baniſhed, unles they break the known lawes of England in ſo high a meaſure, as to deſerve ſo high a puniſhment; and that thoſe few that come over may ſettle here without having two magiſtrates hands, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not being poſſible to obtain, hath procured a kind of baniſhment to ſome, who might have been ſerviceable to this place, as they have been to the ſtate of England, &amp;c. And we likewiſe deſire that no greater puniſhments be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon offenders than are allowed and ſett by the laws of our native country.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas there are diverſe ſober, righteous and godly men, eminent for knowledge and other gracious gifts of the holy ſpirit, no wayes ſcandalous in their lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, members of the church of England (in all ages famous for piety and learning) not diſſenting from the lateſt and beſt reformation of England, Scotland, &amp;c. yet they and their poſterity are deteined from the ſeales of the covenant of free grace, becauſe, as it is ſuppoſed, they will not take theſe churches covenants, for which as yet they ſee no light in Gods word; neither can they clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what they are, every church having their covenant differing from anothers, at leaſt in words: Yea ſome churches ſometime adding, ſometime detracting, calling it ſometimes the covenant of grace, ſometimes a branch of it, ſometimes a profeſſion of the free covenant, &amp;c. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are compelled, under a ſevere fine, every

Whence, as we conceive, doe abound an ocean of inconveniencies, diſhonor to God and to his ordinances, little profit by the miniſtry, encreaſe of anabaptiſme, and of thoſe that totally contemne all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as vaine, fading of chriſtian graces, decreaſe of brotherly love, hereſies, ſchiſmes, &amp;c. the whole body of the members of the church of England, like ſheep ſcattered in the wildernes, without a ſhepherd, in a forlorn condition.</p>
               <p>We therefore humbly intreat you, in whoſe hands it is to help and whoſe judicious eyes diſcern theſe great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, for the glory of God and the comfort of your brethren and countrymen, to give liberty to the members of the church of England, not ſcandalous in their lives and converſations (as members of theſe churches) to be taken into your congregation and to enjoy with you all thoſe liberties and ordinances Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, and into whoſe name they are baptiſed, that the Lord may be one and his name one amongſt us in this place; that the ſeales of the covenant may be applied to them and their poſterity, as we conceive they ought to be, till incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences hereby be found prejudiciall to the churches and colony (which we hope ſhall never be) not doubting but the ſame chriſtian favour will be ſhewed to all its members of theſe churches, when they ſhall retire to our dear native country (if their converſations be righteous and holy) or otherwiſe to grant liberty to ſettle themſelves here in a church way, according to the beſt reformations of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland, if not, we and they ſhall be neceſſitated to apply our humble deſires to the honourable houſes of parliament, who we hope will take our ſad conditions into

               <p>Theſe things being granted, by the bleſſing of God to us in Chriſt, we hope to ſee the now contemned ordinances of God highly prized, the goſpell much darkned, break forth as the ſun at noon day, chriſtian charity and brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, almoſt frozen, wax warm, zeal and holy emulation more fervent, jealouſy of arbitrary government (the bane of all common wealths) quite baniſhed, the wicked, if any ſuch be found, in their courſes diſheartned, the righteous actors in their wayes encouraged, ſecret diſcontents fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting like cankers, remedied, merchandiſing and ſhipping by ſpeciall providence waſted, ſpeedily encreaſed, mines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with more chearfulnes, fiſhing with more forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, huſbandry now withering forthwith flouriſhing, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and plantations much deſerted preſently more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, all mechanicall trades the great enriching of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths heartily going on, ſtaple commodities the life of trade preſently raiſed, our almoſt loſt credit regayned, our brethren of Englands juſt indignation and their force as a poſt flying from us turned to embrace us, the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able houſes of parliament patrons of piety under their wings in theſe dangerous times with alacrity ſhrowding us, the privileges and immunities which we and ours enjoy in our native land more firmly ſettled, forreign enemies day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatning totally diſcouraged, unſettled men now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding firmly planted, that the proſperity of England may not be the ruine of this plantation but the contrary, hands, hearts and purſes now ſtreightned freely opened for public and honorable ſervices, ſtrife and contention now rife abated, taxes and ſeſſes lightned, the burthens of the ſtate but pleaſure, &amp;c.

               <head>A Declaration of the General Court holden at Boſton 4 (9) 1646. concerning a Remonſtrance and Petition exhibited at laſt Seſſion of this Court by Doctor Child, Thomas Fowle, Samuel Maverick, Thomas Burton, John Smith, David Yale, and John Dand.</head>
               <p>IN this Petition and Remonſtrance (as they call it) which is the firſt of the ſorte that we have received, and (as we conceive) without preſident in any plantation or eſtabliſhed commonwealth, as will appear by the ſmale cauſe of ſuch remonſtrance, and as little reaſon for what is petitioned. We firſt obſerve the ſolemne and religious profeſſion they make of the ſincerity and ſingleneſs of their end in reſpect of the glory of God and the good of this colonie, which we have reaſon to be jealous of with a godly jealouſie, when we conſider what connexion and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity there is betweene ſuch greate and glorious ends and the purſuit they make in their remonſtrance, ſo far from truth and righteouſneſs, together with the means they have propounded for attaining the fame. We therefore wiſh them well and deeply to conſider that they have herein to doe with him by whom actions are weighed, whoſe eyes
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:011300_0101_0F86A0438037F438"/>
are like a flame of fire, who will make all the churches knowe that he ſearcheth the heart and the reines, and will render to every one of them according to theire workes. It were a dreadful dareing preſumption, if the bleſſed name of the moſt high God (whoſe honor is ſo oft avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be theire ayme in this deſigne) ſhould be made to ſerve a corrupt project. The next thing we obſerve is, a divine over-ruling hand leadinge them to a cleare acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of that truth which cutts the ſinewes of theire remonſtrance, and juſtifies our government and all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations thereof, againſt all that reproach and blame they endeavour after to caſt upon it. The words are theſe, We cannot but with all thankfulnes acknowledge your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable paines, continuall care and conſtant vigilance, which (by the bleſſing of the Almighty) hath procured unto this wildernes the moſt deſired fruites of peace and plenty; whilſt our native land (yea the chriſtian world) is ſharpely afflicted, &amp;c. From which words we inferre theſe 4 propoſitions. 1. The government eſtabliſhed in this colonie (by the bleſſing of the Lord) hath beene diſpenced and adminiſtred, from the firſt to laſt, with a ſpeciall and eminent meaſure of care and watchfullnes upon all occaſions. 2dly, By the bleſſing of the Lord, the government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and adminiſtred as aforeſaid, hath beene a procuring cauſe of peace and plentie to this colonie. 3dly, By the bleſſing of the Lord, the government eſtabliſhed as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and the good effects thereof have beene graunted to us in this wildernes, and that at ſuch a ſeaſon, while not only our native country, but the chriſtian world, are ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſited and afflicted with contrary evills (we may ſay in this caſe with aſtoniſhment, Not unto us, Lord, but to thy name be the praiſe, we confeſſe it is our ſhame (we deſire it may be alſo our ſorrow) that we have not rendered to the Lord according to his great goodnes.) 4thly, The Petitioners (by theire owne confeſſion) have not only no cauſe to blame this government, or the adminiſtration or effects thereof, but are bound with all thankfulnes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the good fruites thereof, as wherein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have had theire ſhare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:011300_0102_0F86A044353E0528"/>Theſe foure propoſitions (allowing to the firſt of them that which humane frailty calls for) are (as we conceive) no leſſe evident in the truth of them than in theire depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the petitioners owne words. Yet we obſerve 3dly, How they ſometimes ſende forth ſweete water and bitter. For in the following paſſages they ſpeake of leakes, which (they ſay) will inevitablie ſinke this weake and ill-compacted veſſell, which they wholly impute to the evills of our government, civill and eccleſiaſticall, both in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and effects thereof. And though in the ſaid propoſitions, they make us monuments of mercie, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us above our native country, yea above the chriſtian world; yet, in the concluſion they affirme the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; houlding us forth as the ſcumme and off-ſcouring, ſuch as our brethren in England, in their juſt indignation, avoyde as a peſt, which they wholely aſcribe to the evills of our government. They highly commend the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this government, and yet complaine of an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, deteſtable (as they ſay) to our Engliſh nation and to all good men. They commend this government in reſpect of care and watchfulnes; and yet they ſpeake of many ſheepe in this wildernes without ſhepheard, in a forlorne condition. They largely acknowledge the good effects of this government; and yet cry out of intollerable ſlavery and bondage. They commend it in reſpect of peace and plenty; and yet they ſpeake of diſcontents fretting like cancers, of merchants waſteing, of huſbandry wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of villages and plantations much deſolated, and that all buſines both in church and commonwealth have ſeemed to go backward, and that for many year. They commend it in reſpect of peace; and yet affirme they have no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theire lives and liberties, but are under a non cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all they enjoy. They commend it in reſpect of peace; and yet ſpeake of contentions, readie to breake out into a fearful flame, blameing the government as the cauſe thereof. They commend it in reſpect of plenty; yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe they are brought to the brinke of extreame poverty, ſo as they beg of the parliament ſome help for tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:011300_0102_0F86A044353E0528"/>
to ſome other place. They profeſſe they owe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment with all thankfulnes for what they here enjoy; and yet affirme that by reaſon of unjuſtifiable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded and undue taxes impoſed on them, they are in worſe condition than the natives themſelves. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſuch acknowledgment as aforeſaid; and yet affirme that they are in ſuch a place, where they cannot live like chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Theſe petitioners fabricke being thus overthrowne by theire owne confeſſion and manifeſt contradictions, we might have throwne out theire petition, as not worthie our further trouble, but leſt they ſhould pretend, that theire ſaid thankfull acknowledgment was but a complement, or a piece of theire rhetorick <hi>(ad acquirendam gratiam)</hi> to gaine favour (yet let them conſider what we put them in mind of at firſt, how dangerous it is to engage the greate name of the Almighty, to advance theire corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable deſignes. <hi>(Nec tutum eſt ludere cum ſacris)</hi> It is not ſafe to dally with things ſacred. We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the petitioners more cleare conviction, and further ſatisfaction to all the world, examine their particular grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and other paſſages which we meete with in theire remonſtrance, &amp;c. and give ſuch account of our government and adminiſtrations both civil and eccleſiaſtical, as none ſhall be able (we hope) to contradict the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>For our government itſelfe, it is framed according to our charter, and the fundamental and common lawes of England, and carried on according to the ſame (takeing the words of eternal truth and righteouſnes along with them, as that rule by which all kingdomes and juriſdictions muſt render account of every act and adminiſtration, in the laſt day) with as bare allowance for the diſproportion between ſuch an ancient, populous, wealthy kingdome, and ſo poore an infant thinne colonie, as common reaſon can afford. And becauſe this will better appeare by compareing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, we ſhall drawe them into a parallel. In the one columne we will ſett downe the fundamental and common lawes and cuſtomes of England, beginning with Magna
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:011300_0103_0F86A04537AA80E8"/>
Charta, and ſo goe on to ſuch others as we had occaſion to make uſe of, or may at preſent ſuite with our ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings: In the other columne we will ſett downe the ſumme of ſuch lawes and cuſtomes as are in force and uſe in this juriſdiction, ſhewing withall (where occaſion ſerves) how they are warranted by our charter. As for thoſe poſitive lawes or ſtatutes of England, which have been from tyme to tyme eſtabliſhed upon the baſis of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, as they have been ordained upon occaſions, ſo they have been alterable ſtill upon like occaſion, without hazarding or weakening the foundation, as the experience of many hundred yeares hath given proofe of. Therefore
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:011300_0103_0F86A04537AA80E8"/>
there is no neceſſitie that our owne poſitive lawes (which are not fundamental) ſhould be framed after the patterne of thoſe of England, for there may be ſuch different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as in one place may require alteration, and in the other not.</p>
               <p>For ourſelves, we muſt profeſſe our inſufficiencie for ſo greate matters (as the remonſtrants alſo judge of us) and that in the lawes of England we have but the knowledge of novices, which is mixed with ignorance, and therefore ſuch faileings as may appeare either in our collection of thoſe lawes, or in conforming our owne to that patterne, are to be imputed to our want of ſkill. If we had able lawyers amongſt us, we might have beene more exact.</p>

                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:011300_0107_0F86A04A643D9E50"/>By this it may appeare that our politic and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls are framed according to the lawes of England, and according to the charter; ſo that the petitioners (if they had not caſt off all modeſty) muſt needs be aſhamed of this complaint, as alſo of thoſe which follow, viz. Arbitrarie government, The negative vote, Illimited oathes, Unjuſt taxes, Illegall committments, &amp;c. For the firſt, we uſe to ſay, Rome was not built in a day: Nay, they could write of it many hundred yeares after, <hi>Tantae molis erat,</hi> &amp;c. Let them produce any colonie or commonwealth in the world, where more hath beene done in 16 yeares. Let them ſhew where hath beene more care and ſtrife to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all arbitrarines, and to bring all judgements to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule, ſo farre as may be. Let them confeſſe theire ignorance of the judiciall proceedings in England, or theire malice which ſetts them on, to take up any thing to throw at us, though it cutt theire owne fingers, as the practiſe of England (which they would ſeeme ſo much to adhere unto) will moſt certainely doe, if they looke into any of thoſe courts of judicature (except it be the common pleas) but eſpecially the chauncery (which is the higheſt court of judicature) the court of requeſts, the chauncery of the exchequer and of the dutchie, in which courts they are not tyed to the common lawes or ſtatutes of England, but doe judge arbitrarily <hi>(ſecundum aequum et bonum)</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to equitie. If they can give no reaſonable anſwer here (as we are ſure they cannot) they muſt either harden theire hearts or confeſſe theire guilt, and be as carefull to reforme theire arbitrary obedience, as we are to keepe off arbitrary government. We may ſay the ſame for the ſecond, the Negative vote. Sure theſe men would ſeeme to have miſteries of ſtate in theire heads, and they meane to keepe them there. They tell us of a deſtructive negative vote, but they neither ſhew where nor what this daunger is, nor what remedie for it. It may be they have found out a way how a mixt government may ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a negative vote, which this court (with all the help of all the elders, and other the wiſeſt in the country, after
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:011300_0107_0F86A04A643D9E50"/>
two or three years endeavour) could not attaine; nor would the farre deeper wiſdome of the parliament of England ever attempt it (and that theſe remonſtrants are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of) nor doe they affect a democracie. Therefore this muſt needs be put in only as a fine device <hi>(ad facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum populum)</hi> to pleaſe the people. For the third, viz. Illimitted oathes, and covenants not explained by lawe: They ſhould have done well to have tould us what oathes and covenants they meane, for <hi>(dolus verſatur in univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus)</hi> deceit lyes hid in generalls. We know no oathes we impoſe upon any, other than ſuch as are allowed by our charter, and were in practiſe by the company in London (as occaſion required) before we came into theſe parts. And for covenants of a civill nature, there hath not beene ſo much as any mention of any ſuch amongſt us theſe many yeares, ſave only, the laſt yeare, a motion was made in court of complying with our native country in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall covenant there, which was referred to further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. As for our church covenant, that ſhall be ſpoken to in its proper place. Beſides (to prevent all ſuch burdens) we have eſtabliſhed a lawe to that end, as appears here before. 5thly, For unjuſt taxes, there is none that come amongſt, us or heare of our condition and affaires, but will marvaile for what purpoſe ſuch great ſummes ſhould be raiſed upon the country, as ſhould occaſion this grievance; ſeeing we attempt nothing of chardge, but what is neceſſarie, and what the freemen and members of the court contribute unto, as largely as any other. We ſpend nothing ſuperfluouſly in buildings, feaſtings, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, public gratuities, officers fees, or the like; nay we are aſhamed ſometimes at our penuriouſnes, but that we had rather beare ſhame and blame, than overburden the people. Such as are in chiefe office amongſt us are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live beneath the honour of their places that they might eaſe the common charge. All our publick expences have beene about ſome ſmall fortifications, makeing lawes, diſpenſeing juſtice, ſome expeditions againſt the Indians, who by their injuries and inſolencies have provoked us
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:011300_0108_0F86A04AF58120D8"/>
thereunto, and ſome forraigne occaſions of late, which accidentally fell upon us. If the remonſtrants have knowne of any laviſh waſting or miſpence of the publick treaſure, it had beene fitt they ſhould have mentioned it, otherwiſe they deale unjuſtly and injuriouſly with us, to expect we ſhould provide for theire peace and ſafety, and yet deny us the meanes whereby we ſhould accompliſh it. 6thly, For illegall committments, theire complaint pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends frequencie, otherwiſe it were not a publick grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, therefore we conceive they might have produced ſome cleare inſtances in this kind. But let them bring forth one: Or let them charge any of the courts or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates with corruption in theire places, or manifeſt injuſtice in theire ſentences: Or the government with allowance of any thing that is morally evill. If not; they are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſlanderers, and deeply guilty of the breach of the 5th commandment which (without ſerious repentance) God will require of them. 7thly, Theſe remonſtrants would be thought to be a repreſentative part of all the non-free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the countrie; but when we have pulled off theire vizards, we find them no other but Robert Child, Thomas Fowle, &amp;c. For firſt, although their petition was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all gentlenes, yet we heare of no other part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that have appeared in it, though it be four months ſince it was preſented. Againe, we know that divers of the non-freemen have lived ſome in Virginia and other plantations, where the government hath not been ſo eaſy to them as they have found it here. Others have lived in Kent, under the lawes of Gavelkind, more repugnant to the common lawes of England than any of ours. Others have had to doe in maritime affaires; others in cauſes teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamentrie and matrimoniall; others in the chancery, and others in London and other corporations, and ſo have found by experience that Engliſhmen may live comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ſecurely under ſome other lawes beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſtatute lawes of England; and that all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a freeborne Engliſh ſubject is his intereſt in the lawes, without right of election of publick officers, which
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:011300_0108_0F86A04AF58120D8"/>
they were never acquainted with there, and yet payd their equall proportions to all publick charges, &amp;c. Theſe non-freemen alſo are well ſatisfyed (as we conceive) and doe bleſſe God for the bleſſings and priviledges they doe enjoy under this government. They think it is well, that juſtice is equally adminiſtred to them with the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; that they have equall ſhare with them in all towne lotts, commons, &amp;c. that they have like libertie of acceſſe to the church aſſemblies, and like place and reſpect there, according to theire qualities, as alſo in all neighbourly meetings for maintenance of love, as alſo like freedome of trade and commerce. So that we have good cauſe to be perſwaded, that there are not many of theſe diſcontented remonſtrants within our juriſdiction, nor in New England. We are further confirmed herein, when we conſider what hard ſhifts theſe remonſtrants were put unto, to make up the number of ſeven. The firſt (and he that muſt <hi>(ducem agere in hujus militiae)</hi> be the leader in this deſigne) is a Paduan Doctor (as he is reputed) lately come into the country, who hath not ſo much as taſted of their grievances, nor like to doe, being a batchelour and only a ſojournour, who never payd penny to any publick charge, though (of his owne good-will) he hath done ſomething for publick uſe. A ſecond, is a church member, but will be no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; he likes better to be caſed of that trouble and charge. A third, is a freeman, but no member of any church, and the reaſon hath beene his profeſſed affection to the hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie. A fourth, is a clarke of the prothonotaries office, a ſojournour alſo, and of no viſible eſtate in the country, one who hath never appeared formerly in ſuch deſigne, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath been drawne into this; it is like to be as thoſe who were called by Abſolom to accompany him to Hebron. A fifth, is a young merchant, little acquainted with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth affaires. We are willing to ſuppoſe he might alſo be one of them, who were invited by Abſolom to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, but ſure we are, it is no ſmall griefe to his honoured godly friends to find him there, when they prayed and waited dayly to heare of him in Jeruſalem. A ſixth was
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:011300_0109_0F86A04BE292F3C0"/>
taken up by accident, being none of this juriſdiction, but himſelfe and familie inhabiting at Rhode-Iſland. The ſeventh, is an ould grocer of London, whoſe forgetfulnes of the lawes and cuſtomes of that citty, and unmindfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his dutie to the government under which he now lives and proſpers, we may impute to his age and ſome other infirmities. And theſe are the champions who muſt repreſent the bodie of non-freemen. If this be their head, ſure they have <hi>(inſulſum caput et non multo ſale defaecandum)</hi> an unſavoury head, not to be ſeaſoned with much ſalt. It may be thought rather that this was ſome dareing buſines at ſome of their merry-meetings, like that of Sir Roger Williams and the Dutch commander Skencke, who in a vyeing bravery would adventure to fetch the prince of Parma out of his tent in the middeſt of his army.</p>
               <p>Thus have we traced our remonſtrants through the civill ſtate, wherein it was eaſie to follow them by theire ill ſcent; they are now paſſing over to the church, but in theire way they will needs obſerve ſome notable decay of trade and huſbandry, &amp;c. and withall ſome malignant and noiſome diſeaſes among us, and they are bould to deliver Gods councell therein without conſulting with his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, where they might have learned that all things come alike to all, and as many as I love I rebuke and chaſtiſe, and judgment muſt begin at the houſe of God (and how then muſt malignants ſpeed) So as theire imputeing ſuch afflictions to the evil of our government is without rule, nor doe they deale faithfully in their diſcovery. For although our merchants have ſuſtained ſome late loſſes at ſea in two or three voyages, yet we have no cauſe to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at the good providence of the Lord, who hath well repaired thoſe loſſes by his bleſſing upon us in our fiſhing and other tradeing abroade, and by the ſucceſſe he hath given to our labours at home, ſo as we could ſpare twenty thouſand buſhells of corne the laſt yeare (ſo much at leaſt being tranſported) and a good quantity ſhipped out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready this preſent yeare. As for thoſe diſeaſes they ſpeak of, it is true (and the Lord teach us to profitt thereby)
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:011300_0109_0F86A04BE292F3C0"/>
God was pleaſed to viſit ſome of our townes the laſt ſpring with a more violent fever than ordinary, whereby (as we gueſſe) ſome fifty or ſixty perſons were taken away in a few weekes; but when we conſider the nature and ſtrength of the diſeaſe, and the weakneſs of the meanes for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or cure, we muſt acknowledge it a ſingular teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of fatherly love, that among ſo many thouſands he tooke away ſo few, and ſtayed it ſo ſuddenly. And for that ſhamefull diſeaſe they mention, we may ſee how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die they are to publiſh any thing to our diſgrace. They might have covered this blemiſh, being the firſt of this kind that we have knowne in the countrie, and no guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of lyeing upon the government, or upon the country that we can find. There came indeed the laſt yeare out of England a lewd perſon infected with the French diſeaſe, who ſtayed not long with us; but ſince his departure ſome others have been infected, but by what meanes we cannot find; the infection ſpreading by a worke of charitie, in drawing the breaſts of one infected, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowne to them nor to herſelfe, that we can learne. But this was more obſervable (wherein the remonſtrants might have ſeene the good hand of the Lord toward us) that a ſtranger coming accidentally into the country at that time, who had ſpeciall ſkill in that diſeaſe, through the bleſſing of God, ſoone cured them.</p>
               <p>Theſe remonſtrants are now come to the church doore, when one of theire companie gives them the flipp, not dareing (it ſeemes) to enter for feare of an admonition. But let us ſee what exceptions the other ſide have to our churches, &amp;c. They tell us, <q>that divers ſober, righteous, and godly men, eminent for knowledge and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gifts of the Holy Spirit, no wayes ſcandalous in theire lives, are detained from the ſeales, becauſe (as is ſuppoſed) they will not take theſe churches covenant.</q> The petitioners are ſure miſtaken or miſrepreſent the matter; for the true reaſons why many perſons in the country are not admitted to the ſeales are theſe. Firſt, many are fraudulous in theire converſation; or 2dly, noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:011300_0110_0F86A04D13FAC6D0"/>
corrupt in their opinions; or 3dly, groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the principles of religion; or 4thly, if any have ſuch knowledge and gifts, yet they doe not manifeſt the ſame by any publick profeſſion before the church or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the elders, and ſo it is not knowne that they are thus qualified. And our churches may not receive men blind-foulded, or upon other mens creditt, when they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to give account of their faith or repentance, which is ſo expreſly required, 1 Pet. 3.15. Matt. 3.6. Acts 8.37. Matt. 16.16, 17, 18. Few examples (if any) can be given of ſuch as have manifeſted themſelves to be ſo qualified and yet have beene refuſed meerely for ſcrupleing the covenant. And it is juſtly queſtionable whether ſuch ſhould be admitted to the ſeales, who will not be ſubject to the diſcipline appointed by Chriſt in his churches. For what is the covenant but a ſubmitting themſelves under the ordinances of Chriſt, as the ſame are exerciſed according to the rule of the word, in that church where ſuch an one joynes as a member? Let a man profeſſedly engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hereto, and (we ſuppoſe) our churches will reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed therewith. Our churches are not alone, nor the firſt that have walked in this way. The like courſe is held in the French and Dutch churches, and allowed by ſome of the chiefe patrons of the preſbyterian way: As Mr. Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beard, Nar. p. 16. Mr. Rutterford, Due Right, &amp;c. p. 85, 86, 88. Who doe grant, that when a member is admitted, &amp;c. there is alwayes an implicite covenant (at leaſt) which be now comes under. And if ſo, then what burden or danger can there be to any chriſtians conſcience, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing that by his words, which he muſt acknowledge and binds himſelfe unto by his action? unles plain and open dealing be growne unlawfull. They ſay they ſee no light in Gods word for ſuch a covenant, which may well be; for it appeares by other paſſages in theire remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, that they have ſmall acquaintance therewith, or elſe like not to come under the power of it. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares alſo, by the offence they take, to be compelled to attend to it in the publick aſſemblies. They profeſſe to
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:011300_0110_0F86A04D13FAC6D0"/>
approve of the covenant lately impoſed by the honourable houſes of parliament, and that they are all of them very willing to take ſuch oathes and covenants as are expreſſions of theire deſires of advanceing the glory of God and good of this place, &amp;c. and yet they boggle at the covenants of theſe churches, which are wholely framed according to the ſame deſcription. So as it is cleare, it is not want of light (as they pretend) but ſomething in theire owne hearts, which they ſeeke to cover. For let them ſtand to that profeſſion, and they can never ſtick at our covenants. And whereas they ſay they cannot perceive what our covenants are, becauſe they are not one and the ſame in every church; they might as well ſay, they could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our prayers and ſermons, becauſe they differ alſo one from another in forme of words. For the difference of our covenants in the ſeverall churches is no other. In ſubſtance (for ought we know) they all agree. And what ever the ſeverall expreſſions may be, this ſufficeth us (which we conceive to be intended by them all) that in this covenant we profeſſe our engagement of relation to God, and one to another, in all the duties which belong to the publick worſhip of God, and edification one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the rule of the goſpell.</p>
               <p>Another matter which troubles them is, that they are compelled (under a ſevere fine) every Lords day to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the congregation. The law which they account ſo ſevere is this: Any two aſſiſtants may fine or impriſon ſuch perſons inhabiting here, as ſhall uſually abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from church meetings upon the Lords day, ſo as the fine exceed not 5<abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> for one offence. We cannot conceive that ſuch ſober and godly men as theſe remonſtrants ſpeak of, ſhould feare any hurt by this lawe, for ſure ſuch perſons need not to be compelled to reſort to church meetings. Therefore it ſhould ſeeme rather, that they would pleade for libertie for looſe and irreligious perſons, or for ſuch as are tainted with ſuch corrupt opinions as doe cauſe them to caſt off all publick ordinances of Gods worſhip, or elſe they would not have the civill authoritie to meddle with
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:011300_0111_0F86A04DC798C360"/>
men, for matters of the firſt table; and ſo they would have the 4th commandment to be ceremoniall, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly requires that all within our gates be looked unto, that they doe not violate the Lords ſabbath, but ſanctify it. And if they would have all men admitted to the ſeales of Gods covenant, they muſt either allowe they may be brought to the ordinary meanes of inſtruction, whereby they may be made fitt for the ſame; or elſe they confeſſe againſt themſelves that they would have them admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theire ignorance and profanenes.</p>
               <p>They are offended alſo at our lawe againſt Anabaptiſts. The truth is, the great trouble we have beene putt unto and hazard alſo, by familiſticall and anabaptiſticall ſpirits, whoſe conſcience and religion hath been only to ſett forth themſelves and raiſe contentions in the country, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us to provide for our ſafety by a lawe, that all ſuch ſhould take notice, how unwelcome they ſhould be unto us, either comeing or ſtaying. But for ſuch as differ from us only in judgment, in point of baptiſm or ſome other points of leſſe conſequence, and live peaceably amongſt us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out occaſioning diſturbance, &amp;c. ſuch have no cauſe to complaine; for it hath never beene as yet putt in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt any of them, although ſuch are knowne to live amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Another of their grievances is, that in ſome places they are forced to contribute to the maintenance of thoſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who vouchſafe not to take them into their flocke. They doe well to reſtraine this grievance to ſome places; for it is well knowne, that in many of our churches no ſuch courſe is uſed. And ſure we are, that none of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants were ever compelled ſo ſuch contribution. And although the ſcripture ſaith the labourour is worthy of his wages, yet there are amongſt us ſome, who live under the miniſtry of the word, themſelves and theire families, yeare after yeare, and yet never contribute the worth of one penny to the maintenance thereof, though they have place in the aſſembly equall to any of theire ranke, and though the wives of ſome of them doe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:011300_0111_0F86A04DC798C360"/>
at the Lords table, and their children are received to baptiſme. And whereas they complaine that they are not accounted ſo much as brethren, nor publickly ſo called. The truth is, we account all our countrymen brethren by nation, and ſuch as in charity we may judge to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are accounted alſo brethren in Chriſt. If they be not publickly ſo called (eſpecially in the church aſſemblies) it is not for want of due reſpect or good will towards them, but only for diſtinction ſake, to putt a difference betweene thoſe that doe commuicate together at the Lords table, and thoſe who doe not. As for that complaint of want of exerciſing chriſtian vigilancie towards them, it is a moſt untrue and unjuſt charge. For it is evident in moſt places (and for ought we know) in all, that beſides the publick prayers and inſtructions which is common to them with the members of the church, they are admitted (ſuch as will) to private conference and prayers; they are viſited in tymes of ſicknes, &amp;c. as occaſion requires. If any faileing be in particular members in this kind, it is againſt the mind of the churches and the intent of the civill government. If ſome duties of church diſcipline are not exerciſed towards them, they can blame none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in that they refuſe to ſubmitt themſelvs thereto.</p>
               <p>Concerning the baptiſme of the children of ſuch as are not members of our churches, there is an aſſembly of the elders now in being, and therefore we think fitt to deferr any reſolution about that and ſome other pointes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church diſcipline, untill we ſhall underſtand theire concluſion therein, for further light in theſe things.</p>
               <p>In theire concluſion, theſe remonſtrants prognoſticate what peace and felicitie we may certainely expect both in church and common wealth, if theire petition be granted, viz. that every man be left to his owne libertie, and no diſtinctions or qualifications obſerved, &amp;c. which they might have illuſtrated by ſome examples, which we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile they omitted, eſpecially haveing one ſo neere and freſh; we ſhall therefore help theire memory. They well know that ſome eight yeares ſince, here were a
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:011300_0112_0F86A05061BBD570"/>
certaine companie (which were petitioners and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants alſo though in another kind) who out of theire tendernes of libertie of conſcience, and civill libertie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, made greate diſturbance both in church and civill ſtate, but not obtaineing their deſire, and fearing ſuch a ruine to come upon us as theſe remonſtrants foreſee, they removed to Rhode-Iſland, where haveing given equall priviledge to all and eſtabliſhed this as their baſis, &amp;c. that no man ſhould ever be moleſted for profeſſing his judgment, &amp;c. they thought themſelves the onely happy concording people under heaven. But, alas! it was but a dreame; it was not of God and therefore could not ſtand. For this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and equallity ſo fomented naturall corruption, as they preſently fell at variance among themſelves, and grew into three or foure oppoſite parts, which continue to this day; and inſtead of eſtabliſhing church and civill ſtate have overthrowne both.</p>
               <p>Such peace, unity, proſperity, &amp;c. is that which we may expect, if we will caſt off the rules of Gods word, the civill prudence of all nations, and our owne obſervation of the fruite of other mens follies, and hearken to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of theſe new ſtateſmen. From which the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, and all the ſeed of Iſraell to the comeing of Chriſt Jeſus. AMEN.</p>

The irregular departure of ſome cauſeth a deeper ſearch of heart, wherefore God hath brought his people hither, (I will briefly mention Gods ends, as I conceive them, by and by) and the plotting of others under the alluring notion of liberty, thereby to winne the opinioniſts and looſer ſort, cauſes the ſolid chriſtians to prize the rare and rich liberty which God hath given them, and they have deerly purchaſed, (viz. in reſpect of men in this their great adventure) at a very high rate.

               <p>Mr. Parker with his wife and family are well ſeated in a good plantation of 20 acres, beſides a good ſtipend and many good guifts, well approved of in his function, oppoſed by none, unleſſe by antinomians and ſuch like.

I perceive by your letter that the Lord did ſhake his rod over New-England, it was his greate mercy only to put you in remembrance. We have felt his heavy hand in wrath, and yet I feare not ſenſible of it, for here is little amendment, or notice taken of his great puniſhments. The ſicknes was an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute plague; very infectious and deſtroying, in ſo much that in our pariſh there were buried 20 in a weeke, and many weekes together, 15 or 16. It firſt ſeaſed on the ableſt men both for account and ability of body. Many who had begun and almoſt finiſhed greate ſugar workes, who dandled themſelves in their hopes, but were ſuddenly laid in the duſt, and their eſtates left unto ſtrangers. Our

For his neceſſities preſſed us to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſburſement of thirty pounds, and to recover it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine would be a hard matter, yea too hard for us, he living in Norfolk; but a word is ſufficient, it is better to looſe ſome than all.

Here is a great murmuring at the great proviſions of powder and ſhott the ſeverall ſhipps gett licenſe for, yeare after yeare, 40 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells of powder and 50 barrells is an ordinary proportion to a ſhipp, nay ſometimes 100, and lead and arms propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. Its laid to our chardge, that being cuſtom free, we inrich ourſelves by furniſhing Barbadoes and Virginia, though enemies, &amp;c. with that and other commodities, and there hath been upon that very accompt a ſerious debate about revoking our free cuſtome and exciſe. I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in it, and ſatisfyed many of the Parliament and Counſell of State, of your care not to ſuffer any powder more than ſhipps ſtore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be tranſported away, that we are faine to land all we bring hither for feare of fireing the ſhipps in the river, and muſt gett licenſe for that alſo upon

We are juſtly ſenſible of the diſhonour putt upon the Engliſh nation by this unjuſt affront, of our duty to preſerve the Engliſh title to ſo conſiderable a place as Delaware, and that a juſt repaire and ſatisfaction be made to thoſe ſo wronged both in their perſons and eſtates and, from you, deſire information what eſteem the old pattents for that place have with the Parliament or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of State, where there hath been no improvement hitherto made by the pattentees; whether the Parliament hath graunted any late pattents, or whether in graunting they reſerve not libertie and encouragement for ſuch as have or ſhall plant upon their formerly duely purchaſed lands; as alſo how any engagement by the colonies againſt the Dutch upon the forementioned occaſion will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Parliament, of which we deſire information by the firſt, &amp;c.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>FOR ſo I muſt acknowledge you, not only for the eminency of place and command which the God of power and honour hath called you unto; but alſo for that the Lord hath ſat you forth as a veſſell of honour to his name, in working many and great deliverances for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and for his truth, by you; and yet helping you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the honour to him, who is the God of ſalvation, and the Lord of hoaſts, mighty in battell. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that you ſuffer no ſmall diſhonour in the tongues of many, not only as a ſectary, but as out of your calling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſat on worke (as is pretended) by an uſurped power, and yourſelfe (with the army) exerciſing a power deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in ſome caſes to the priviledges of parliament, and the liberty and ſafety of the kingdome. But 3 or 4 principles there be, upon which it ſeemeth to me your proceedings have been grounded and carryed on, and whein my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (reaſonable it is) hath been fully ſatisfyed: 1. That the conceſſions of the late king never came up to ſuch a poſture as whereon to lay a firme foundation of a ſafe peace, either to church or commonwealth. 2. That when the Parliament was full, and aſſiſted with the commiſſioners of Scotland (in the treaty at Uxbridge or Newport, or elſewhere) they agreed together that the king could not be reſtored to his former ſtate upon ſuch termes. And therefore (unles his conceſſions afterwards in the Iſle of Wight were more ſafe and ſatisfactory)<note n="*" place="bottom">This is expreſſed very cautiouſly.</note> if the Parliament of England voted the contrary afterwards, in a mighty conſultation, it was not an act of Parliament, but a praevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a former juſt and lawfull act. And therefore, when the army diſcerned, not only their owne ſafetyes, but the ſafety of religion and ſtate, and their cauſe and victoryes given in defence thereof, all of them given away in that praevarication, I know not how they could have
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:011300_0120_0F86A0593739AE18"/>
approved their faithfullneſſe better to the ſtate and cauſe, then by purging the Parliament of ſuch corrupt humours, and preſenting the king to publique tryall. 3. That the army, though they be inferiour and ſubordinate to the ſtate that giveth them commiſſion and pay; yet neither their conſciences nor ſervices are mercenary, though they doe receive wages for their ſupport in the ſervice; though ſoldiers may take oathes of fidelity to the ſtate, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking an expedition, yet they, regarding the cauſe as well as the perſons that ſet them on worke, doe performe their fidelity, if they attend to the cauſe for which they fight, rather than to the private ends or luſts of ſuch as ſend them forth. Joab (the generall of Davids hoaſt) though he went beyond his commiſſion in putting Abſalom to death, yet not beyond his fidelity. 4. That when covenants are plighted, which conſiſt of many articles (ſome principall and fundamentall, others ſubordinate and acceſſary) if it ſo fall out that all the articles cannot be performed without breach of ſome or other, there may be juſt cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting the undertaking of ſuch covenants; but yet, if ſome articles cannot be performed without breach of others, the covenanters muſt chiefely attend to the performance of the principall articles, though (with griefe) they be put to it to violate the ſubordinate. Theſe things are ſo cleare to mine owne apprehenſion, that I am fully ſatisfyed, that you have all this while fought the Lords battells, and the Lord hath owned you, and honoured himſelfe in you, in all your expeditions, which maketh my poor prayers the more ſerious and faithfull and affectionate (as God helpeth) in your behalfe. In like frame (as I conceive) are the ſpirits of our brethren (the elders and churches of theſe parts) carried forth, and the Lord accept us, and help you in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If you aſke upon what ſtructure I have made thus bold to addreſſe myſelfe in theſe rude lynes to your Lordſhip, I muſt acknowledge it is abhorrent from my native baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe to run into the preſence of great men: But I received the other day a letter from my reverend brother Mr. Hooker of Newhaven, who certifyeth me that your Lordſhip made ſpeciall mention of me in your late letters
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:011300_0120_0F86A0593739AE18"/>
to him, with tender of loving and more reſpectfull ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than I could expect; withall he moved me to write to your Lordſhip, as believing you would accept the ſame in good part. This is my excuſe, ſuch as it is.</p>
               <p>The Scots, whom God delivered into your hands at Dunbarre, and whereof ſundry were ſent hither, we have been deſirous (as we could) to make their yoke eaſy. Such as were ſick of the ſcurvy or other diſeaſes have not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed phyſick and chyrurgery. They have not been ſold for ſlaves to perpetuall ſervitude, but for 6 or 7 or 8 yeares, as we do our owne; and he that bought the moſt of them (I heare) buildeth houſes for them, for every 4 an houſe, layeth ſome acres of ground thereto, which he giveth them as their owne, requiring 3 dayes in the weeke to worke for him (by turnes) and 4 dayes for themſelves, and promiſeth, aſſoone as they can repay him the money he layed out for them, he will ſet them at liberty.</p>
               <p>As for the aſperſion of factious men, I hear, by Mr. Deſboroughs letter laſt night, that you have well vindicated yourſelfe therefrom by caſhiering ſundry corrupt ſpirits out of the army. And truly, Sir, better a few and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, than many and unſound. The army on Chriſts ſide (which he maketh victorious) are called choſen and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Rev. 17.14. a verſe worthy your Lordſhips frequent and deepe meditation. Go on therefore (good Sir) to overcome yourſelfe (Prov. 16.32.) to overcome your army, (Deut. 29.9, with v. 14.) and to vindicate your orthodoxe integrity to the world.</p>
               <p>Pardon, I beſeech you, my boldneſſe and rudeneſſe, which not arrogancy but due reſpect and obſervancy to your Lordſhip hath put upon me.</p>

               <p>Whereas Mr. Coddington have gotten a charter of Roade Iland and Conimacucke Iland to himſelfe, he have thereby broken the force of their charter that went under the name of Providence, becauſe he have gotten away the greater parte of that colonie.</p>

               <head>An Anſwer to the Propoſitions preſented by the honored French Agent to the Preſident and Commiſſioners for the Engliſh united Colonies.</head>
               <p n="1">1. UPON due conſideration and reſpect of what the honnored deputyes from the illuſtrious Governor of New-France have informed and upon experience our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have had of the inſolency and treachery of ſome of the barbarians, we can conceive and grant, that the French and thoſe eaſterne Indians may have juſt grounds to their owne ſafisfaction, for a warr againſt the Mohawks.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Engliſh looke upon all ſuch Indians as receive the yoke of Chriſt with another eye than upon thoſe that worſhip the Divell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Engliſh deſire by all juſt meanes to keep peace (if it may be) with all men, even with theſe barbarians.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Mohawkes, living at a diſtance from the ſea, have little intercourſe in theſe parts, but in the warr the Engliſh had with the Indians 14 or 16 yeares ſince, the Mohawkes ſhewed a reall reſpect, and have not ſince done any knowne hoſtile acts againſt them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Engliſh engage not in any warr before they have full and ſatisfying evidence, that in all reſpects and conſiderations it is juſt, and before peace upon juſt termes hath been offered and refuſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Mohawkes are neither in ſubjection nor league with the Engliſh, ſo that we can neither require any account of their warres, or other proceedings, nor have we meanes to informe ourſelves what they can ſay for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If all other conſiderations were cleered, to make warr with the Mohawkes may endanger all our neighbour
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:011300_0123_0F86A05B77110FA8"/>
Indians (of which divers profeſſe chriſtianity) and the reſt doe rather expect juſt protection than that we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, by our voluntary invading the Mohawkes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Though the Engliſh in theſe juriſdictions are free to performe all neighbourly offices of righteouſneſs and peace, towards the French collonie, yet they foreſee they can neither permitt volunteeres or auxilliary forces to be taken up againſt the Mohawkes, nor that the French or eaſtern Indians paſſe through the Engliſh juriſdictions, to invade them, but they ſhall expoſe both the chriſtian and other Indians and ſome of the ſmaller Engliſh plantations to dainger.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Engliſh are much unſattisfied with that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous trade the French and Dutch have had and ſtill continue, ſelling gunns, powder and ſhott to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, of which we have dayly complaints, and by which the Indians are animated and apt to grow inſolent not only againſt Indian converts and catechumens, but againſt the chriſtians of Europe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If the Engliſh colonies were aſſured of the juſtice of this warre, and engaged with the French to proſecute againſt the Mohawkes, yet we have no ſuch ſhort and convenient paſſage either by water or land to approach them, as may be had up Hudſons river, to and beyond Aurania forte, which is in the Dutch juriſdiction.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They hope the auncient peace and amitye betwixt England and France will be continued and confirmed, which they both deſire and as far as lyes in them ſhall by all due meanes readily promote.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They conceave that the honored deputies have power and authoritie at preſent to agree and ſettle a free commerce betweene the Engliſh and French colonies in theſe parts, but if the ſaid deputyes, upon reaſons knowne to themſelves, ſee cauſe to limitt the Engliſh colonies to ſuch reſtrictions, or rather prohibitions as the unpriviledged French are under, that they may not trade till they have firſt procured a particular licence from the Governor and Councell of New-France, at leaſt till they have iſſued the

preſent differences and ſettled peace with the Mohawkes, a fitter ſeaſon for theſe treaties muſt be attended, which the Commiſſioners ſhall readily improve when it is preſented.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Colonies, as in the 2d article, are ready upon a fitt opportunity to ſhew all due reſpect to all truly converted and chriſtian Indians, and much more than to others, but while they live at ſuch a diſtance from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh juriſdictions they neither may promiſe nor afford them any protection to ſecure them from dainger.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Maſſa.

               <p>The place of his birth was the towne of Derby, the moſt eminent place in that country; his father trained him up to ſuch learning as the ſchoole afforded, for the fitting him for Cambridge, whither he went when he was very young, at 13 years of age, and was admitted into the famous ſociety of Trinity-College, where he fell ſoe hard to his ſtudie, and ſoe profitted in the knowledge of the tongues and arts that he had undoubtedly beene fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low there, but that at that time their great hall was then
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:011300_0124_0F86A05C5418AF10"/>
in building, which cauſed ſuch expences to them that the election was put by or at leaſt deferred till ſome longer time. And this providence I cannot paſſe by concerning him, that his father (whoſe calling was to be imployed in the ſtuddy and practiſe of the law) had not many clients that made uſe of his advice in law matters before, it pleaſed God after he was gone to Cambridge, to put his father upon great practiſe, ſoe that he was very able to keepe him there and allow him liberall maintenance; inſoemuch that the bleſſed man ſaid, God kept me at the univerſity. From Trinity colledge he removed to Emanuel colledge, the happy ſeminary of learning and piety, where he was honoured with a fellowſhip in that ſociety, after a diligent and ſtrict examen, according to the ſtatutes of that houſe: wherein this is worth the taking notice of, that when the poſer came to examine him in the Hebrew tongue, the place where he was to be examined was that in Iſai. 3. that ſpeakes againſt the bravery of woemen, which hath more hard words together than any place in the Bible within ſoe narrow a compaſſe, and might have poſed a very good Hebrician, but he was very ready at it, and all thoſe difficult words were eaſy to him. Afterwards he was head-lecturer and dean and catechiſt in the colledge, and was a diligent tutor to many pupills and very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of them: His exerciſes that he performed in the colledge, whether in way of common-place or diſpute, wanted not ſinnewes and ſtrength, were highly commended and applauded of thoſe that knew him. The firſt time that he became famous throughout the whole univerſity, was from a funerall oration which he made in latine for Doctor Some, who was Maſter of Peter-houſe, which was ſoe elegantly and oratoriouſly performed that he was much admired for it by the greateſt witts in the univerſity. After that, being called to preach at the univerſity church called St. Maries, he was yet more famous for that ſermon, and very much applauded by all the gallant ſchollars for it: After that, being called to preach there againe, God helped him not to flaunt, as before, but to make a plain, honeſt
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:011300_0125_0F86A05F30920948"/>
ſermon, which was bleſſed of God to famous Dr. Preſton's ſoules eternal good: His <hi>Concio ad Clerum,</hi> when he tooke his degree for Bachelor of Divinity, which was after he had beene at Boſton halfe a yeare or more, was very much admired and applauded more than he deſired; his text was out of Math. 5.13. <hi>Vos eſtis ſal terrae, quòd ſi ſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuatus fuerit, quo ſalietur?</hi> In handling of which, both the matter and the rhetorical ſtreighnes, elegancy of phraſe, and ſweet and grave pronunciation rendered him yet more famous in the univerſity; and ſoe did his anſwering of the divinity act in the ſchools, though he had a very nimble opponent, Mr. William Chappel by name, who diſputed with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. Concerning his removal from Cambridge to Boſton in Lyncolnſhire, this is to be ſaide, that his call was good, for their deſire was urgent, their need preſſed, their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of people very great, himſelfe very able, and his heart inclining to come to them. At his firſt coming he found ſome obſtruction from the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, which was B. Barlow, who told him he was a young man and unfit to be over ſuch a factious people: Mr. Cotton being ingenuous and undervaluing himſelfe, thought ſoe too, and was purpoſing to returne to the colledge againe; but ſome of Mr. Cotton's Boſton friends underſtanding that one Simon Biby was to be ſpoken with, which was near the Biſhop,<note place="margin">Which ſome called Simony &amp; Bribery.</note> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently charmed him, and ſo the buſineſſe went on ſmooth, and Mr. Cotton was a learned man with the Biſhop, and he was admitted into the place, after their manner in thoſe dayes. Well, to Boſton the good man came, and for 3 yeares he preached and lived ſoe amongſt them, that they accounted themſelves happy (as they well might) in the enjoyment of him, both the towne and country thereabout being much bettered by him: But it pleaſed God, after 3 or 4 yeares being there, that he could not digeſt the ceremonies that were ſoe preſſed, nor conformity to them, which in ſome ſpace of time after bred him trouble in the court of Lyncolne, from
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:011300_0125_0F86A05F30920948"/>
which he was adviſed to appeale to a higher court, and imploying Mr. Leverit (which was afterwards one of the ruling elders of the church at Boſton in N. E.) to deale in that buſineſſe, and he being a plaine man as Jacob was, yet ſubtile to get ſuch a ſpiritual bleſſing, ſoe far inſinuated himſelfe into one of the proctors of the high court, that he ſware <hi>in animam Domini,</hi> that Mr. Cotton was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable man, and ſo he was reſtored to Boſton; as likewiſe by the meanes that a gentleman of Boſton, called Mr. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, uſed to bring him in againe: After which he was marvelous ſucceſsful in his miniſtry, till he had beene 20 yeares there, and in that 20 yeares ſpace, he on Lords-day, on afternoones, went over, thrice, the whole body of divinity in a catechiſtical way, and gave the heads of his diſcourſe to thoſe that were young ſchollars and others in that towne, to anſwer to his queſtions in publique, in that great congregation, and after their anſwers he opened thoſe heads of divinity and ſweetly applyed all to the edification of his people, and to ſuch ſtrangers as came to heare him: In the morning on the Lords-day, he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the firſt ſix chapters of the goſpel by John, the whole booke of Eccleſiaſtes, the propheſye of Zephaniah, and many other ſcriptures, and when the Lords ſupper was adminiſtred (which was uſually every month) he preached upon 1 Cor. 11. and the whole 30th chapter of the 2 Chron. and ſome other ſcriptures about the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: On his lecture dayes he preached through the whole 1ſt and 2d epiſtles of John, the whole booke of Solomons ſong, the Parables of our Saviour ſet forth in Matthewes goſpel to the end of cap. 16. comparing them with Mark and Luke. He tooke much paines in private, and read to ſundry young ſchollars that were in his houſe, and ſome that came out of Germany, and had his houſe full of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. Afterwards, ſeeing ſome inconveniences in the peoples flocking to his houſe, beſides his ordinary lecture on the 5th day of the weeke, he preached thrice more on the weeke dayes, on the 4th and 6th dayes, early in the morning, and on the laſt day at 3 of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone;
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:011300_0126_0F86A0606209DA18"/>
only theſe 3 laſt lectures were performed by him but ſome few yeares before he had another famous col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with him, and not many yeares before he left Boſton: He alwayes preached at the election of their mayors and at that time when they tooke their oath and were inſtalled in their office; and alwayes (if he were at home) at the funerals of thoſe of the abler ſort that died: He was frequent in duties of humiliation and thankſgiving, in which I have knowne him in prayer and opening the word and applying it, 5 or 6 houres, ſoe indefatigable he was in the Lords worke, and ſoe ready to ſpend and be ſpent for his peoples ſoules: He was of admirable candor, of unparalleled meekneſſe, of rare wiſdome, very loving even to thoſe that differed in judgment from him, yet one that held his owne ſtoutly, <hi>arctè tenens accuratèque defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> what himſelfe judged to be the truth. He anſwered many letters that were ſent far and neare, wherein were handled many difficult caſes of conſcience, and many doubts by him cleared, to the greateſt ſatisfaction. He was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly beloved of the beſt, and admired and reverenced of the worſt of his hearers. Nothing was wanting to make him a compleat miniſter, nothing lacking to make him a perfect chriſtian, but the perfection of grace which he hath now attained to, and the glory he hath now arrived at. He was a man that was in great favour with Dr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams the Biſhop of Lincolne, who admired him for his learning, and (as I have beene told) when he was lord keeper of the great ſeale, he went to King James, and ſpeaking of Mr. Cottons great learning and worth before him, the King was willing, notwithſtanding his non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, to give way that he ſhould have his liberty, to goe on without interruption in his miniſtry, which was very marvelous, conſidering how the Kings ſpirit was carryed out againſt ſuch men; the myſtery of which Mr. Samuel Ward of Ipſwich being ignorant of, ſpake merrily among ſome of his friends: Of all men in the world I envy Mr. Cotton of Boſton moſt, for he doth nothing in way of conformity, and yet hath his liberty, and I doe every
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:011300_0126_0F86A0606209DA18"/>
thing that way and cannot enjoy mine. He had many enemies at Boſton, as well as many friends, and ſome that roſe up againſt him and plotted ſecretly to undermine him, and others that practiſed more openly againſt him; but they all of them were blaſted, either in their names, or in their eſtates, or in their familyes, or in their devices, or elſe came to untimely deathes, which ſhewes how God both owned his ſervant in his holy labours, and that in the things wherein they dealt proudly againſt him, he would be above them.</p>
               <p>One thing more, and I have done with him as he was one of Englands gloryes, and then come to him as over the Atlantique ocean, and in New-England, and it is this; concerning his hoſpitality, wherein he did exceed moſt that ever I heard of, and eſpecially his heart and doores were open to receive (as all that feared God, ſoe) eſpecially godly miniſters, which he moſt curteouſly entertained, and many other ſtrangers beſides; only one miniſter, Mr. Hacket by name, which had got into the fellowſhip of famous Mr. Arthur Heilderſham, with many other godly miniſters, and being acquainted with their ſecrets, betrayed them into the prelates hands; this man coming into Boſton and meeting with Mr. Cotton, the good man had not the heart to ſpeake to him, nor invite him to his houſe, which he ſaid he never did to any ſtranger that he knew before, much leſſe to any miniſter.</p>
               <p>Concerning the laſt thing, viz. his departure from Boſton to New-England. The times growing perillous, he was envied of ſome at home and others abroad; and letters miſſive were come to convent him before the high-commiſſion-court, and a profligate fellow and a filthy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, Gowen Johnſon by name (who not long after dyed of the plague) was to bring the letters to him, as he did to ſome others near him, which when Mr. Cotton under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, he looked for nothing from the court but ſcornes and priſon, and therefore with advice from many able heades and gracious hearts, he kept cloſe for a time, and fitted himſelfe to goe to N. E. and God bringing him and his
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:011300_0127_0F86A06169D5DAA8"/>
company over in ſafety, through his mercy, after they had beene there a while, there grew ſome trouble betweene thoſe that were to ſettle matters in church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but Mr. Cotton then preaching before the general court an excellent ſermon out of Hag. 2. Be ſtrong Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel, and be ſtrong Joſhua, and be ſtrong ye people of the land, &amp;c. it pleaſed God ſoe to compoſe and calme and quiet ſpirits, that all apprehenſions were laid aſide, and they went about the worke of the Lord very comfortably and were much encouraged. After which time how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he was to England, to New-England, to magiſtrates, miniſters, people, in publique, in private, by preachings, counſells, diſſolving hard knots, and anſwering difficult queſtions, all knew, that knew the grace of God ſoe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifeſted in him. What ſcriptures he went over on Lords dayes in expounding and preaching, I cannot certainly ſay, becauſe I was of another church, ſerving there according to the grace beſtowed upon me; but ſurely he went through very many, for on his lecture dayes he preached over the whole booke of the Revelation, Eccleſiaſtes and Canticles, the 2d and 3d Epiſtles of John, the 2 Epiſtles of Timothy, with divers others, all which ſhews the unwearied paines which he tooke in the Lords worke, beſides all the bookes that were written by him, and other unknowne labours that he went through. I could ſpeake much more, but at this preſent want ſtrength, but this I ſay, he may be a patterne to us all, and happy they that come neareſt him, in thoſe things wherein he moſt followed Chriſt. I am not like to live to ſee ſuch another in N. E. though I know God is able to double the ſpirit of that Elias upon him that ſucceeds him, and upon many others in our native country and here. It is well for both the Boſtons, that they had ſuch a light, if they walke in the light, and continue in that word of Chriſt and light of grace and truth that he held out to them. I end all with that of our Saviour concerning John-Baptiſt, he was a burning and ſhining light, and God graunt the after words be not verified of both Englands
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:011300_0127_0F86A06169D5DAA8"/>
and both Boſtons. I ſpeake my feares, but would be glad to entertaine better hopes. My prayers ſhall be that it may never be ſaid as of old, <hi>Fuimus Troes, fuit Ilyum, ſed jam ſeges eſt ubi Troja fuit. Fuimus fideles, fuimus <gap reason="foreign">

               <opener>To the right reverend and my very honourable good Lord, John Lord Biſhop of Lincoln, at his pallace in Kurkden, preſent theſe. <salute>My very good Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is now above twenty yeares agoe, ſince by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God and (for a good part of this time) by your Lordſhips lawfull favour, I have enjoyed the happines to miniſter to the church of God at Boſton, a remote corner of your Lordſhips dioceſſe. What I have done there, all this while, and how I have ſpent my time and courſe, I muſt ere long give account to the great ſhepherd of the ſheep, the biſhop of our ſoules. Meane while, give me leave to make your Lordſhip this ſhort account: The bent of my courſe hath been (according to my weake mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) to make and keep a 3 fold chriſtian concord amongſt the people; between God and their conſcience; between true hearted loyaltie and chriſtian liberty; between the fear of God and the love of one another. That wherein I have moſt ſeemed to your Lordſhip to fayle (to witt in not diſcerning chriſtian liberty to practiſe ſome commands of authority, in ſome circumſtances) I doe humbly thanke your Lordſhip, and freely acknowledge, your Lordſhip
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:011300_0128_0F86A06185FD2078"/>
hath not been wanting freely and often to admoniſh me thereof, and that with ſuch wiſdom and gravity, and with ſuch well tempered authority and mildneſs, that I profeſs unfeynedly noe outward reſpect in the world could have deteyned me from requeſting your Lordſhips favour with ready ſubjection to your Lordſhips counſell, that I might have prolonged myne owne peace and your Lordſhips fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour together, but ſo it is (my good Lord) though I doe unfeynedly and deſervedly honour your Lordſhip, and highly eſteem many hundreths of other reverend divines, great lights of the church (in compariſon of whom what am I poore ſparke?) who doubt not of their liberty in thoſe matters; yet to this day (I ſpeake in the ſimplicity of my heart) I can only follow your Lordſhip with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and them with reverence, but not with that plero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phory of fayth in theſe thinges which in ſuch caſes the apoſtle requireth, Rom. 14.5. Your Lordſhip well knoweth it is both the apoſtles and prophets principle (and it holdeth in every righteous man from the meaneſt to the greateſt) <hi>Juſtus ex fide ſuâ vivit, non alienâ,</hi> and therefore, howſoever I doe highly prize and much preferre other mens judgment and learning, and wiſdom, and piety, yet in thinges pertaining to God and his worſhip, ſtill, I muſt (as I ought) live by mine own fayth, not theirs. Nevertheleſs, where I cannot yeeld obedience of fayth, I am willing to yeeld patience of hope.</p>
               <p>And now, my good lord, I ſee the Lord who began a yeare or two agoe to ſuſpend (after a ſort) my miniſtry from that place by a long and ſoare ſickneſs (the dregs whereof ſtill hang about me) doth now putt a further ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon me, wholly to lay down my miniſtry there, and freely to reſigne my place into your Lordſhips hands. For I ſee neither my bodily health, nor the peace of the church will now ſtand with my continuance there. I doe now therefore humbly crave this laſt favour at your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips hand, to accept my place as voyd, and to admitt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a ſucceſſor as your Lordſhip ſhall finde fitt, and the patron (which is the corporation of Boſton) ſhall preſent to
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:011300_0128_0F86A06185FD2078"/>
you therefor. The congregation is great, and the church duetyes many, and thoſe, many times, requiring cloſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and I would be very loth the ſervice of God, or the helpe of the people ſhould be in any ſort neglected by my long diſcontinuance.</p>
               <p>What though this reſignation of my place into your Lordſhips hands may be defective in ſome forme of law; yet I truſt your Lordſhip will never forgett the auncient moderation and aequity of that honourable and high court of chauncery, whereunto your Lordſhip was advanced, to temper the rigour of legall juſtice, to the relief of many diſtreſſed. Never (I thinke) came there any cauſe before your Lordſhip more diſtreſſed, nor more juſtly craving chriſtian aequity.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord of heaven and earth ſoe guide and keep and bleſſe your Lordſhip on earth, that he may delight to crown your Lordſhip with honour in heaven, at the end of your dayes, through Jeſus Chriſt.

of his highneſs Oliver lord protecter of England, Scotland and Ireland, we well knowing what greate reſpect you owe unto the ſtate of England, and not doubting of your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in any thing you can to manifeſt the ſame to them, are therefore encouraged to make theſe few propoſitions in the name of his highneſs and the ſtate of England.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you would be pleaſed to declare that if the Engliſh inhabitting in the country of Accadia be at any time aſſaulted with an enemie, or in any occaſion of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helpe from this government, you will aſſiſt us with ſuch men as we may ſtand in neede of, we paying for them according to the cuſtome of paying ſouldiers in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in any ſervice you employ them in.</p>

               <p>Many reaſons we might give, and ſhall if deſired, why there might be a compliance with us in this our requeſt, but we hope that reſpect and compliance with England will be argument enough to admit this favour in which we hope we attend much the good of theſe plantations, and be confident you ſhall finde us readie to our power to ſerve you either here or in any place God ſhall caſte us in, and remaine your humble ſervants,</p>

               <p>YOUR letter wee received and returne you this anſwer, that wee are very glad and approve of the accompts you ſent over by the laſt, which are or may be ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the manifold objections have of late ariſen about the ſame, for when (through mercy) our demeanors had ſtopped the mouths of all men heere, then the greate quere was, whether things ſent were not miſapplied with you in New-England. And truly you would wonder had wee but time to relate the ſeverall ſorts of objections, which for the moſt part turne all to obſtructions for a ſeaſon; till by the elaborate paines of Mr. Winſlow, wee are forced to take off and remove the ſame, you wrote to us not to ſend any more goods till you ſent for them, and to tye ourſelves to ſuch and only ſuch proviſions to be ſent. We are very well ſattisfied therewith, and thereupon ſhall deceive the expectation of divers, that have written for letters, for printing paper, &amp;c. and indeed in ſo writing you ſeem to underſtand your owne power and truſt, but give us leave to tell you there is ſuch a material objection here ſtarted as wee are aſhamed of and know not how to anſwer, viz. the manifold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made by Mr. Elliot to ſundry his friends here, that you allow him but £. 20 per ann. which doth not beare his charges, inſomuch as he runnes in debt every yeare more and more, and is diſabled for giving his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren that education he otherwiſe would. Now whether it be or no wee know not, but verily believe the worke will ſuffer ſome thouſands of pounds by it, for it flyeth like lightning and takes like tinder, men being extreame glad

to meete with any thing may colour over theire covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and dull theire zeale in ſo good a worke: Nay Mr. Peters who, but fourteene daies before, told Mr. Winſlow in plaine termes he heard the worke was but a plaine cheate, and that there was no ſuch thing as goſpell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion amongſt the Indians, preſently after, charged the ſame man upon a letter he received from Mr. Weld, by information from Mr. Elliot that you the commiſſioners for the united colonies forbad the worke in that you would not allow competent maintenance to Mr. Elliot, and others that laboured therein; and however wee have otherwiſe charitable thoughts of Peters yett he hath been a very bad inſtrument all along towards this worke, who (though of a committee in the army for the advance of it amongſt them) yett proteſted againſt contributing a penny to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it in perſon, and indeede ſome of us have been faine to intreate the reſt of the gentlemen not to trouble him any further in the buſines, nor know wee any cauſe unleſſe it be that the worke is coming to ſuch perfection and he hath not had the leaſt hand or finger in it.

Wee are farr from juſtifying Mr. Elliott in his turbulent and clamorous proceedings, but the beſt of Gods ſervants have their faylings, and as ſuch ſo we looke upon him.

and powerfull entrance into the hearts of theſe poore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, but it is an afflicting conſideration that the worke ſhould receive any diſcouragement or hinderance either from Mr. Elliotts penn or Mr. Peters ſpeech. By a letter ſigned by Mr. Winſlow in the name and by order of the honnored Corporation, dated May the 1ſt 1652, wee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what inconvenience did or might grow by the collections and diſburſments made by Mr. Butcher not put into the corporation ſtocke and account, which (with you) wee deſired might be brought into your treaſury, as the right channell, accordingly wee enquired of Mr. Elliott what ſomes are ſent over yearely upon thoſe more private accounts and how imployed, what part to the Indians, and what to himſelfe and others who labour in the worke; he acknowledged ſome conſiderable ſomes of money came that way to his hands, but was ſlowe to give any account how much or how expended; heereupon wee did conceive that 20 <abbr>

                  </abbr> per ann. added to what he received by other meanes out of England and what he received from the church of Roxbury (which as we heare is not leſſe than 60<abbr>

                  </abbr> per ann.) might ſufficiently mayntaine his family and afford due education to his children without running him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into debt. We ſhall now allow him forty pounds per ann. and, if there be cauſe, ſhall readily enlarge further, and ſo to Mr. Mayhew; all wee propound is, that as our maſters acceptance is ſufficient, nay rich wages, for any care or paines of ours in this worke, ſo there may be ſome due proportion (as neere as wee can judge) betwixt the imployment and incouragement of other inſtruments. Through the bleſſing of him who is love itſelf and the God of peace, the Commmiſſioners now mett at Hartford doe comfortably cloſe, as in the affaires of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo in the other occaſions of the confaederation, and hope they ſhall ſo proceede.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rawſon hath ſent his accounts for the yeare paſt to the Commiſſioners now met at Hartford, but upon peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall wee finde ſomething defective or obſcure, ſo that wee returned them to him to be perfected, and muſt deſire the Commiſſioners for the Maſſachuſetts to review and upon their approbation to underwrite and ſend them for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

               <head>The Narrative follows.</head>
               <p>MY ſelfe, whoſe name is underwritten, being impowered by the Commiſſioners of the united Colonies, bearing date the 25th Sept. 1654, doe declare the particular acts of the proceeding of the councill of warre being aſſembled at Thomas Stantons, according to the inſtructions received from the ſaid Commiſſioners, as followeth.</p>
               <p>Imprimis, our firſt inſtruction being forthwith to march into the Nyanticke countrey, the place of Ninnigrets or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary place of reſidence, and to demand of him (if he may be ſpoke with) the Pequotts, &amp;c. The reaſons why wee did not attend to that particular was, wee knew he was removed from that place up into the woods into a ſwamp, ſome 15 myles from our quarters, and further, by a ſtorm the boates of Conecticott and Newhaven, whereas all were to meete 13 October 54, we ſay, the boates and ſome of the ſouldiers with their ſtocke of ammunition came not to us untill the 16th day the one, and the 17th day the other. Further, we had one clauſe in our inſtructions to act as might ſtand with the honour of the Engliſh and the ſafety of the countrey, but for us to move with our forces wee thought it would make great rumour to ſtirr amongſt the Indians, when they ſhould heare wee were returned to our quarters and did nothing; therefore wee thought it would expedite our worke to attend that that was preſented to us, which are as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="unknown:011300_0135_0F86A068F8A00478"/>Firſt, Ninnegret haveing ſome of his Indians preſent with us, who as we ſuppoſed were willing to ſalve up things as well as they could, we agreed to ſend ſome of them to him to adviſe him to come and ſpeake with us, but we haveing intelligence of his great feare to conſent to this motion, wee offered him hoſtages for the ſecurity of his perſon, and if this pleaſed him not, he ſhould acquaint us what he would deſire to ſecure him; his anſwer was, by 4 of his men, that one of our Indians had taken away a canoe of his and made prize of it, and upon this he was more afraid than before.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, He demanded what he had done to the Engliſh that they came ſo againſt him round about, and will not let him alone, and he would deſire to tranſact this buſines by meſſengers, and not come face to face.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, He ſaid his father was a friend to the Engliſh in former times, and he wondered they ſhould be ſo againſt him now. Our anſwer to theſe things were as followeth. Firſt, wee knew nothing of the canoe, and that if any of our Indians had wronged him in this kind they ſhould reſtore it againe; but they would not forbeare this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſo wee ſent them away with theſe following an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, Firſt, wee wondered that he, a wiſe man as he would be accounted, that he ſhould offer to hold us in diſcourſe about ſuch a trifle as a canoe is, either he muſt be unwiſe himſelfe, or thinke us unwiſe, if wee ſhould be delayed with ſuch things at theſe. 2dly, That it was not the faſhion of the Engliſh to tranſact things of ſuch a nature by meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers from an ambaſſador, but to come face to face. 3dly, If this courſe might have beene taken, wee could have done this from the place of our habitation, without raiſing theſe forces. The 16th, there came ſome of the Pequotts and told us that, the day before this, they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Ninnegretts company to perſwade their kindred to come from him, fearing otherwiſe it would goe ill with them, but they met with three Pequotts that did adhere to Ninegrett, who aſked them what they did there, they ſaid they had ſomething to doe; then they aſked our Pequotts
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:011300_0136_0F86A069B4EE9920"/>
how many there were of them, they ſaid 30, then ſaid the 3 men there are 30 heads for us; then our Pequotts ſaid they did attend the Engliſh to carrey letters or burthens abroad, where the Engliſh ſhould have occaſion to ſend them, then one of the 3 men told them they would have their 30 heads before to morrow in the afternoone, though the Engliſh men were with them, and they ſaid they would not deſert from the warr againſt the Long Iſlanders, neither would they forſake Ninegrett. This day they came into us and gave in their names to the number of 73. The 17th day there came into us more Pequotts that lived neere to Ninegrett, which, before, wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bring away their houſes and goods, which things they did, and gave in their names as the reſt to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 36. The 18th day, Ninegrett ſtill keeping off and would no ways comply with us, wee agreed and ſent two gentlemen with two to attend them, and two inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters to make ſome demands of him; but there being ſixe he refuſed to ſpeake with above two of them, but after much debate with his ſcours and ſome of his chiefe men, they came to ſpeake with them, viz. Capt. Davis and Capt. Seely, and firſt they demanded the Pequotts under him, his anſwer was, why doe yee demand the Pequotts of me when you have them already? they demanded more, his anſwer was he had not above 3 or 4 with him, but the reſt were diſpoſed abroad a hunting and elſewhere, but in the iſſue he ingaged by writing to ſurrender all that were under him into the hands of Mr. Winthrop or Capt. Maſon within ſeven days. 2dly, They demanded the tribute due for the Pequotts, his anſwer was he never engaged for them; he was told he payd it at New-Haven; he ſaid the reaſon of that was he feared they would have been taken from him, therefore he payd 9 or 10 fathom of his owne peage to make up the ſome. 3dly, They further required not to make any more war againſt the Long Iſland Indians, to this he was ſilent for a time, but after ſaid this; Shall ſuch a prince and two ſuch captains looſe their lives and their blood not be revenged? the anſwer to this was,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:011300_0136_0F86A069B4EE9920"/>
he muſt act in a right way by making the commiſſioners acquainted with it, but he was ſilent. Further he was charged not to moleſt them nor any other of the friends of the Engliſh leſt his head were ſet up upon an Engliſh pole. Alſo he was informed that none of ours ſhould moleſt him. 4thly, The charges of this expedition was demanded of him, his anſwer was he was not the cauſe of it, but the Long Iſland Indians killed him a man at Connecticott.</p>

               <p>ABOUT twelve days ſince I wrote to you by Capt. Collens, wherein I gave you a large account of our proceedings in this iſland of the Barbadoes; how that by Gods bleſſing we attained our paſſage in five weekes, made the 2500 men we landed 6000, and becauſe our ſtores for the army were not as yet come up cloſe we ſhould loſe the drie ſeaſon and my lords honor ſuffer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and have ſcrabled up ſo many arms as to make the 1500, we here brought, 6000 or near thereabout: that we raiſed two ſmall troopes of horſe upon the iſland and gotten ſuch and ſo many other ſtores as we are to ſett ſaile this evening from the place: We thought to have gone the 24th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant but could not attaine thereunto. Since which time came Capt. Haſſefield of London and tells us of the Great Charity, that ſhe was at ſea with him; but ſaies that ſhe with many others in company were forced back by the fowle weather. This gentleman was above two months, from Falmouth hither, and tells us our ſtoreſhips were in the Downes with a ſafe convoy and believes they will

We have agreed to order the Great Charity to ſtay heer till our ſtores come up and then to convey them to us. The general hath ſettled the militia of the iſland and given commiſſion to fowre regiments of horſe and fowre of foote and made the governor his lieutenant-generall and Col.

We have made bold to refer our commiſſioners to make uſe of their exciſe office whereof the governor had a 3d, which 3d we ſtill leave him to poſſeſſe; but whereas they call upon their articles I tell them they have broken that article, for whereas they were to pay the publick debts of the iſland therewith they have received all thoſe two yeares profitts paſt and we none at all, and now we ſhall reape the cropp of this 3d yeare, but with a greate deale of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to many.

                  <salute>Much honoured Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is my humble and earneſt petition unto God and you, that you may ſo be pleaſed to exerciſe command over your own ſpirits that you may not mind myſelfe nor the Engliſh of theſe parts (unworthy with myſelf of your eye) but only that face of equitie (Engliſh and chriſtian) which I humbly hope may appeare in theſe repreſentations following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="unknown:011300_0141_0F86A070745B36A8"/>Firſt, May it pleaſe you to remember, that concerning the town of Warwick (in this colonie) there lies a ſuite of £. 2000 dammages againſt you before his highnes and the lords of his councell, I doubt not if you ſo pleaſe but that (as Mr. Winſlow and myſelf had well nigh ordered it) ſome gentlemen from yourſelves and ſome from Warwick deputed, may friendly and eaſily determine that affair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Indians which pretend your name at Warwick and Pawtuxet (and yet live as barbarouſly if not more than any in the country) pleaſe you to know their inſolences upon ourſelves and cattell (unto £. 20 dammages per annum) are inſufferable by Engliſh ſpirits; and pleaſe you to give credence that to all theſe they pretend your name and affirme that they dare not (for offending you) agree with us, nor come to rules of righteous neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, only they know you favour us not and therefore ſend us for redreſſe unto you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Concerning four Engliſh families at Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuxet, may it pleaſe you to remember that two controverſies they have long (under your name) maintained with us, to a conſtant obſtructing of all order and authoritie amongſt us.</p>
               <p>To our complaint about our lands they lately have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a willingnes to arbitrate, but to obey his highnes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in this charter, they ſay, they dare not for your ſakes, though they live not by your lawes, nor bear your common charges nor ours, but evade both under colour of your authoritie.</p>
               <p>Honoured Sirs, I cordially proſeſſe it before the moſt high, that I believe it, if not only they but ourſelves and all the whole country, by joint conſent, were ſubject to your government, it might be a rich mercy; but as things yet are, and ſince it pleaſed firſt the parliament, and then the lord admirall and committee for foraigne plantations, and ſince the councell of ſtate, and laſtly the lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and his councell, to continue us as a diſtinct colonie, yea and ſince it hath pleaſed yourſelves by publick letters and references to us from your publick courts to owne
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:011300_0141_0F86A070745B36A8"/>
the authoritie of his Highnes amongſt us; be pleaſed to conſider how unſuitable it is for yourſelves (if theſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at Pawtuxet plead truth) to be the obſtructers of all orderly proceedings amongſt us; for I humbly appeale to your owne wiſedomes and experience how unlikely it is for a people to be compelled to order and common charges, when others in their boſoms are by ſuch (ſeeming) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie exempted from both.</p>
               <p>And therefore (laſtly) be pleaſed to know, that there are (upon the point) but two families which are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and deſtructive to an equall proceeding of civill order amongſt us; for one of theſe 4 families, Stephen Arnold, deſires to be uniforme with us; a ſecond Zacharie Rhodes, being in the way of dipping is (potentially) baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you. Only Wm. Arnold and Wm. Carpenter (very far allſo in religion from you, if you knew all) they have ſome coulour, yet in a late conference they all plead that all the obſtacle is their offending of yourſelves.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas (I humbly conceave) with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this colonie your commerce is as great as with any in the countrey, and our dangers (being a frontier people to the Barbarians) are greater than thoſe of other colonies, and the ill conſequences to yourſelves would be not a few nor ſmall, and to the whole land, were we firſt maſſacred or maſtered by them. I pray your aequall and favourable reflection upon that your law which prohibits us to buy of you all meanes of our neceſſary defence of our lives and families (yea in this moſt bloudy and maſſacring time.)</p>
               <p>We are informed that tickets have rarely bene denied to any Engliſh of the country; yea the barbarians (tho' notorious in lyes) if they profeſſe ſubjection, they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: Only ourſelves, by former and later denyall, ſeem to be devoted to be the Indian ſhambles and maſſacres.</p>
               <p>The barbarians all the land over are filled with artillerie and ammunition from the Dutch, openly and horridly, and from all the Engliſh over the country (by ſtealth) I know they abound ſo wonderfully, that their activitie and inſolencie is grown ſo high, that they dayly conſult and
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:011300_0142_0F86A0720953E0E0"/>
hope and threaten to render us ſlaves, as they long ſince (and now moſt horribly) have made the Dutch.</p>
               <p>For myſelfe (as through Gods goodneſs) I have refuſed the gaine of thouſands by ſuch a murtherous trade, and think no law yet extant amongſt yourſelves or us ſecure enough againſt ſuch a villainie; ſo am I loath to ſee ſo many hundreds (if not ſome thouſands) in this colonie deſtroyed like fools and beaſts without reſiſtance: I grieve that ſo much bloud ſhould cry againſt yourſelves, yea and I grieve that (at this inſtant by theſe ſhips) this cry and the premiſſes ſhould now trouble his highnes and his councell. For the ſeaſonable preventing of which is this humble addreſs preſented to your wiſdome, by him who deſires to be</p>

At my laſt returne from England I preſented your then honoured governor, Mr. Bellingham, with an order of the lords of the councell for my free taking ſhip or landing at your parts, unto which it pleaſed Mr. Bellingham to ſend me his aſſent in writing, I humbly crave the recording of it by yourſelves, leaſt forgetfullnes hereafter againe put me upon ſuch diſtreſſes as, God knows, I ſuffered when I laſt paſt through your colonie to our native country.</p>

               <p>MAY it pleaſe this much honoured aſſembly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that, as an officer and in the name of Providence Colonie. I preſented you with our humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:011300_0142_0F86A0720953E0E0"/>
before winter, unto which not receaving anſwer I addreſſed myſelfe this ſpring to your much honoured Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who was pleaſed to adviſe our ſending of ſome of Providence to your aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Honoured Sirs, our firſt requeſt (in ſhort) was and is, for your favourable conſideration of the long and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table condition of the town of Warwick, which hath been thus. They are ſo dangerouſly and ſo vexatiouſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with the Barbarians, that I have long admired the wonderfull power of God in reſtraining and preventing very great fires, of mutuall ſlaughters, breaking forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them.</p>
               <p>Your wiſedomes know the inhumane inſultations of theſe wild creatures, and you may be pleaſed alſo to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that they have not bene ſparing of your name as the patron of all their wickednes againſt our Engliſh men, women and children, and cattle to the yearely dammage of 60, 80 and 100<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>The remedie is (under God) only your pleaſure that Pumham ſhall come to an agreement with the towne or colonie, and that ſome convenient way and time be ſet for their removall.</p>
               <p>And that your wiſdomes may ſee juſt grounds for ſuch your willingneſs, be pleaſed to be informed of a realitie of a ſolemne covenant betweene this town of Warwick and Pumham, unto which, notwithſtanding that he pleads his being drawne to it by the awe of his ſuperiour Sachims, yet I humbly offer that what was done was according to the law and tenour of the natives (I take it) in all New England and America, viz. that the inferiour Sachims and ſubjects ſhall plant and remove at the pleaſure of the higheſt and ſupreme Sachims, and I humbly conceave that it pleaſeth the Moſt High and only Wiſe to make uſe of ſuch a bond of authoritie over them, without which they could not long ſubſiſt in humane ſocieties, in this wild condition wherein they are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pleaſe you not to be inſenſible of the ſlipperie and dangerous condition of this their intermingled cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:011300_0143_0F86A073348991D8"/>
I am humbly confident, that all the Engliſh towns and plantations in all New-England put together ſuffer not ſuch moleſtation from the natives as this one towne and people. It is ſo great and ſo oppreſſive that I have dayly feared the tidings of ſome publicke fire and miſchief.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be pleaſed to review this copie from the lord admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and that this Engliſh towne of Warwick ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, alſo that if any of yours were there planted they ſhould by your authoritie be removed. And we humbly conceave that if the Engliſh (whoſe removes are difficult and chargeable) how much more theſe wild ones, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move with little more trouble and dammage then the wild beaſts of the wildernes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pleaſe you to be informed that this ſmall neck (wherein they keepe and mingle fields with the Engliſh) is a very den of wickednes, where they not only practice the horrid barbariſms of all kind of whoredoms, idolatries and conjurations but living without all exerciſe of actual authoritie, and getting ſtore of liquors (to our griefe) there is a confidence and rendezvous of all the wildeſt and moſt licentious natives and practices of the whole country.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſide ſatisfaction to Pumham and the former inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this neck, there is a competitour who muſt allſo be ſatisfied, another Sachim, one Nawwuſhawſuck, who (living with Ouſamaquin) layes claime to this place, and are at dayly fewd with Pumham (to my knowledge) about the title and lordſhip of it. Hoſtilitie is daily threatned.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond requeſt concerns 2 or 3 Engliſh families at Pawtuxet who, before our charter, ſubjected themſelves unto your juriſdiction. It is true, there are many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances betweene many of the town of Providence and them, and theſe I humbly conceave may beſt he ordered to be compoſed by reference.</p>
               <p>But (2) we have formerly made our addreſſes and now doe for your prudent removall of this great and long obſtruction to all due order and regular proceedings among us, viz. the refuſall of theſe families (pretending your name) to conforme with us unto his Highnes authoritie amongſt us.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="281" facs="unknown:011300_0143_0F86A073348991D8"/>3. Your wiſedomes experimentally know how apt men are to ſtumble at ſuch an exemption from all duties and ſervices from all rates and charges either with yourſelves or us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This obſtruction is ſo great and conſtant, that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your prudent removall of it) it is impoſſible that either his Highnes or yourſelves can expect ſuch ſatisfaction and obſervance from us as we deſire to render.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as before, we promiſed ſatisfaction to the natives at Warwick (and ſhall all poſſible ways endeavour their content) ſo we humbly offer as to theſe our countrymen, Firſt, as to grievances depending, that references may ſettle them. 2dly, For the future, the way will be open for their enjoyment of votes and privileges, of chooſing or being choſen to any office in towne or colonie.</p>
               <p>Our third requeſt is for your favourable leave to us to buy of your merchants fower or more barrells of powder yearely, with ſome convenient proportion of artillerie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our hazardous frontier ſituation to theſe Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who from their abundant ſupply of armes from the Dutch (and perſidious Engliſh all the land over) are full of our artillerie, which hath rendered them exceedingly inſolent, provoking and threatning, eſpecially the inlanders which have their ſupply from the fort of Aurania. We have bene eſteemed by ſome of you as your thornie hedge on this ſide of you; If ſo, yet an hedge to be maintained: If as out ſentinells, yet not to be diſcouraged. And if there be a jealouſie of the ill uſe of ſuch a favour, pleaſe you to be aſſured that a credible perſon in each towne ſhall have the diſpoſe and managing of ſuch ſupplies according to the true intent and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For the obtaining of theſe our juſt and neceſſary peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have no inducement or hope from ourſelves; only we pray you to remember that the matters prayed are no way diſhonourable to yourſelves and we humbly conceave doe greatly promote the honour and pleaſure of his Highnes, yea of the Moſt High allſo, and laſtly, ſuch

               <p n="1">1. Firſt, wee cannot (without breach of charitie) but take it for a thing graunted generally by the inhabitants of the united colonies, that an able orthodox miniſtry is a precious fruite of Chriſt's death, reſurrection and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and neceſſary for the ſpiritual good of his people, and to be duely ſought after in every ſociety or townſhip within the ſeveral juriſdictions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſecondly, that a competent maintenance propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the abilitie of the place and neceſſitie of the miniſter is a debt of juſtice not charitie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence thirdly, the miniſter may juſtly expect it from that ſocietie and townſhip wherein he labours.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The reference or relation of a miniſter being to the whole ſocietie joyntly, whether in church order or not, his expectation of maintenance, and the debt of juſtice, is from the whole ſocietie joyntly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Although the ſocietie may according to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion uſe divers wayes to raiſe this maintainance, yet if the wayes be ineffectual (though the defect may be in ſome particular perſons) the ſocietie cannot be diſcharged, but is the debtor.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="286" facs="unknown:011300_0146_0F86A076951779A0"/>6. The ingagement being upon the ſocietie, and that according to religion and right reaſon, it neceſſarily follows that the ſociety be enabled with ſufficient power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Therefore the generall court ſhould declare ſuch a power to be in ſuch ſocieties, that there may be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in them for want thereof, and if any ſocietie or townſhip ſhall be wanting, either out of neglect or opinion, to procure and maintaine as aboveſaid an orthodoxe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry according to the goſpell, wee conceive (by the rules of ſcripture and the practiſe not only of all chriſtian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments but even of heathen who not only held their ſacra in veneration but tooke care of thoſe that had the keeping of them and the charge of making knowne their miſteries) the ſeverall generall courts ſtand charged with the care that the people profeſſing chriſtianitie owne and live according to rules and ordinances of their profeſſion, and that the diſpenſers of them be incouraged as aforeſaid. The maintenance of the miniſtry being a debt of juſtice from the ſocietie and the ſocietie impowered to diſcharge it, if any particular perſon ſhall be defective to the ſocietie they ought to be ordered by the ordinary courſe of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Theſe generalls wee thought meete to propoſe, from whence wee leave to the wiſdome of the generall court to draw up ſuch concluſions and orders as may attaine the end deſired. And if any of the members of the ſaid court ſhould not concur (at preſent) with our apprehenſions, wee doe earneſtly deſire that by all meanes they would labour to informe and ſatisfy themſelves of the trueth of the particulars aboveſaid, whereof wee (for our parts) have noe doubt. Wee doe further propoſe to the ſeverall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall courts that all Quakers, Ranters, and other notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heretickes be prohibited comeing into the united co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies and if any ſhall hereafter come or arriſe amongſt us, that they be forthwith ſecured or removed out of all the juriſdictions.

                  <p>Of which ſort are theſe, viz.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That ſuch lawes (though called libertyes) yet more properly they may be called rights, and in this ſenſe this may be added as a third fundamentall law, viz.</p>
                  <p>That no cuſtome or precedent ought to prevayle in any morall caſe, that may appear to be ſinnfull in reſpect of the breach of any law of piety againſt the firſt table, or of righteouſneſſe againſt the ſecond.</p>

I did
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:011300_0148_0F86A0781D26C4C0"/>
expreſſe ſome grounds of my judgment to be ſeen in the records. Now I ſhall add further what doth induce me to that apprehenſion in the caſe, viz.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This may be given as a reaſon, that it is againſt a fundamentall law in nature to be compelled to pay that which others doe give. For then no man hath any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynty or right to what he hath, if it be in the power of others (by pretence of authority or without) to give it away (when in their prudence they conceive it to be for the benefit of the owner) without his owne conſent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This to me is ſome ſtrengthning to induce my apprehenſion in this caſe, viz. That notwithſtanding in England, it cannot be denied, but that mens eſtates were ſometymes unduly taken from them: Some by force, ſome by fraud, ſome by ſiniſter wreſting of evidences, yea, and ſometimes of lawe itſelfe, as about knighthood-money, ſhipmoney, &amp;c. yet I dare ſay, if ſearch be made into hiſtories, lawyers bookes of reports, &amp;c. it cannot be made to appeare that in the moſt exorbitant times any man hath had his eſtate taken from him as by the guift of others, under colour of lawe, or countenance of authority. Noe, noe, lawyers would have bluſhed to have given ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of lawes; and ſuddenly their faces would have waxed pale. For the Kinge would have beene too wiſe to have owned the plea. And what would all wiſe men have ſaid for ſuch taking away the greateſt outward right or liberty from them? For it may be underſtood, that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volencies, incouraging gratuities, leaves, or privy ſeales, were not required by lawe, or by pretence of lawe, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired as by favour. However they were obtained by ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and tyrannicall meanes, as was apprehended.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay further, and I doe argue it from the greater to the leſſe. That if noe kinge or parliament can juſtly enact and cauſe that one mans eſtate, in whole or in part, may be taken from him and given to another without his owne conſent, then ſurely the major part of a towne or other inferior powers cannot doe it. But ſhew us any man that can produce any footſtep for ſuch a way, either directly or indirectly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="unknown:011300_0148_0F86A0781D26C4C0"/>But to the contrary it appeareth unto me. See Dalton page 401. where it is to this effect. That the kinge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not releaſe a man out of priſon (being in at a private mans ſuit) to his damage, without his owne conſent. Alſo to the ſame purpoſe ſee Sir Henry Finch, recorder of London, in his firſt booke of lawe, page 74, having ended his rules about native or fundamentall lawes, he ſaith in the next page, Therefore lawes poſitive doe loſe their force and are noe lawes at all, which are directly contrary to the former viz. native or fundamentall.</p>
                  <p>The parliament may tax (and that juſtly) the whole country to give a guift or reward to one man for ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for they are betruſted ſoe to doe. The reaſon is, it is levied upon the whole country, with their conſent, and for the immediate benefitt of the whole.</p>
                  <p>But if they ſhould doe it between perſons (though they ſhould ſoe doe by power, and the perſon wronged hath noe remedy in this world) yet it would be accounted ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Is it not to take from Peter and give it to Paul?</p>
                  <p>If one man, for ſuch or ſuch a turne or good end, may juſtly be deprived of a fundamentall right or liberty, then an other and an other, and ſo every man. In England there is but one ſort of men that might be deprived of their goods; which ſort are uſually called ſlaves but there they are called villeynes to the lord of the mannor.</p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning fundamentall lawe, in reference to mine and thine, not to be given or taken away without his owne conſent.</p>
                  <p>But now to anſwer ſome objections that may be made to the caſe in hande.</p>
                  <p>Objection. Suppoſe it be true what is expreſſed, and granted that he were a ſtrange man that ſhould deny the ſame in the generall: Yet, notwithſtanding, it hindereth not but that a towne (when and as often as they thinke good, in their prudence) may doe it for good ends, and ſoe (in ſpeciall caſes) it may lawfully be done in the particular, upon the lawe made page the 9th, <hi>that every inhabitant
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:011300_0149_0F86A0794DCA22D8"/>
ſhall contribute to all charges in church and commonwealth (whereof he doth or may receive a benefitt) elſe he ſhall be ſtrayned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer. I conceive that it is an extreame diſhonour caſt upon the generall court, to make ſuch a conſtruction of their poſitive laws as doth infringe the fundamentall law of mine and thine; for it muſt needs be voyd, if it ſhould indeed be neceſſaryly conſtrued againſt the right or liberty of the ſubject. But the law in its true ſenſe is good.</p>
                  <p>Before this recited law was made, though ſome churches, or townes rather, did agree how much yearely maintenance the miniſter ſhould have, yet it was not rated, at leaſt in any compellable way by the towne, but men did pay their proportion in a way of voluntary contribution. But ſome (eſpecially non members) ſome of them did grow ſlacke; and ſo the burthen grew too hevy upon church members, &amp;c. And upon conſideration it was found lawfull to make a law to compell every one to beare his owne ſhare; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as by hearing the word and publique prayer, &amp;c. he did or might receive a benefitt and (in a way of God) be received as a member with the reſt. And yet the law was framed ſoe, as ſuch churches as choſe to goe in a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way of weekly contribution or ſoe, might ſoe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, notwithſtanding this law, as ſome churches in this country doe to this day.</p>
                  <p>But for the right underſtanding of the word <hi>benefitt</hi> in the law, it is worthy the conſideration or attendance, that benefit and neceſſary duty muſt goe together. The law both of God and the country doth require people to goe to the meeting for publique worſhip.</p>
                  <p>But it is not underſtood that any law doth provide that every towne ſhall buy or build a houſe for the miniſter as often as there is a removall by death or otherwiſe, I mean to be his in propriety.</p>
                  <p>Let us a little examine the poynt of <hi>benefitt</hi> that a man doth or may receive, as a motive to ſuch a gift.</p>

                  <p>And if you ſhould onely conſider matter of <hi>benefitt</hi> (not at all in this conſideration minding the poynt of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe or unlawfullneſſe in being compelled to pay) though it be not material to the caſe (as hath been ſayd) whether it be <hi>benefitt</hi> or not in this reſpect, yet then the other way voted by the towne, viz. for the miniſtry, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law provided, (by ſo generall if not univerſall conſent) is to be compared with this way now ſtrayned for, to underſtand which way turnes the ſcale for matter of <hi>benefitt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that layeth downe a ſumm of money in hand for worke to be done, gives juſt occaſion for others to take into the conſideration whether a mans life be ſoe certayne or his continuance in the place and worke is made ſo ſure as that it is a <hi>benefitt</hi> to goe in that way rather than in the other: For in any matter of this kind, rightly to underſtand whether ſoe or ſoe be a <hi>benefitt,</hi> yea or noe, both the preſent and future arguments muſt be weighed together.</p>
                  <p>Obj. But if any ſhould object and ſay there is noe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betweene the <hi>benefitt</hi> that ariſeth by the miniſters function amongſt people and externall temporall goods, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. It is fully granted in one ſenſe, but not in the ſenſe of our enquiry. Here externall <hi>benefitt</hi> (in the compariſon) is the thing conſiderable, as that the labourer is worthy of his hire.</p>
                  <p>For if the objecter ſhould have men otherwiſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the matter of <hi>benefitt,</hi> he muſt alter his mind upon this conſideration: Whoever doth but ride through the towne, and the people being met at that tyme, the ſtranger comes in and ſpeaks ſome heavenly truths amongſt them: Is not this of greater value than all the lands, houſes and cattle in the towne? And is it therefore legall and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if the major part preſent doe give him 100 <abbr>

But the law urged fol. 9. expreſſeth civill charges as well as eccleſiaſticall; therefore, though it were a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the commonwealth ſo to interpret generall ſentences in poſitive or court lawes;<note place="margin">This is quite contrary to the rules following for interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of laws.</note> this law (ſo interpreted) will leave them out, if a towne or ſelect men ſhall thereupon give, and accordingly rate and diſtrayne ſuch as never conſented to their acting, to one good ditcher ſoe much over and above his allowance for his worke by the rodd, &amp;c. Such a ſmith ſoe much, &amp;c. For it is to the <hi>benefitt</hi> of the towne to incourage them to ſtay, and ſo be content to take the leſſe wages.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. Amongſt 200 inhabitants in a towne, whereof a matter of ſix, or ſoe, be worth 2000<abbr>l.</abbr> a piece, the reſt doe perceive that the ſix rich men within a yeare will remove their eſtates out of towne. The towne having a generall meeting doe give 300<abbr>l.</abbr> to the preſent miniſter, that the proportion of the eſtates of ſuch rich men may eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the future: It is in conſideration of his ſtaying amongſt us and as part of his yearly maintenance and for advancing the lands of the towne in general, either to lett out or ſell for ſuch as come into towne after ſuch a ſumm layd down in hand before the worke be done. And who can deny but the rich men doe or may receive a <hi>benefitt,</hi> or ſome <hi>benefitt</hi> (at the leaſt) thereby, namely, by the word of God preached, before they doe remove theire eſtates out of towne.</p>
                  <p>After this there is another tax raiſed by the towne (there being 20 of good eſtate though not neare the firſt) for ſome good end, &amp;c. and there are divers valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations held forth, them thereunto moving, at laſt the few riche men begin to perceive that they being few in number ſhall be levelled, and yet comfort themſelves that they cannot be made ſlaves in this countrey: For though they be thus deprived of their eſtates, yet they have the words of a law for them; and if all, in a manner, ſhould be thus waſted, yet there is ſuch a way to eaſe them again.</p>

                     <head>About a bargain or contract.</head>
                     <p>Obj. Suppoſe it ſhould be endeavoured to be made a bargain, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. It is no matter to the caſe in queſtion: For though it be in the power of a perſon or of many (each perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting) to make a bargain never ſo much to his owne loſſe, yet he or they muſt be holden to it: But otherwiſe it is with a derived power or truſt, being a ſociety; for they have not ſuch an unlimited domination over other mens eſtates or perſons; For, ſetting aſide the conſideration of the fundamentall law (before ſufficiently ſpoken unto) they are limited by ſtatute law. And ſuch bargains as bind the non conſenters muſt be juſt, rationall, and the termes or conditions alſo expreſſed and certayne: If any of theſe fayle noe law will bind them.</p>
                     <p>This is knowne, that upon motions in towne meetings and other companies, ſome uſe one argument or motive, ſome another. Some are moved with one argument or conſideration in his mind, ſome with another. And is the rule to ſeeke then (or onely ſoe in this caſe) what is the way of nations to underſtand the mind of the company? Muſt not recourſe be had to the record?</p>
                     <p>In the caſe in queſtion, doe the agitations end in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or in a gift? Whatever the motives were that did incline, &amp;c. if ſo expreſſed in termes, it is hard worke to add thereunto or to alter therefrom.</p>
                     <p>If it were ſo, that any man were not capable to receive a gift, it might have ſome colour to be interpreted to be a bargain, or contract.</p>
                     <p>But if it be an equall or rationall thing to have pay laid downe, or urged to be laid downe afore-hand, where a call of God is acknowledged by accepting and taking office before.

                     <p>And certayne ſuch as plead on the now defendants party muſt ſay it is either a gift or a bargain. If this be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be a bargain or contract, it is a very blind bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as they ſay, which (acting upon oath) I could not allow. If a gift (for there may be motives and high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations in the minds of the granters to give as well as to conclude a bargain) then it doth not bind ſuch as doe not conſent to be forced to pay what doe move other men to give away out of their eſtates.</p>

                     <head>Now a little about interpretation of lawes and of rules to be attended therein.</head>
                     <p>Let us not (here in New-England) deſpiſe the rules of the learned in the lawes of England, who have both great helps and long experience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt rule is, that where a law is ſuch as that, by wreſting, a man may give ſuch an interpretation as will overthrow it, when it might be conſtrued to be good; this is a corrupt interpretation. So holy ſcripture may be wreſted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Finch p. 33. in his booke of law.</note>If repugnant to fundamentall law, its voyd; as if it gives power to take away an eſtate from one man and give it to another.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Page 75.</note>It is then conſonant, if it be to compell men to pay neceſſary duties in church and common wealthe, as yearely maintenance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another rule is about equality. Hence where a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in truſt doth act, if any will imply conditions (noe way expreſt) yet,<note place="margin">F. p. 20.</note> to hold forth any color of binding, they muſt be knowne to be equall and certaine: though a ſtatute law ſhould provide or expreſſe miſchief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. See his words at large, juſtly applyable as is expreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="297" facs="unknown:011300_0151_0F86CB2DD907BED0"/>3. Another rule appeareth to this effect. That where a perſon is ſued at a private mans ſuit, and put in priſon upon execution,<note place="margin">Dalton p. 401.</note> the king cannot pardon that impriſonment without the conſent of the party plt. and the reaſon is there given; for it is in lieu of damage to the party, as hath been touched before.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The law conſtrueth things with equity and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">Finch page 55.</note> and therefore reſtrayneth a generall act, if there be any miſchief or inconveniency in it.</p>
                     <p>So far touching rules for interpretation of laws.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. By the way: Seeing there is ſo much ſpoken about fundamentall lawes and interpretations, what may be the difference betweene the late Earle of Straffords inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations and actings againſt fundamentall lawes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe of other men?</p>
                     <p>Anſw. Although in ſome things materially they ſhould be the ſame, yet formally they are not, or may not be ſo.</p>
                     <p>The Earle of Straffords acting was found to be a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and perfidious attempt to alter and ſubvert the frame of polity.</p>
                     <p>So there were theſe particulars in it, viz. Firſt, his end was naughr. 2dly, He acted arbitrarily againſt ſuch lawes. 3dly, It was done perfidiouſly, it being done willingly.</p>
                     <p>But others acting againſt fundamentall law, charity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrueth that their end they ayme at is good. Secondly, their arbitrary conſtruction (where it is ſo) may be through ignorance, or through want of notice taking of ſuch rules for interpretation of laws as are expreſſed in the lawyers bookes.</p>

                     <head>Precedents and judgments in courts.</head>
                     <p>Although there had been noe precedent in the like caſe, yet I ought (I conceive) to have judged, in the caſe in queſtion, according to the rules aforegoing: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I grant that what I find to have beene judged already and acted, both juſtly and honourably, I ought to be the more confirmed thereby.</p>

In Ipſwich, ſome years ſince, the town greatly wanted a good chirurgeon, &amp;c. and the inhabitants then generally being deſirous of ſuch a perſon to inhabite amongſt us; the chiefe ſort conſulted how to effect it. It muſt coſt above 50 <hi>l</hi> to bring it about.</p>
                     <p>It was concluded that it could not be juſtly done by way of rate, but each mans name being drawne out (according to a rate) ſuch as were willing did ſignify the ſame, and the reſt were left to uſe their liberty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I am informed and doe partly remember it, that ſome yeares ſince there was a ſix acre lott in Ipſwich purchaſed for Jeffery Snelling; but ſome of the inhabitants conſented not: It came it laſt to a ſuite in Ipſwich court, and it was found againſt the towne, becauſe by law they could not give away any mans eſtate againſt his owne conſent, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the conſiderations and motions inducing.</p>
                     <p>And admitt there were not ſuch weighty conſiderations or benefitt as in ſome other caſe there may be, the degree is not the poynt; for <hi>majus et minus non variant ſpeciem.</hi> Ambroſe Leach the ſeller of the land. Daniell Clarke was ſued.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is yet, I conceave, a concluding argument (in the like caſe) in the generall court, I referr to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord itſelfe (but till an underſtanding man, then an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of Weymouth, (as I am informed) mentioned it ſince the paſſing of my ſentence in the caſe in queſtion) it was out of my mind.</p>
                     <p>I remember the ſubſtance of it, and I ſuppoſe ſo doe many more. That towne of Weymouth did generally agree to provide an houſe and meet accommodations for the uſe of the miniſtry, to remaine for poſterity.<note place="margin">This caſe was tried at a county court at Boſton, and found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the town.</note> The matter came into the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall court. Mrs. Richards ſtood out, and not many (if any more beſides) and although the court did ſoe well like their ayme, or the thing (in itſelfe conſidered) as may by and by appeare, yet it was judged in court that they could not juſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe payment upone one, or more perſons, not conſenting.
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:011300_0152_0F86CB2EADDF7820"/>
One Dyer was then deputy of that towne, and did proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in behalfe of the towne: Yet herein the court gave a teſtimony of their good liking in reſpect of the townes intent, viz. in that way to provide for the miniſtry. And accordingly the law was framed, and enacted for the future,<note place="margin">Page 20.</note> that very court.</p>
                     <p>This proviſion was not to give away, but to remaine to poſterity, and the like proviſion was for every towne in the country; and that which a great part, if not the greater part, of Ipſwich have deſired and do ſtill ſtand for.</p>
                     <p>Obj. But it may yet further be objected. That the two wayes, viz. of giving a ſume, 100 <hi>l.</hi> more or leſſe, and that of laying out 150<abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> for the miniſtry, whereby the preſent miniſter ſhould have the benefitt and uſe during his life (if he ſtayed in the place which he had formerly accepted) and after him the ſame to remaine to poſterity for the uſe of the miniſtry, which were beſt is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c. Now ſeeing the greater part doth chooſe rather the latter way, by a major vote, what great matter if the other part doth not yield to it? or why ſhould they not yet yield to it, for the firſt way ſeems to tende moſt to peace, and there is leſſe preſent expence about it, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Anſw. The anſwer to this is, we are not now upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive arguments, what is leaſt expence. &amp;c. or what may be ſuppoſed to tend moſt to peace, or upon a thing to be done: But I am to judge the caſe according to juſtice and right, upon what is already done; wherein, according to my oath and truſt, I am not to reſpect perſons in judgment.</p>
                     <p>Obj. But poſſibly ſome will yet further object that it was done in part of his maintenance.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. This is ſpoken unto already. How can this be part of that contract which was ſome ſix weeks before, viz. that he ſhould have 80<abbr>

                        </abbr> as it is expreſſed in the record. From which I dare not in any wiſe in point of juſtice receed.</p>
                     <p>Obj. Laſtly, if it be objected that in that there was ſoe great a ſume given or granted it may ſtumble the buſines, but had there beene a matter of half of it or leſſe it would have been held good.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. However too often it falls out in the world that ſmaller injuries or errors are paſſed by, being done by the hands of ſuch as have power in their hands and ſpecially if acted by ſuch as are in ſupreme authority, yet ſuch act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were but a crooked or leſbian rule to juſtify an act thereby.

                     <p>Queſt. If it be demanded whether there be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence detweene diſpoſing mens eſtates by way of guift (under colour of law and countenance of authority) unto other men againſt or without the conſent of the owners and the doctrine of levelliſme.</p>

                        <pb n="301" facs="unknown:011300_0153_0F86CB2ED5383C58"/>Anſ. It may be anſwered (I conceive) to this effect, viz. That of the levellers, though wicked and abſurd, yet it is as yet but doctrinall (I thinke) but this kinde of tranſpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens eſtates is both doctrinall and practicall alſoe, and ſoe leadeth more directly to tiranny as it ſeemeth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Levelliſme (I take it) reacheth but to the eſtate, &amp;c. But this (if accounted legall) men may for a debt ſoe obtained (as in other caſes) upon execution for a debt inforce the perſon to priſon, or expoſe him to be ſould to make payment.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. But what if there be an interpretation put upon the words of the records, and call it a contract, will not this help the matter.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. This liberty to interprett acts or records againſt the playne words thereof (if it be a help) I ſuppoſe it is to make the matter worſe in this reſpect (if worſe can be) then the doctrine of levelliſme, for by their doctrine (I thinke) a man may underſtand what they meane by their words, and their words are uſed (its likely) in one fence.</p>
                     <p>But this kinde of liberty of interpreting ſeems to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſtrengthen the opinion of the ſcepticks, which makes all things true, and ſoe indeed nothing true or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. Hence when an act will ſerve the turne let the words ſtand, elſe take liberty to interpret them for their purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>If this kind of liberty be good, either to conſtrue laws (provided for neceſſary payments) or turning guifts into contracts (as men pleaſe) then indeed it is all one whether both parties be preſent when the buſines is in hand or not.

                     <p>The queſtion unto this court is annexed under the hand of the clerk of Salem court.</p>
                     <p>It being framed in one queſtion by Salem court, it doth conſiſt of a compound axiome.</p>
                     <p>Upon viewing whereof I finde the paper to contayne two queſtions diſtinctly taken.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Firſt, Whether the vote doth binde all or any of the inhabitants of the ſaid towne to pay any thinge towards the ſaid 100 <hi>l.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Secondly, Whether ſuch as voted not but are and were unwilling may be compelled thereunto, yea or noe?</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe doth not concerne ſuch as refuſe to pay or are defendants in the caſe originally: Save that they are bound to deſire that matters may be rightly underſtood and judged. Not doubting but the court ſeeth a manifeſt difference betweene a mans being bound in private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to performe his owne promiſſe, and being legally bound by a vote of a towne. For a towne or court cannot or need not diſtinguiſh of particular perſons who is for the affirmative, who not. But how many, &amp;c. Its the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of a major part's vote is in queſtion; not the perſonall vote of this man or of that.</p>
                     <p>The latter doth properly concerne the ſaid defendants. For payment whereunto, or accordingly, they are ſued and their goods diſtreyned. And the caſe is now come to this court for reſolution.</p>
                     <p>The order of the towne of Ipſwich, its proceeding in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the anſwers in queſtion was to this effect, viz.</p>
                     <p>At a meeting in Ipſwich October 55, about the tyme of Mr. Cobbetts coming to towne, there was a vote paſt to pay 80<abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> per ann. for his maintenance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="303" facs="unknown:011300_0154_0F86CB2FD76526A8"/>Alſoe there was another vote of the towne expreſſing their willingnes to diſburſe a ſume not exceeding 150<abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> to provide for the miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>And there was a meeting of the towne in February following (being about ſix weekes after Mr. Cobbett was ordayned) upon much agitation to and fro there was a vote paſt in theſe words, viz. Voted by the towne to give 100<abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> to buy or build a houſe for Mr. Cobbett.</p>
                     <p>It is conceived that the view hereof doth afford argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for further clearing and confirming (if need were) of what is argued for in this paper.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this matter, I thank God, I am for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances both in church and common wealth; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for due meanes for the upholding of them (and doe account it not onely a great wickednes to be contrary-minded, but extreme folly and madnes) and I thinke it tends to the honour of them, when, in reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, proviſion is made either in a voluntary or elſe in a way of compulſion, grounded upon ſuch principles as both here and in other nations will be owned as juſt and equall.</p>
                     <p>I doe ſometymes remember what is ſaid of Levy. In poynt of right and truth, he tooke noe notice of father or mother. And that is the way to eſtabliſh love and peace in this our Iſrael. And the holy ſcripture doth oblige the doctrine and practice of piety according to the firſt table, and of diſtributive juſtice in the ſecond, both expreſsly, or by neceſſary conſequence, at the hands of ſuch as are called to diſpence the ſame, though they take not oath ſoe to doe.</p>
                     <p>It is ſuppoſed that noe man is come to New England to have his goods given and taken from him, unto, or for what good end, or under what pretence ſoever.</p>
                     <p>If this ſhould be confirmed for good law; henceforth then (I conceive) there will be noe more need, or little, to make any more propoſitions for voluntary contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions.</p>

                  <head>To the honoured Generall Court now aſſembled.</head>
                  <p>WHEREAS it hath pleaſed God in the way of his providence to exerciſe the towne of Ipſwich with great troubles, by removing thoſe reverend elders which they formerly enjoyed, it pleaſed God in our ſtraits by the help of our honoured Governor, Deputy Governor and ſeverall of the reverend Elders, to provide for us an able helpe in the worke of the Lord among us, our rev. paſtour Mr. Th. Cobbet, whom now at preſent we enjoy. After he was come amongſt us, we came in a church-meeting to conſider how to provide for his maintenance, in which we conceive a houſe muſt be provided for him. Then the caſe came to be propounded to the towne in a generall towne-meeting, where being ſome agitations about it, there paſſed a vote, which is here expreſſed.</p>
                  <q>Voted to give 100<abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> towards the building or buying a houſe for Mr. Cobbet.</q>
                  <p>Which vote was full and cleare; and afterwards there was a proportion made by the ſelectmen of the towne upon the ſeverall inhabitants. But there being diverſe of them that refuſed to pay their proportion, the deacons
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:011300_0155_0F86CB30479F4B40"/>
came to conſider with the ſelectmen what to do about it, and they ordered the marſhall to diſtreine one, or two. He was ſued in an action of treſpaſſe before our honoured magiſtrate Mr. Samuel Symonds, from whoſe judgment he appealed to Salem court; where the partyes appearing, were deſired by the court to ceaſe proſecution and to let the queſtion be ſtated by the court and preſented to the generall court. Which was accordingly conſented unto. Which we humbly intreat this honoured court to take into their conſideration.</p>

                  <head>A copy of the order of Salem court.</head>
                  <p>WHEREAS there were ſeverall actions commenced at this court by ſome of the inhabitants of Ipſwich, which were of great and generall concernment. And the court fearing the uſuall manner of proceedings would not put a comfortable iſſue to the ſaid caſes, propounded to the partyes that the queſtion in controverſy might be ſtated and preſented to the generall court for reſolution, which ſhould determine the particular actions and all others that might ariſe upon the ſaid queſtion, which queſtion was by the court ſtated with the conſent of partyes, and is as followeth.</p>
                  <q>At a generall yearely meeting of the inhabitants of the towne of Ipſwich Feb. 25. 55. voted to give 100<abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> toward building or buying a houſe for Mr. Cobbet.</q>
                  <p>The queſtion is, Whether this vote doth bind all or any of the inhabitants of the ſaid towne to pay any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſaid 100<abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> and that ſuch as are or were unwilling may be compelled thereunto, yea or no? And it is agreed that either party ſhall have liberty to preſent their reaſons, in writing, to the generall court, pro and con. But no other pleadings by either party to be allowed.</p>
                  <p>According to which liberty we preſent as followeth.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion hath two parts, 1. Whether the vote be binding. 2. Whether ſuch as refuſe may be compelled.</p>
                  <p>The firſt being proved, the other will eaſily follow.</p>
                  <div type="reasons">
                     <pb n="306" facs="unknown:011300_0156_0F86CB3102A7DEE0"/>
                     <head>Reaſons tending to prove the affirmative.</head>
                     <p>The vote is legall, therefore binding. It is legall in reſpect of the matter and manner. For the matter, it is neceſſary, publicke towne charges, viz. honourable main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the miniſtry, which the law requires in generall, but leaves to each towne to determine and apply in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſuitable to their owne condition; provided they are ſubject to be regulated by higher authority, where need ſhall require. This honourable maintenance, we conceive, cannot be leſſe than that a miniſter, for his labour in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpell, (whatever eſtate he hath of his owne) ſhould have ſuch a recompence whereby he may be enabled comfortably to provide for the preſent neceſſity of his family, to be given to hoſpitality, and to leave ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable proviſion for his family after his deceaſe, as other men by Gods bleſſing upon their ordinary labours are generally enabled to doe. This being granted which (we hope) ſeems but juſt and reaſonable, that miniſters families may not be left in a worſe condition than moſt other mens, the particular way and manner of affording this maintenance (where there are variety of apprehenſions) muſt neceſſarily be determined by the major part. So it was in our caſe, and the towne pitched upon what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the vote, the due fullfilling of which is neceſſary and juſtifiable upon theſe grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The uſuall yearly allowance will not reach the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer end, viz. to afford any proviſion for a miniſters family after his death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This hath been a common practiſe among ourſelves formerly, and in other places in the country leſſe able, not only to give their firſt but ſucceeding miniſters a dwelling houſe, or ſomewhat proportionable that way.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This we perceived would be moſt acceptable, and might rationally be expected, and the other way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, of providing a houſe meerely for uſe, would not be acceptable, as not being uſuall in the country, and apprehended prejudiciall to the familyes of miniſters after their deceaſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="307" facs="unknown:011300_0156_0F86CB3102A7DEE0"/>4. The ſume given is not ſo great as to exceed the end for which it is granted, or to burden the towne in payment of it, and other leſſe ſumes being propounded, this was freely choſen and reſolved on.</p>
                     <p>This for the legality of the vote in reſpect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubſtance of it.</p>
                     <p>For the manner. It was a lawful meeting, free liberty of debate being given, and at laſt concluded by the farre major part, very few oppoſing it either in debate or voting.</p>
                     <p>Thus the vote appearing legall, we conceive it binding, and being ſo, we conceive the towne hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſuch as refuſe to yield to it, by virtue of a law enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed by the generall court, p. 9. providing that all common charges to church and commonwealth may be compelled by aſſeſſment and diſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, we hope and perſuade ourſelves that our brethren are one with us in their love and deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage an able godly miniſtry among us, and will judge it ſafeſt and ſuitableſt both to the mind of God and the godly zeale and religious care of our honoured generall court, to be open, rather then ſtrait-handed that way: And that we would not be juſtly taxed for, nor exemplary in, the leaſt diſcouragement of that nature, and that we agree in the end, only differ about the meanes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>

The arguments are as ſtrong againſt taxes by the General Court as by a Town, and yet the Houſe of Repreſentatives (p. 304) voted that the tax made by the Town was not binding.

The reaſon I ſuppoſe hath beene the miſcarriage of Mr. Garrat,<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſhip with many paſſengers of note and effects of great value which ſailed from New-Haven. <hi>Maſſa. Hiſt.

ſent unto me by him; and as the ſtate of affayres hath hapened there hath not beene any prejudiſe; for although upon the ſitting of the laſt parliament, at theyr meeting in January, I receyved intelligence of ſomething prepareing to be moved in the houſe reſpecting the eaſtern parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your juriſdiction, whatever it was, it mett with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention by his Highnes the Lord Protectors diſſolving of that aſſembly, ſo that as yet I have not heard of any thing moved to his Highnes nor councell, though ſome are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting to that end, but ſo ſoone as any thing is upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſhall heare of it, and doubt not but to give ſuch anſwer as ſhall hinder any proceeding that might be to the prejudize of your government. Sir, There lately paſt an order of the councell to be confyrmed by his Highnes, for the impowering of you, calling to your aſſiſtance ſuch as you ſhall judge meet, for the examination of the accounts preſented by me to his Highnes and councell, which was kept by Mr. Tho. Lake, concerneing the forts, the which with a letter unto you will not have diſpatch by this ſhip, by the next it may, which will be about a month or ſixe weekes hence; the favour that I crave from your worſhip is, that you will pleaſe to give a diſpatch thereunto, for that though an order is paſſed for my receipt of the money due upon the ſaide account, yet I am neceſſitated, upon what ground I knowe not, to give in bond for the makeing pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of what ſhall appeare due to be repayed upon that account to the ſtate. When the order is compleated and your letter, I ſhall make bold to give you further trouble herein for newes.</p>

of diſburſements and receipts for the carrying on his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſervice at the forts taken from the French in America, a hint whereof I gave you by my laſt of the 16th current; in the letter you are required to call Col.

Mr. Tho.

               </argument>
               <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
               <p>WHEREAS as information doth report unto us of ſeveral addreſſes lately made unto your Highnes, by ſome gentlemen of worth, for reſtitution of their right of juriſdiction over us, claimed by theyr patents, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination whereof (we humbly conceive) after a legall hearing, reſts upon your pleaſure, wherein ourſelves not being ſo properly concerned as others, at preſent, doe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely wave, craving onely to preſent your Highnes with a true narrative, though implicite, of our firſt and laſt eſtate, before and ſince we had this government which through Gods mercy we now enjoy to our good ſatisfaction, and for our continued ſetlednes under it we dayly pray, for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe of ourſelves we have ſmall power to carry on government, being a people but few in number, and thoſe not competent perſons to manage ſuch weighty affayres, our weakenes occaſioning diſtraction, our paucity diviſion, our meanes contempt, as our owne former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath fully evinced to the totall ſubverting all civill order amongſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, Becauſe chainges cannot reduce things from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilityes to make things, of ſuch as are not, to be, the caſe is ours, the places of our reſidence admit but of ſmall

inlargement, the generality of the country from us eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is ſo confuſedly taken up with uninhabitable beings of ſterile lands, ſwamps, and rockey mountaynes, as not more than a few ſhreds are left by the ſea ſhore fitt for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation, and thoſe already populated by an inconſiderate number of people. How the wiſeſt of ſuch who deſyer ſuperintendency over us can ſettle a well governed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth upon ſuch baſis we leave to your wiſdome to judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, Becauſe changes in theſe tymes may prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, where diſcontented ſpirits wayte for ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunityes, which have not beene the leaſt part of that ſmall number amongſt us who were profeſſed royaliſts, whoſe breathings that way, ſince our ſubjecting to this authority, have beene ſo far ſtifled, as that the activity of ſuch ſpirits cannot fynde any, or the leaſt opportunity of motion.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, Becauſe we feare the hurtfulnes of our change. As our government now is, our perſons and eſtates ſtand under the ſecurity of wholeſome lawes, watchfull gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, the fathers of our nouriſhment and peace, whoſe pyous care not onely tollerates but maynetaynes us the pureſt inſtitutions for the encouragement of godly perſons, both miniſters and others, to reſide amongſt us, but changing it may throw us backe into our former eſtate, to live under negligent maſters, the dainger of a confuſed anarchy, and ſuch other inconveniencyes as may make us a fitt ſhelter for the worſt of men, delinquents and ill affected perſons to make their recourſe unto, thereby to exempt themſelves from their juſt deſerved puniſhments.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, Changes are apt to inihilate, unleſs they prove much for the better, eſpecially in weake boddyes, where heades are far remote; touching ſuch events our former experience hath taught us ſomething, elſe we crave of thoſe gentlemen who are now ſo ſolicitous for government over us, what ment the deepneſs of theyr ſylence ſeverall yeares, both in theyr tongues and penns, as not after our frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of writing to them they not ſo much as returne us one ſylable of anſwer, or afford us the leaſt aſſiſtance in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:011300_0161_0F86CB3582567708"/>
the want whereof let us ſincke into great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, for our recovery thence ſeverall amongſt us petitioned for government to the collony of the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, who after ſome debate with us and confirmation of ſome articles of agreement to us, tooke us under theyre authority, unto which we ſubſcribed and ſubjected our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and under whoſe protection to continue we account it not the leaſt part of our ſecurity and happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly.

               <p>Our humble requeſt therefore is, that your Goodneſs would favour our reaſonable entreatyes, whoſe weakenes calls for ſupport, our manners for ſome ſtrictneſs of rule, whoſe diſtractions for ſome preſent ſettlement wherein our voate is that it may be as it is under the government of the Maſſachuſets, againſt which if changes ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our inevitable troubles would follow. Our condition as it was in part, and as it now ſtands, lyes really before your gracious eye, although not ſo methodically preſented, for which we hope our ignorance will excuſe us.

               <p>YOURS of 13 September received with the encloſed to his Highnes the Lord Potector, dated 10th June 58. Now ſuch was the good pleaſure of the Moſt High, that the Protector, whoſe commands occaſioned that letter in returne, was gathered to his fathers before that came from you, he dyed the 3d September. Upon the 4th his eldeſt ſon the Lord Richard was proclaimed Protector, to whome I made my application on the behalfe of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that day fortnight after; agayne, upon receipt of the generall courts letter, I applyed myſelfe to his Highnes and preſented the ſaid letter the 27th day of October, he was pleeſed to open and read the letter in my hearing, and then gave me aſſurance as formerly that he had a deep ſenſe how deare the people of N. E. were to his deare father, and that he ſhould be ready in all things to lay forth himſelf for the good of that people. After my humble thankes returned on the countrys behalfe, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a copy of the petition from Paſcataqua and Yorke inhabitants (Mr. Godfrey being active about his complaints, the which he ſtill proſecutes and hath procured a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) his Highnes ſaid he would read the ſame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thereof at more leiſurable tyme than he had at that preſent; ſo that I doubt not but whatever Mr. Godfrey may doe we ſhall be able to give ſuch anſwer as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prejudice to the courts actings as to thoſe parts.

all that apply themſelves to him; writs for a parliament are out; calling them according to the old manner as in anno 40; they are to ſit the 27th January; the Dutch ſending Lord Opdam with a fleet of nye 40 ſaile and 4000 men to aſſiſt the Danes, was encountered by the Sweeds and well battered; vice-admiral De Wit, the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander the Dutch has, mortally wounded, taken his ſhip and all in her, ſix more the Dutch loſt, moſt diſinabled, their admiral Opdam hardly eſcaping with 5 foot water in hold; ſince this conflict his Highnes hath ſent a fleet of 20 ſayle of fregates, under the command of vice admiral Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to aſſiſt the Sweed; Sir George Aſcue with 300 Engliſh commanders and officers gone with him to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Sweeds fleet; but the froſt in thoſe parts hath been ſo hard that neither one nor the other could ſeize the land, as its ſaid.

               <p>WE have received your letter of October 58, with the petition of Mr. George Rigby, &amp;c. have conſidered the contents of both, and have herewith ſent you a copie of our patent, and of the extent of our lyne taken by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, with ſeverall other writings and letters to friends in reference thereunto, which we deſire and hope may be improved to our advantage, and judge it convenient, if there be a fitt opportunitie and friends propitious for us, that it may be a ſpeedy iſſue. Some conſiderations we thought good to ſuggeſt, which you may make uſe of as there ſhall be occaſion; as firſt, from the expreſſe words of the pattent that determines our northerly bounds, which our generall court hath always underſtood to meane as you know, as alſo one other paſſage in the pattent where it is ſaid that any thing of doubtfull interpretation ſhall be underſtood in favour of the patentees. 2dly, At our firſt coming hither into this wilderneſs, and for ſome yeares after, multitude of occaſions in the beginning of ſo great an undertaking did hinder our exact taking notice of our laying claim to the utmoſt extents of our limits, eſpecially to the norward, nor had we for ſome time after our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hither occaſion to make uſe thereof, yet did we never ſett up our bounds 3 myles eaſt of Merimack, as the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mentions, but as occaſion was given have always aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the ſame limits that now we claim, though we knew not certainly (till tryall made) where it would fall. In the meane time, ſeverall perſons procured pattents of certaine tracts of land within the limits formerly graunted us, all or moſt whereof were obtained ſurreptitiouſly and illegally, and afterwards ordered and governed as unduely, the pattentees chiefly ayming at trade or private profitt, neglecting the chiefe end intended, and declared in his

of your and the countryes concernes that neyther myſelfe nor any other for you can heare from you; the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof had almoſt wrought me to a reſolve of neglecting this opportunity of preſenting my due reſpects in giveing you any account of others motions in England concerneing you; but leaſt you ſhould have cauſe of chargeing me with neglect I have ſet pen to paper, to let you underſtand what I heare in relation to New England. The complaynants againſt you to the Kings majeſty, as I am informed, are Mr. Godfrey and that company, Mr. Reckes and Sefford and company of iron workes, ſome of the ſometymes fyned and impriſoned petitioners, whoe thought, firſt, to have made theyr complaynts ſeverally, after, reſolved in joint by petition; moved to have the quakers and anabaptiſts joyned but they refuſed. I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have a ſight of theyr petition but cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it; but am informed that, haveing mentioned the articles they petition for, the diſtance of place does not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a way of heareing as being nigher it might. They move that a generall governour may be ſent to give reliefe to them. To this petition they get what hands they can of perſons that have been in New England, though never inhabitants. The quakers I heare have been with the King concerneing your putting to death thoſe of theyr friends executed at Boſton. The generall vogue of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is that a governour will be ſent over. Other rumours there are concerneing you, but I omitt them, not knowing how to move and appeare at court on your behalfe, I made bold to addreſs myſelf to the Lord Say and deſyred his favour that in caſe of complaynts to his majeſty he would be your friend, ſo far as to deſyre his majeſty that you might be heard before any thing were determined concerneing you as to judgment. His lordſhip profeſſed his greate reſpect for the plantations and thanked God he prayed for you dayly, promiſing to improve his intereſt according to my motion. I likewiſe addreſſed myſelfe to the Earle of Mancheſter, Lord Chamberlaine, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the like. By the ſhips that are expected I perceive
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:011300_0165_0F86CB3F429B8E88"/>
that ſome of thoſe that complaine doe expect that you will impower ſome to appeare for you, and thereupon make ſome demurr in theyr proſecution, but if that be not, then they intend to have ſomething done againſt the ſpring of the yeare. The peace with Spayne was proclaimed in London 11th inſtant, upon the ſame articles concluded in his late majeſtyes tyme. Epiſcopacy, common prayer, boweing at the name of Jeſus, ſigne of the croſs in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the altar and organs are in uſe and like to be more.

ſcript, the tranſcript of our loyall hearts, into your royall hands, wherein we crave leave to ſupplicate your Majeſty for your gracious protection of us in the continuance both of our civill as of our religious liberties (according to the grantees known end of ſuing for the pattent) conferred upon this plantation by your royall father. This, this, viz. our libertie to walke in the faith of the goſpell with all good conſcience, according to the order of the goſpell (unto which the former in theſe ends of the earth is but ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient) was the cauſe of our tranſporting ourſelves with our wives, little ones, and our ſubſtance, from that pleaſant land over the Atlantick ocean into the vaſt wilderneſs, chooſing rather the pure ſcripture worſhip with a good conſcience in this remote wilderneſs among the heathen, than the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of England with ſubmiſſion to the impoſitions of the then ſo diſpoſed and ſo far prevailing hierarchy, which we could not doe without an evill conſcience. For this cauſe we are this day in a land which lately was not ſowne, wherein we have conflicted with the ſufferings thereof much longer than Jacob was in Syria. Our witneſs is in heaven that we left not our native country upon any diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as to the conſtitution of the civill ſtate. Our lot, after the example of the good old nonconformiſts, hath been only to act a paſſive part throughout theſe late viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and ſucceſſive overturnings of ſtates. Our ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from our brethren in this deſart hath been and is a ſufficient bringing to mind the afflictions of Joſeph: But providentiall exemption of us hereby from the late warres and temptations of either party we account as a favour from God; the former cloaths us with ſackcloth, the latter with innocency. What reception, courteſy and equanimity, thoſe greater, and others, adherers to the royall intereſt, who in their adverſe changes viſited theſe parts, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with amongſt us, according to the meaneſs of our condition, we appeal to their own reports.</p>
               <p>Touching complaints put in againſt us, our humble requeſt only is, that for the interim, while we are as dumb by reaſon of our abſence, your Majeſty would permit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:011300_0166_0F86CB400A3AD9C8"/>
to make an impreſſion on your royall heart againſt us, untill we have both opportunity and leave to anſwer for ourſelves: Few will be innocent, ſaid that impleader, if it be enough to deny: Few will be innocent, ſaid the then Emperor, if it be enough to accuſe. Concerning the quakers, open and capitall blaſphemers, open ſeducers from the glorious Trinity, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the bleſſed goſpell, and from the holy ſcriptures as the rule of life, open enemies to the government itſelfe as eſtabliſhed in the hands of any but men of their owne principles, malignant and aſſiduous promoters of doctrines directly tending to ſubvert both our church and ſtate, after all other meanes for a long time uſed in vaine, we were at laſt conſtrained for our owne ſafety to paſſe a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of baniſhment againſt them, upon pain of death. Such was their dangerous and impetuous and deſperate turbulence both to religion and ſtate civill and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, as that how unwillingly ſoever (could it have been avoyded) the magiſtrate at laſt, in conſcience both to God and man, judged himſelf called for the defence of all, to keep the paſſage with the point of the ſword held towards them, this could do no harm to him that would be warned thereby, their wittingly ruſhing themſelves thereupon was their owne act, we with all humility conceive a crime bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their blood upon their owne head. The quakers died, not becauſe of their other crimes how capitall ſoever, but upon their ſuperadded preſumptuous and incorrigible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of authority breaking in upon us, notwithſtanding their ſentence of baniſhment made known to them; had they not been reſtrained, ſo far as appeared, there was too much cauſe to fear that we ourſelves muſt quickly have died or worſe, and ſuch was their inſolency that they would not be reſtrained, but by death; nay, had they at laſt but promiſed to depart the juriſdiction, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne without leave from authority, we ſhould have been glad of ſuch an opportunity to have ſaid they ſhould not dye.

That we might therefore enjoy divine worſhip without humane mixtures, without offence to God, man, our owne conſciences, with leave but not without teares departed from our country, kindred and fathers houſes into this Pathmos, in relation whereunto we do not ſay our garments are become old by reaſon of the very long journey, but that ourſelves, who came away in our ſtrength, are by reaſon of long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence many of us become grey-headed, and ſome of us ſtooping for age.

               <p>WEE greet you well. It having pleaſed almighty God, after long trialls both of us and our people, to touch their hearts, at laſt, with a juſt ſenſe of our right, and by their aſſiſtance to reſtore us peaceably and without bloud to the exerciſe of our regall authority for the good and wellfare of the nations committed to our charge. We have made it our care to ſettle our lately diſtracted king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms at home, and to extend our thoughts to increaſe the trade and advantages of our colonies and plantations abroad. Amongſt which as wee conſider New-England to be one of the chiefeſt, having enjoyed and grown up in a long and orderly eſtabliſhment, ſo wee ſhall not come behind any of our royal predeceſſors in a juſt encouragement and protection of all our loving ſubjects there, whoſe applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto us, ſince our late happy reſtoration, hath been very acceptable, and ſhall not want its due remembrance upon all ſeaſonable occaſions; neither ſhall we forget to make you and all our good people in thoſe parts equal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of thoſe promiſes of liberty and moderation to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſciences expreſſed in our gracious declarations; which though ſome perſons in this our kingdom of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, diſloyal and unchriſtian principles, have lately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to the publick diſturbance and their owne deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet wee are confident our good ſubjects in New-England will make a right uſe of it, to the glory of God, their own ſpiritual comfort and edification.

               <p>WEE according to your honours order departed in ſearch after Col. Goffe and Whaley (perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared traytors to his Majeſtie) from Boſton May the 7th, 1661, about ſix a clock at night, and arrived at Harford the 10th day and repaired to Governour Winthrop and gave him your honours letter and his Majeſties order for the apprehending of Col. Whaley and Goffe, who gave us an accompt that they did not ſtay there but went directly for New Haven, but informed us that one Symon Lobden guided them to the towne. The honourable Governour carried himſelfe very nobly to us, and was very diligent to ſupply us with all manner of conveniencies for the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and promiſed all dilligent ſearch ſhould be made after them in that juriſdiction, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performed. The 11th day we arrived at Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and repaired to the Deputy Governor, William Leete, and delivered him your honours letter and the coppie of his Majeſties order for the apprehending of the aforeſaid perſons, with whome at that time was ſeverall perſons. After the peruſal of them, he began to read them audibly, whereupon wee tould him it was convenient to be more private in ſuch concernements as that was; upon which, withdrawing to a chamber, he tould us he had not ſeene the two Colonels not in nine weekes. We acquainted him of the information we had received that they were at Newhaven ſince that time he mentioned, and thereupon deſired him to furniſh us with horſes, &amp;c. which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ſome delays, which wee tooke notice of to him, and after our parting with him out of his houſe and in the
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:011300_0170_0F86CB43259EEF88"/>
way to the ordinary, came to us one Dennis Scranton and tould us he would warrant that Col. Goffe and Whaley. at the time of his ſpeaking was harboured at the houſe of one Mr. Davenport, a miniſter at New-Haven, and that one Goodman Biſhop of the towne of Guildford, was able to give us the lyke accompt, and that, without all queſtion, Deputy Leete knew as much, and that Mr. Davenport had put in ten pounds worth of freſh proviſions at one tyme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe, and that it was imagined it was purpoſely for the entertainment of them.</p>
               <p>And the ſaid Scranton ſaid further, That Goffe and Whaley ſhould ſay that if they had but two hundred friends that would but ſtand by them, they would not care for Old or New-England: Whereupon wee aſkt him if he would depoſe to that: He replied he would, that it was openly ſpoken by them in the head of a companie in the field a traineing. Which words was alſo confirmed by ſeverall others, as allſo information that Goffe and Whaley was ſeene verie lately betwixt the houſes of Mr. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and one Jones, and it was imagined that one lay at one of theire houſes and the other at the others. Upon which wee went back to the Deputies and required our horſes, with aide, and a power to ſearch and apprehend them; horſes was provided for us, but he refuſed to give us any power to apprehend them, nor order any other, and ſaid he could doe nothing untill he had ſpoken with one Mr. Gilbert and the reſt of the Magiſtrates: Upon which wee tould him wee ſhould goe to New-Haven and ſtay till wee heard from him, but before wee tooke horſe the aforeſaid Dennis Scranton gave us information, there was an Indian of the towne wanting, which he tould us was to give notice of our comeing. But to our certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one John Megges was ſent a horſeback before us, and by his ſpeedie and unexpected goeing ſo early before day was to give them an information, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the delayes was us'd it was breake of day before wee got to horſe, ſoe hee got there before us; upon our ſuſpicion wee required the Deputie that the ſaid John
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:011300_0171_0F86CB43CF454D40"/>
Meggs might bee examined what his buſineſs was that might occaſion his ſoe early goeing: To which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie anſwered that hee did not know any ſuch thing, and refuſed to examine him; and being at Newhaven, which was on the 13th day, the Deputie arrived within two hours or thereabouts after us and came to us to the court cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where wee againe acquainted him with the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wee had received and that wee had cauſe to believe they were concealed in Newhaven, and thereupon wee required his aſſiſtance and aide for their apprehenſion: To which he anſwered that he did not believe they were. Whereupon wee deſired him to impower us, or order others for it. To which he gave us this anſwer, That hee could not, nor would not make us magiſtrates: Wee replied, wee ourſelves would perſonally adventure in the ſearch and apprehenſion of them in two houſes where wee had reaſon to imagine they lay hid, if they would give way to it and enable us: To which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, Hee neither would, nor could not doe any thinge untill the freemen were met together. To which wee ſet before him the danger of that delay and their inevatable eſcape, and how much the honour and ſervice of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie was deſpiſed and trampled on by him, and that wee ſuppoſed by his unwillingneſs to aſſiſt in the apprehenſion, hee was willing they ſhould eſcape: After which hee left us and went to ſeverall of the magiſtrates and were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five or ſix hours in conſultation, and upon breakeing up of their counſell, they tould us, they would not nor could not doe any thing untill they had called a generall court of the freemen: Whereupon wee repreſented to them your Honours and Governour Winthrops warrants as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, who upon the receite of his Majeſties pleaſure and order concerning the ſaid perſons, ſtood not upon ſuch niceties and formallities, but endeavoured to make all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in ſeizing on them, if to bee found in their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and allſo how your honour had recommended this grand affaire to him, and how much the honour and juſtice of his Majeſtie was concerned, and how ill his ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:011300_0171_0F86CB43CF454D40"/>
would reſent ſuch horrid and deteſtable concealments and abettings of ſuch traitors and regicides as they were, and aſkt him whether he would honour and obey the king or noe in this affaire, and ſett before him the daunger which by law is incurred by any one that conceales or abetts traytors; to which the Deputie Leete anſwered, wee honour his Majeſtie, but wee have tender conſciences.</p>
               <p>To which wee replied, that wee believed that he knew where they were, and onely pretended tenderneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for a refuſall: Upon which they drew into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation againe, and after two or three houres ſpent, in the evening the Deputie and Magiſtrates came to us at the head of the ſtaires in the ordinarie, and takes one of us by the hand and wiſht he had binn a plowman and had never binn in the office, ſince he found it ſoe weightie.</p>
               <p>To which wee tould them, that for their reſpect to two traytors they would doe themſelves injurie and poſſibly ruine themſelves and the whole collony of Newhaven, and ſtill continuing to preſſe them to their duty and loyaltie to his Majeſtie, and whether they would owne his Majeſtie or noe, it was anſwered, they would firſt knowe whether his Majeſtie would owne them.<note n="*" place="bottom">New-Haven was a government formed by a voluntary Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, without any Charter, or Commiſſion, or authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever from the Crown, or other Powers in England.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This was the ſubſtance of our proceedings, there was other circumſtantiall expreſſions which are too tedious to trouble your honour withall, and which wee have given your honour a verball accompt of, and conceive it needleſs to inſiſt any further; and ſoe findeing them obſtinate and pertenaceous in their contempt of his Majeſtie, wee came away the next day in proſecution after them, according to inſtructions, to the Governour of Manadas, from whome wee received civill reſpects and a promiſe, if they were within his juriſdiction, wee ſhould command what ayde wee pleaſed, but for ſending of them according to your honours requeſt, hee could not anſwer it to his maſters at home, but if they came there hee ſhould give your honour timely notice: Whereupon we requeſted his honour the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour

               <p>THE council of our juriſdiction being aſſembled the 4th inſtant at Boſton, ordered me to ſignify to you what lately they have receaved from England by Captain Leverett, his letter bearing date 12th April 1661, who tells us that however our addreſſe to his Majeſty came ſeaſonably and had a gracious anſwer, yett many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and claims are multiplied againſt us, and that wee are like to heare from his Majeſty's committee what thoſe
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:011300_0172_0F86CB4481F0BC10"/>
complaints are, and what is expected from us; that an oath was produced againſt him for ſaying that rather then wee ſhould or would admitt of appeales here, wee would or ſhould ſell the country to the Spaniards; which though he abſolutely denyed that ever he ſo ſaid, and that if he ſhould have ſo ſaid he had wronged the country very much, ſome of the ſaid committee ſaid the words if ſpoken they were pardoned, but they looked at the words not ſo much his as the ſpirit of the country, and tho' againe he deſired that the country might not ſuffer, in theire minds, for what he knew was ſo much and ſo farre from them, as to thinke ought in any ſuch reſpect, yet one of them proceeded to queſtion him, whether if wee durſt wee would not caſt off our allegiance and ſubjection to his Majeſty; He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he did apprehend wee were honeſt men and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in our application to his Majeſty the contrary, and therefore could not have ſuch thoughts of us without the breach of charity; that it is no leſſe than neceſſary we had ſome able perſon to appeare for us, well furniſhed to carry on our buſines, which will not be without money; that the councill for plantations demanded of him whether wee had proclaimed the King and whether there was not much oppoſition to the agreeing of our application. He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he knew not, only had heard Capt. Breaden ſay ſo, but humbly ſubmitted to theire conſideration, that neither wee nor any other were to be concluded by debates but by our concluſions, which were ſent and preſented to his Majeſty in our names. They tooke notice, from enquiry, that it was only from one colony, namely, Maſſachuſetts, and have theire conſiderations of the other colonies neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, to ſpeake moſt favourably thereof. Thus farr as to the letter. Further, I am required to ſignify to you as from them, that the non attendance with dilligence to execute the Kings majeſtys warrant for the apprehending of Colonel Whaley and Goffe will much hazard the preſent ſtate of theſe colonies and your owne particularly, if not ſome of your perſons, which is not a little afflictive to them.

                  <p>THE committee, taking the premiſſes into their ſerious conſideration, cannot but look upon it as a humbling providence of God towards his poore people, that whilſt they are endeavouring (and as they hope in ſome meaſure of ſincere love to the Lord his truth and ordinances) to wait on God in the uſe of all lawfull means left unto them for the preſervation of ſuch high favours as in ſundry reſpects he hath been pleaſed to betruſt us withall, that ſo many clouds ſhould hover over our heads for the darkning our pathes, and ſtumbling blocks appearing in our way to hinder the ſame, yet nevertheleſſe being perſuaded that not only prudentiall arguments referring to our owne peace and ſafety, but alſo the honor of the Lords name, church and wayes, which is now principally ſhott at by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:011300_0178_0F86CB51C5AE0290"/>
doeth call aloud upon us not to delay the uſe of all lawful meanes, and this propounded being upon mature councills in ſundry debates agreed upon as the beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient conducing to ſuch an end, doe account it their duty (the ſaid objections notwithſtanding) to further the ſaid gentlemen in the diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in them, and cannot conſent to any unneceſſary delay therein.</p>
                  <p>Further briefly to the ſeveral partes.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, The committee doe indeed concurr with the commiſſioners that a more full and explicite acting of the ſaid honored gentlemen, were very deſirable, but yet not eſſentially neceſſary. The honored governor having manifeſted himſelf willing not only to give his approbation to ſuch commiſſion inſtructions and particulars as ſhall be orderly agreed upon, as alſo to ſign the ſame according to the appointment of the generall court.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond, The committee conceive there is no doubt on their part as to this meſſage, nor yet any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of what they have propounded with what the general court agreed upon, but ſuch as may be rationally interpreted to be the true meaning of the power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them.</p>
                  <p>To the third, The committee doe conceive they are already agreed of the meſſage, viz. the commiſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and petitions as in the former returnes.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth, That as yet no act hath beene paſſed by them of ſuch tendency, only ſome propoſals, where they have rather expreſſed their tender reſpect towards our honored and deare friends, than any juſt reaſon that they have for the entertaining ſuch fears.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the committee doe propoſe as a further expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the ſatisfaction of our honored commiſſioners, that they themſelves would be pleaſed to conſider and preſent unto us what themſelves apprehend there yet remains to be done by us for their furtherance in this ſo great an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and we hope we ſhall not be found wanting to their encouragement in what we may.</p>

               <p>A Letter of yours being brought hither, directed to Mr. Aſhurſt and Mr. Hutchinſon, though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe two gentlemen did by the laſt ſhip, as he tells us, acknowledge the receipt of it, and intimate the reaſons of our ſilence, yet we now thinke it meete to aſſure you alſo ourſelves how acceptable it was to us to be informed, partly by that letter of yours and partly by the relation of ſome learned miniſters that came a while ſince from New-England, that you continue your care and concerne for the propagation of the goſpel of Chriſt amongſt the poore Indians, and we are glad that through the goodnes of God wee are now in a condition to informe you that ſince the receipt of your lately mentioned letter, it hath pleaſed the king's majeſty (in councill) to grant a charter of incorporation, wherein many of the nobility and other perſons of quality, and moſt of thoſe gentlemen that were

The bill of £.800 drawne for the uſe of the Indian worke is for the moſt part paid, and ſhould have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſo ere now, were it not for the want of preſent money.

               <p>TRUSTY and well beloved, Wee greete you well. Whereas wee have lately received an humble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and petition from the generall court of our colony of the Maſſachuſetts in New England, preſented to us by Symon Bradſtreet and John Norton, Wee have thought it agreeable to our princely grace and juſtice to lett you know that the ſame have been very acceptable unto us, and that wee are ſatisfyed with your expreſſions of loyalty, duty and good affection made to us in the ſaid addreſs, which wee doubt not proceeds from the hearts of our good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Wee are therefore willing that all our good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that plantation do know that Wee doe receive them into our gracious protection, and will cheriſh them with our beſt incouragement, and that Wee will preſerve, and doe hereby confirme the pattent and charter heretofore graunted to them by our royall father of bleſſed memory, and that they ſhall freely injoy all the priviledges and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertyes graunted to them in and by the ſame, and that Wee will be ready to renew the ſame charter to them,

under our great ſeale of England, whenever they ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. And becauſe the licence of theſe late ill times have likewiſe had an influence upon our colony, in which they have ſwerved from the rules preſcribed, and even from the government inſtituted by the charter, which wee doe graciouſly impure rather to the iniquity of the time than to the evill intents of the hearts of thoſe who exerciſed the government there. And Wee doe therefore publiſh and declare our free and gracious pardon to all our ſubjects of that our plantation, for all crimes and offences committed againſt us during the late troubles, except any ſuch perſons who ſtand attaynted by our parliament here of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if any ſuch perſons have tranſported themſelves into thoſe parts; the apprehending of whom and delivering them into the hands of juſtice Wee expect from the dutiful and affectionate obedience of thoſe our good ſubjects in that colony, if they be found within the juriſdiction and limmitts thereof. Provided always, and be it in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared expectation, that upon a review of all ſuch lawes and ordinances that are now or have been during theſe late troubles in practiſe there, and which are contrary or derogative to our authority and government, the ſame may be annulled and repealed, and the rules and preſcriptions of the ſaid charter for adminiſtring and taking the oath of allegiance be henceforth duly obſerved, and that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice be in our name.<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe are made the conditions of the Pardon which the King may annex as he thinks fit, on the performance whereof the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Pardon will depend.

Wee cannot be underſtood hereby to direct or wiſh that any indulgence ſhould be graunted to thoſe perſons commonly called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, whoſe principles being inconſiſtent with any kind of government, Wee have found it neceſſary, with the adviſe of our parliament here, to make a ſharp law againſt them, and are well content you doe the like there. Although Wee have hereby declared our expectation to be that the charter graunted by our royall father, and now confirmed by us, ſhall be particularly obſerved, yet, if the number of aſſiſtants injoyned thereby be found by experience, and be judged by the country, to be inexpedient, as Wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it is, Wee then diſpence with the ſame, and declare our will and pleaſure, for the future, to be, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſaid aſſiſtants ſhall not exceed 18, nor be leſs at any time than 10, Wee aſſuring ourſelves, and obliging and commanding all perſons concerned that, in the election of the governor or aſſiſtants, there be only conſideration of the wiſdome and integrity of the perſons to be choſen, and not of any faction with reference to their opinion or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that all the freeholders of competent eſtates, not vicious in converſations, orthodox in religion (though of different perſwaſions concerning church-government) may have their vote in the election of all officers civill or military.

For the manner of government though 'tis under an annuall election according to pattent, yet the perſons ſeldome chang'd or remov'd but by death or their owne removing out of the collony.

Conecticott have offered to referr the matter to the two colonies of Maſſachuſetts and Plimouth, to which motion diverſe of Rhoad Iſland would concur but others refuſe, upon what ground is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.

If ſoe be that from the complaints of Rhoad Iſland men, or any others, any thing ſhould be reflected upon the collony of the Maſſachuſetts, may wee by the means of any friend or friends but obtaine the favour to be heard before wee are concluded with thoſe complained againſt, or have any concluſion made of us, it will be a verry high obligation unto us.

But God that hath prevented and diſapoynted all hitherto, can and will, ſoe far as it may concur with his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills and good pleaſure, which hath appeared to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills of much peace towards an unworthy people, for which let his holy name be forever praiſed by us in a way of believing, that wee may be able to ſay in truth, this God is our God who was our fathers and will be our guide unto death.</p>

               <p>TRuſty and well beloved we greet you well; whereas our truſty and well beloved Ferdinando Gorges, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> hath by his humble petition informed us that his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Knight, deceaſed, being a perſon who laid himſelf forth very much for the advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of forraine plantations, and particularly that of New-England in America, did in the fifteenth year of the raign of our late royal father of bleſſed memory, obtain a grant under the great ſeale of England, for a certain part and portion of the ſaid country, which by the ſaid patent was entitled the province of Meyne and (as the petitioner af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, he hath heard from ſeveral perſons of worth) he the ſaid Sir Firdinando Gorges did expend in planting ſeveral parts of New-England above twenty thouſand pounds ſterling; and when he was in hopes to receive ſome advantage in recompence of his great diſburſements afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, the late unhappy warres breaking out in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:011300_0196_0F86CB6A01EB3600"/>
he the ſaid Ferdinando Gorges (though betwixt three and fourſcore years of age) did perſonally engage in our royal fathers ſervice, and particularly in the ſiege of Briſtol, by reaſon whereof when it was neceſſary for him to appear before the councel and committees for forraine plantations, he was wholly diſcountenanced by them, even to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of the people in the ſaid province to diſown his government, which had continued for ſeveral years unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, and a party of the inhabitants of the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, petitioning the governors of the Maſſachuſetts Bay, that they would alſo take upon them the government of the ſaid province; in purſuance of that petition, thoſe who had the government of the ſaid Bay did from thenceforth take upon them the government of the ſaid province, ſo as both the ſaid Sir Ferdinando, the petitioners father, and himſelf, have ever ſince been thereby deprived of the iſſues and profits of ſaid province. Now in regard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and for as much as thoſe agents who were lately imployed to addreſs themſelves unto us, on the behalf of the governours and inhabitants of the ſaid Bay, being on the behalf of the petitioner charged before our privy council for uſurping the government of the ſaid province, did declare that thoſe whom they repreſented did not claim any title in, or intereſt to the ſaid province; but did onely govern the ſame untill orders from hence were ſent over for the government thereof, on the behalf of the petitioner: upon whoſe humble ſupplications, we were graciouſly pleaſed to refer the allegations aforeſaid to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our counſel learned in the law, who have made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port unto us, that they have conſidered thereof, and do find that Sir Ferdinando Gorges aforementioned, in the fifteenth year of the raigne of our royal father, obtained a grant to him and his heirs under the great ſeal of England of a part of New-England in America, called by the name of the province of Meyne, to be held as of the mannor of Eaſt Greenwich, under certain rents and conditions in the letters pattents expreſſed, and that it appeared by ſeveral affidavits and certificates of credible perſons that the ſaid
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:011300_0196_0F86CB6A01EB3600"/>
Sir Ferdinando Gorges had the poſſeſſion of the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince without any diſturbance, and did govern the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the directions of the ſaid letters pattent for ſome years, expended above twenty thouſand pounds in the plantation thereof, that when he had made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the ſaid plantation as that he expected to reap ſome profit and advantage thereby, the unhappy warres break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in England Sir Ferdinando Gorges was in actual ſervice in the ſaid warres for our royal father, by reaſon whereof he was a great ſufferer, plundered and impriſoned ſeveral times and thereby diſabled from any further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in carrying on the ſaid plantation, the rather for that he was ſo diſcouraged and diſcountenanced by the then pretended commiſſioners for forraine plantations, as that his commiſſioners were forced to come from the ſaid plantation, and ſo loſt the poſſeſſion, and the inhabitants thereof petitioned the governours of the Maſſachuſets or Bay of Boſton, to take them under their government, which accordingly they did, and have continued under their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ever ſince, and the petitioners commiſſioners ſince our reſtauration have endeavoured to take poſſeſſion of the ſaid province for the petitioner (being heir to his grandfather) and proclaimed us, began to hold courts as formerly, and to adminiſter the oathes of allegiance and ſupremacy, but were diſturbed and hindered therein by the ſaid governours of the Maſſachuſets or the Bay of Boſton, who required the commiſſioners to proceed no further on the behalf of the petitioner untill they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the ſupream authority of England, untill which time they commanded the inhabitants of that province to continue under their government: We have taken the whole matter into our princely conſideration, and finding the petitioners allegations and report of our ſaid councel learned ſo conſonant, we have thought fit to ſignifie our pleaſure on the behalf of the ſaid Ferdinando Gorges the petitioner, hereby requiring you that you forthwith make reſtitution of the ſaid province unto him or his commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and deliver him or them the quiet and peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion

               <p>HIS Majeſty hath heard this petition<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix to Hiſtory of Maſſachuſets Bay, V. I. p. 537.</note> read to him and hath well weighed all the expreſſions therein, and the temper and ſpirit of thoſe who framed it, and doth not impute the ſame to his colony of the Maſſachuſets, amongſt whom he knowes the major part conſiſts of men well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to his ſervice and obedient to his government, but he hath commanded me to let you kow that he is not pleaſed with this petition and lookes upon it as the contrivance of a few perſons who have had too long authority there, and who uſe all the artifices they can to infuſe jealouſies into his good ſubjects there and apprehenſions as if their charter were in danger, when it is not poſſible for his Majeſtie to doe more for the ſecuring it or to give his ſubjects there more aſſurance that it ſhall not any degree be infringed, than he hath already done, even by his late commiſſion and commiſſioners ſent thither, who are ſo far from having the leaſt authority to infringe any clauſe in the ſaid charter, that it is the principall end of their journey, ſo chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Majeſtie, to ſee that the charter be fully and punctually obſerved; his Majeſtie did expect thankes and acknowledgments, from that his colony, of his fatherly care in ſending his commiſſioners thither, and which he doubts not he ſhall receive from the reſt of his colonies in thoſe parts, and not ſuch unreaſonable and groundleſſe complaint as is contained in your petition, as if he had thereby intended to take away your priviledges and to drive you from your habitations, without the leaſt mention of any miſdemeanour or miſcarriage in any one of the ſaid commiſſioners or in any one particular; nor can his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie comprehend (except you believe that by granting your charter he hath parted with his ſoveraigne power
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:011300_0198_0F86CB6B887BB508"/>
over his ſubjects there) how he could proceed more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, or indeed any other way, upon ſo many complaints preſented to him by particular perſons of injuſtice done contrary to the conſtitution of that government; from the other colonies for the oppreſſion they pretend to undergoe by the power of that of the Maſſachuſets, by extending their bounds and their juriſdiction further than they ought to doe, as they pretend; from the natives for the breach of faith and intolerable preſſures layed upon them, as they alledge, contrary to all kind of juſtice, and even to the diſhonour of the Engliſh nation and chriſtian faith, if all they alledge be true; I ſay, his Majeſtie cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how he could apply proper remedies to theſe evills, if they are reall, or how he could ſatisfy himſelfe whether they are reall or noe by any other way or meanes than by ſending commiſſioners thither to examine the truth and grounds of all the alligations, and for the preſent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the differences the beſt they can, untill upon a full and clear repreſentation thereof to his Majeſty, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but expect the ſame from them, his Majeſties owne finall judgment and determination may be had, and it hath pleaſed God ſo far already to bleſſe that ſervice that its no ſmall benefit his Majeſtie and his Engliſh colonies in thoſe partes have already received by the ſaid commiſſioners in the removall of ſo inconvenient neighbours as the Dutch have been for theſe late years, and which would have been a more ſpreading and growing miſchiefe in a ſhort time, if it had not been removed. To conclude, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Majeſtie to aſſure you againe of your full and peaceable enjoyment of all the priviledges and liberties granted to you by his charter, which he hath heretofore and doth now againe offer to renew to you, if you ſhall deſire it, and that you may further promiſe yourſelves all the protection, countenance and encouragement that the beſt ſubjects ever received from the moſt gracious Prince; in returne whereof he doth only expect that duty and chearfull obedience that is due to him, and that it may not be in the power of any malicious perſon to make you

               <p>LET my firſt ſalutation be my congratulation for this addition of a further expreſſion of Gods peoples affection and confidence in your courage, wiſdom and faithfulnes for the intereſt of our Lord Jeſus and the good and wellfare of church and commonwealth, in that they have unanimouſly called you to be one of the aſſiſtants for governing the civill affaires in the court, as well as to be their major generall in the campe. The good Lord aſſiſt and governe you by his ſpirit of wiſdom, of courage, and of the feare of the Lord in both.</p>
               <p>Sir, I received yours dated 27. 3d. 65. for which I returne humble and hearty thanks, and for the incloſed narrative, whereby I perceive that the powers of darknes which have prevailed in other parts of the world are at worke here alſo, to ſubvert the kingdom of Chriſt in theſe ends of the earth. But God hath not yet ſaid that this is theire hour in reference to N. E. though our unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes for the goſpel, unfruitfulneſs under it, diſſobedience
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:011300_0199_0F86CB6C51A8E3A8"/>
to it, declenſions from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, and ſinful compliances, &amp;c. have deſerved that our hedge ſhould be broken down. That admonition which Chriſt ſent unto the church at Epheſus ſhould ſound in our hearts continually, Repent and doe thy firſt workes. For even David had his firſt and his latter wayes. Therefore it is noticed concerning Jehoſaphat, in 2 Chron. 17.3. that the Lord was with him, becauſe he walked in the firſt waies of his father David. If N. E. would returne to the firſt waies of reformation here begun, according to goſpel rules and patternes (from which the compas of the laſt ſynods concluſions ſeemes to be varied by ſome degrees towards the antartique, or is newly diſcovered to be other than I formerly apprehended to have been the way of theſe churches) I would hope that the ſame onely wiſe God who diſſappointed the councel of that archprelate in the raigne of the laſt king (whereby your pattent was once and againe demanded by the ſaid king, and as often refuſed by your generall court, to be returned to England) would alſo ſtill appeare, in this juncture, by fruſtrating the preſent deſigne and making it an abortion, or a mere tryall of the country, whether they will ſtand to their church rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges or permit them to be invaded and violated by ſuch attempts, which when they are tried and found unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, will ceaſe for the future. For the Lord is and will be with his people while they are with him; and if yee ſeeke him he will be found of you. An experiment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you had in the quiet proceeding of your elections, as a gracious anſwer to prayers. Their claiming power to ſit authoritatively as a court for appeales, and that to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in an arbitrary way, was a manifeſt laying of a ground worke to undermine your whole government eſtabliſhed by your charter. If you had conſented thereunto, you had plucked downe with your owne hands that houſe which wiſdom had built for you and your poſterity. For all your courts would then have ſignified nothing; the ſentences of them being liable to be diſſannulled, upon complaints to the commiſſioners made by delinquents, as
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:011300_0200_0F86CB6E70689018"/>
appeareth in the caſe of Mr. Tho. Deane, &amp;c. and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the juſteſt cenſure might be hindred and the courſe of juſtice obſtructed, as you have alreadie found in the caſe of John Potter. Nor can I ſee that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that authority and juriſdiction which the laſt king, by his roial charter, gave you, can rationally be accounted an oppoſing the ſoveraignety which this king hath over you, ſeeing <hi>id poſſunt reges quod jure poſſunt.</hi> There is indeed a verbal profeſſion of preſerving your liberties. But if the commiſſion of theſe gentlemen be of ſuch a latitude as they ſay, it is a real deſtruction of that which they promiſe to preſerve. <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> Therefore, to me, the matter of your anſwer ſeemes to be rational, juſt and neceſſary. As for the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of publiſhing it, in three places, by ſounding a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, I believe you did it upon good adviſe, and therefore, ſuſpending my own thoughts, I ſhall wait to ſee how it is reſented at the court in England. Yet, upon ſerious ſecond and third thoughts, I ſee not but that it was your prudent way ſo to do, conſidering that, 1. It was the anſwer of the generall court. 2. Publiſhed in the kings name. 3. For the cogniſance of the whole country concerned in it. 4. For declaring the courage and reſolution of the whole countrey to defend theire charter liberties and priviledges, and not to yeeld up theire right voluntarily, ſo long as they can hold it, in dependance upon God in Chriſt, whoſe intereſt is in it, for his protection and bleſſing, who will be with you while you are with him. If my adviſe were worth any thing, I would ſay, let a collection of your grievances occaſioned by the coming over of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and by their actings, in one place and another, and of the 3 commiſſioners in prejudicing the Indians againſt the Engliſh, whereby the good worke for theire converſion is in danger to be hindered and the ſafety and peace of the Engliſh to be hazzarded, for the future; let, I ſay, all inſtances of theire illegal and injurious proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, throughout the countrey, be fully collected and clearly proved, and ſpeedily tranſmitted and repreſented to the
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:011300_0200_0F86CB6E70689018"/>
king, the lord chancellor, &amp;c. by your next addres, and therein let them fully and plainly underſtand that the whole countrey (for the generality of them) are much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved at theſe doings and humbly deſire to be reſettled in theire former ſtate, according to theire charter, and that they may be freed from thoſe new encroachments; wherein the petition to the generall court preſented in the names of ſo many non-freemen, declaring theire full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the ſettled government, as it is, with theire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire that it may be ſtill continued without alteration, may be ſignified to the higher powers, to good purpoſe. Sir, You ſee whether my zeale for preſerving Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in your parts (though in N.H.C.<note n="†" place="bottom">New Haven Colony.</note> it is miſerably loſt) and my unfeigned love to your colonie and my fervent deſire of the wellfare of the churches and commonwealth (ſo far as they may be promoted and perpetuated by your circumſpection) hath carried me, through my confidence in your wiſdom and faithfulnes, that you will make no other uſe of this my ſcribbling then ſuch as ſhall be ſafe both to you and me. To the honorable governor you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it, if you pleaſe, preſenting alſo to him my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affectionate ſervice.</p>

Truely, friends, this your practice of compelling any in matters of worſhip to doe that whereof they are not fully perſuaded, is to make them ſin, for ſoe the apoſtle (Rom. 14 and 23.) tells us, and many are made hypocrites thereby, conforming in their outward man for feare of puniſhment. We pray for you and wiſh you proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie every way, hoped the Lord would have given you ſo much light and love there, that you might have been eyes to God's people here, and not to practice thoſe courſes in a wildernes, which you went ſo farre to prevent.

               <p>MY brother Wilſon and ſelfe doe both of us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your love, as otherwiſe formerly, ſo now in the late lines wee received from you, that you grieve in ſpirit to heare dayly complaints againſt us, it ſpringeth from your compaſſion of our afflictions therein, wherein wee ſee juſt cauſe to deſire you may never ſuffer like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury yourſelfe, but may finde others to compaſſionate and condole with you. For when the complaints you hear of are againſt our tyranny and perſecutions in fining, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and impriſoning men for their conſciences, be pleaſed to underſtand wee looke at ſuch complaints as altogether injurious in reſpect of ourſelves, who had noe hand or tongue at all to promote either the coming of the perſons you ayme at into our aſſemblyes, or their puniſhment for their carriage there. Righteous judgment will not take up reports, much leſſe reproaches, againſt the innocent. The cry of the ſinnes of Sodome was great and loude, and reached up to heaven; yet the righteous God (giving us an example what to doe in the like caſe) he would firſt goe downe to ſee whether their crime were altogether according to the cry, before he would proceede to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Gen. 18.20, 21. and when he did finde the truth of the cry, he did not wrap up all alike promiſcuouſly in the judgement, but ſpared ſuch as he found innocent; wee are amongſt thoſe whom (if you knew us better) you would account of (as the matron of Abel ſpake of herſelfe) peaceable in Iſrael, 2 Sam. 20.19. Yet neither are wee ſo vaſt in our indulgence or toleration as to thinke the men
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:011300_0205_0F86CB79A18C12E0"/>
you ſpeake of ſuffered an unjuſt cenſure. For one of them (Obadiah Holmes) being an excommunicate perſon himſelfe, out of a church in Plymouth patent, came into this juriſdiction and took upon him to baptize, which I thinke himſelfe will not ſay he was compelled here to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. And he was not ignorant that the rebaptizing of an elder perſon, and that by a private perſon our of office and under excommunication, are all of them manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations againſt the order and government of our churches eſtabliſhed (wee know) by Gods law, and (he knoweth) by the lawes of the country. And wee conceive wee may ſafely appeale to the ingenuity of your owne judgement, whether it would be tolerated in any civill ſtate, for a ſtranger to come and practiſe contrary to the knowne principles of their church-eſtate? As for his whipping, it was more voluntarily choſen by him than inflicted on him. His cenſure by the court was to have payed (as I know) 30 pounds or elſe to be whipt, his fine was offered to be payed by friends for him freely; but he choſe rather to be whipt; in which caſe, if his ſuffering of ſtripes was any worſhip of God at all, ſurely it could be accounted no better than will-worſhip. The other (Mr. Clarke) was wiſer in that point and his offence was leſſe, ſo was his fine leſſe, and himſelfe (as I heare) was contented to have it payed for him, whereupon he was releaſed. The impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of either of them was noe detriment. I believe they ſared neither of them better at home, and I am ſure Holmes had not been ſo well clad of many yeares before.</p>
               <p>But be pleaſed to conſider this point a little further. You thinke to compell men in matter of worſhip is to make men ſinne, according to Rom. 14.23. If the worſhip be lawfull in itſelfe, the magiſtrate compelling him to come to it compelleth him not to ſinne, but the ſinne is in his will that needs to be compelled to a chriſtian duty. Joſiah compelled all Iſrael, or (which is all one) made to ſerve the Lord their God, 2 Chron. 34.33. yet his act herein was not blamed but recorded amongſt his virtuous actions. For a governour to ſuffer any within his gates to prophane
<pb n="405" facs="unknown:011300_0205_0F86CB79A18C12E0"/>
the ſabbath, is a ſinne againſt the 4th commandment, both in the private houſeholder and in the magiſtrate; and if he requires them to preſent themſelves before the Lord, the magiſtrate ſinneth not, nor doth the ſubject ſinne ſo great a ſinne as if he did refraine to come. If the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate connive at his abſenting himſelfe from ſabbath duties the ſinne will be greater in the magiſtrate than can be in the others paſſive comeing. Naamans paſſive goeing into the houſe of Rimmon did not violate the peace of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, 2 Kings 5.18 19. Bodily preſence in a ſtewes, forced to behold the leudneſſe of whoredomes there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, is noe whoredome at all. Noe more is it ſpirituall whoredome to be compelled by force to goe to maſſe.</p>
               <p>But (ſay you) it doth but make men hypocrites, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to conforme the outward man for feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. If it did ſo, yet better to be hypocrites than prophane perſons. Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man, but the prophane perſon giveth God neither outward nor inward man.</p>
               <p>Your prayers for us wee thankfully accept, and wee hope God hath given us ſo much light and love (which you thinke wee want) that if our native country were more zealous againſt horrid blaſphemies and hereſies than wee be, wee believe the Lord would looke at it as a better improvement of all the great ſalvations he hath wrought for them than to ſett open a wide doore to all abominations in religion. Doe you thinke the Lord hath crowned the ſtate with ſo many victoryes that they ſhould ſuffer ſo many miſcreants to pluck the crown of ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from Chriſts head? Some to deny his godhead, ſome his manhood; ſome to acknowledge noe Chriſt, nor hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor hell, but what is in a mans ſelfe? Some to deny all churches and ordinances, and ſo to leave Chriſt noe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible kingdome upon earth? And thus Chriſt by eaſing England of the yoke of a kingdome ſhall forfeit his owne kingdome among the people of England. Now God forbid, God from heaven forbid, that the people and ſtate of England ſhould ſo ill requite the Lord Jeſus. You

know not, if you thinke wee came into this wilderneſſe to practiſe thoſe courſes here which wee fled from in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Wee believe there is a vaſt difference betweene mens inventions and God's inſtitutions; wee fled from mens inventions, to which wee elſe ſhould have beene compelled; wee compell none to mens inventions.</p>
               <p>If our wayes (rigid wayes as you call them) have layd us low in the hearts of God's people, yea and of the ſaints (as you ſtile them) wee doe not believe it is any part of their ſaintſhip. Michal had a low eſteeme of Davids zeale, but he was never a whit lower in the ſight of God, nor ſhe higher.</p>
               <p>What you wrote out of Holland to our then governor Mr. Dudley, in behalfe of Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, Seekers, and the like, it ſeemeth, mett with a ſhort anſwer from him but zealous; for zeal will not beare ſuch mixtures as coldneſſe or lukewarmeneſſe will, Revel. 2.2.14.15.20. Nevertheleſſe, I tell you the truth, wee have tolerated in our church ſome Anabaptiſts, ſome Antinomians, and ſome Seekers, and do ſo ſtill at this day; though Seekers of all others have leaſt reaſon to deſire toleration in church fellowſhip. For they that deny all churches and church ordinances ſince the apoſtacy of Antichriſt, they cannot continue in church fellowſhip but againſt their owne judgment and conſcience; and therefore 4 or 5 of them who openly renounced the church fellowſhip which they had long enjoyed, the church ſaid amen to their act, and (after ſerious debate with them till they had nothing to anſwer) they were removed from their fellowſhip. Others carry their diſſent more privately and inoffenſively, and ſo are borne withall in much meekeneſſe. Wee are farr from arrogating infallibility of judgement to ourſelves or affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uniformity; uniformity God never required, infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he never granted us. Wee content ourſelves with unity in the foundation of religion and of church order: Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures wee ſuffer to varie; wee have here preſbyterian churches as well as congregationall, and have learned (through grace) to keepe the unity of the ſpirit in the bond

               <p>I HAVE lately heard that his Majeſty hath authorized and required you to reduce Canada to his Majeſty's obedience, therefore I thinke it my duty (for ſeveral reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects) to give you advertiſement of an opportunity which preſents it ſelfe towards the facilitating (if not wholly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting) the worke at once. For I have received letters yeſterday that the French were marching (in number ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Indyans computation about 700 men) towards Albany. I preſume they will not openly profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enemyes to us, till they have either vanquiſht the Mohaukes, or made peace with them; however I have ſtrengthened my garriſon in the fort to withſtand their attempts; hereof I have alſo ſent governor Winthrop an account, and cannot imagine any reaſon to the contrary why ſo faire an advantage againſt the French ſhould bee let ſlip, ſince his Majeſty's directions therein are ſo poſſitive. And truly if from your colony a ſpeedy force of horſe and dragoones, not exceeding 150, would march and joyne with a proportionable number of Conecticott colony, in all probability few of the French could return to Canada, whoſe whole ſtrength is now ſo farr engaged from home,
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:011300_0207_0F86CB7CCB0F9AA0"/>
and by conſequence the reſt of the French will not be able to make any conſiderable reſiſtance; the neceſſity of your ſpeedy determination is ſo evident, that I ſhall not make uſe of other arguments, only aſſuring you of my utmoſt endeavours to ſerve his Majeſty upon this occaſion in the defence of his dominions, not doubting but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſafety is precious to you, although the danger at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent more immediately threatens this colony; I remitt the conſideration of the premiſſes to your ſerious thoughts, and remaine your very affectionate friend and ſervant,</p>

               <p>ALthough wee were credibly informed before your generall court ſate in September laſt, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers circumſtances were jealous that the ſignification of his Majeſties pleaſure to yourſelves, under his Majeſties ſigne manuall and ſubſcribed by Sir William Morice, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſecretary of ſtate, would not meet with a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance in your generall court; yet wee were loth to credit reports ſo derogatory to your dutifull ſubmiſſion to his Majeſties commandes; and having ſeene the copy of an humble addreſſe to your generall court, under the hands of many conſiderable perſons eminent for loyalty and eſtates within your juriſdiction, wherein the petitioners did, with a modeſt importunity, offer to their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives their deep ſenſe of the calamities which may enſue, if his Majeſties juſt diſpleaſure ſhould be kindled againſt the diſobedient, wee were full of hopes that the generall court would have given his Majeſtie due ſatisfaction to his commands, and particular thankes to thoſe gentlemen the petitioners: But being fully informed that your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are neither to ſend Mr. Richard Bellingham, your

               <p>THE colony of Conecticote returned their humble thankes to his Majeſty for his gracious letters and for ſending commiſſioners to them, and made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of their loyalty and obedience. And they did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to have appeales made to his Majeſties commiſſioners, who did hear and determine ſome differences among them. All formes of juſtice paſſe only in his Majeſtyes name, they admit all that deſire it to be of their corporation; they will not hinder any from enjoying the ſacraments and uſing the common prayer book, provided that they hinder not the maintenance of the publick miniſter; they will amend any thing that hath been done derogatory to his Majeſtyes honour, if there be any ſuch thing, ſo ſoone as they ſhall come to the knowledge of it. The bounds betwixt the Dukes province and Conecticote were miſtaken by wrong information, for it was not intended that they ſhould come nearer to Hudſon's river then twenty miles, yet the line was ſet downe by the commiſſioners to goe from ſuch a poynt N. N. W. whereas it ought to goe
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:011300_0209_0F86CB7E47D84D00"/>
juſt N. otherwiſe the line will goe into Hudſons river. They have nothing to ſay againſt Duke Hamiltons pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but their writings were burnt, and that they bought the land of the Lord Say and Brook and others, and that his Majeſty hath confirmed it to them, and that they never knew that the late Marquis Hamilton had a graunt of it, for he never ſent any to take poſſeſſion of it or to inhabit upon it. Their eaſtern bounds are determined to be a line drawn weſtward from the midſt of the road Pawtucket river, neere to Shaws houſe. Their northern bounds is the ſouth line of the Maſſachuſets, which, as the collony complaines, is ſtretched much too ſoutherly. This colony hath many good rivers and harbours, many ſcattering towns not worthy of their names, and a ſcoller to their miniſter in every town or village, but noe places fortified except Seabrook fort, which is much gone to decay, and here, for the moſt part, they are rigid preſbyterians.</p>
               <p>The colony of Road Iſland and Providence plantations returned their humble thankes to his Majeſty for ſending commiſſioners and made great demonſtration of their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and obedience. They approved, as moſt reaſonable, that appeals ſhould be made to his Majeſtyes commiſſioners, who having heard and determined ſome cauſes among them, referred other ſome, in civility, to their generall court, and ſome to the governor and others; ſome of which cauſes they again remitted to the commiſſioners to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. All proceedings are in his Majeſtyes name, they admit all to be freemen that deſire it; they allow liberty of conſcience and worſhip to all who live civilly, and if any can inform them of any thing in their lawes or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes derogatory to his Majeſtyes honour, they will amend it. The Marquis of Hamiltons pattent takes in all Road Iſland colony and about half of Conecticote. The Narhiganſet Sachims did in the year 1664, by writing, ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their people and country, into the late Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; two of which Sachims, now living, did actually, in their own perſons, ſurrender themſelves, people and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, into his royall Majeſtyes protection before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:011300_0210_0F86CB7F18561E28"/>
and deliverd to them them that very deed made in 1664, which had been carefully kept by Mr. Gorton, &amp;c. whereupon the commiſſioners, according to their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, entred upon the country in his Majeſtyes name and have named it the Kings province, have taken the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives into his Majeſtyes protection, and have appoynted juſtices of the peace to govern it untill his Majeſtyes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be farther known. For this Narhyganſet country is allmoſt all the land belonging to the country, the which cannot ſubſiſt without it, and therefore the commiſſioners ordered that the magiſtrates for the colony ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the peace for the Kings province, that noe difference may ariſe betwixt the officers. The Sachims did thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receive the two coates preſented to them in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtyes name. In acknowledgment of their ſubjection they are to pay yearly, upon the 26th of May, two wolf ſkins to his Majeſty, and did now ſend two caps of peague and two clubs inlayed with peague for a preſent to the King, and a feather mantle and a porcupine bag for a preſent to the Queen, which ware all taken by the Dutch. One of theſe princes, named Paſſicus, deſired the commiſſioner to pray King Charles that noe ſtrong liquor might be brought into that country, for he had 32 men that died by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Theſe Indian princes gave a long petition to the commiſſioners, complaining of many acts of violence and injuſtice which the Maſſachuſets had done to them: Among others, they firſt cauſed them to be fined, then tooke their whole country in mortgage (according to the remonſtrance ſent to his Majeſty) and would have juggled them out of it; but there could be noe redreſſe, the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets refuſing to let the commiſſioners have the hearing of appeals. Their weſtern bounds are determined with Conecticote, their northern bounds muſt be the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets ſouthern line, wherever it falls (which they complain to be too ſoutherly) their eaſtern bounds betwixt them and New Plymouth could not be determined by conſent of both parties (Road Iſland claiming a ſhred of land 3 miles broad all the length of the maine land lying next to
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:011300_0210_0F86CB7F18561E28"/>
the Narhyganſet iſland, which they of New Plymouth could not part with without great prejudice) whereupon commiſſioners appoynted the water (the naturall bounds of each colony) to be their preſent bounds, untill his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtves pleaſure be farther known. Mr. William Brenton, deputy governor of Road Iſland, having bought a farm upon that ſhred of land which he hoped would belong to that colony, humbly deſires his Majeſty that he may continue to poſſeſſe that farme though it falls within the line of New Plymouth, and Doctor Alcock, a phyſician, having bought Block Iſland for 400<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> of ſome of Boſton, who took upon them power (never graunted them) to ſell it, and having been at great charges in planting of it, deſires his Majeſty that he may not be diſpoſſeſſed of it, he humbly ſubmitting to the government of Road Iſland; both theſe petitions to his Majeſty are loſt. This colony, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of all religions, even Quakers and Genneralliſts, was begun by ſuch as the Maſſachuſets would not ſuffer to live among them and is generally hated by the other colonyes, who endeavoured ſeverall wayes to ſuppreſſe them; they maintained ſeveral other Indians againſt the Narhyganſet Indians. The commiſſioners of the united colonyes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a great part of this country, pretending they had conquered it from the Pequod Indians, but evidence being made that the Narhyganſets had conquered it before the Engliſh began their war, and that the right was in him who had ſold it to the Road Iſlanders, and his Majeſtyes commiſſioners not thinking it juſtifiable for any colony to diſpoſe of land without their own lymits, determined it for the Road Iſlanders. The Maſſachuſets did maintain Pumham (a petty Sachim in this province) twenty years againſt this colony and his chief Sachim, and did, by armed ſoldiers, beſiedge and take priſoners Mr. Gorton, Howden, Weeks, Green and others in this province, and carryed them to Boſton, put them in chains, and took eighty head of cattle from them, for all which they could never yet get ſatisfaction. This colony could never be acknowledged for a colony till his Majeſty's
<pb n="416" facs="unknown:011300_0211_0F86CB7FC17D6C88"/>
charter was publiſhed, though in the year 1643 they ſent over ſome into England to procure the King's charter then, but finding that unnaturall war begun, and the King gone from London, they took a charter from the lords and commons, which was more then Newhaven did pretend to, and more then Conecticot could ſhew, yet theſe two were admitted colonys in their great combination, and Road Iſland ſlighted. The Narhyganſet bay is the largeſt and ſafeſt port in New-England neareſt the ſea and fitteſt for trade; this colony hath two ſcattered towns upon Road Iſland, two upon the maine land, and four ſmall villages; here only yet is lime ſtone found, and here only the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and magiſtrates ſerve the publick at their own charge. In this colony is the greateſt number of Indians, yet they had never any thing allowed towards the civillizing and converting the Indians, and in this colony they have the greateſt playnes, but noe place of ſtrength fortified, altho' many places capable of fortification. In this province is the beſt Engliſh graſſe and moſt ſheep, the ground very fruitfull, ewes bringing ordinarily two lambs, corn yields eighty for one, and in ſome places they have had corn twenty ſix years together without manuring. In this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince only they have not any places ſett apart for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, there being ſoe many ſubdivided ſects they cannot agree to meet together in one place, but according to their ſeveral judgments they ſometimes aſſociate in one houſe ſometimes in another.</p>
               <p>The colony of New-Plymouth did ſubmit to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals made to the commiſſioners, who here had but one plaint to them, which was, that the governour would not let a man enjoy a farm of four miles ſquare which he had bought of an Indian, the complaint ſoone ſubmitted to the governor when he underſtood the unreaſonablenes by it. They are here conſtrained to perſwade men, ſometimes to compell there, to be free men, ſoe far are they from hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any. This colony is ſeated on a neck of land the baraneſt part of the country. They were the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in New-England, though the Maſſachuſetts got the
<pb n="417" facs="unknown:011300_0211_0F86CB7FC17D6C88"/>
firſt charter, and ſince hath much ſtreightned this colony by ſtretching their line ſo much ſoutherly. They ſhewed their charter and gave a copy of it to their commiſſioners, and told them they were ſo poore they could not renew it; whereupon the commiſſioners took occaſion to offer to get their charter renewed and delivered to them at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners own charge, if, for a further demonſtration of their loyalty, they would let his Majeſty chooſe one of three (whoſe names themſelves ſhould ſend to the King) to be their governor, and this to be done every 3 yeare, or every 5 years, which they thought beſt. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners thought if this had ſucceeded in this the firſt colony they had viſitted it might have been a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the reſt; but after the generall aſſembly had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of it, with many thankes to the commiſſioners and great proteſtations of their loyalty to the King, they choſe to be as they were. They have about twelve ſmall towns, one ſaw mill for boards, one bloomary for iron, neither good river nor good harbour, nor any place of ſtrength; they are ſoe poore, they are not able to maintain ſcollers to their miniſters, but are neceſſitated to make uſe of a guifted brother in ſome places.</p>
               <p>The collony of the Maſſachuſetts was the laſt and hardlieſt perſwaded to uſe his Majeſtyes name in the forms of juſtice. In this collony, at the firſt coming over of the commiſſioners, were many untruths raiſed and ſent into the collonyes, as that the King had ſent to raiſe 5000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> yearly for his Majeſtyes uſe, whereupon Major Hawthorne made a ſeditious ſpeech at the head of his company, and the late Governor another at their meeting houſe in Boſton, but neither of them were ſoe much as queſtioned for it by any of their magiſtrates. The commiſſioners viſitted all other collonyes before this, hoping both that the ſubmiſſion and condeſcention of the other collonyes to his Majeſtyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires would have abated the refractorineſſe of this collony, which they much feared, and that the aſſiſtance of Colonel Nicholls (whome they expected) would have prevailed much: But neither examples nor reaſons could prevaile

with them to let the commiſſioners hear and determine ſoe much as thoſe particular caſes (Mr. Deanes and the Indian Sachims) which the King had commanded them to take care of and doe juſtice in: And though the commiſſioners, who never deſired they ſhould appear as delinquents but as defendents, either by themſelves or by their attorneys, aſſured them that if they had been unjuſtly complained of to his Majeſty, their falſe accuſers ſhould be ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and their juſt dealing made known to his Majeſty and all the world, yet they proclaimed by ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet that the generall court was the ſupreameſt judicatory in all that province, that the commiſſioners pretending to hear appeals was a breach of their priviledges graunted them by the Kings royall father and confirmed to them by his Majeſtyes own letter, and that they ſhould not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt it; by which they have for the preſent ſilenced above 30 petitions which deſired juſtice againſt them, and were all loſt at ſea. To elude his Majeſtyes deſire of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting men civill and of competent eſtates to be freemen, they have made an act, whereby he that is 24 years old, a houſekeeper, and brings a certificate of his civill life, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his being orthodox in matters of faith, and a third of his paying ten ſhillings, beſide head money, at a ſingle rate, may then have liberty to make his deſires known to the court, and then it ſhall be put to vote. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners examined many townſhips, and found that ſcarce three in a hundred pay ten ſhillings at a ſingle rate; yet, if this rate were generall it would be juſt; but he that is a church member, though he be a ſervant and pay not two pence, may be a freeman: They will not admitt any who is not a member of their church to communion, nor their children to baptiſme, yet they will marry their children to thoſe whome they will not admitt to baptiſme, if they be rich: They did impriſon and barbarouſly uſe Mr. Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan for baptizing children, as himſelf complained in his petition to the commiſſioners. Thoſe whom they will not admitt to the communion they compell to come to their ſermons, by forcing from them five ſhillings for every
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:011300_0212_0F86CB8082050378"/>
neglect; yet theſe men thought their paying one ſhilling for not coming to prayers in England was an unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tyranny: They have put many Quakers to death, of other provinces, for which alſo they are petitioned againſt; firſt they baniſhed them, as Quakers, upon payn of death, and then executed them for returning: They have beate ſome to jelly, and have been otherwayes exceeding cruell to others, and they ſay the king allows it in his letters to them; indeed they have miſconſtrued all the king's letters to their own ſence. They yet pray conſtantly for their perſecuted brethren in England. They have many things in their laws derogatory to his Majeſty's honnor, of which the commiſſioners made a breviate and deſired that they might be altered, but they have yet done nothing in it; among others, whoever keeps Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas day is to pay five pounds. They cauſed at length a mapp of their territoryes to be made, but it was made in a chamber by direction and gueſſe: in it they claim fort Albany, and beyond it all the land to the ſouth ſea. By their ſouth ſea line they intrench upon the colonys of New Plymouth, Road Iſland and Conecticote; and in the eaſt they have uſurped Capt. Maſons and Sir Ferdinando Gorges pattents; and ſaid that the commiſſioners had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe betwixt them and Mr. Gorges, becauſe his Majeſty neither commanded them to deliver poſſeſſion to Mr. Gorges, or to give his Majeſty reaſon why they did not. The commiſſioners being at Perſcataqua when they received his Majeſtyes letter which commanded them to ſee the harbours fortified, &amp;c. ſent their warrants to four towns upon that river, requiring them to meet at ſuch a time and place to hear his Majeſtyes letter read, one of theſe warrants was ſent poſt to Boſton, from whence two marſhalls are ſent from the governor and counſell with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other warrant to forbid the towns either to meet or doe any thing commanded them by the commiſſioners, at their utmoſt perills; and withall ſent an unbeſeeming letter to the commiſſioners, both which letter and warrant were loſt at ſea. Col. Whaley and Gough were entertained by the magiſtrates with great ſolemnity and feaſted in every place,
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:011300_0213_0F86CB8140B63488"/>
after they were told they were traytors and ought to be apprehended; they made their abode at Cambridge untill they were furniſhed with horſes and a guide and ſent away to Newhaven; for their more ſecurity, Capt. Daniell Gookin is reported to have brought over and to manage their eſtates; and the commiſſioners being informed that he had many cattle at his farm in the Kings province which were ſuppoſed to be Whalyes or Goughs, cauſed them to be ſeazed for his Majeſtyes uſe, till further order, but Capt. Gookin, ſtanding upon the priviledge of their charter and refuſing to anſwer before the commiſſioners, as ſoe, there was noe more done in it; Capt. Peirce who tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Whaly and Gough into New England may probably ſay ſomething to their eſtate. They of this colony ſay that King Charles the firſt gave them power to make laws and to execute them, and graunted them a charter as a warrant againſt himſelf and his ſucceſſors, and that ſo long as they pay the fifth part of all gold and ſilver oare which they ſhall gett they ſhall be free to uſe the privileges graunted them, and that they are not obliged to the King but by civillity; they hope by writing to tire the King, Lord Chancellor and Secretaryes too; ſeaven years they can eaſily ſpin out by writing, and before that time a change may come, nay, ſome have dared to ſay, who knows what the event of this Dutch war will be? This colony furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cromwell with many inſtruments out of their corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and their collidg, and thoſe that have retreated thether ſince his Majeſty's happy return are much reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and many advanced to be magiſtrates. They did ſolicit Cromwell, by one Mr. Winſlow, to be declared a free ſtate, and many times in their lawes ſtiling themſelves this ſtate, this common wealth, and now beleve themſelves to be ſoe. They demand what taxes they pleaſe, but their accounts could never yet be ſeen. Some few ſoldiers they keep at their caſtle; their governor hath 100<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> yearly, every magiſtrate 30<abbr>

                  </abbr> They convert Indians by hiring them to come and hear ſermons, by teaching them not to obey their heathen Sachims, and by appoynting rulers
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:011300_0213_0F86CB8140B63488"/>
amongſt them over tens, twentyes, fiftyes. The lives manners and actions of thoſe whom they ſay are converted, cannot be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe who are not, except it be by being hired to hear ſermons, which the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous natives ſcorn. This colony, which hath ingroſſed the whole trade of New-England and is therefore the richeſt, hath many townes, but not one regularly built within its juſt limitts, which the commiſſioners ſuppoſe to be Seconett brook on the S. W. and Merimack river on the N. E. and two right lines drawn from each of thoſe two places, till they come within 20 miles of Hudſon river, for that river is already planted and given to his royall highneſs. Boſton is the chief town in it, and ſeated upon a penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula in the bottom of a bay, which is a good harbour and full of fiſh. It was fortified this year 1665 with two block houſes, they had, before, a caſtle upon an iſland in the roade where ſhips muſt paſſe, about 5 or 6 miles from the town. Their houſes are generally wooden, their ſtreets crooked, with little decency and noe uniformity and, there, neither months, dayes, ſeaſons of the year, churches nor inns are known by their Engliſh names. At Cambridg they have a wooden collidg and, in the yard, a brick pile of two bayes for the Indians, where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſaw but one; they ſaid they had 3 or more at ſcooll. It may be feared this collidg may afford us many ſciſmaticks to the church, and the corporation as many rebells to the king, as formerly they have done, if not timely prevented. In this colony too the king hath many loyall ſubjects, who petitioned this general court at his Majeſty's firſt coming in, for the owning of his Majeſty, and now laſtly for complying with his Majeſty's commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, but have had neither anſwer nor good look ſince; they are ſorry that ſoe few (for there are ſcarce above 8 of the moſt factious) ſhould carry on ſoe ſtrong a faction, yet they are ſo over-awed that they can doe nothing to remedy it. They only ſay it is now with them as it was with the king's party in Cromwell's time; one of thoſe was derided for being ſoe civill to accompany one of the
<pb n="422" facs="unknown:011300_0214_0F86CB836DDBD670"/>
commiſſioners from the town where he lived to Boſton, and others in Boſton derided thoſe of Road Iſland for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yielded ſoe much to the commiſſioners. In Boſton lyes 10 iron guns brought from the French fort taken in Cromwell's time, which would doe well at Peſcataqua to defend the mouth of that river, where the maſts are laden, if they be the king's. On the 10th of September 1664 they publiſhed by order of court a paper to deter and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten all from making any complaints to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners. The commodities of the country are fiſh, which is ſent into France, Spain and the Streights, pipe ſtaves, maſts, firr boards, ſome pitch and tarr, pork, beef, horſes, and corn, which they ſend to Virginia, Barbados, &amp;c. and take tobacko and ſugar for payment, which they after ſend for England. There is good ſtore of iron made in this province; their way of government is common wealth like; their way of worſhip is rude and called congregational, they are zealous in it, for they perſecute all other formes.</p>
               <p>New-Hampſhire is the name of a province granted to Capt. Robert Maſon about the year 1635, and was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin on the ſea coaſt 3 miles E. of Merimack river, and reaches to Peſcataqua, and 60 miles of that breadth up into the country; but now it is uſurped by the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts who pretend that it is within their bounds, and that the people petitioned to be within their protection; it is true that difference of oppinion made a diviſion among them, and a few who were for congregationall churches did petition for their aſſiſtance, by which occaſion, partly by force and partly by compoſition, they have engroſſed the whole and named it Norfolk. When the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts charter was firſt graunted, the mouths only of the two rivers, Charles and Merimack, were known to them, for they durſt not travill far up into the country, preſently after there was a houſe erected three large miles from Merimack, which was for 17 years called and known to be the bounds of the Maſſachuſetts, and in that time was this pattent graunted to Capt. Maſon. Mr. Wheelwright was baniſhed out of the juriſdiction of Maſſachuſetts and was
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:011300_0214_0F86CB836DDBD670"/>
permitted to inhabit immediately beyond the bound houſe, as himſelf gave teſtimony before the commiſſioners. Mr. Maſon had a pattent for ſome land about Cape Ann before the Maſſachuſetts had their firſt pattent, whereupon Capt. Maſon, and Mr. Cradock, who was the firſt governor of the Maſſachuſetts and lived in London, agreed that the Maſſachuſetts ſhould have that land which was graunted to Capt. Maſon about Cape Ann, and Capt. Maſon ſhould have that land which was beyond Merimack river, and graunted to the Maſſachuſetts. This agreement was ſent to Mr. Henry Joſlin to get recorded at Boſton, but before he could have leaſure to goe thither he heard that Capt. Maſon was dead, and therefore went not, of this he made affidavit before the commiſſioners, who forbore to doe any thing about the limitts of this province till this might more fully be proved, though the generallity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple petitioned to be taken from under the tyranny of the Maſſachuſetts, as themſelves ſtiled it. The Maſſachuſetts, ſince they have had the government of this land, have graunted and divided the province into ſeveral townſhips, which are very long and thin, three of which are ſeated upon Peſcataqua river, which is a very good harbour and very capable of fortification; here are excellent maſts got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and here dry docks might be made, and upon the river are above twenty ſaw mills, and here are great ſtore of pipe ſtaves made, and great ſtore of good timber ſpoyled.</p>
               <p>The province of Mayne begins at the E. ſide of Peſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqua, and reacheth to Kennebeck river; it was named and graunted to Sir Ferdinando Gorges by king Charles the firſt, but was uſurped alſo by the Maſſachuſetts under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it was within the limitts of their charter, and that the people petitioned to be under their government, and they named it Yorkſhire. One gentleman, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſubmitt to the Maſſachuſetts and ſuffered great loſſe by them, ſhewed the commiſſioners a warrant the Maſſachuſetts made to have him brought to Boſton alive or dead, and now demands juſtice againſt them. This province upon petition of the inhabitants and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:011300_0215_0F86CB842FD9DCD8"/>
betwixt Mr. Gorges commiſſioners and the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, his Majeſty's commiſſioners took into his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's protection and government, and appoynted juſtices of the peace to govern them untill his Majeſty's pleaſure be farther known. The inhabitants afterwards petitioned his Majeſty that they might allways continue under his Majeſty's immediate government, and that Sir Rob. Carr might continue their governor under his Majeſty, which petition was loſt at ſea: In this province allſo lives an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Sachim, who lives neer to the great lake, from whence flowes Merimack river; petitioned his Majeſty to take him into his protection, which was allſo loſt. In this province there are but few townes and thoſe much ſcattered, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally they are throughout New-England; they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther farmes than townes: But in this province there is a bay called Caſco bay, in which are very many iſlands, two outletts to the ſea, many good harbours and great ſtore of fiſh and oyſters, crabs and lobſters. In this province, as in all the reſt there are great ſtore of wild ducks, geeſe and deer in their ſeaſons, ſtrawberyes, raſberyes, gooſberyes, barberyes, and ſeverall ſorts of billberyes, ſeverall ſorts of oaks and pines, cheſnut trees, wallnut trees, ſometimes for four of five miles together; the northerly the country the better the timber is accounted: On the N. E. of Kenibeck river, which is the bounds of the province of Mayn, upon Shipſcot river and upon Pemaquid, 8 or 10 miles aſunder, are 3 ſmall plantations belonging to his royall highneſſe, the biggeſt of which hath not above 30 houſes in it, and thoſe very mean ones too, and ſpread over 8 miles at leaſt. Thoſe people, for the moſt part, are fiſhermen and never had any government among them, moſt of them are ſuch as have fled hether from other places to avoide juſtice. Some here are of opinion that as many men may ſhare in a woman as they doe in a boat, and ſome have done ſoe. The commiſſioners, for neceſſity ſake, have appoynted the beſt whom they could find, in each place, to be a juſtice of peace, and have ordered 3 of thoſe juſtices of the peace in the province of Mayn, who live
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:011300_0215_0F86CB842FD9DCD8"/>
next to them, to joyn with them in holding of ſeſſions, till further order be taken. In theſe parts are the beſt white oaks for ſhip timber. All the lands graunted to his royall highneſſe in theſe north parts of New England, except theſe 3 plantations, are allſo graunted to Sir Thomas Temple, in the pattent of Nova Scotia.<note n="*" place="bottom">This Narrative was undoubtedly the work of the Commiſſioners, or ſome Perſon employed by them.

               <p>YOURS of July 1667 wee received by the hand of Capt. Henry Addy, who through the bleſſing of God arrived here ſafe the 14th of this inſtant. Some few dayes before whoſe arrivall a letter from his Excellency the Lord Willoughby, your honourable father, intimating the ſeaſonablenes of ſome preſent ſupply to be made from hence for the reliefe of his Majeſties fleet with you, was received, and care taken ſpeedily to provide and ſend ſuch proviſions as wee in our poor capacity are able, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions are now putting on board the good ſhip called the Hopewell, whereof under God Capt.

               </opener>
               <p>I Was for ſome time paſt very unwilling to believe that you would reaſſume a power of government in the province of Mayne or Yorkeſhire, the abſolute deciſion whereof is lodged with his Majeſty; and ſurely it will appeare an open breach of duty that any of his Majeſtyes inferiour courtes ſhould uſurpe a power over townes and perſons after it hath pleaſed his Majeſty to ſignifie his pleaſure to yourſelves, in theſe following words: "And for the better preventing of all differences and diſputes upon the bounds and lymitts of the ſeaverall collonyes, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtyes pleaſure is, that all determinations made by his Majeſtyes ſayd commiſſioners with reference to the ſayd bounds and lymitts may ſtill continue and be obſerved till upon a full repreſentation of all pretences his Majeſtye ſhall make his owne finall determination," &amp;c. Which very words you will finde in your owne letter from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, concluding thus: "And his Majeſty expects that full obedience be given to this ſignification of his pleaſure in all particulars. Given at the court at Whitehall, the 10th day of Aprill 1666, in the 18th year of his Majeſtyes raigne, by his Majeſtyes command, Wm. Morice." But I have now ſeene the order of your laſt generall court, in anſwer to the petition of ſome reſtleſſe and unquiet ſpirits, wherein your reſolution is already taken to ſend commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to keepe a court and to exerciſe juſtice, &amp;c. as under your government. I know you have force enough to compell moſt of your neighbours to ſubmitt to your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but if you thinke his Majeſtyes arme will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſtretched forth to defend his ſubjects from uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you may attempt any thinge under the notion of ſettling peace and order. I dare not be ſilent in a matter ſoe expreſsly contradictory to his Majeſtyes ſignification, dated 10th Aprill 1666,<note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix to Hiſt. Maſſa.

people have ſpread a report that the ſaid ſignification was never knowne to or owned by his Majeſtie, and probably for that reaſon the generall court was induced to iſſue forth the aforeſaid order, yet you are to expect that his Majeſty will owne his hand, and Sir William Morris will require ſattisfaction for ſuch ſcandalous aſperſions upon him, being principall ſecretary of ſtate. In ſhort, you will finde that province allready ſettled by his Majeſtyes commiſſioners in peace and order, except ſome few turbulent ſpirits. You may read his Majeſtie hath made a temporary confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, why then are you ſoe haſty to enter upon a thinge of this nature, or how can you ſay that you have heard nothing ſince that might diſcourage or weaken your title to the ſaid government? I am neceſſitated to write in theſe playne and large termes becauſe the ſhortneſſe of my tyme in theſe parts will not permit me to give you a viſit, but will tell you my feares, that if you proceed to compell an alteration of government in the province of Mayne, by ſubverting there preſent eſtabliſhment as it now ſtands cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, in all likelyhood you may cauſe blood to be ſhed, for it is both naturall and lawfull for men to defend their faſt rights againſt all invaders.</p>

                  <salute>Right Worſhipfull, Reverend and Beloved,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE received yours dated from Boſton Aug. 21. 1671. directed to many of us, which alſo we have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times conſidered, as the providence of God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us opportunities of meeting together. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the contents thereof, together with the honor and reſpect we owe you all, obligeth us to return you ſuch anſwer as we are at preſent capable of, according to that diſpoſall which it hath pleaſed the infinitely wiſe God to make of us in our ſtations, and alſo of the conditions which he hath meaſured out to his people amongſt whom he hath placed us, from whom, as well as ourſelves, you cannot expect (as things ſtand with us) to receive that fruit that either your need calls for or our love would produce, were we not ourſelves, together with the churches of Chriſt in theſe nations, intangled in many ſtraits, and thereby call'd to a more univerſall deſignment of what God hath graciouſly left his poor people to the ſupportation of the intereſt of his goſpell and the miniſters and profeſſors thereof, whoſe daily relief depends, as to many counties, principally upon this citty, from whom alſo we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ourſelves the greateſt part if not all of that little we can hope to attain to, to expreſſe the value we have for the intereſt of our dear Lord Jeſus amongſt you, and more eſpecially the promoting of the continuance of it in our aſſiſtence to the education of ſuch as may by the bleſſing of his grace and ſpirit be uſefull in their generation for the running and glorifying of his goſpell in and by your numerous growing poſterity.</p>
               <p>As to the three branches of your letter, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the whole of it, we doe according to the beſt of our judgments repreſent our thoughts to you which we hope will be acceptable to you, as you may find in it any labor of love towards you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="unknown:011300_0218_0F86CB8DEB101410"/>Firſt, We join with you in that humble thankfullneſſe which is due to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he hath for ſo long a time planted and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued amongſt you a ſchool of the prophets, from whence have iſſued ſuch inſtruments as God hath uſed for ſervice to himſelf, even in both Englands, and heartily condole, that not only the dead ſtones, but alſo the living ones in that foundation are ſo much crumbled and diminiſhed, and gladly would we contribute our helping hand to the repairing of the one and the reviving of the other, were our power ſuited to our wills. But upon conſideration of the ſtraits and troubles the miniſters and churches of Chriſt are here wreſtling with, and after conſultation had with ſome wiſe and godly gentlemen, ſincere lovers of you, we find in ourſelves and them the concentring of the ſame thoughts, that the exhauſted purſes of thoſe that are moſt able to contribute, cannot reach any ſumme conſiderable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the repair of the edifice, ſo many of God's ſervants here calling for daily relief, even of neceſſaries to them and their impoveriſhed families, yet have we adviſed about ſending you what aſſiſtance God ſhall enable us unto for the maintenance of Fellows and Tutors for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and education of youths, who may be bred up in good literature and fear of the Lord, for future imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in church and common-wealth, in which we can ſay there is a reall zeale for you and them in this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. Several wayes have been propoſed and debated, we cannot yet acquaint you with any fully determinate meanes for effecting, yet this we were willing to adviſe you of, that you are in our hearts, and that we are fully purpoſed (if the preſent liberty we have to meet be not interrupted by thoſe preſaged hurryes which ſeeme to be in the womb of Providence coming upon us) to uſe all our indeavour to collect ſuch ſummes of money (and ſo to diſpoſe them by the beſt advice we can take) as may in time amount to ſome comfortable help towards the end which we ſpecified before, in the ſervice whereof we judge that which is moſt neceſſary for you (at leaſt that we are capable of) may be attended.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="431" facs="unknown:011300_0218_0F86CB8DEB101410"/>2dly, As we deſire to bleſs God with and for you, that ſo reverend and judicious a perſon as your preſident hath for ſo long a time been continued with you, and that ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſo it is a grief of heart to us that there appeares none amongſt yourſelves to ſucceed him in that employment, and more that we cannot find perſons whoſe hearts God hath touched to goe over to you, in order to a ſupply of that expected loſſe which you mention; yet, if our advice herein be worth attending to, we would ſuggeſt, that it having pleaſed God to ſtirre up the heart of our beloved friend Dr. Hoar to intend a voyage towards you by this ſhipping, we do ſuppoſe a ſpeaking providence in it, and doe judge that God hath ſo farr furniſhed him with the gifts of learning and the grace of his ſpirit, as that if your judgments concurre with ours and his inclinations (if God ſhall bring him to you) he may in ſome meaſure ſupply that want and help to make up this breach, and we ſhall hope and pray that it may be to ſome good fruit to you and yours.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, For what concerns our promoting the ſending of youths over to you for their education, wee can ſay no more but this, that where we find any inclined ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their children, we ſhall not be wanting to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it as farre as we hear there ſhall be reaſon for it, by the Lords proviſion of ſuch help amongſt you as ſhall be continued yet unto you or further added by him in whoſe hands is the reſidue of the ſpirit, to be poured out on you and on your ſeed, according to his covenant. So commending you to the Lord and to the word of his grace we remaine</p>

               <p>HOW greatly doe I long to ſee thee, but ſeeing that cannot be, thy choych lettars doe much refrech my drouping heart, to heare of thy health and happynes, with thy deare friend,<note n="†" place="bottom">Whaley, her father.</note> is the chefe comfort I have in this world, next to ſole marciſe. I receved yours of the 6 of novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I cared the incloſed and did as you deſired, which I parſeved was liked better then a lettar would have been from you; he hoped to ſend ſomething but not yet, he told me you wantid nothing ſo far as he could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darſtand, I wich you find it ſo, but the Lord is very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhous to you and us in taking care, and tis a choyc marcy not to want that the Lord will not have us to inioy, tis the worke of the Lord to bring our minds to our condiſhon, but I find hope deſired makes the heart ſick, but the Lord is pleſed to be the veſhion in the applycation of ſom word or other, as that I will never leve thee nor forſake thee, I will be your God and the God of your ſead, and throe marcy I have found it in ſome meſhere maid good, for Frank is, I bles the Lord, receved into the chorch and gave great ſattisfaxon to all that ware preſent, theare was eldars, deakons and ſom other of the membars that ſpake with her at forſt and the whole church was ſattisfid in her, and I hope the Lord who hath begon the worke will finneſh it to his glory and our comfort that ſhe may help kepe up the name of the Lord in the world when we are laid in the doſt. I found the incloſed, it being of her one writing, I have ſent it to thee that we may reioyce and bles

the Lord together for ſo great a marcy; a porſhon in him ſelf is the beſt porſhon for this cannot be loſt, the Lord help us all to love him more and then the parting with earthly comforts will not be ſo grevous to us as it tis, deare Mrs. Jane hath ſent ſome goods ſhe being perſwaded that it would be beſt this year, if the Lord pleſe to ſend them ſafe and that thay be well maneged for you and your freinds benefit. I truſt the Lord will make it of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to you, for my aunt toke great paines to ſend it before the war begon and we hope it is gon ſafe, we deſire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it with prayers. If you be good lads and will ſend word what you want theare will be care taken to ſoply you, but tell then I forbare to ſend becauſe it is your deſire. I bles the Lord I want nothing but thy deare company and thy friends. Give all the glory to God he is the giver of all our marceyes. It will not be long but I muſt be gon to thoſe manſhones that Chriſt hath prepared for me and all that love the Lord; theare will be no ſorrow but fulnes of joy and pleſhures for ever more; but if it may ſtand with the pleſhure of my father I ſhold be glad to ſee thee and peaſe upon Iſarell onſe more, but I feare I am not worthy of ſuch a marcy, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is, for whoſe ſake he will appeare in the beſt time. I have ſent you the incloſed by which you may ſee that the pepell of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy much liberty at the preſent but what the eſhue of it may be the Lord knows. The war with the Duch is like to be very terabel; the Lord ordar all things for his one glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Chriſt is the head of the church and that may comfort us in the medſt of all theſe commoſhons. I bles the Lord I and your ſiſtars and other friends are in health, only Betty is weakly, my ant takes great care of my brother as if he ware her one and is very kind to all the ſamely and to all that feare the Lord, for ſhe makes it her buiſnes to help the afflicted; many have cauſe to bles the Lord for her; doutles ſhe will have a hye place in heaven; her good huſband is much afflicted with the ſtone which makes him ſtratened in time that I fear he cannot write but prays dayly for you. Mrs Jane is much pleſed when you write

Pray Child be carefull of yourſelf and friend and if you want a periweg to keep you warm let me know it and I will ſend you one; pray want for nothing that may be good for you, for my happynes is bound up in your well being. The going of the ſhips are very unſartain and therefore I know not whether I may write any more this yeare or not, but I ſhall not ſeſe to pray for you and all the pepell of the Lord with you, eſpecially for thoſe that ſhow kindnes to you to whom I deſire to be remembred and returne hearty thanks for all thear great love; I hope the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them a thouſand fould. If anny thing be don by us to your prejediſh pray let me know it from yourſelfe. Many friends deſire to be remembred to you and prays dayly for you, all your ſiſtars preſents thear humbell duty and greatly longs to ſee you, my moſt indeared love to thyſelf and humbel duty to whom it belongs, I bles the Lord that theare is anny hopes of his recovery, the Lord profit the marcy and ſanctifie all his dealings to us and let every mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and every afflixon that we mete with bring us nearer to himſelfe and then we ſhall have no cauſe to complayn, my child this is like to be a very trobelſom ſommar and therfore pray hard that the Lord wold appeare for his poore pepell and that the goſpell may be upheld. Many nay allmoſt all that fear the Lord have apprehenſhons that God is bringing ſom great ſtroke upon this naſhon, the Lord devart his judgments if it be his will or however hide his pepell while theſe calametyes be over paſt, we have yet a breathing time, the Lord give hearts to improve it. The churches of Chriſt many of them ware in greate likly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods to mete in the halls, having a grant from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes, but at preſent theare is a demur on it, you may ges from home, but the Lord raineth let the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, doutles this is a great blow to the buſhops, but I ſhall be to troubelſom thoe I know not how to leve when

               <head>Copy of the Elders Advice to the General Court.</head>
               <p>WHEREAS it hath pleaſed this honnourable generall court aſſembled and ſetting in Boſton the 15th of May 1672, to call us ſeverall of the elders of the churches in this colonie, to conſider, conſult and adviſe concerning the preſent difficult emergencies before them, in order to the free, full and amicable concurrence of both houſes in managing ſuch caſes of judicature as are repreſented unto this court, by petition or otherwiſe, according to law; wee thought incumbent on us as an indiſpenſable duty, preſſed under the ſenſe of the great conſequence of the queſtion, it being to us a matter of the greateſt importance, on the one hand, to ſay nothing that might in the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the honour, power and authority due to the honored magiſtrates, or, on the other, infringe, weaken or make voide the liberties, priviledges or power by our conſtitution appertaining to the freemen, both which are more deare to us than our lives; ſeeing that in the temperament of both ſtandeth the firmneſſe of our civil being and the happineſſe of this whole people, in the preſervation of the common intereſt; wee thought good humbly to ſuggeſt as the reſult of our ſerious thoughts on the whole confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that it pleaſed this honoured generall court to
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:011300_0221_0F86CB91CC0B34C8"/>
admit us unto the hearing of amongſt themſelves for our formation in the ſtate of the caſe, theſe propoſals following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our civil conſtitution reſpecting both the form and adminiſtration of civil government, it is or ought to be founded in and upon our charter by which wee are incorporated into a body politique, and furniſhed both with legiſlative and executive power, and giveth life and ſtrength both to the being and operations of our civil politie, and maketh us a people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That therefore this our charter is to be kept and obſerved inviolably in all the fundamentalls of civil policy, therein directing to the right conſtitution of courts and regular diſtribution of differing intereſt of power and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege between the magiſtrates and the freemen, and the diſtinct exerciſe of legiſlative and executive power by thoſe who are by pattent veſted therewith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in any particular which doth admit a latitude of interpretation and fall under a different underſtanding amongſt us, ſuch a juſt accommodation as may conſiſt with our patent and beſt provide for the publicke ſatisfaction and ſafety is moſt adviſeable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That although wee concurre fully with thoſe our worthy predeceſſors in the miniſtry who when called to give their advice in the like, if not the ſame caſe, have placed the negative vote in the major part of both houſes, as, in their underſtanding, moſt agreeable to the charter and conducible to the publick weale of this colony, as by their manuſcripts yet extant more fully doth appeare:</p>
               <p>Yet, for a preſent accommodation (wee humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) that our honoured magiſtrates bill referring to the iſſuing of all debates in matters of judicature (in caſe of the non-concurrence of both houſes voting apart) unto the vote of the whole court mett together, or the major part of them, whereof the governor, deputie governor and four magiſtrates, or otherwiſe five of the magiſtrates at leaſt ſhall alwayes bee a part, to the making any valid act; wee ſay wee humbly conceive that a mutuall conceſſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto and a joynt concurrance herein may bee a ſitt medium
<pb n="438" facs="unknown:011300_0222_0F86CB92917E7848"/>
of ſuch an accommodation, as that which falls within a true latitude of interpetation, and for this wee humbly ſubmit our reaſons to your conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the patent doth expreſly make and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate two diſtinct eſtates conſtituting this corporation, as 1ſt, That of the governor, deputy governor and aſſiſtants. 2dly, That of the freemen. Therefore, either to confound theſe two eſtates of magiſtrates and freemen, ſo as that there ſhould be noe diſtinction in the exerciſe of executive power, or to diveſt the magiſtrates of the exerciſe of all executive power, or to inveſt the freemen with a power equall unto, and in caſe above, the magiſtrates in the finall determination of matters of judicature; or to ſwallow up the whole eſtate of the magiſtracy, with all their intereſt of place, power and patent right together, by a major vote of the freemen in court, doth ſeem to us to ſhake and overthrow the boundaries of two diſtinct eſtates laid in the charter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the patent doth, according to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, conſtitutue a quorum of the magiſtrates in all generall courts, with whom there is a negative vote in matters properly appertaining to that court, elſe what meanes that clauſe divers times induſtriouſly inſerted, of which the governor, deputy governor and ſix of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhall be ſeven, which, if ſo, then totally to null that quorum and negative vote together, ſeems to us to bee a fundamentall errour in government, according to patent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe, to leave the finall determination of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in any caſe altogether to the freemen, doth tend to evacuate our great liberty and priviledge of election, as to one main end of it, unto which our honoured magiſtrates are ſolemnly ſworne, viz. the adminiſtration of eivil juſtice according to the lawes of the land, which they cannot poſſibly doe if altogether ſuperſeded by the major vote of the freemen in generall court; all which, wee humbly conceive would be prevented if the aforeſaid accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may bee attained.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="439" facs="unknown:011300_0222_0F86CB92917E7848"/>5. That for the prevention of trouble and expence of time to the honoured generall court, by hearing and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineing caſes civill or criminall, it ſeemes expedient, by law, to provide that there may bee a more open way to an iſſue of ſuch caſes in inferiour courts of judicature, by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bench and jury, and that the magiſtrates may be, by expreſſe law, directed to accept the juries verdict and to grant judgment accordingly, unleſſe they ſhall judge the juries verdict to be evidently contrary to law and evidence, in which caſe, that they may bee impowered by law to cauſe the jurie to anſwer for their default, in the ſame court, before a jurie of twenty four perſons choſen by the freemen, or otherwiſe to bee liable to bee ſerved by the party aggrieved with a writ of attainder out of the ſame court, or otherwiſe as this honoured court may ſee more aptly and amply to provide.</p>
               <p>It being the great liberty of an Engliſh ſubject to be tryed by his peers, before whom he hath free and full libertie to plead law for his indempnitie and ſafety.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That when the worthy deputies in generall court engage as judges in matters of judicature it may bee thought meet and juſt that they are ſworne according to law, ſo farre at leaſt as the magiſtrates are ſworne, which ſeemes neceſſary in reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, That acting joyntly and together with the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates they may act under the ſame obligation of law and conſcience. It ſeemes very incongruous, that of joynt judges ſome ſhould bee ſworne to judge according to law, and others left with a latitude to judge according to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience only, and ſo that the magiſtrates ſhould be only judges and the deputies judges and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors in the ſame court.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. That our perſons, names, eſtates, lives, and all, may bee under the protection of law, which is the great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the ſubject, and that it may not reſt in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience of any of our judges to vacate our lawes and in an extrajudiciall way to paſſe judgment in any caſe under a legall cognizance.</p>

As to the news from England all men, both wiſe and others of more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cappaſſityes, looke on the effect or produce thereof will be as black a daye in the world, as the world hath knowne. The late actions in England in commiſſionating their fleet to ſeiſe and fall on the Hollander, of which I wrote you in my laſt, breaking their league, joyning with the French, aſſiſting them with ſouldiers out of England, and with their principall harbours to receive a numerous army and ſhutting up the exchequer, whereby many are outed of their eſtates contrary to all lawe, are thinges that both in England and here, by men of all ſorts, are looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſtrange, horrid, and omminous.

                  </abbr> charged on Capt. Peirce, which is in my hands, ſaving what hath binn diſburſed, according to your order, to Mr. Ruſhworth, whom I have, as you directed, employed ſince 24th June laſt, to have an eye upon your affayres, though I neglect it not myſelfe. I agreed to give him 3 guynies a quarter and have accordingly payd him 9 at the rates they goe, which is 20<abbr>s.</abbr> a piece, and have agreed to be at all contingent charges of fees or tranſcribing papers; which beſides a croune or thereabout which I have layd out is all yet out of purſe; unleſs you ſhall think fitt to allow any thing towards the charges of the publique papers I have formerly and now ſent, which I have hitherto payd out of my owne wholly. Your letter directed to Dr. Owen, Mr. Woodbridge and myſelfe, wee did not communicate to him, his abode being at Newberry and ſeldome in towne, and, betwixt you and I, wee judge one that is not very likely to be ſerviceable to you. You need not give any account of it to Mr. Symons. Through Gods goodneſs there is not the leaſt cauſe to write to you about any thing at preſent that concernes you, ſaving that New-York being reſtored by the peace one Mr. Andrews is appointed governor, a man I know not; and ſome rumour is mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſpread at court that you have made peace with the Dutch there, which is obviated by the readineſs of ſome perſons to ſhew the falſhood of it. I hope nothing will for this year further diſturbe you, and if any thing doe ariſe it will be from New-Yorke and the government there, I have therefore greatly encouraged ſome gentlemen your friends, who would purchaſe it of his royall highneſs, as thinking it will be much for your peace, who are about it, but how it will iſſue I know not. Mr. Ruſhworth hath not had any thing to doe for you as yet, but only to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what the council table or council of trade ſhould
<pb n="444" facs="unknown:011300_0225_0F86CB94C0C60B38"/>
paſſe, before the laſt of which Plymouth patent hath layn long, but nothing done in it. I hope you ſhall want no infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, only I hear the King is offended that ſome of your ſhips take in their lading from Virginia and goe to France and defraud his cuſtomes, as alſoe from other plantations; to which I know not what to ſay. The truth is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing the parliament is ſome yea much diſcontent to them, when they had ſoe many good things before them, and the preſent tranſactions in Europe, with the kings vaſt debts, and their not having yet come to any reſolve as to the future way of paying of them, takes up all their thoughts that they have little time to mind ſuch minute things as yours, untill ſome old things be againe revived or new provocations given, in which I doubt not God will enable you to walke wiſely. All the publique news and papers moſt choyce, as to manuſcript or print, that have come out in the time of war or parliament, I have encloſed in a box which my brother Hammond will take up, it is ſhipped in Mr. Clements, whom I have ordered to deliver them to you and pray you, after you have peruſed them, to let my father have them for the uſe of friends; and were there any thing conſiderable that is not there I ſhould add it, ſaving the preſaging of mens minds of ſome dangers of papiſts and popery, and other things not fit for papers. The 2 nations are diſcompoſed as to the prorogueing of the parliament, eſpecially Scotland, where hath binn ſad jangling betwixt the Duke of Lauderdale and the nobility, which may iſſue in diſquietments. I am, I bleſs God, well, with my wife, who preſents you and your lady with her ſervice, and ſoe are all your relations. God hath binn afflicting our family here, having taken away lately my only daughter, and alſoe, as I hear, my relations there have had ſore breaches, the Lord ſanctifye to them and me his holy hand. Since my laſt it hath pleaſed God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move by death Mr. Lodor, Mr. Venning and ſome other miniſters of the preſbiterian perſwaſion, holy men and much lamented; as alſoe lately Sir Thomas Temple, whom melancholy and griefe hath killed by his hard uſage
<pb n="445" facs="unknown:011300_0225_0F86CB94C0C60B38"/>
from Mr. Elliott, but eſpecially the occaſion given of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall by his lodging at his old Mrs. her houſe, Mrs. Martin, which having heard the echo of again from New England, from the letters that ſome too uncharitably wrote, did ſit deep upon his ſpirit and haſtened his end: He ſent for mee and I was with him ſeverall houres, before hee dyed a week, and hee layd open his ſoul; it was a meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yea great neceſſity, I judge, afterward that caſt him at that wretches houſe; hee did declare in the preſence of God, that noe temptation, noe not in a luſt after her, had ever come upon his ſpirit but contrarywiſe a great abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of it, was deeply afflicted that any had ſoe much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grevated the report, and that the name of God ſhould ſuffer. I ſaw neither diſeaſe nor paine that would haſten his end, but his ſpirit broken, his inward eſtate darke, wherein God did enable mee to doe him ſome ſmall ſervice. I hope he had the root of the matter in him and is gone home to reſt. Your concuſſions you have at the colledge doe greatly grieve mee, and ſoe much the more that noe friend hath binn pleaſed to give me a true ſtate of it, but all I gather, from them that I ſee, are wholly of one ſyde; it cauſeth a great rumour here, and is greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated to the preſidents reproach, in whom I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, for hee was a member with us, but it ſeems hath joined himſelfe with the 3d church at Boſton, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth me, although I doe judge his relation thereby to us is erazed, all that I would ſay is, that it hath by our New England friends here binn layd as a reproach upon all the elders, yet I think without cauſe; for if our letter bee viewed you will not find that wee did recommend him to bee your preſident, wee judged that too much for us to undertake, nor did wee excite him to come or urge him upon ſuch hopes; it was his own eagre deſire after it and his thinking that hee might bee ſerviceable there; all wee ſayd was, that ſince hee was prepared to come wee thought him one that might bee helpfull in your colledge worke and left it with you to judge how; if there be any other expreſſions, or to the like purpoſe of what I mention, they
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:011300_0226_0F86CB96832A3DE0"/>
are none of ours; I hope the letter is kept, and if you would doe mee the favour to ſend mee the original, or a true copy, I ſhould returne it to you again ſafely, though I had rather have the original. I hope that noe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of ours will cauſe you to continue him, if you find him unfitt; better hee ſuffer than the glory of the colledge bee mined, as is the expreſſion of ſeveral letters from the very beſt hands there. Juſt as I was writing this, came to hand yours of the 12th of February 1673, wherein I have ſome account of the things I am now wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about, for which I thanke you, and find your candid opinion of the Dr's actings, like to Mr. Stoughton's who gave mee much the ſame ſentiments about the matter of fact, but did not inſtance in what was charged againſt him. I hope God will pleas to heal that breach or to direct you to what may bee moſt for the good of the colledge; and to add noe more of that, the kind and obliging expreſſions which you are pleaſed to uſe towards mee I returne you my humble thanks for, and pray I may be continued in your love and prayers as I deſire to mind you in mine, though weak and ſinfull. Sir, I ſhall only further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you that Capt. Peirce required a diſcharge for the whole ſumme, and conſidering the 100<abbr>

If it be ſoe, I deſire you will ſeriouſly conſider whether the collony is not to make me reparation, by taking the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the rates he might have ſould it. And firſt I muſt tell you, in fact, its what his Majeſty doth here, for ſince the war our ſalpeter did riſe conſiderably to tranſporte, his Majeſty prohibited the exportation and paid us the ſame price to a farthing, reddy money, that we could have ſould it for, and hath the peter ſtill in his ſtores.

ought to beare it, it being but little to each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon when the whole beares it, but heavy where one beares it; and if there be a benefit, as undoubtedly it was judged, the whole did pertake of it, which they ought to doe at theire owne charge and not at mine.

               <p>There has been much diſcourſe and complaint about Mr. Gorges's pattent; it were good if ſuch things were taken up, leaſt in the future they prove prejudiciall.

               <p>I Formerly wrote unto you about my ſuffering in my powder, in which I hope you will ſee mee righted; ſince which, being at the corporation for the propagateing the goſpel amongſt the Indians, I found the commiſſioners letter did not incoredge the ſending any ſtocke into the country, but upon conſideration amongſt themſelves have at laſt reſolved to ſend ſome, remitting it into the hands of

Mr. John Richards and Mr. Peter Sergeant, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for that worke. If you pleaſe to adviſe with them and others, and find a way of certain improvement by buying lands, mortgages or other ſecurity, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the corporation may be inclined to goe in debt here to remitt a good ſome over. And indeed if you had my apprehenſions of things you would endeaver it.</p>
               <p>And now to returne to what I began with. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded your country will afford good peter and it would be your advantage to make powder yourſelves, and in the mean time to have a ſtore by you, that you may not be in ſtraights, upon any ſudden breach. I wiſh I may not be a prophet (as I have binn twice to ſome amongſt you) in this, that I feare another warre. Upon which account, had I had the freedom of the diſpoſe of the commodity, or that the country would have bought it now its cheape, I ſhould have ſent a large ſupply this yeare, but now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare untel I heare from you, and may then doe it, if the doar be open.

               </opener>
               <p>ON the 23d July I received yours of the 29th March 1674, with the incloſed that ſhould have come laſt year, hoping you have alſo by this time received mine of the 21ſt May laſt, which informs you how it was then with myſelfe and your old friend Mr. R.<note n="*" place="bottom">Whaley.</note> and that I wrote largely to yourſelfe and dear Mrs. Jaines, in October laſt, which I perceive you have not received, which I am very ſorry for; but it hath been a great mercy that all my former letters came ſafely to your hands, and as for thoſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hazard of their miſcarriage by reaſon of the warres, I kept the coppyes of them, and for your further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I have again tranſcribed, that you may ſee I was not unmindfull of my duty in writing to you and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your deſire of my advice concerning my ſiſter Fr.<note n="†" place="bottom">His daughter Frances.</note> of whoſe diſpoſall in marriage you have now given me the account, ſo far as you conceive you could, and I believe are longing to underſtand my thoughts of it. Dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you are pleaſed to ſay well, that you gave me an account how it hath pleaſed the Lord to diſpoſe of her, &amp;c. It is indeed the Lord, who is her heavenly father, that hath diſpoſed of her and provided this huſband for her, and therefore, tho he be unknowne to me, I do believe he is the fitteſt perſon in the world for her, and that ſhe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the moſt meet help for him. I remember in a former letter to yourſelfe, when you deſired my thoughts in a matter concerning her, I tould you I was confident the Lord would take care of her and in due time provide a huſband for her, and now he hath done it, ſhall I queſtion whether he hath done it well? No, I dare not do it. It is a great ſatisfaction to me that you ſought the Lord, and tooke adviſe of our dear and chriſtian friends, and that my ſyſter was guided in her choyſe by yourſelfe
<pb n="454" facs="unknown:011300_0230_0F86CBA202552330"/>
and them, and deſire with you to bleſſe the Lord that hath provided ſo well for her, and ſhall not ceaſe to pray night and day on their behalfe, that the Lord will be pleaſed to make them great bleſſings to each other, and that this new condition may be, every way and allways, comfortable to them both, for as you very truely ſay, it will be as the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to make it. I pray remember my moſt tender and affectionate love to them both, and tell them that I greatly long to ſee them; but ſince that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at preſent, you may aſſure them that whilſt they ſhall make it their great worke to love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, and love one another dearly for Chriſt's ſake, and to carry it with tender love and dutyfull reſpect to yourſelfe, I ſhall eſteem it my duty to love and pray, and act faith for them as if they were my own children, being not otherwiſe able at this diſtance to be helpfull to them. Dear mother, that yourſelfe and all friends did ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the match gives much content to my heart, and I beſeech you not to give way to any recoylings that may ariſe in your own ſpirit; do not ſay, as to the world, my ſiſter might have done much better, the Lord knowes what is beſt for us, and ours; it may be that which wee may think would have been better might have proved much worſe. Theſe are dying times, wherein the Lord hath been and is breaking down what he hath built, and plucking up what he hath planted, and therefore it is not a time to be ſeekeing great things for ourſelves. Let us read the 45th chap. of Jeremiah, and apply to ourſelves what the Lord there ſpeakes to Baruch, and account it a great mercy if he give us our lives for a prey, and bring us again to ſee the faces one of another with comfort, The things, that Baruch is dehorted from ſeeking, were worldly things, why then are they called great things? Surely the Lord ſpeakes it onely according to the eſteem that we are too apt to have of them, for the worlds great things are indeed and in truth but poor little things, and the ſaints ſhould looke down upon them with contempt, and ſhew themſelves to be of high raiſed ſpirits, ſeeking
<pb n="455" facs="unknown:011300_0230_0F86CBA202552330"/>
things truly great, as our Lord himſelfe doth exhort us, Mat. 6.33. But ſeeke you firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſſe, as if he had ſaide, for they are great things, worthy your affectionate endeavours, and as for all theſe little things which gentiles ſo earneſtly purſue, they ſhall be added unto you ſo far as your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of them. My poor ſiſter begins her houſekeeping at a time when trading is low, and all proviſions dear, and I cannot but pitty her in that reſpect. I hope ſhe will not be diſcouraged nor her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band neither, but for prevention I deſire them to conſider ſeriouſly and to act faith upon that moſt excellent councell our Lord delivered with authority in his ſermon on the mount, Mat. 6th from the 24th ver. to the end of the chapter. I cannot but be full of longings to heare how the Lord hath dealt with her in her lying in, but I doubt not you will take the firſt opportunity to inform us of it, in the mean time I ſhall endeavour to ſtay myſelfe upon the promiſe made to childe-bearing women, 1 Tim. 2.15.</p>
               <p>Dear mother, I have been hetherto congratulating my newly marryed ſyſter, but I muſt now turn aſide to drop a few tears upon the hearſe of her that is deceaſed, whoſe loſſe I cannot chooſe but lament with tears, and ſo ſhare with you in all the providences of God towards us; but my dear mother, let me not hereby be the occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing your griefe, for I doubt not but you have grieved enough, if not too much, allready. Let us conſider how graciouſly the Lord deales with us (as for my dear ſyſter, ſhee is got beyond our pitty, we need not lament for her ſake, but rather rejoyce that ſhee is at reſt in the boſom of Chriſt) who whileſt he is taking from us with one hand, gives double with the other. He hath added one to your family on whom I hope you may ſet that motherly affection as if he were your own ſon, and I hope hath before this time alſo made you to rejoyce in the fruit of my ſyſters womb; and ſhall not we ſay with Job, the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord. But oh how apt are wee to murmur, if the Lord
<pb n="456" facs="unknown:011300_0231_0F86CBA369D8FF58"/>
do in any thing diſpleaſe us, but what a ſhame it were that we ſhould be diſpleaſed at any thing which God doth? Who are wee, that wee ſhould ſet our corrupt wills in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his moſt holy and bleſſed will. It is bleſſed counſell that a reverend miniſter of the goſpell gives, who had been in the ſchoole of affliction, that I lately met with in a printed booke of his, I pray you (ſaith he) drink in that notion, viz. That the will of God being pure, holy, perfect, yea God himſelfe, ſhould not onely be ſubmitted to, or reſted in, but loved and choſen above all creatures, yea above life itſelfe, the beſt of creatures. Would wee but once learne this leſſon (which the Lord is, I hope, teaching of us by all his dealings with us) and help us (as you ſay ſweetly in your letter) to ſee love in all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, there could nothing come amiſſe to us.</p>
               <p>Dear mother, I perceive, when you wrote laſt, you were upon a remove from thoſe dear friends with whome you then ſojourned, I hope the Lord guided you to that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhall long to hear where you ſettle; in the mean time, it is my comfort that the Lord tells all your wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, and receives all your tears into his bottle, and will not faile to direct all your ſteps, till he hath given you a ſafe conduct through your wearyſome pilgrimage, and at the end thereof open unto you an abundant entrance into thoſe manſions that are prepared for you in our fathers houſe, where you ſhall be at reſt in the boſome of Chriſt for ever.</p>
               <p>Your old friend, Mr. R. is yet living, but continues in that weake condition of which I formerly have given you account, and have not now much to add. He is ſcarce capable of any rationall diſcourſe, his underſtanding, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and ſpeech doth ſo much faile him, and ſeems not to take much notice of any thing that is either done or ſaid, but patiently bears all things and never complaines of any thing, tho' I feare it is ſome trouble to him that he hath had no letter of a long time from his cozen Rich, but ſpeaks not one word concerning it, nor any thing you wrote of in your laſt, onely, after I had read your
<pb n="457" facs="unknown:011300_0231_0F86CBA369D8FF58"/>
letters to him, being aſked whether it was not a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to him to hear ſuch a gracious ſpirit breathing in your letters, he ſaid it was none of his leaſt comforts, and indeed he ſcarce ſpeakes any thing but in anſwer to queſtions when they are put to him, which are not of many kinds, becauſe he is not capable to anſwer them; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and very frequent queſtion is to know how he doth, and his anſwer, for the moſt part, is, very well, I praiſe God, which he utters with a very low and weake voyce; but ſometimes he ſaith, not very well, or very ill, and then if it be further ſaid, do you feele any pain any where, to than he allwaies anſwereth, no; when he wants any thing he cannot well ſpeake for it, becauſe he forgets the name of it, and ſometimes aſks for one thing when he meanes another, ſo that his eye or his finger is oftentimes a better interpreter of his mind than his tounge; but his ordinary wants are ſo well known to us, that moſt of them are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed without aſking or making ſignes for them, and ſome help he ſtands in need of in every thing to which any motion is required, having not been able, of a long time, to dreſſe or undreſſe himſelfe, nor to feed, or eaſe nature either way, orderly, without help, and its a great mercy to him that he hath a friend that takes pleaſure in being helpfull to him, and I bleſſe the Lord that gives me ſuch a good meaſure of health and ſtrength, and an opportunity and a heart to uſe it in ſo good and neceſſary a worke; for tho' my help be but poor and weake, yet that ancient ſervant of Chriſt could not well ſubſiſt without it, and I do believe, as you are pleaſed to ſay very well, that I do enjoy the more health for his ſake. I have ſometimes wondered much at this diſpenſation of the Lord towards him, and have ſome expectations of more than ordinary iſſue; the Lord help us to profit by all, and to waite with patience upon him, till we ſhall ſee what end he will make with us. Thus farr I write of myſelfe, I ſhall now aſk him what he would have me to ſay to his friends concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. The queſtion being aſked, he ſaith, I am better than I was. And being aſked what I ſhould ſay more to
<pb n="458" facs="unknown:011300_0232_0F86CBA561E58D20"/>
his cozen R. or any other friends, after a long pauze, he again ſaide, the Lord hath viſitted me in much mercy, and hath anſwered his viſitation upon me. (I give it you in his own words.) Being deſirous to draw more from him, I propoſed ſeverall queſtions and the ſume of his anſwers were, that he earneſtly deſires the continuance of the fervent prayers of all his friends for him, and deſires to be remembered to his cozen Rich and longs to receive a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from her, and deſires her to exhort her ſon and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his dear cozens, to fear God, and to be remembered to her aunt at Chelſey, praying that the Lord will requite all her great love, as alſo to be remembred to Mrs. Jaines and her good huſband, to whom alſo he thinkes himſelfe greatly obliged for their great love, and in particular for Mrs. Jaines her care of poor Nol. deſiring her to continue the ſame; as alſo to be remembred to yourſelfe, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Frank much comfort in her new condition, and ſaith he ſhall not ceaſe to pray for you and all yours. This is written on the 6th of Auguſt, but I know not when I ſhall have opportunity to ſend to Boſton, it may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before I ſend away my letter I may have ſomething more to add concerning him.</p>
               <p>Thus far I proceeded yeſterday, but night coming on and having ſomething elſe to do, I could proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo laid aſide my paper, intending this morning to finiſh (if the Lord pleaſed) my anſwer to yours of the 29th March. But now my firſt worke muſt be to tell you that, thro' the great goodneſſe of God, I did alſo laſt night, after ſupper, receive your welcome letter of the 8th of May (Franks birthday) wherein you let me know that you have alſo received mine of the 2d of October laſt, at ſuch a ſeaſon, which made it the more refreſhing to you, which is a great ſatisfaction and comfort to me, for which I deſire to bleſſe the Lord; but it would have been the more full if you had but ſaid, with the incloſed to dear Mrs. Jaines, which I have lately tranſcribed, together with your owne, from the originalls, with a purpoſe to have ſent them with this, but I ſhall ſend neither, for I have good hopes that
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:011300_0232_0F86CBA561E58D20"/>
both were received, for I cannot but think when you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that the dore of your houſe was opened, if halfe of your goods had been taken away you would have made mention of it; for your own letter was both the houſe and inventorie of all the goods contained in it.</p>
               <p>Dear Mother, it is alſo a great comfort to me to hear that the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed to appear on my dear ſyſters behalfe in the needfull hour, and deſire with you to bleſſe the Lord for that great mercy, and I heartily thanke you for giving me ſo quick a notice of it. Dear mother, it was likewiſe a great mercy that the Lord was pleaſed ſo far to ſatisfie your deſire as to ſhew you the fruite of her wombe and to make you the joyfull grandmother of a ſon, and tho' it hath pleaſed the Lord ſo ſoon to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant him from the militant to the triumphant church, yet it may be a great comfort to yourſelfe and my dear ſyſter, that from your wombs hath proceeded the increaſe to the miſticall body of Jeſus Chriſt, and reckon it a mercy that the Lord being purpoſed to take him from you in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, was pleaſed (that it might be the more eaſy to you) to do it before it had much time to take deep root in your affections, for I do believe the longer yourſelves and his other relations had enjoyed him the harder it would have been to us all to have parted with him: But what ſhall we ſay more? It may be ſuch conſiderations as theſe are too ſelfiſh, it is enough to compoſe the hearts of the children of God under every providence, to ſay, it is the Lord that hath done it, our loving and tender hearted infinitely wiſe Father hath declared his royall pleaſure, and it is our duty to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, yea to rejoyce in it (for it is moſt meet he ſhould diſpoſe of us and ours as ſhall ſeem good in his ſight) and to apply ourſelves to learn the leſſons he would teach us thereby, and among the reſt that is none of the leaſt which you mention, to get our hearts weaned from creature comforts and to live upon himſelfe as our allſufficient ſoul ſatisfying portion; and let my dear brother and ſyſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what the H. G. ſaith, Lam. 3.27. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. Dear mother,
<pb n="460" facs="unknown:011300_0233_0F86CBA6049A63F8"/>
I pray, in your next, ſpeake a little more fully concerning his godlineſſe, for you ſay nothing to that, except by the phraiſe of a very honeſt man, you mean a very godly man, as I hope you do; for you give the ſame epethite to that good man (whoſe word you tooke concerning him) of whom another friend ſaith that he is a very godly man, aged and wiſe, &amp;c. I pray, remember my dear love to ſyſter Judeth, and tell her from me ſhe muſt now be a very good childe, and labour to know the God of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſerve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind, 1 Chr. 18.9. and leaving to grieve for her ſyſter and nephew that are at reſt with God, ſtrive with all her might to be a comfort to her poor afflicted mother, who is conteſting with the difficulties and temptations of an evil world. I humbly thanke you for your motherly love and care for me, in your being ſo deſirous to ſupply my wants; and becauſe you are pleaſed to lay your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon me, I ſhall make bould, when I need your help in that kind, to write to you for it. There is yet a little meale in the barrel and oyle in the cruiſe. The greateſt thing I need is a heart to abide patiently in this condition untill it be expended. I cannot but account it a great mercy that in theſe hard times you ſhould be able to be ſo helpfull to your poor children; but I beſeech you let not your love to them make you to forget yourſelfe, in parting with what is neceſſary for your own comfort in your old age. Dear mother, you ſay you find nature greatly decaying in you, and therefore deſire prayers that grace may be ſtrengthened, &amp;c. It cannot be otherwiſe expected but that as age comes on nature will decay; but I beſeech you preſerve it what you can, and take heed of immoderate griefes, or whatſoever elſe may be prejudiciall to your health, which you are able ta avoyde, and when you have done all you can, if you ſtill perceive the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man periſhing, yet faint not, for I do believe, through the faithfulneſſe of God, your inward man ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day, 2 Cor. 4.16.

yet I have and do enjoy a competent meaſure of health and ſtrength, and beg your pardon if I have been too ſlow in acquainting you with and giving you the comfort of it. I thanke you for what you have written concerning thoſe relations I deſired to heare of; and the rather becauſe you ſay you cannot write much, through the weakneſſe of your eyes, and I feare it may hurt them to read theſe long let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for I deſire you firſt to reade and then ſeale and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the incloſed to my honored and dear friend D.

                  <p>Now, my dear mother, give me leave in a poſtſcript to be a little merry with you, and yet ſerious too. There is one word in one of your letters that ſounds ſo harſhly, and looks ſo untowardly, that I cannot tell well how to read or looke upon it, and I know not how to write it, and yet I muſt, though I croſſe it out againe. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you do by this time ſufficiently wonder what will follow; but the matter is this, after you had given me a loving account of a buſineſſe wherein you have done your beſt, you were pleaſed to ſay, that if I ſhould be
<pb n="462" facs="unknown:011300_0234_0F86CBA6CDA54558"/>
                     <hi>angry</hi> you had many to beare with you, &amp;c. Raſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I confeſſe, is a burthen that needs more ſhoulders than one to beare it; for Solomon ſaith, a ſtone is heavy and the ſand weighty, but a fools wrath is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than them both. But oh, my dear mother, how could you feare ſuch a thing from me? Yourſelfe knoweth I never yet ſpake an angry word to you, nay I hope I may ſay (without taking the name of God in vain) the Lord knoweth I never conceived an angry thought towards you, nor do I now, nor I hope never ſhall, and in ſo ſaying I do not commend myſelfe, for you never gave me the leaſt cauſe, neither have you now, and I believe never will; therefore, dear mother, the whole praiſe belongs to yourſelfe, or rather to the Lord, who, bleſſed be his name, hath ſo united our hearts together in love that it is a thing ſcarce poſſible to be angry one with another. But I ſhall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with a requeſt that you will not be angry with yourſelfe for writing that word I have ſpoken ſo much againſt, for I ſuppoſe all your meaning was, if I ſhould not alltogether approve of what was done, &amp;c. and I am abundantly ſatisfied that the root from which that feare ſprung was tender love, and that you ſpeake your heart when you ſay you love and honour me as much as ever, which may well increaſe my longings after you, for the exceeding grace of God in you. Now thankes be unto God for his unſpeakeable gift. 2 Cor. 9.14, 15.<note n="*" place="bottom">The remarkable circumſtances of two perſons who had made ſo conſiderable a figure in England will, I hope, excuſe the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this long letter, altho' it has no immediate relation to the affairs of the Maſſachuſets colony.</note>

For your providentially being reſtrayned from communicating ours to Mr. B. I am well pleaſed with, and ſhall make uſe thereof according to your information. I heartily deſire you to preſent my ſervice to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend my honored friend though unknown to him D. J.

For the buſines of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg with us wee have cauſe to be humbled, that through animoſityes wee ſhould cauſe diſcouragement to thoſe at ſo great diſtance that wiſh us well, that they are hindred in their freedom in the forwarding of that worke, I muſt freely ſay it to you I ſee not the reaſon, but that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſpirit ſeems to be our judgment.

Thy Doctor's<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Hoar the Preſident of the College.</note> oppoſers looſe ground, and I hope the worke will yet be carryed an end. The not effecting the diſappointment of the laſt commencement, and the Lord's helping the Doctor in that act to paſs with general acceptance gives ſome hopes that he may gett over the check given him in his beginning, which may make him more cautious for time to come; who is, I doubt, nor ſo cautious in his comeing off from former engagement as he ought before he enters upon new; his not concerneing you in his relateing himſelfe in church fellowſhip here, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke at as independently congregationall, I meane in a good ſence, I have not had opportunity to ſpeake to him, but intend it; he hath lately had an ague and ſince a flux, but in a hopeful way of recovery. Mr. Oakes<note n="†" place="bottom">Miniſter of Cambridge, afterwards Preſident of the College.</note> hath had a diſtemper hang upon him that hath much weakned him; the greateſt occaſion, I thinke, is ſome exerciſe in his mind, though he thinks it is the remayne of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs long agoe in England.

               <p>BY yours of the 27 April 74, you give me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that you have information from Mr. Peter Sergeant that the authority of the Maſſachuſets prohibited him from ſelling of your powder in his hand, and from thence claim juſtice by the taking off the powder at the price he could have ſould it; I ſhall not need but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to Mr. Sergeant, by whome theſe come, for the giveing you a more right underſtanding of what he wrote,
<pb n="466" facs="unknown:011300_0236_0F86CBA846904858"/>
for I aſſure you never any order paſt for the reſtraynning of him or any other to make ſale of that or any other ſort of goods, but the contrary, ſince upon the warre, an order paſt that the ſtorekeeper ſhould not deliver any but by order from ſome magiſtrates; nor will Mr. Sergeant ſay that ever he had any denyal upon any deſire for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of powder ſould by him; there was one bound for Guyny, that had bought of him twenty barrels and clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely, contrary to law, ſhipped it, ſo that it was ſeiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by a law in force when you was in theſe parts; which powder, upon his petition, was ſet at liberty, and he allowed to ſhip off ten barrels, the other he privetly conveyed, ſo that he carryed all away. At the ſame tyme the order before mentioned was given to the ſtorekeeper, there was an order iſſued for the ſeveral townes to have their ſtores fully ſupplyed according to law, which quickened the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of powder within ourſelves; and the other collonyes underſtanding the order applyed themſelves for liberty to recruite their ſtores, which was redily granted them, ſo that the order paſt by authority was noe obſtruction but a furtherance to thoſe that had of that commodity, both for quicknes of ſale and advance of price, and this I hope is ſufficient to rectifie your thoughts in that matter.</p>
               <p>Sir, For the buſines of Mr. Gorges pattent, which was graunted, as by the date appeares, after the Maſſachuſets, ſo that the juriſdiction lyeth within the government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is without queſtion here; that there hath been ſeveral turnes therein is very true; but that there hath been any juſt cauſe of complaint of the government of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets, I am perſwaded that if the whole matter weare prepared noe indifferent judges would blame them for what hath beene done by them; yet, could there be a way hit upon to ſtop clamours it would be a ſervice to them. I am confident, and that upon good and rational grounds, had Mr. Gorges what he deſires from the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets he would not find the place turne to his profitt, but rather an addition to former loſſe; and ſhould any purchaſe his pretentions, in expectation of profitt, they
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:011300_0236_0F86CBA846904858"/>
would miſs in their expectation; yet, could the buſines be tooke up with him, it might be a ſervice to this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in preventing clamours. In order thereto, and you pleaſe to treat with them concerned, that thereby you may underſtand what they claime and the grounds thereof, and what propoſal they will make, and give notice thereof, you ſhould receive anſwer thereto; or might his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be bought off for five hundred pounds, and aſſurance given to take off all after claimes and claimers againſt the collony of the Maſſachuſets or others upon the place, and you pleaſe to ingage in it for the collony, I doe hereby oblige that the money ſhall be ordered to be paid there, upon ſuch aſſurance given. Concerning which I may not queſtion but that you will doe it by ſuch advice as may be had, that it may ſtand good in law, and for that, poſſibly, you may meet with an opportunity that for preſent money more may be effected than by taking tyme, if you pleaſe to diſburſe it to the ſum forementioned, I doe paſs my word that you ſhall be imburſed your money, with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for the ſame. I ſhould not have made thus bould with you in this matter, but from your loveing encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given by yours to me, and the confidence I have of that loveing reſpect you have to the peace and welfare of this place, and the churches of our Lord Jeſus therein; deſiring that what I have wrote in this matter may be for your uſe and noe thing therein may be imparted to any that may ſeeke occaſion againſt the government thereby.</p>
               <p>By yours of the 4th June, which came firſt to hand (the other not coming to my hand until the 18th inſtant, Mr. Sergeant can give the reaſon) I perceive your mind is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for the publique good, your informations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I heartily thanke you for, and ſhall in any thing to my power promote, for the Indian affaire with the commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or the other gentlemen. We are upon a worke for makeing powder and have erected a mill in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto at Neponſet, about 6 miles from Boſton; our difficulty will be for peter, which we muſt, in our beginning, have from without us, but hope, in time, may raiſe it amongſt

us. We have an aincient man that came out of Kent, one Walter Everden, that made powder in England, as he ſaith, is imployed in the worke; and for your having liberty to ſhip off from hence, in caſe you have ſtore with us, you ſhall not need to doubt it, or if a ſtay be made for the countreys uſe, but that they will make pay for the ſame. You may aſſure yourſelf that we ſee it for the publique ſervice to encourage trade, and I hope we ſhall not be left to ſtrike in with others, that labour what in them lyes to put clogs and diſcouragement upon the trade that the Lord hath led us into, beyond expectation in our beginnings; and you will be enformed by Mr. Sergeant that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that was laide before you was upon ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſpriſion and not from any thing done by authority to occaſion it; ſo commending you to God, I reſt,</p>

               <p>BY yours of the 24th of Auguſt I perſeave you judge my complaint about the powder was groundleſs: The reaſon you give me. For my applying to you, it was upon my cozin Sergeants informing me, as I then wrote, which he ſtill affirmes, and though he's loath to offend the government in ſaying any thing now that he thinkes may not be acceptable, I thinke your owne excuſe, if weyed, ſaith enough for me; for when 20 barrels ware ſould there was a great trouble to git a licence for 10, and the other ten privately carried away, which certainly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred others from endeavouring to buy any to ſend abroad, and that voyage, I know, might well have carried to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ten times that quantity: And I aſſure you, let the law be as aintient as it will, I will never (if I can help it) have my eſtate under ſuch a reſtraint, and had I known it would never have had a barrel in your collony. Yet the oldneſs of the law takes not off the equity againſt the new law to compell all into one ſtore-houſe, under your ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
<pb n="470" facs="unknown:011300_0238_0F86CBA9BB738B20"/>
and that he ſhould deliver none but by the mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates order; which is prejudiciall to its ſayle; for trade is a ſeacret thinge, and when made publicke in the perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers proves injurious to the concerned, but where ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perviſers will make it otherwiſe, and ſoe, upon the whole, I am not ſatisfied, but my firſt demand is grounded upon reaſon, and ſoe expect you ſhould doe me juſtice. The caſe of peter I inſtanced in houlds good, for it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by a law made before ours was imported, and yet his Majeſtie tooke ours off at the rate it would have yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is what you ought to doe for my powder. I am alſoe much diſſatisfied with my cozin Sergeants great charge of ſtore-houſe rome, 32<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ.</hi>
                  </abbr> per ton a year. It was a prudent caſe to have powder at a diſtance from the towne, as here in the tower, but let the quantity be never ſoe great that we lodge there, nothing is paid for it; ſoe if you had laid it upon the countrys charge, or at leaſt a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ware-houſe rome, it might have bin excuſed, but becauſe a private perſon, for a barrel or two, is willing, therefore to injoine for quantities, I thinke is not equall (though a factor may conſent) which alſoe I leave with you for juſtice.</p>
               <p>For the buſineſs of Mr. Gorge I ſhould willingly have diſburſt the money you mention, but they are now in the clouds and expect as much a yeare, ſecured here, for their intereſt; the coppy of his, with others their petition, I gave Mr. Collins to ſend you, and is heare incloſed. The councell of trade have don nothing, ſoe its remanded to his Majeſties prevy councell. As any thing paſſeth (ſoe far as I can learne) ſhall adviſe you, but am of opinion that ſome preſents might be plaſte to the countrys advantage, and yet of noe great vallue.</p>
               <p>As to what you write of the 26th of September, I am glad I could ſay ſoe much to ſome of his Majeſty's officers, yet I muſt informe you that the paying the cuſtome in Virgina doth not priveledg any veſſel to carry tobacco to any place but to the Engliſh plantations, and the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the plantation where ſuch tobacco is brought, if it
<pb n="471" facs="unknown:011300_0238_0F86CBA9BB738B20"/>
be againe exported, is bound to take bond to bring it for England. I ſhould be ſorry that his Majeſtie ſhould have any ground of offence in this kind, for a little profitt to ſome particular perſons, to be an occaſion of depriveing the whole of their chiefeſt injoyments. Its objected here by ſome that you have noe ſuch law there, and ſoe will not judg by our lawes in exporting or importing of goods to or from forraine kingdomes. If it be ſoe, as a true friend to you, I would adviſe it be one of the firſt things you doe to prevent greater evills, which is all the trouble that at preſent is given you by your affectionate and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant.</p>

expecting the preferment; yourſelfe, with others moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, parting it betwixt both. I chuſe the medium to judge by; only methinks a paſſage in your letter, more direct againſt him than any thing formerly, doth a little ſtartle mee, at leaſt ſoe far as to beg, in your next, a true account of it, namely his want of truth in his words. Pray Sir, if you judge him juſtly culpable in that matter, let me privately know it, for hee is a member with us, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. The encloſed coppy of the letter is, as far as I remember, juſt as wee wrote it. My only concerne in this buſines is to ſympathize with the broken ſtate of that once flouriſhing houſe, to beg of God a revival of the worke and all elſe in which his glory is concerned in the midſt of the yeares, and to mourne over that diſunited ſpirit amongſt Gods people which appeares in this matter and all others; and what tokens of Gods diſpleaſure are but too evident with you; the Lord humble his people, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and heal the land. For the buſines of Mr. Dyers petition I know nothing of that in particular but, as I hope God hath ſent in Mr. Foſter, you will, by my letters, underſtand the ſame thing, in effect, which now I am able to give you an account of, as far as yet the affair hath gone. The encloſed petition will ſhew you what they are about to put the King upon, a purchaſe of the propriety of the province of Main and Hampſhire, and by whome tranſacted; hee that the King ſhould buy it for is the Duke of Monmouth, though nothing as yet is determined; many complaints are made againſt you; they have thoughts of ſending a commiſſioner thither, and it was determined to do it with ſome force, but their more weighty affaires and want of money will hardly admit this, I ſuppoſe, this ſummer; but a letter from his Majeſty you will have, to order ſome account of theſe things to bee given him, and I fear that which is aymed at is to call your patent to a ſtrict account, upon what termes you hold it; you would doe well to be in a preparation for it, eſpecially to make good your title to that part of your government. Here is none able to ſpeake for you, wee want inſtructions, papers that

My Lord Privy Seal, who was formerly wrote to and engaged on your behalfe, lately ſent for mee, with whom I had diſcourſe about an hour, who was as free as hee thought good with mee in this affair, and beyond his owne will I could not nor durſt urge.

As to what you write of the removal of more of Gods ſervants in the miniſtry, and eſpecially Mr. Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enbridge, lately, I doe bemoan it, the Lord of the harveſt ſend forth more labourers into it. As to any private hints you give about myſelfe what they will amount to I cannot judge till I ſee how providence workes, and then, I fear, my reſolution will not be equal to what may be deſired, how willing ſoever I may bee, which if I were free I ſhould deeply ponder; I doubt the church here will as ſoon all remove to you as myſelfe; but here is too much of an affair that I know not whether I ſhall bee any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerned in than to tender my humble thankes to you for that undeſerved love and reſpect you have ſhewed in your deſires to have me ſo near to you. As for our affaires here, I have nothing to write, but I ſhall tranſmit in the publique prints, ſave only that the King, by the prevalency of the biſhops over him, hath within this month or 6 weeks taken off the protection of his licences given us in March 72 and, together with a hot proſecution of the Papiſts, left us alſoe a very troubleſome perſecution, wherein many are ſpoyled of their goods, ſeveral impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, which laſt coſt the life of a worthy miniſter, Mr. Thompſon of Briſtol, paſtor of the church there; ſeveral returned upon 20<abbr>s.</abbr> a month into the exchequer, to their utter undoing; this city yet ſcapes beſt, you cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how averſe the ſpirit of the mageſtrates is to meddle with us; what importunity and opportunity may at laſt produce wee are fearful.

               <p>AND whereas amongſt the ſeverall colonies and plantations ſettled there that of the Maſſachuſets bay, commonly called the corporation of Boſton, is the moſt flouriſhing and powerfull, and at the preſent gives lawes to a great part of this country, by a pretended char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from his late Majeſtie, it is firſt in relation to this colony moſt humbly anſwered. To the firſt enquiry.</p>
               <div n="1" type="inquiry">
                  <head>Where the legiſlative and executive powers of the government of New England are ſeated.</head>
                  <p>The legiſlative power is ſeated in a generall court, from which there is no appeal, conſiſting at preſent of a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, deputy governor and 10 magiſtrates, with the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſeverall townes in that juriſdiction, all which are yearely elected.</p>
                  <p>This court is the ſupreme judicature of the colony, and only hath power to make lawes, raiſe money, and lay taxes upon the whole colony, diſpoſe lands, give and confirme properties, impeach, ſentence and pardon, and receave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from all inferior courts, and cannot be adjourned or diſſolved without the conſent of the major part.</p>
                  <p>The governor, deputy governor and magiſtrates are choſen by the majority of the votes of the freemen of the colony, who are to attend at Boſton, either in perſon or by proxy, without any ſummons, the laſt Wedneſday in Eaſter terme, and upon that day to conſummate the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is done by writing the names in paper, but no

                  <p>The deputies for the generall court are choſen by the freemen of every towne, who have all the power of the freemen transferred to them. No town can ſend more than two deputies, and where a town hath but 20 freemen, that town can ſend but one deputy, and when not 10 freemen the town ſends none; no perſon being an attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is to be choſen a deputy.</p>
                  <p>No perſon is admitted to be a freeman of the colony, or have vote in any election but church members who are in full communion and approved by the generall court.</p>
                  <p>The governor and magiſtrates ſit apart and act all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by themſelves, by drawing up bills and orders, which having agreed upon, they ſend to the deputies to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and accordingly to give their conſent or diſſent thereunto.</p>

                  <p>No law is made without the conſent of the major part of the magiſtrates and the greater number of the deputies. The governor hath a caſting vote in all courts and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, can call a generall court, or any other court or council at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The executive power is in the governor and council, whereof ſeven men make a quorum, the governor or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty governor to be one. But when buſineſſe is urgent then the acts of ſo many as do aſſemble are accounted valid and ſufficient, and can impreſſe ſoldiers, ſeamen, ſhips, all manner of ammunition and proviſion, and all other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and give warrant to the treaſurer to make payment for the ſame.</p>

                  <p>The governor and deputy governor jointly agreeing, or any 3 magiſtrates conſenting, have power to reprieve a condemned perſon till the next generall court.</p>
                  <p>Every magiſtrate is a juſtice of the peace, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any cauſe under 40<abbr>s.</abbr> can commit to priſon and puniſh offenders for breach of lawes and impoſe fines according to diſcretion.</p>

                  <p>Monſieur La Bourn, governor for the French King there, upon pretence, of ſome affronts and injuries offered him by the government of Boſton, did ſtrictly inhibit the inhabitants any trade with the Engliſh, and moreover layd an impoſition of 400 codfiſh upon every veſſel that ſhould fiſh upon the coaſts, and ſuch as refuſed had their fiſh and proviſions ſeized on and taken away.</p>

               <p>The governor having opened your Majeſties letter ſayd to the reſt of the magiſtrates, it was a letter from your Majeſtie, and looking to the bottom of the letter, he read by his Majeſties command Hen. Coventry. The gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor aſked me who that Mr. Coventry was. I told him he was your Majeſties principall ſecretary of ſtate.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the reading of your Majeſties let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the whole councill being covered, I put off my hat; whereupon three of the magiſtrates tooke off their hats and ſate uncovered; but the governor with the reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to keep their hats on.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſties letters, with the incloſed petitions of Mr. Maſon and Mr. Gorges, being read in my hearing, the governor told the councill that the matters therein contained were very inconſiderable things and eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and it did no way concern that government to take any notice thereof. I acquainted them that your Majeſtie had commanded me to require an anſwer of your ſayd letters, and for which your Majeſtie had ordered me one month to attend. The governor anſwered, that they ſhould conſider of thoſe things. Whereupon I withdrew.</p>
               <p>Then I delivered the particular letters of Mr. Maſon, which he had writt unto ſeverall of the moſt eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Boſton, ſome whereof are the principall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the militia. Theſe gentlemen receaved me with
<pb n="505" facs="unknown:011300_0255_0F86CD0C7A500A20"/>
much kindneſſe and expreſſed great loyalty to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie. The letters he wrote were to give them an account of the contents of your Majeſties letters, his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the proceedings of that government, with the occaſion of my coming into theſe parts, deſiring them to communicate the ſame to others, the which was ſoon ſpread abroad, to the great pleaſure and ſatisfaction of all thoſe who are well-wiſhers to your Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>Within a day or two after my arrivall, I met with a report which ſeemed artificially rayſed to amuſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the people about domeſtique troubles here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the ſume whereof was, that the Duke of Yorke, with diverſe of the nobility, upon diſcontent, had left the court, and had applied themſelves to the citty for aſſiſtance, and that all was going to confuſion at home. This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with much confidence, and ſayd to be writt from ſome very good people in London, and therefore muſt be true. I ſoon confuted this report, by many arguments, ſhewing them the falſeneſſe of it, and ſo in a ſhort tyme it vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>After two days conſideration it was reſolved in their councell that thankes be returned to your Majeſtie for your gracious letter, and that an anſwer be forthwith ſent by a maſter of a veſſel ready to ſaile for London.</p>
               <p>The 15th of June I was ſent for to the councell. The governour aſked me whether I intended for London by that ſhip that was ready to ſaile, if ſo I ſhould have a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate of their letter to your Majeſtie, the originall being to accompany his own particular anſwer to a letter he had receaved from Mr. ſecretary Williamſon by the ſame maſter of the ſhip I came with. I told them I had other matters of concern under my charge, and ſhould not return ſo ſoon, and withall aſked them if they had well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of his Majeſties letter and the incloſed petition in ſo ſhort a time, and concluded on their agents and the time of their going for England, to which they gave me no reply, but the governour aſked me if I had any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offer them from your Majeſtie, I told them I had
<pb n="506" facs="unknown:011300_0256_0F86CD13883EF640"/>
nothing further to communicate to them, whereupon the governor ſaid that he looked upon me as Mr. Maſon's agent, and that I might withdraw.</p>
               <p>The day after, I went to viſit the governour at his houſe, and among other diſcourſe I told him I tooke notice of ſeverall ſhips that were arrived at Boſton, ſome ſince my being there, from Spain, France, Streights, Canaries and other parts of Europe, contrary to your Majeſties lawes for encouraging navigation, and regulating the trade of the plantations. He freely declared to me that the lawes made by your Majeſtie and your parliament obligeth them in nothing but what conſiſts with the intereſt of that colony, that the legiſlative power is and abides in them ſolely to act and make lawes by virtue of a charter from your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties royall father, and that all matters in difference are to be concluded by their finall determination, without any appeal to your Majeſtie, and that your Majeſtie ought not to retrench their liberties, but may enlarge them if your Majeſtie pleaſe, and ſaid, your Majeſtie had confirmed their charter and all their privileges by your Majeſties letter of the 28th of June 1662, and that your Majeſty could doe no leſſe in reaſon than let them enjoy their liberties and trade, they having upon their own charge and without any contribution from the crown made ſo large plantation in the wilderneſſe, and that during the Dutch warrs your Majeſtie ſent ammunition to New-Yorke for that place, but ſent them word they muſt ſhift for themſelves and make the beſt defence they could, and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the colony had many enemies, yet they did believe your Majeſtie to be their very good friend, for that your Majeſtie had by ſeverall letters expreſſed your great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them.</p>
               <p>Within a few days after I met with one Mr. Harris, a gentleman who arrived there from England about ſix months before, who told me that at his arrival at Boſton, he was, according to their law, conducted to the governor, which enjoins all maſters of veſſels to bring all paſſengers to the governor upon penalty of 20<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> who enquiring of
<pb n="507" facs="unknown:011300_0256_0F86CD13883EF640"/>
him if he knew Mr. Maſon and whether he was coming over and what commiſſioners were coming with him, Mr. Harris told him there was a report that Mr Maſon was to come over. The governor then ſaid he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved information from England that commiſſioners had come over laſt ſummer or the ſpring, but that your Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had not money to defrey that charge and ſet them forth, and did therefore beleave no commiſſioners would come.</p>
               <p>The 23d June I gave in a memoriall to the governour, the councill being then aſſembled at his houſe, wherein I acquainted them that in purſuance of my inſtructions I did remind then of your Majeſties command of ſending over agents that might be ſufficiently qualified and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, and did deſire that ſeeing a generall court ſeemed much more proper for diſpatch of matters of ſo great and weighty concerns, that a generall court might on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion be aſſembled, that ſo I might receave their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſolemn anſwer to your Majeſties letters, for the which I would attend. But hereunto they gave me no other anſwer then that when I was ready to ſaile for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land I ſhould have a coppy of their letter which they had writ unto your Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of July, I went into the province of New-Hampſhire, belonging unto Mr. Maſon, but now divided by the Boſtoneers into three counties, and by them called Norfolk, Suffolk and Middleſex. And travailed through ſeverall of the moſt conſiderable towns, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inhabitants with the occaſion of my coming into the country, and read Mr. Maſon's letter unto them, which gave them great ſatisfaction, the whole country complaining of the oppreſſion and uſurpation of the magiſtrates of Boſton, impoſing miniſters upon them, not admitting them to the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper, denying baptiſm to their children, and liberty of chooſing their own magiſtrates and officers becauſe they were not members of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. And as a farther marke of their power and ſovereignty over them they ſend twice a year magiſtrates from Boſton to keep courts for trying of cauſes, and that
<pb n="508" facs="unknown:011300_0257_0F86CD1513F6E2B8"/>
they lay at pleaſure what impoſitions, fines and taxes they thinke fit upon their eſtates, perſons and trade, contrary to the lawes of England, and that they have been for a long time earneſtly expecting to be delivered from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Maſſachuſets Bay, and doe now humbly hope your Majeſtie will not permitt them any longer to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but will be graciouſly pleaſed to give them relief, according to the promiſes made them by your Majeſties commiſſioners in 1665, who were then in that province, and declared them not to be under the government of Boſton.</p>
               <p>And being at Portſmouth, a town of very great trade, lying upon the river of Piſcataway, in the northermoſt part of New-Hampſhire, about ſeventy miles from Boſton, ſeverall of the principall inhabitants of the province of Main, belonging unto Mr. Gorges, and now by the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneers, ſince the ſeizing thereof, called Yorkſhire, came unto me making the ſame complaints, with thoſe of New-Hampſhire, entreating me to repreſent their condition to your Majeſtie and are paſſionately expecting relief, ſome of them having been ſuffered to be ruined by the Indians for having formerly expreſſed their duty to your Majeſtie when your Majeſties commiſſioners were in that country, and for having taken commiſſions from them to act as juſtices of the peace.</p>
               <p>At my return to Boſton I receaved a meſſage from Joſiah Winſlow, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> governor of your Majeſties colony of New-Plymouth, deſiring I would give him a viſit before I left New-England. Whereupon I made a journey to him, whome I found a gentleman of loyal principles and hath ſhewed himſelf a perſon of great courage and conduct in the management of the Indian warre, thoſe barbarous people being chiefly overcome by his conduct and troops, which makes him to be feared and not loved by his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the Boſtoners.</p>
               <p>In his diſcourſe he expreſſed his great diſlike of the carriage of the magiſtrates of Boſton to your Majeſties royall perſon and your ſubjects under their government;
<pb n="509" facs="unknown:011300_0257_0F86CD1513F6E2B8"/>
of their incroaching upon the rights, trades and poſſeſſions of the neighbouring colonies, laying what rates they pleaſe on the commodities and products of the other colonies imported into their harbours; the dayly breach of your Majeſties lawes concerning trade and navigation, trading with and incouraging all nations ſo trade with them, to the great prejudice and detrement of your Majeſtie and this your kingdom: And that he, finding the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of a divided government dayly ariſing, did ſay, that New-England could never be ſecure, flouriſh, nor be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to your Majeſtie, untill the ſeverall colonies and plantations were reduced under your Majeſties immediate government, and that the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticot would readily and willingly ſubmitt to your Majeſties pleaſure and commands in the diſpoſall and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the civill government.</p>
               <p>That during my ſtay at Boſton I made acquaintance with ſeverall of the chief inhabitants and ſome of the magiſtrates, and did particularly informe myſelf of the humour, diſpoſition and affections of the people, and found the principal inhabitants, ſome whereof are the chief offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the militia, and the generality of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the arbitrary government and oppreſſion of their magiſtrates and doe hope your Majeſtie will be pleaſed to free them from this bondage by eſtabliſhing your own royall authority among them and govern them according to your Majeſties lawes. And many of the better ſort did intreat me to repreſent this their condition to your Majeſtie, not daring publickly to expreſſe their deſires or complaint by petition, becauſe of the ſeverity and arbitrary proceeding of their rulers, and that many of them have been ſufferers for petitioning formerly. Altho' at the general court in Octob. 1666, upon occaſion of your Majeſties letter and declaration of the 10th Aprill in the ſaid year, which petition was ſubſcribed by upwards of 100 of the principall inhabitants of that colony, wherein they did aſſert your Mejeſties right of juriſdiction and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over them, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed,
<pb n="510" facs="unknown:011300_0258_0F86CD16B1EA9850"/>
being given me by ſome of the chief perſons that had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it, deſiring that your Majeſtie might ſee the ſame; theſe gentlemen ſoe delivering this petition, did then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave a ſevere check, the petition voted ſcandalous, they ſtiled the betrayers of the libertyes of that colony and ill-affected to that government, for which ſome of them have been greatly prejudiced in their eſtates and fortunes, and ſtill lye under many inconveniences, and are not admitted into any offices of the government or choyce of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>
               <p>Being ready to return for England, the tyme allotted by your Majeſtie being expired, I went to the governor on the 20th July, for my diſpatches, and was entertained by him with a ſharp reproof for publiſhing the ſubſtance of my errand into thoſe parts, contained in your Majeſties letters, as alſoe in Mr. Maſons petition and what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to his friends there, with that of Mr. Gorges unto the inhabitants of Boſton, New-Hampſhire and Main, telling me that I deſigned to make a mutiny and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the country and to withdraw the people from their obedience to the magiſtracy of that colony and the authority thereof. I told him, if I had done any thing amiſſe, upon complaint made to your Majeſtie he would certainly have juſtice done him.</p>
               <p>The governor then gave me the duplicate of a letter directed unto the right honorable Mr. Secretary Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which he told me was the anſwer which the councill thought fit to give to your Majeſties letters, the originall being ſent for England a month before.</p>
               <p>At my departure from him, both he and ſome of the magiſtrates, ſeverally, intreated me to give a favourable report of the country and the magiſtrates thereof, adding, that thoſe that bleſſed them God would bleſſe, and thoſe that curſed them God would curſe. And withall, deſired me to acquaint your Majeſtie that whatever reports were rayſed againſt them, by wicked and evill minded men, to draw away your Majeſties grace and favour from them, yet they were a people truely fearing the Lord and very obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to your Majeſtie.</p>

               <p>The receaving a charter from his Majeſties royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor for the planting of this colony, with a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame from his royal perſon, by our late addreſſe ſufficiently declare this place to be part of his dominions, and ourſelves his ſubjects, in teſtimony of which alſo our firſt governour Mr. Mathew Cradock, as we are informed, ſtands recorded <hi>juratus de fide &amp; obedientiâ</hi> before one of the maſters of chancery, whence it is evident that if any proceedings of this colony have given occaſion to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to ſay that we beleave he hath no juriſdiction over us, what effectual courſe had need be taken to free our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from incuring his Majeſties farther diſpleaſure, by continuing in ſo dangerous an offence, and to give his Majeſtie all due ſatisfaction in that point? Such an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be no leſſe deſtructive to our welfare than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to his Majeſties honour. The doubtful interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words of a patent, which there can be no reaſon to beleeve can ever be conſtrued to the diveſting of a ſoveraign prince of his royall power over his naturall ſubjects and liege people, is too frail a foundation to build ſuch a tranſcendent immunity and privilege upon.</p>

               <p>THERE comes with this another letter to yourſelfe from mee, which Mr. Rawſon will give you, with that which your committee here for the colledge hath ſent to the overſeers. There is one Mr. Smith, I think his name is ſoe, an expert ſurveyor, who hath built forty of theſe famous houſes in London, though he be a ſtranger to myſelfe, yet hath the commendations of eminent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for his goodnes, beſides ſome of the chiefe workmen in the city for his ability in his calling. If you make uſe of him about the colledge, you may doe well to pay his paſſage, or as you pleaſe; I have agreed with him for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge, becauſe he deſired to be left free.</p>
               <p>Sir, there is another trouble which I preſume to putt upon you, which is, to ſpeak to the reverend Mr. Higgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, paſtour of Salem, to move that congregation to doe ſomething for the maintenance of Mrs. Peters,<note n="*" place="bottom">Widow of Hugh Peters.</note> who, ſince her huſband ſuffered here, hath depended wholly upon Mr. Cockquaine and that church whereof he is paſtour. I fear ſhe will be forced to ſeke her living in the ſtreets, if ſome courſe be not taken for her relief, either by Mr. Higginſon or Mr. Oxenbridge, or ſome other ſympathy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing miniſter. Sir, I pray you, preſent my beſt reſpects to both of them. Little news here ſince my laſt, which was directed to yourſelfe. Here is great talke of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperor and the Sweeds joyning with the Hollander. The treaty of peace at Coligne is ſayd to be broken up, our navy is going forth ſuddainly, it is violently ſuſpected that all our Eaſt India men are taken by the Dutch, and ſome of our factoryes. The bleſſed God ſtrengthen your heart and hand in that great work which he hath called

Whereas We have been given to underſtand that you did in the month of October laſt, paſſe a law in your aſſembly at Boſton for the reviving and adminiſtring a certain oath of fidelity to the country; and whereas the enjoyning the ſaid oath at ſuch time, when you had inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by your agents here of our being diſpleaſed with the forme thereof, is highly diſreſpectfull to Us, and ſeems to be intended as a ſnare in the way of many of our good ſubjects there, of whoſe preſervation We ſhall ever be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; We have thought fit hereby to ſignify to you, that We take the untimely renewing and enjoyning of the ſaid oath very ill, and that We look upon the ſame as deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to our honour as well as defective in point of your duty, inaſmuch as the allegiance due to us, and the fidelity to the country are joyned together in the ſame undecent forme, wherein ſuch fidelity is made even to precede your allegiance to us. And though We doe not, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, preſcribe what forme may be proper amongſt your ſelves, as to your corporation oath, yet We doe hereby ſtrictly require and command you to give order that the oath of allegiance, as it is by law eſtabliſhed in this Our kingdom of England, a copy of which oath atteſted by one of Our principall ſecretaries of ſtate you will receive herewith incloſed) be adminiſtred unto and taken by all Our ſubjects, inhabitants within that Our colony, who are of years to take an oath, wherein We expect your entire

obedience and utmoſt care, this being ſoe fundamentall a concerne to Our dignity and government, We could not omit any longer to ſignify to you Our pleaſure therein, though ſeverall other matters of moment relating to that Our colony are ſtill depending before Us, in which We are not come to any finall reſolution. And ſo We bid you farewell. Given at Our court at Whitehall, the 27th day of Aprill 1678, in the thirtieth yeare of Our Reigne.</p>

               <p>THAT whereas your ſayd petitioners have ſince your Majeſties moſt happy reſtauration, upon their ſeveral addreſſes in the yeares 1661, 62, &amp;c. received many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and gracious returns of favor (confirmation of our charter, pardon of our errors, aſſurance of your royall inclination to promote the trade and happines of this plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) proceeding only from your royal goodnes, which hath highly obliged us to all due acknowledgments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as wee have had opportunity; and wee ſhall, in future, at no time omit to manifeſt (according to our capacitie) our harty and ſincere affection to your Majeſties ſervice and intereſt, as in duty wee are bound: And therefore moſt humbly implore the continuance of thoſe gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, whereby your poore ſubjects here have been ſoe much refreſhed in their great ſufferings and diſtreſſes, and that your Majeſtie, according to your innate wiſdome and

               <p>In humble obedience to your Majeſties command in 76, wee diſpatched our good friends Mr. William Stoughton and Mr. P.

               <p>TRUSTY and well beloved, Wee greet you well. Theſe our letters are to accompany our truſty and well beloved William Stoughton and Peter Bulkley, Eſqrs. your agents, who having manifeſted to us great neceſſity in their domeſtick concernes to returne back into New-England, Wee have graciouſly conſented thereunto, and the rather becauſe, for many months paſt, our councill hath been taken up in the diſcovery and proſecution of a popiſh plott, and yet there appears little proſpect of any ſpeedy leaſure for entring upon ſuch regulation in your affaires as is certainly neceſſary, not only in reſpect of our dignity but of your owne perfect ſettlement. But it is very probable that if either your ſaid agents had brought commiſſion to intermeddle in ſuch regulation (which they have diſowned) or that you had ſent ſuch commiſſion after them, when, from time to time, intimations were given them of what wee did expect, and what wee were thereupon willing to grant, neither their ſtay had been thus long, nor had the matter now been undetermined. Wee muſt therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a further opportunity for this work and, in order thereunto, our will and pleaſure is, that you ſend out ſuch other fitt perſon or perſons, duly inſtructed, and ſend them in ſix months after the receipt of theſe our letters, that they may here attend us in the proſecution of the ſame: For ſince the charter, by its frame and contents, was originally to be executed in this kingdome<note n="*" place="bottom">See Maſſa.

In the mean time, wee doubt not but the bearers hereof, who have demeaned themſelves, during their attendance, with good care and diſcretion, will, from their owne obſervations, acquaint you with many important things which may be
<pb n="520" facs="unknown:011300_0263_0F86CD1A04249F88"/>
of ſuch uſe and advertiſement to you that we might well hope to be prevented, by your applications, in what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or deſired by us, ſo much it is your intereſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intercede for the ſame; for we are graciouſly inclined to have all paſt errors and miſtakes forgotten, and that your condition might be ſo amended as that neither your ſettlement, or the minds of our good ſubjects there, ſhould be lyable to be ſhaken and diſquieted upon every complaint. Wee have heard, with ſatisfaction, of the great readineſs wherewith our good ſubjects there have lately offered themſelves to the taking of the oath of allegiance, which is a clear minifeſtation to us that the unanſwerable defect in that particular was but the fault of a very few in power, who for ſo longe a time obſtructed what the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and our expreſſe commands obliged them unto, as will appeare in our gracious letters of the 28th of June, in the fourteenth yeare of our reigne; and wee ſhall henceforth expect that there will be a ſuitable obedience in other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the ſaid letter, as namely, in reſpect of freedom and liberty of conſcience, ſo as thoſe that deſire to ſerve God, in the way of the church of England, be not thereby made obnoxious or diſcountenanced from their ſharing in the government, much leſſe that they or any other of our good ſubjects (not being Papiſts) who do not agree in the congregationall way, be by law ſubjected to fines or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, or other incapacities, for the ſame; which is a ſeverity to be the more wondred at, when as liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was made one principall motive for your firſt tranſportation into thoſe parts; nor do wee think it fitt that any other diſtinction be obſerved in the making of freemen, than that they be men of competent eſtates, rate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at ten ſhillings,<note n="*" place="bottom">They ſeem to have held out till the laſt in refuſing to admit any to be freemen who were not, either church members or who did not, at leaſt, obtain a certificate from the miniſter of the town that they were orthodox, of good lives, &amp;c.</note> according to the rules of the place, and that ſuch, in their turnes, be alſo capable of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and all lawes made voyd that obſtruct the ſame.

And our further will and pleaſure is, that all perſons coming to any priveledge, truſt, or office in that colony, be firſt enjoyned to take the oath of allegiance, and that all the military commſſions as well as the proceedings of juſtice may run in our royall name. Wee are informed that you have lately made ſome good proviſion for obſerving the acts of trade and navigation, which is well pleaſing unto us.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is very extraordinary, for this proviſion was an act of the colony declaring that the acts of trade ſhould be in force there. Maſſa. Hiſt.

               <p>There is one thing which wee cannot omit to let you know wee are ſurprized at, which is, that during the time wee had the complaints of Mr. Gorges under our conſideration, you ſhould preſume, without aſking our royall permiſſion, to purchaſe his intereſt in the province of Maine, the truth whereof is but lately owned by your ſaid agents, when almoſt at the ſame time wee come to heare of ſome effects of a ſevere hand layd by you on our ſubjects there in conſequence thereof. And whereas your agents declare you have payd to Mr. Gorges the ſume of twelve hundred pounds for the ſaid province, wee do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that upon our reimburſement of what it ſhall appeare you have payd for the ſame, that there be a ſurrender of all deeds and writings thereof made into our hands, and that your future agents do bring them over, foraſmuch

as wee were ſometime in treaty for the ſayd province and do diſapprove what you have done therein. And as for that part of the province of New-Hampſhire lying three miles northward of Merimack river, which was granted unto Mr. Maſon, and whereof the government remains ſtill veſted in us, you are not to expect (according to the deſire of your agents) that the ſame ſhould be annexed to your government, for wee have it under our conſideration to eſtabliſh ſuch method there as may be of moſt benefit and ſatisfaction to the people of that place. And therefore our will and pleaſure is, that you do recall all commiſſions granted by you for the governing within that province, which wee do hereby declare to be voyd, and do require that you do in all things for the future conforme yourſelves unto the regulation which wee have taken in this behalfe. And ſo not doubting of your duty and obedience herein, wee bid you farewell. Given at our palace of Hampton-Court the 24th day of July 1679, and in the one and thirtieth year of our reigne.</p>

We have alſo received the petition of our truſty and well beloved Robert Maſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> whoſe anceſtors obtained divers grants and made large purchaſes of lands in New England, humbly laying before us the ſtate of his further preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the propriety of ſoyle in a tract of land lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Merrimack and Nahinkeke rivers, by virtue of a grant bearing date in the nineteeeth yeare of the reigne of our royall grandfather, in the examination whereof the lords of our committee of forrain plantations had made ſuch a progreſſe that the right of our ſubjects had been thereupon ſettled, without the humble intreaty of your ſaid agents, and the conſent of the ſaid Robert Maſon, that in regard of their ſuddaine departure and want of power in that behalfe, the determination thereof might be ſuſpended untill the arrivall of other agents to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed according to the limitation of our aforeſaid let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as your agents were able to informe you.

Gookin, Mr. Salton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, Sam. Nowell, Mr. Richards, Mr. Davy, Mr. Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Mr. Appleton, magiſtrates. And againſt John Fiſher, Eliſha Cook, Tho. Brattle, Anthony Stodder, Bathurſt, Hathorn, Wait, Johnſon, Hutchinſon, Sprague, Oakes, Holbrook, Cuſhion, Hammond, Pike, deputys &amp;c. By Edward Randolph, collector, &amp;c. of his Majeſties cuſtoms in New-England.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. THAT the ſaid faction, the governor not conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, have refuſed to publiſh his Majeſties proclamation of the 24th of November in the 23d year of his reign, ſent by his Majeſties ſpecial command, and received by this government in October 1680, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth the act made in 25th year of his Majeſties reign.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="527" facs="unknown:011300_0266_0F86CD1DEDD6E8B8"/>II. The ſaid faction have refuſed to declare and admit of his Majeſties letters pattents bearing date at Weſtminſter 15th October, in the 33d year of his reign, erecting an office of collector, &amp;c. of his Majeſties cuſtoms in New-England, and of the powers granted to his Majeſties offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer by the ſame, tho' often preſſed thereunto, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall court, by the governour, Major Dudley and ſeverall of the magiſtrates of the colony.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The ſaid faction have refuſed to pay me ſeverall ſummes of money which I was forced to depoſit in court before I could proceed to triall of cauſes relating to his Majeſty's concerns, by virtue of an order of court made October 1. 1681, no law of this colony directing the ſame, though by his Majeſty's royall letters of Octob. 21. 1681, they are particularly required thereunto.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The ſaid faction, under pretence of ſatisfaction of his Majeſty and regulating the trade of this colony, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ſaid officer of collector of his Majeſty's cuſtoms, have confirmed the place and powers of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the cuſtoms and impoſts laid upon wines and ſtrong waters imported into their colony, ſet up by a law made in their colony in 1645, their preſent navall officer, having been chiefe collector of theſe dutyes above a yeare before this navall office was ordered, as by their law, navall office, doth appeare.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ſaid faction continue to exerciſe the power of governor and court of aſſiſtants, which, through the inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency of former governors, the court of deputyes have aſſumed, to heare, repeale and determine in civill cauſes, which, for want of education and being under no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar oath, they are uncapable to manage: ſo that by their numbers outvoting the governor and court of aſſiſtants, his Majeſty's ſubjects greatly ſuffer in their eſtates, and beſides, there is no ſuch power granted them in their charter.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The ſaid faction have neglected to repeale all laws of their colony contrary to the laws of England, though required thereunto by his Majeſty's letters of 28th of Feb. 1662, and the obſervance thereof promiſed by their agents
<pb n="528" facs="unknown:011300_0267_0F86CD21AE0B8578"/>
at that time; and alſo by particular direction from the right honourable the Lords of the committee of trade and plantation to their late agents in 1678, by which meanes coining of money (acknowledged in their agents petition to his Majeſty a great crime and miſdemeanor, who then craved his Majeſty's pardon to the government for the ſame) is continued to this day, &amp;c. Alſo their laws eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall continued, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The ſaid faction have refuſed to admit of his Majeſties letters pattents beating date at Weſtminſter 19th of May in the 32d year of his Majeſty's reign, granted to William Blathwait, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> erecting an office of ſurveyor and auditor generall of his Majeſties revenues ariſing in America, and do appropriate to themſelves the fines, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, &amp;c. which appear by the ſaid letters pattents to belong to his Majeſty, and they make the condition of all recognizances and penall bonds payable to the treaſurer and not to the King.</p>

               <p>HIS Majeſties great goodnes and favour in giving us a farther opportunity to attend him in the affaires of this his colonie expreſſed in his gracious letter of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>  wee with moſt humble thankfulnes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

                  <pb n="529" facs="unknown:011300_0267_0F86CD21AE0B8578"/>Upon the receipt of his Majeſties ſaid letter (though at a ſeaſon, in regard of the extremity of the cold and ſnow, very difficult for the members, eſpecially thoſe remote, to aſſemble in) the governour forthwith ſummoned a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court; which being met January 4th and his Majeſties letter communicated with all duty and regard, the contents thereof were taken into ſerious conſideracion.</p>
               <p>And, in the firſt place, wee applyed ourſelves to the choiſe of agents that they might have timely notice and, accordingly, ſo prepare themſelves for that ſervice as to be ready to imbarque upon the firſt opportunity.</p>
               <p>Wee conſidered of inſtructions for them, wee carefully peruſed our whole booke of lawes, purſuant to the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to ſome of them by Mr. Atturny and Sollicitor generall when our late agents were attending his Majeſtie and their information given us, ſince their returne home, wherein wee have made a conſiderable progreſſe towards a concluſion.</p>
               <p>But ſo it is, right honourable, that wee find it no eaſy matter to prevaile with perſons, in any degree qualifyed, to undertake ſuch a voyage at this time; and though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral elections have been made, wee have not as yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the conſent of any.</p>
               <p>The preſent calamity of others of this country, now ſlaves in Algier (and one of them an agent from one of his Majeſties colonies here) not yet ranſomed, does greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, eſpecially ſuch as live in good credit and condition.</p>
               <p>And truly, Sir, ſhould perſons under ſuch a character be taken, wee have cauſe to beleeve their ranſome would be ſo high as that it would be hard for us to procure it amongſt a poore people yet labouring under the burthen of the arreares of our late warre with the Indians and other extraordinary charges not yet defrayed.</p>
               <p>Sir, Wee doe not urge this as that which hath kept us from our duty, but only as an inconvenience that meets us in the diſcharge of it.</p>

                  <salute>My Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN my attendance on your Lordſhip, I often expreſt that ſome able miniſters might bee appoynted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the officies of the church with us. The maine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle was, how they ſhould be mainetayned. I did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and doe now propoſe, that a part of that money ſent over hither and pretended to bee expended amongſt the Indians, may be ordered to goe towards that charge. I am told by credible perſons that there is nigh two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds of that money put out to intereſt in this country, I know two hundred hath bin for many yeeres in the hands of Mr. Rawſon, their ſecretary, who is now preſſed for to pay the money, to his utter ruin. Neceſſity, and not duty, hath obliged this government to ſend over two agents to England; they are like to the two conſuls of Rome, Ceſar and Bibulus. Major Dudley is a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the faction heere, againſt which I have now arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled to his Majeſty, who, if he finds things reſolutely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niged, will cringe and bow to any thing; he hath his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to make in the world, and if his Majeſty, upon alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the government, make him captain of the caſtle of Boſton and the forts in the colloney, his Majeſty will gaine a popular man and obleidge the better party.</p>
               <p>But if, whatever I have ſaid and proved againſt, and even confeſſed by their former agents, their money raiſed upon the miſerable inhabitants ſhall ſtill prove a prevailing argument, and the agents be diſmiſſed before every mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concluded in England bee certified to bee duly and punctually obſerved heere, you will render them more capable to oppoſe his Majeſtys authority.</p>
               <p>I have reaſon, from ſuch great preſſing reaſons to pay in this 200<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to believe that this money is a banke layd up heere upon mannaging ſome publick deſigne. There was
<pb n="532" facs="unknown:011300_0269_0F86CD2845E03A08"/>
a great difference betwixt the old church and the members of the newchurch, about baptiſme and their members joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in full communion with either church; this was ſoe high that there was impriſoning of parties and great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, but now, heereing of my propoſals for miniſters to be ſent over, for they have very good correſpondancy with ſome of the clarks of the councell, they are now joyned together, about a fortnight ago, and pray to God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the devices of all who diſturbe their peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. I have made it an article againſt them, for not repealing their lawes eccleſiaſticall, and ſent in my papers to Mr. Blackworth a large account of their latter tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to which I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to be referred and to be preſent at the committys making a party againſt their great friend L. P. S. who cannot withſtand their weighty arguments. They have bin this 3 yeeres raiſing money for this expedition, their laſt agents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended above 4000<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> in their agency, the poore people muſt pay all, for by their law neither magiſtrates, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or any publick officers are charged with any publick rate. Theſe agents have certaynly one great advantage by my abſence, haveing liberty to ſay what they pleaſe; but I thinke I have ſo cleerly layd downe the matter of fact, ſent over their lawes and orders to confirme what I have wrote, that they cannot deny them; however, if commanded, I will readily paſs the ſeas to attend at White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, eſpecially if Danford, Goggin and Newell, majeſtrates, and Cooke, Hutchinſon and Fiſher, members of their late generall court and great oppoſers of the honeſt governor and majeſtrates, be ſent for to appeare before his Majeſty, till which time this country will always be a ſhame as well as inconveniency to the government at home. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath a great pledge for ſuch miniſters as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall thinke convenient to ſend over, for their civell treatment, and I thinke no perſon ſitter than Major Dudley, their agent, to accompany them, who will be very carefull to have them ſettled as ordered in England. He is one of the commiſſioners for the money ſent over for
<pb n="533" facs="unknown:011300_0269_0F86CD2845E03A08"/>
the converting the Indians; I give him two or three lines to recommend him to your Lordſhips favour, ſoe far as he may bee ſerviceable to the deſigne; as for Capt. Richards, he is one of the faction, a man of meane extraction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a poore ſervant, as moſt of the faction were at their firſt planting heere, but by extraordinary feats and couſſinadge have gott them great eſtates in land, eſpecially Danford, ſo that if his Majeſty doe fine them ſufficiently, and well if they eſcape ſoe, they can goe to worke for more. As for Mr. Richards, he ought to be kept very ſafe till all things tending to the quiett and regulation of this government be perfectly ſettled. I give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip my humble thankes for the great preſent of excellent bookes. I have diſpoſed of them to advantage and, with my wife, are cryed out upon as diſturbers of the peace of the churches, for bringing in damnable bookes. We have in Boſton one Mr. Willard, a miniſter, brother to Major Dudley, he is a moderate man and baptiſeth choſe who are refuſed by the other churches, for which he is hated. My Lord, we heere the ſlaves in Algier are all to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, that I bouldly write itt that the ſettlement of this country and putting the government into the hands of honeſt gentlemen, ſome or which are already in the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, and diſcountenancing utterly the faction, will be more gratefull to us, for now our conciences as well as our bodys are in captivity to ſervants and illiterate plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. My Lord, your goodnes and readines to ſerve his Majeſty in the ſettlement of this great plantation, invites me, upon all occaſions, to interpoſe your Lordſhips more weighty affayres, but ſince wee are heere immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Lordſhips care, I with more freedome preſs for able and ſober miniſters, and wee will contribute largely to their maintenance, but one thing will mainely helpe, when no marriages heereafter ſhall be allowed lawfull but ſuch as are made by the miniſters of the church of England.

               <p>I Wrote your Lordſhip largely by Mr. Foy, which I hope is come to your Lordſhips hands. Our agents are ſayled from hence about a fortnight ago. Wee heare, Maj. Dudley, one of them, is very ſick of a feavor and not like to hold out the voyage, Mr. Richards, the other, one of Danforths faction and a great oppoſer of the governor, will, upon Maj. Dudleys death, have an opportunity to ſay what he pleaſeth, in defence of the ſeverall miſdemeanors objected againſt them and their faction.</p>
               <p>They have been theſe 2 yeares rayſing money upon the poore inhabitants, to make friends at court, certainly they have ſome there, too nigh the councill chamber, otherwiſe they could not have coppies of my petition againſt their government, my articles of high miſdemeanures againſt Danforth, and now of Mr. Cranfields inſtructions and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations in the province of New-Hampſhire.</p>
               <p>I heartily congratulate the happy returne of his Royall H. my gracious maſter, to Whitehall, the news whereof and of his Majeſties bringing quo warrantos againſt ſeveral charters in England, and of Mr. Cranfields being conſtituted
<pb n="535" facs="unknown:011300_0270_0F86CD29CD67D2E0"/>
governor of New-Hampſhire, puts the faction in a great perplexity; their generall court hath ſett above a month, and made only the incloſed law, and appointed a faſt throughout the government. I am confident, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie had bene pleaſed, at the ſame time he made Mr. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field governor, to bring a Q. W. againſt their charter and made him governor of this collonie, they would thanck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receive him, eſpecially upon declaring liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in matters of religion; but ſo long as their charter remaines undiſturbed, all his Majeſtie ſaith or commands ſignifies nothing here. The governor is very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that the faction will not hearken to reaſon; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have their navall office (ſett up in oppoſition to my letters pattents) taken away this generall court, and have all the acts of parliament relating to trade declared and publiſhed, but the faction are reſolved to doe nothing to oblige the governor or anſwer his Majeſties expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. His Majeſties quo warranto againſt their charter and ſending for Tho. Danforth, Sam. Nowell, a late factious preacher and now a magiſtrate, and Dan. Fiſher and Eliſha Cooke, deputies, to attend and anſwer the articles of high miſdemeanures I have now exhibited againſt them, in my papers ſent Mr. Blaithwait per Capt. Foy, will make the whole faction tremble. I was very much threatned for my proteſt againſt their navall office, but it was at a time when they heard of troubles in England; but, ſince, I am very eaſy, and they would be glad to heare no more of it. His Majeſtie commanded them to repay me the money they tooke from me by their arbitrary orders, which the faction would not heare of, I have therefore arreſted Mr. Danforth for 10<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> part of that money, and their treaſurer, Mr. Ruſſell, for 5<abbr>

                  </abbr> due to me for a fine, and I am to have a tryall with them. I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip that I may have coeſideration for all my loſſes and money laid out in proſecuting ſeizures here, in the year 1680. If I may not have it out of his Majeſties treaſury in England, that the heads of this faction here may be ſtrictly proſecuted and fined for their treaſons and miſdemeanures, and my
<pb n="536" facs="unknown:011300_0271_0F86CD2A8DD45050"/>
money paid out of their fines. My Lord, I am at a great diſadvantage, by reaſon of my diſtance from court, and in no condition to ſollicite his Majeſties concernes and the good and wellfare of this colony, as formerly, I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, buſineſs with your Lordſhip, as with other Lords of the councill, ſometimes intervenes, which hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned not only delays but quite alters the face of things, eſpecially when a committee of Lords meete, who are not acquainted with the whole ſeries of this affaire: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my humble requeſt to your Lordſhip to move that 2 or 3 committyes may be appointed for this matter, when your Lordſhip, my Lord Hide, and Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, may be preſent, and the whole matter of fact examined and ſtated. I know the agents, at leaſt one of them, will confeſs what is charged upon their government, as their former agents did, in their petition to his Majeſtie, which is a ſtanding evidence againſt them; but if that be not ſufficient ground to avoid their charter, together with the miſdemeanors charged upon them, on which your Lordſhip hath the opinion of Sir Wm. Jones, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie pleaſe to direct Gov. Cranfield to examine the laſt articles againſt the faction, there will be reaſon not only to vacate their charter but to ſend over a prudent gentleman to be generall governor. If the party were ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to revolt, upon his Majeſties reſolution to ſettle this plantation (as hath been ſometime ſuggeſted) their firſt worke would be to call me to account, for endeavouring, openly, the alteration of their conſtitution, which by their law is death, but they dwindle away and are very much divided, magiſtrate againſt magiſtrate, the one hoping, the other fearing a change. My Lord, I have but one thing to reminde your Lordſhip, that nothing their agents can ſay or doe in England can be any ground for his Majeſtie to depend upon: Be pleaſed to remember, from the time your Lordſhips honorable father, the late Lord Chancellor, engaged with their agents, in 1662, who undertooke and aſſented to every thinge his Lordſhip propoſed for his Majeſties honour and the benefit of his ſubjects here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting,
<pb n="537" facs="unknown:011300_0271_0F86CD2A8DD45050"/>
nothing but open contempt, of all his Majeſties commands, with ſmall evaſions and tricks, have followed, and worſe may be daily expected, if it be left to them to regulate the abuſes complained of. My Lord, one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy (if not willfull) miſtake hath very much promoted theſe miſchiefs, his Majeſtie hath been repreſented to this people very low in his treaſury, unable and unwilling to give them any diſturbance, though never ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to it, which is here believed, when to this day their contempts putt upon his Majeſties commiſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in 1664, his Majeſtie not calling them to account for refuſing to ſend over Bellingham and Hathorne, when commanded upon their allegiance to attend at Whitehall by his Majeſties letter of 1666, no not ſo much as the leaſt notice taken of it in any of his Majeſties letters at any time ſince to this government, and on the other hand, by a certain <hi>deceptio viſus,</hi> theſe people have been repreſented to his Majeſtie as a very dutifull and loyall people, that they are a great people and can raiſe great forces, beſides that they have been at vaſt charges and expences in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing a wilderneſſe and making a great country, without any charge or expence to the crown. Its true there are many loyall ſubjects here, but few of them in any places of truſt. Their forces are very inconſiderable, more for ſhew than ſervice. I will engage with 500 of his Majeſties guards to drive them out of their country. And for their expences, I know very few now living, nor their children, who were at that charge. Mr. Dudley, one of the preſent agents, was one of the firſt planters and a gentleman, came over with a good eſtate, but the firſt adventurers are either all dead and their children drave out of all, by their fathers ſervants, or elſe ſo few and inconſiderable that no notice is taken of them; and as for all the perſons joyned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the faction here, I know but one man who was not a ſervant or a ſervants ſon, who now governe their governor and the whole country.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a ſcandalous miſrepreſentation, unleſs he intended to ſave himſelf by ſuppoſing the governor and the whole country to be governed by a few, only, of thoſe againſt whom he had juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exhibited articles of high miſdemeanor.</note> I beſeech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

to pardon my long New England diſcourſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, in all this, to aime at his Majeſties honour and the good of this plantation, where, by his Majeſties goodneſs and your Lordſhips favour, I am now become an inhabitant, and remaine</p>

               <p>I Gave your Lordſhip the trouble of mine of 29th of May laſt, which I hope is long ſince received. Wee have advice by Capt. Barrett, now arrived from London, that your lordſhip hath remembered us, and ſent over a miniſter with Mr. Cranfield, the very report hath given great ſatisfaction to many hundreds whoſe children are not baptized, and to as many who never, ſince they came out of England, received the ſacrament. I wrote your
<pb n="539" facs="unknown:011300_0272_0F86CD2B4307D160"/>
lordſhip of our two agents coming over to attend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Majeſties commands, they have large commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to promiſe as much as any of their former agents, and have credit for large ſumes of money to purchaſe (if they can) what their promiſes cannot obtaine, but I hope nothing will be concluded upon, and they thereupon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to returne home, till his Majeſtie have full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from governor Cranfield that all things are here duly performed which are expected and commanded to be done in this collonie. But nothing will ſo effectually ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle this government on a firme dependence upon the crowne as bringing a quo warranto againſt their charter, which will wholly diſinable many, now, great ſticklers and promoters of the faction among us from acting further in a publick ſtation, eſpecially thoſe againſt whom I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the incloſed articles ſent in my laſt to Mr. Blathwait.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am at a great diſtance and ſo not able perſonally to attend and ſollicite in this affaire as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but in regard the matter is more eaſy to be effected, I thinke it unneceſſary, yet in regard its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for his Majeſties ſervice and advantage to the crown to have the whole plantation ſettled upon the true baſis of duty and allegiance, I had rather take a voyage to England, if commanded, to make out my alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, than to have this matter paſſed over and hurſht up upon bare pretences and promiſes. I confeſſe my particular buſineſſe is to take care of the trade of this country, I dayly expoſe myſelfe to many hazards and troubles, but all I have done or can project is to little purpoſe, ſo long as this government (now ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided) which the lawes of England enjoyne to my aide and aſſiſtance, are parties and chiefe obſtructers of my deſigns, for till this government be thoroughly regulated, all that his Majeſtie commands will ſignify nothing. This inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency in government claimed and daily practiſed by us is one chiefe occaſion of the many mutinies and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in other his Majeſties forreigne plantations. If wee are miſinformed concerning your lordſhip's ſending
<pb n="540" facs="unknown:011300_0273_0F86CD2BFB75FC20"/>
over a miniſter, be pleaſed to commiſerate our condition, and ſend us over a ſober diſcreet gentleman. Your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath now good ſecurity, ſo long as their agents are in England, for his civill treatment by the contrary partie; he will be received by all honeſt men with hearty chriſtian reſpects and kindneſs, and if his Majeſties lawes (as none but fanaticks queſtion) be of force with us, wee could raiſe a ſufficient maintenance for divers miniſters out of the eſtates of thoſe whoſe treaſons have forfeited them to his Majeſtie. I have wrote to the Earl of Clarendon, to Mr. ſecretary Jenkins, to remind them of the many ſmall eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and tricks putt upon his Majeſtie and the lords of the councill by this inconſiderable faction, whoſe ſo long delayed puniſhment and reformation, invites and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth to greater contempts. I queſtion not but your lordſhips unſpotted loyalty to his Majeſtie, and charitie to us his dutifull ſubjects, will now engage your lordſhip timely and vigorouſly to aſſiſt, ſo to reduce this faction, as to put it abſolutely out of their power to attempt the like for the future. Our miniſters hope God will ſupport them in all their extravagancies, and now wee have a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne faſt ordered to intreate the Lord to give our agents favour in the eyes of the King, and with all they are to be concerned. Serjeant Maynard, his Majeſties ſerjeant at law, hath made a preſent of eight cheſts of books, now ſent over to the colledge at Cambridge, by Capt. Barrett, and conſigned them to Capt.

                  <salute>Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have yours of Sept. 10th by me and am now to give you the news of your charter being vacated, by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for non-appearance. His Majeſty has choſen Coll. Kerke, late governor of Tangier, to be your governor. He is a gentleman of very good reſolution and, I believe, will not faile in any part of his duty to his Majeſty nor be wanting to doe all good offices for your diſtracted colony, if, at laſt, they will hear what is reaſon and be governed. Here was ſent over a moſt ſcandilous paper, preached, as tis ſaid, by Mr. Moody and Mr. Mather; the Duke of Yorke hath a copy of it, and others have coppies alſo; twill doe your country great prejudice and put jealouſies into the minde of the councel here, as if the collony would not abide by the judgment againſt their charter, but ſtand up to defend their liberties. My buſineſs has been and ſhall be to ward off as much as I can. And if, by the iniquity and folly of your miniſters and majeſtrates, you faile of what was expected, the whole blame will reſt upon themſelves. The King ſent me over to Holland, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the irregular traders; 3 or 4 had been there, and they were gone before my coming. I returned back a fortnight after judgment was given and would have been glad to have ſeen Sir Edmund Andrews in England, who is yet in Guernſey. I queſtion not but you will have reports, as if a great fleet of ſhips, with regements of horſe and foote, are coming againſt you, but I know of no ſuch thing, only, I believe, a frigott or two will attend the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who is leftenant of one of his Majeſties regiments of guards and one of the bed chamber. I remember what you adviſe, that the government be, in the firſt place, tranſpoſed and committed to the care of fitting perſons upon the place to prepare and accommodate affairs againſt the arrival of the governour. I am not wanting to preſs for liberty of conſcience and confirmation of all your rights and poſſeſſions, and have nominated, according to what was
<pb n="543" facs="unknown:011300_0274_0F86CD2CC28A73A0"/>
agreed betwixt you and myſelfe, perſons for the councill, and diſſwade all I can from raiſing any rates upon the peo-to ſupport government, more than what has been uſual with you. The King has been pleaſed to make me ſecretary and regiſter of New-England. I have nominated you for the King's receiver generall of all New-England, which will be a place of profit. I had other things to propoſe on your behalfe, but that muſt attend a farther opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Reſpects to the governor and his lady, madam Taylor, Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Bulkeley, Mr. Page and his lady, and all friends. Its yet very uncertain whether proceſſe will iſſue out againſt Rhode Iſland and Connecticut collony to bring in both them before the governour come over, or to do that afterward in caſe they refuſe to ſubmit to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral governour, as yet nothing has been diſcovered of it. A committee of Lords but ſaturday next is appointed for that buſines. Dr. Cox is well and ſo is Mr. Boyl and all your friends, amongſt whom I deſire to be recorded, becauſe I am Sir,</p>

               <p>PURSUANT to his Majeſtyes order in council of the 13th July 1685, directing Mr. Attourney Generall to cauſe writs of Quo Warranto to be brought againſt the charters of the colonys of Rhode Iſland and Connecticot in New England, I accordingly ſerved theſe writts, tho' by a tedious paſſage of almoſt 6 months from London to this place, the time of their returne was lapſed. However, the governor of Connecticott, upon my delivering the writt to him at Harford, on 21ſt inſtant, has appointed a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the generall courte of that colony to be called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to ſurrender their charter to his Majeſtie, if not perſwaded by the factious people (who are unwilling to depend on his Majeſties favour) to ſtand a triall, only to gain time and delay his Majeſties ſending over a generall. Upon my delivering the governor of R. Iſland the ſummons of the writt, he aſſembled the freemen, and they have drawne a petition and addreſs to be forthwith humbly preſented to his Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>I intended, long before this time, humbly to lay before your Lordſhips a more early account of the preſent ſtate of this government, but have forbore, to wait the effect his Majeſties gracious commiſſion and conſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, containing libertie of conſcience, would have upon
<pb n="545" facs="unknown:011300_0275_0F86CD2D79B0A188"/>
the people of this colony, which, at my firſt arrivall, was received with all outward ſhew of ſatisfaction and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of gratitude was returned his Majeſty for that favour; but ſince, the proceeding of the governor and councill, whatever they write or pretend in their letters to their Lordſhips, are managed to the incouragement of the independant faction and utter diſcountenancing both the miniſter and theſe gentlemen and others who dare openly profeſs themſelves to be of the church of England, not making any allowance for our miniſter, more than we rayſe by contribution amongſt ourſelves. The frame of this government, only, is changed, for our independant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters flouriſh, and expect to be adviſed with in publick affaires. I need no further arguments to confirme the truth hereof to your Lordſhip than to ſay, but two of the preſent members of the government, viz. Mr. Maſon and myſelfe, are members of the church of England, that of above 60 officers in the militia of the whole government, there are not above 2 captains, or 3 inferior officers, but are either church members or ſuch as conſtantly frequent thoſe meetings, which makes nonconformiſts from all places reſort there. About 2 months agoe Mr. Morton, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated miniſter, came hither from Nuington green; he was welcomed by our preſident and deſigned to be maſter-head of our colledge, but not daring to proceed, at firſt, by ſuch large ſteps, he is called to be miniſter at Charleſtowne, a very good liveing, and is ready at hand to be preſident of the colledge.</p>
               <p>Two brothers, of the name of Baylie, great and daring nonconformiſts at Lymbrick in Ireland, have been here 2 yeares and well provided for. In the time of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouths rebellion, moſt part of the miniſters animated the people, ſaying the time of their deliverance was at hand, and not one of them prayed for his Majeſtie, nor would give credit to his Majeſties moſt gracious letter, ſignifying the overthrow of the rebells. I humbly propoſe, as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the quiet and wellfare of this plantation of New-England, that no miniſter from England be permitted to
<pb n="546" facs="unknown:011300_0276_0F86CD2FC2055968"/>
land without the licence of the generall governour, and that he have power or licence to reſtrain from preaching ſuch as are already upon the place. From all which it will appear very neceſſary that his Majeſty would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to ſend over to us a generall governour, to unite and ſettle this diſtracted country, and alſo to make good what is already begun in this colony, the delay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be of evil conſequence and give way for the factious people here to reaſſume the government, which they openly declare they have not parted withall, but expect an opportunity to be reſtored.</p>
               <p>And as to the diſcharge of that truſt repoſed in me, I humbly repreſent to your Lordſhips, that under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties authority the preſident takes great liberty to injoyne upon me in my ſtation, and would not aſſiſt me to make a ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure of a veſſel in the harbour, which my officers were not permitted to board. I am by all accounted the foule enemy of the country, having been for 11 yeares attending his Majeſties command in this affaire, and by ſerving the writts upon the other colonies, my life may be made very uneaſy, unleſs his Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed graciouſly to recommend me to the care and protection of his generall governour, for whoſe ſpeedy arrivall all good men hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pray.</p>

               <p>INCLOSED is a letter ſent ſome time ſince from the government of Road Iſland, they call it a ſurrender of their charter. I have ſince the receipt of it called on them in my way to Hartford in Connecticott, the governor tells
<pb n="547" facs="unknown:011300_0276_0F86CD2FC2055968"/>
me they will paſs a ſurrender in fuller tearmes under the ſeale of their colony, but are willing to have this ſent. I was with the governor of Connecticott and delivered to him the quo woranto. I ſuppoſe they intend not to ſtand it out, our councill have ſent Major Pincheon and Capt. Winthrop to Hardford to perſwade them to accommodate the matter, ſo as they may be added to the government here; how farr that will prevaile I know not; they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Mr. Dudleyes encroachment on all and every ſide, and are unwilling to truſt him, and are ſtrongly invited to come under New Yorke, but it is more for the publick advantage to have that colony continued to us. Since my goeing to Hartford, the preſident has ſo contrived the matter that Capt. George has received above two hundred pounds mony which legally belongs to me who, as collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and informer, ought to be admitted to proſecute a ſhip laden with Scotch goods, but its all as Capt. George pleaſes, the preſident and he carry all as they pleaſe, to the greate diſſattisfaction of the members of the councill, that now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of meeting to do publick buſineſs, tis only to quarrill and that in ſuch heats that I feare it will occaſion the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving this government. I am forced to moderate others paſſions (tho' I have moſt cauſe to complaine) and quietly to ſuffer my proffitts to be ſhared out amongſt others till Sir Edmund Andros come over; he is longed for by all ſober men who find themſelves abuſed by the falſe preſident. Mr. Wharton is comeing over our agent, I have offered Mr. Maſon at leaſt to be joined with him, but I think I cannot gett it to paſs.</p>
               <p>There will I fear be an eruption betwixt the French of Nova Scotia and our people in Mayne and New Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, occaſioned by Capt. Palmer and Mr. Weſt of New Yorke, who being at the fort of Pemmequid and haveing advice of a ſhip of Piſcattaqua which landed wine at Ponop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcutt belonging, as they ſay, to Nova Scotia, they by force went aſhoar and took of the wine: I referr you to the incloſed, a copie of Mr. Palmers letter: The gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of New-Yorke I am told has given them directions to
<pb n="548" facs="unknown:011300_0277_0F86CD309585FE98"/>
claim all the land as farr eaſtward as the River St. Croix. We have ſent to all places to warne our people and to the fiſhermen, not to venter upon their coaſts, leaſt they be ſurprized, and made to anſwer for damages done by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Juſt now I have received a letter from my good friend Mr. Chaplin, who acquaints me of your happy recovery from a dangerous ſickneſs, for which I returne hearty thancks to allmighty God. Mr. Stoughton is inclined to the nonconformiſt miniſters, yet ſtands right to his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes intereſt. Mr. Uſher is made a great criminall for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming againſt Moody and Allin, who are ſtirring up the people to rebellion, he is a juſt honeſt man, and will not ſee his Majeſtyes intereſt ſuffer. But we are over voted and cannot help our ſelves till Sir Edmund come to regulate the matter. Sir, I am under great difficultyes, and were it not for my ingagement in the buſineſs of the maſts, I would once more make a journey over, for I am treated by Mr. Dudly worſe than by Mr. Danforth, yet all under the pretence of friendſhip, and is angry that I do not believe him. Honeſt Major Buckly is quite tyred out and can hardly be perſwaded to come to Boſton. This is our preſent diſtracted condition. Wee have only patience and our friends aſſiſtance to depend upon in England for redreſs.</p>
               <p>I remaine, Sir, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sir, I am informed that the land wheron the wine was landed have been allwayes deemed to belong to the French and was the very place formerly belonging to Sir Thomas Temple, and was delivered up to the French upon the articles of Breda by Capt. Wibourne, by his Majeſty's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall command, in exchange for the Engliſh plantation on St. Chriſtophers and that done about the yeare 1667.</p>
               <p>Sir, Some of the members of the councill are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that ſince the conſtitution of this government is by a preſident and councill, who united are all but governor, that therefore they ought to have a proportionable ſhare of the profitt as well as the charge and burthen, haveing not one penny comeing to them as members of the councill more then to any juſtice of the peace; ſome ſtay here five

               <p>I Have forborne riteing to your grace till I had been ſome time upon the place, to ſee how the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here would demean themſelves under this new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At my firſt arrivall I met with outward expreſſions of joy and ſatisfaction, and many ſeemed well pleaſed at the change, having been ſtruck with a panicke feare upon the aprihention of Colonel Kurcks coming hither to be theire governor; but finding a commiſſion directed to a gentleman borne among themſelves, the then governor and companie, growing hardie by theire miniſters, began to perſwade Mr. Dudlie not to except of his Majeſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be preſident, hoping thereby to continue the government among themſelves: But that faileing them, they adjourned the meeting of their generall aſſembly to the ſecond of October next, and ſo broke up with hopes, that either ſome unhappie accident in affairs of ſtate at home, or by diſſention raiſed by their artifices among the members in this new government, they might prevaile ſo far as to diſſolve this new conſtitution and then reaſſume the government, which to accompliſh they are ſoliſſitouſe. I take leave humbly to remind, that when your grace was preſent at a committee of the Lords and was therein pleaſed to move, that one of theire meeting houſes in
<pb n="550" facs="unknown:011300_0278_0F86CD327676B020"/>
Boſton ſhould be ordered to be ſet apart for the exerciſe of the religion according to the church of England, it was then anſwered by ſome of thoſe noble Lords who diſcorſed in theire favour, provided they might have libertie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience in matters of religion, they would voluntarilie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to have one of theire three meeting houſen to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by the preſident and councell, for that uſe. Since my arrivall with Mr. Ratcliffe, a ſober man, recommended by my Lord of London to be our miniſter; who, beſides his Lordſhips faire teſtimonials, brought with him a letter from the right honourable the Lords of the committe for trade and foraine plantations to the preſident and councell for their countenance and incouridgement in the diſcharge of his office; yet twas a long time before they tooke the leaſt notice of him or his buſines; at laſt, though ſtrongly oppoſed, I got a little roome in their towne houſe, for ſuch as were for the church of England to aſſemble in, but found it ſo ſtraite that we are forced now to make uſe of the exchange for that purpoſe; where, to humour the people our miniſter preaches twice a day and baptiſes all that come to him, ſome infants, ſome adults perſons; we are now come to have praiers every Wedneſday and Friday mornings on their exchange, and reſolve not to be baffled by the great affronts; ſome calling our miniſter Baals prieſt, and ſome of their meniſters, from the pulpit, calling our praiers leeks, garlick and traſh. We have often moved for an honourable maintenance for oure meniſter; but they tell us thoſe that hire him muſt mainetaine him, as they maintaine their owne meniſters, by contribution. Of a preſident and eighteen members of the councell, there is onely myſelfe, ſince Mr Maſons departure for England, that is of the church of England, and twas never intended that that charge ſhould be ſupported by myſelfe and ſome few others of oure communion.</p>
               <p>I humbly repreſent to your grace, that the three meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſes in Boſton might pay twentey ſhillings a weeke, a piece, out of their contribution, towards the defraieing our church charges; that ſume being leſs per annum

than each of their miniſters receive. We have yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie for another miniſter to come over to us; for if any illneſs or indiſpoſition happen to the preſent incumbent, we have no man heere to performe the office. I am not to forgit to your grace the banke of monie in the hands of the corporation for evangelizing the Indians. Your grace was very deſireous that that monie might be inquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and applied to build us a church and free ſchooll, that our youth might be no longer poyſoned with the ſediſſious principles of this country: I am told that there is not leſs then two thouſand pounds here, but adventure not to ſtir the leaſt in it, having all redie brought upon my ſelf ſo many enemiſe, and to all my crimes added this one as the greateſt in bringing the letherdge and cerimoniſe of the church of England to be obſerved amongſt us, and this day is a commencement at our collidge, which your grace was pleaſed to honoure with a preſent of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hamonds works, that rich man: They are all at preſent more taken up in puting in one Morton of Neventon-green, a rank independent, to be theire precident, than to ſhew any reſpect which is due to youre graceouſe preſent, and I cannot expect it ſhould be otherwiſe till his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhall be pleaſed to ſend us a generall governor from England.</p>
               <p>Thus much relating to theſe affairs of oure church, that of our ſtate little differs; moſt part of our chiefe officers, as juſtices of the peace, &amp;c. are congregationall men, and not above three church of England men; and not above three church of England officers in the militia; ſo that in the maine I can only aſſure your grace that the perſons onely and not the government is changed.</p>
               <p>Now from all this, after ſo many hazards and difficulties which I have gon throw in the proſecution of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſervice in New England, I am, by their maliciouſe practiſes made very uneaſie; and ſuch perſons who reape particular advantages by the change of government hate me for accompliſhing it, and are makeing parties and factions to miſrepreſent me to his Majeſtie.

               <p>I Have ſome time ſince humbly repreſented to your grace a neceſſity of having a church built in Boſton to receive thoſe of the church of England. Wee have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent 400 perſons who are daily frequenters of our church, and as many more would come over to us, but ſome being tradeſmen, others of mechanick profeſſions, are threatened by the congregationall men to be arreſted by their creditors, or to be turned out of their work, if they offer to come to our church; under ſuch diſcouragements wee lye at preſent, and are forced to addreſs your grace for reliefe.</p>
               <p>I have taken care to informe myſelf how the money ſent over hither for the company of evangelizing Indeans in New England (for ſoe by their pattent from his late Majeſty they are ſtiled) is diſpoſed of here. Here are 7 perſons, called commiſſioners or truſtees, who have the ſole manage of it; the chief of which are Mr. Dudley, our preſident, a man of a baſe, ſervile and antimonarchicall principle, Mr. Stoughton, of the old leaven, Mr Richards, a man not to be truſted in publique buſineſs, Mr. Hinkley, governor of New Plimouth collony, a rigid independant, and others like to theſe. The poor Indians (thoſe who
<pb n="553" facs="unknown:011300_0279_0F86CD32B9B87958"/>
are called miniſters) come and complaine to Mr. Ratclieffe, our miniſter, that they have nothing allowed them: We have ſpoken to the commiſſioners to have ſome allowance for them; all we can gett is the promiſe of a coarſe coat againſt winter, and would not ſuffer Aaron, an Indian teacher, to have a bible with the common prayer in it, but took it away from him. This money is not leſs than 3 or 400<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> which is yearly returned over hither (ſome ſay 600) with which they enrich themſelves, yet charge it all as layd out among the poore Indians. I humbly preſume to remind your grace of your promiſe to me, when in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that a commiſſion ſhould be directed to ſome perſons here, unconcerned, to audit and report their acts of this money. We want good ſchoolemaſters, none being here allowed of but of ill principle, and, till there be proviſion made to rectifye the youth of this country, there is noe hopes that this people will prove loyall. The money now converted to private, or worſe uſes, will ſet up good and publick ſchooles and provide maintenance for our miniſter, who now lives upon a ſmall contribution, and are yet forced to meet in the town-houſe.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit to acquaint your grace, how tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienced, members of our old church, for ſoe they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the other 2 churches in Boſton, are. Not long ſince, I deſired them to let their clerk toll their bell at 9 clock, Wedneſdays and Fridays, for us to meet to go to prayers. Their men told me, in excuſe for not doing it, that they had conſidered and found it intrenched on their liberty of conſcience granted them by his Majeſtyes preſent commiſſion, and could in noe wiſe aſſent to it.

               <p>I Have with me your three letters of March the 7th, 11th and 7th April, by Mr. Maſon, for all which I heartily thank you, and for your particular direction in the ſeveral ſtages of my employ. I have very lately had the bonds of maſters of ſhips bound from hence to England in my cuſtody, and thoſe are indorſed that copys thereof are ſent for England; you ſhall not faile of the duplicates if this ſhip makes not too much ſpeed, and for the future you may expect them with my other accounts of the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe; however I am to take it as a favour if I be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſend them directly to the cuſtom-houſe, in regard I have been cenſured for ſuffering my papers but to look firſt into the plantation office, and the primier, there now, objected hard againſt me. Pardon my digreſſion, you are ſenſible how much buſineſs I have lying upon me, to ſend accounts and duplicates from my cuſtom-office. I am at 50<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a year charge to keep an able clerke. I cannot yet get any fees ſettled ſufficient to pay that charge, Mr. Stough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Mr. Wharton and others objecting that his Majeſties ſalary for 100<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a year is to defrey all that charge, ſo that I am a great loſer, beſides I am to have deputies in our ſeveral ports, and unleſs they allow fees I am not capable of doing that ſervice at a diſtance without deputies, and their not allowing moderate fees is only to diſcourage from inſpecting their irregular trade. This his excellency has endeavoured to have rectified, but is oppoſed by my enemies, to my very great loſſe, and prejudice to my deputyes. Incloſed is ſuch an account as I could get from Mr. Hooke, late treaſurer in the province of Mayne. Mr. Danforth, tho' ſeverall times putt upon it for an account, wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines it, and ſayed he never received any money but it was all payd to Mr. Hooke, treaſurer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="555" facs="unknown:011300_0280_0F86CD3B4F802F78"/>His excellency tryed all wayes to bring the people to quitt rents. There were ſeverall who would take grantes for lands, but as it now falls out his excellency has none to diſpoſe of; a little time will trye what our new judges Dudley and Stoughton will ſay, when either Indian pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or grantes from the generall court are queſtioned before them. Sir, you will much wonder to hear I have diſpoſed of the ſecretaryes office, for a time, for too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable a vallue, whenas it was judged worth 5 or 600<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> I loſt mony conſiderable, during the time I had it, one part the preſident run away with, and it was not ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, tho' his excellency endeavoured it, but alwayes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and whatever Mr. Weſt can make of it, I could not get an able man to diſcharge it, but the whole trouble, care and charge lay upon me. I, ſometime after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencyes arrivall, was directed to prepare commiſſions, civill and military for the whole territory. I made 12 in parchment for the peace, 240 military, copied and engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in parchment all the lawes, and diſperſed copies through the whole government, yet they ſcrupled to allow me for writing them, theſe matters have ſo diſcouraged me that I thought it better to have ſome certainty than to leave all looſe, and know no end to the charge. I hope long ere this you have received the minutes ſince his excellency's arrivall, ſince which nothing conſiderable has paſſed, only ſome laws about regulating cornfields and cattle, coopers and caſks, they ſtick hard upon that of poſſeſſion as of a generall concerne and, next to that, for a law for miniſters maintenance, ſtrongly oppoſed by the quakers. We have had but one meeting of the whole councill ſince paſſing thoſe laws; that of the rates of pieces of eight does not anſwer the end, money grows very ſcarce and no trade to bring it in. The members of the councill of Rhoad Iſland and New Plimouth have enough of comeing to ſett in councill, 8 or 10 dayes a time, at their own charge, and I now expect but very thin appearance for the future, in regard the tables are downe, but to the great diſſatisfaction of our brethren.</p>

               <p>By the ſeverall Gazetts, filled with addreſſes, I find you are all at liberty at home, and I believe the court is ſo taken up with the weightier matters of ſtate that there will be no room for my wife to addreſſe my petition for a confirmation of my office of ſecretary and ſole regiſter, &amp;c. which I pray may be enlarged and extended to the limitts of the preſent government. I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould reſede in my deſires of getting an underſtanding gentleman to come from home to engage in the diſcharge of the ſecretary's and regiſter's office, which is very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to Weſt, no fees being as yet agreed upon, and I have ground to believe deſignedly done to diſcourage any to undertake that office, whilſt, in the mean time, he extorts what fees he pleaſes, to the great oppreſſion of the people, and renders the preſent government grievous. I have wrote you of the want we have of two or three honeſt atturneys (if any ſuch thing in nature) we have but two, one is Mr. Weſt's creature, came with him from New-York, and drives all before him; he alſo takes extravagant fees, and for want of more the country cannot avoid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, ſo that we had better be quite without them than not to have more. I have wrote Mr. Blathwait the great neceſſity of judges from England. I know there are ſome loyall gentlemen and able lawyers, who have not practice; the judges with us, being now 3, have 390<abbr>

the loſſe I dayly receive, Mr. Weſt is cryed out upon by all; and whom Mr. Blathwayt or you ſhould recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend will be acceptable. Capt. Nicholſon tells me Mr. Martin who was to come over with Col. Kerke, is out of buſines and believes he would accept of the office: I would have an honeſt gentleman, who will not be drawn to ill company, but will mind his buſines: There are many about court, but now out of my mind. Pray, pleaſe to aſſiſt my wife in what may be for my intereſt.</p>
               <p>Severall veſſells are gone from hence to Bermodos, but are deſigned for the wreck. No news yet of Sir John Norburrow or Sir William Phips being there. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet agree upon the prizes of money: Some would have all peeces of 8, tho' of 15 pennyweight, go at 6<abbr>

               <p>Since the governor's arrivall, New Plimouth colony have great profitt by whale killing: I believe they will have nigh 200 tons for to ſend to England, and will be one of our beſt returnes, now beaver and peltry fayles us. I have a deſire to ſee England once more, but know not when I can get an opportunity, or my buſines will allow of my abſence, till I take leave of it, which I am not much diſpoſed to think of till I hear all things are ſettled with you.

               <p>I Am to thank you for yours of the 23d of November, and would not faile to anſwer the chief particulars. If the union of all New England under one governor be acceptable on your ſide the water, what will the joining and annexing to the ſame government be of all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh territories in America, from Delaware bay to Nova Scotia? This is already determined by his Majeſty, and a commiſſion conſtituting Sir Edmund Andros governor alſo of New-York, as united to and parcel of his Majeſties dominion of New-England. And for the two Jerſies, ſcire facias's are expediting towards their union. This, beſides other advantages, will be terrible to the French and make them proceed with more caution than they have lately done.</p>
               <p>I am obliged to you for your kind preſent of cranberries, acorns, cheſnuts, &amp;c. which came very well and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to Mr. Robert Southwell. The little box of locuſt trees was broke open and they are loſt, which was a pity, ſince they are ſo ſhady as you mention. I told the king of the black fox, who taking not much notice of it, I keep it myſelf, unleſs you think otherwiſe to diſpoſe of it.</p>
               <p>Care is already taken for the paſſing your patent for all New-England, and if Mr. Spragg were not in the way, it might have been for the whole new dominion.</p>
               <p>Pray, preſent my humble ſervice to Mr. Maſon and let him know Mr. Povey gives him particular inſtructions by this ſhip how to proceed regularly. The governour needs not any order from hence to do juſtice. If Mr. Maſon be aggrieved he may appeal.</p>
               <p>My humble ſervice likewiſe to Capt. Nicholſon, who I hope may be the lieut. governour intended by the King
<pb n="560" facs="unknown:011300_0283_0F86CD3E02F33BD8"/>
for the New-England. Nor let my ſervice be forgot to my couſin Treffry, whoſe relations are all very well.</p>
               <p>Since you are ſo mindfull of my concerns, the incloſed paper will ſhew you how the article for the auditors is to be worded. But pray remember the firſt accompt of the preſident and councill. It was ſent back with ſeverall queries, in order to the ſatisfying the lords commiſſioners of the treaſury, and I expect your return of it. And you may do well to help Sir E. Andros to diſpatch the firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt ſince his arrivall, by ſetting forth every particular, how expended, more minutely than the parchment ſent me does contain, that the Lords of the treaſury may not except againſt the method of it.</p>
               <p>I ſend you the gazettes touching the pirates and Sir R. Holmes. The King has granted him all pirates goods for 3 years and the power of pardoning for one year. He offers fair to diſcoverers and ſuch as ſurrender themſelves, and will certainly make good his promiſe. An accident on that account may make your fortune, as you are moſt in the way of that ſort of people.</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget my humble ſervice to all my other friends and acquaintance with you. Time and patience will ſtand you in great ſtead, amidſt your diſappointments and afflictions, and you will always find that I am moſt truly</p>

               <p>I Received your two letters of the 8th and 18th March, the firſt at Pemmequid, where, after a tedious paſſage in 5 or 6 boats and other water carriage, I overtooke his excellency, being left behind at Boſton, by ſickneſs, about the end of Aprill laſt. The Governor, with his ſervants, travelled by land to Piſcataqua; Col. Maſon was viſiting the militia in the province of Maine, and was forced to follow the Governor to Caſco bay, where the Governor's ſloop and barge with 10 oares attended their coming; he
<pb n="562" facs="unknown:011300_0284_0F86CD3ECBC444A0"/>
went amongſt all the iſlands in Caſco bay, viſited Mr. Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's poſſeſſions at Pejepſgut, and rowed up many leagues in Kennebeck river; from thence, by eaſy motions, they got to Pemmequid, where he ſtayed 3 or 4 dayes to refreſh themſelves with ſheep and foules, and then, with the Roſe frigott, made towards Ponobſcott; his Excellency had ſooner, by me before, appointed Capt. George to ſpeake to Monſieur St. Caſteen, and to acquaint him with his come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the captain roade with his frigott before Caſteen's doore, ſent his lieut. aſhoare, Caſteen ſpoake to him and told him, but upon notice of the Governor's comeing, Caſteen and all the company retired, left the place to that  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  and left his houſe ſhutt; the Governor landed, with other gentlemen with him, and went into the houſe and found a ſmall altar in the common roome, which altar, and ſome pictures and ordinary ornaments, they did not meddle with any thing belonging thereto, but tooke away all his armes, powder, ſhott, iron kettles and ſome trucking cloath and his chaires, all which were putt aboard the Roſe and laid up in order to a condemnation of tradeing, in the forte at Pemmequid; at their returne, notice being irregularly given to the Indian Sachem, neighbour to Caſteen, that he ſhould have all his goods reſtored if he would demand them at Pemmequid and come under obedience to the King, it is ſuppoſed he went and acquainted the Governor at Port Royall of it, and how reſented we were to expect by the returne of our fiſhing veſſels. This Caſteen is a Frenchman, has lived there many yeares, has 3 or 4 Indian wives and goes a hunting with the Indians, he has a tradeing houſe and ſold the Indians, armes and ammunition in the late Indian wars; he does not well like to be under the French government, deſires to live indifferent. His Excellency carryed with him carpenters and boards, nailes and all neceſſary ſtores, intending to erect a forte at Ponopſcutt, the old one, as they ſay, being gone to ruin, formerly made up with ſtone and turfe, but finding none there, was reſolved to ſpare that charge till a more proper time offered, and in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's

returne from Ponopſcutt, 5 or 6 leagues off from thence, I meete the Governor at ſea, I being bound to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſcutt, but I then returned with him to Pemmaquid. The Governor ſent out, every way, meſſengers to ſummon in all the Indian Sachems; ſuch as were at Pemmaquid at his firſt arrivall, ſtayd his returne; they were well treated with ſhirts, rumm and trucking cloath, but his Excellency, with a ſhort ſpeech, by an interpreter, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that they ſhould not fear the French, that he would defend them, and ordered them to call home all their young men and they ſhould live quietly and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed. There I went to one Shurt, town clarke of Pemmequid, to know what leaſes were made lately and by whom, and for what quitt rent; he told me that above 2 years agoe Capt. Palmer and Mr. Weſt produced to them a commiſſion from Col. Dongan, to diſpoſe of all their land to whoever would take leaſes at 5<abbr>

The poor have been very much oppreſſed here, the forte run all to ruin and wants a greate deale to repaire it; the Governor has ordered it to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; it ſtands very well to command a very good bay and harbour about it, and will in time be a good place, being the only good porte for all veſſels, eaſtward, to ride well and ſecure by the forte from danger. At this time,
<pb n="564" facs="unknown:011300_0285_0F86CD40863032B0"/>
Capt. Palmer and Mr. Weſt laid out for themſelves ſuch large lotts, and Mr. Graham, tho' not there, had a child's portion, I think ſome have 8 or 10000 acres; I hear not of one penny rent comeing in to the King from them who have their grants confirmed at Yorke, and this 5<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ.</hi>
                  </abbr> an hundred acres was only a ſham upon the people. At our returne, we ſaw very good land at Winter harbour, enough to make large ſettlements for many people: The Governor will have it firſt meaſured and then ſurveyed, and then will diſpoſe of it for ſettlements.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham and his family are ſettled in Boſton, he is made attourny generall and now the Governor is ſafe in his New Yorke confidents, all others being ſtrangers to his councill. My couſen Maſon can make no progreſs in his buſineſs, he has attempted to try his title at Piſcataqua, but has been delayed by the judges, and the inhabitants are far more obſtinate than formerly, Mr. Weſt haveing told ſome of them that his title is little worth. All Mr. Weſt aimes at is to have the paſſing grantes for all Mr. Maſon's lands, and neither he nor Graham will allow that he has power to make a grante to any tennant; they are for leiveing him out of all. The newes of the diſſenters being indulged and taken into favour, at home, encouraged this people, and the judges will not give a cauſe for the King. They now diſpute his Excellency's grantes and plead either poſſeſſion or Indian purchaſe in barr of it. The addition of New Yorke to this government does very much inlarge our bounds and may be of greate ſervice to the crowne, but they have been ſqueezed dry by Colonell Dongan and his agents Weſt and Graham, that there is little good to be done. We are in greate expectation of Foyes arrivall, and ſome preparations are makeing for a ſoutharne expedition, but I believe Sir Edmund will not goe into New Yorke till Col. Dongan is removed off the place, there is no good underſtanding betwixt them, and twas not well done of Palmer and Weſt to tear all in pieces that was ſettled and granted at Pemmequid by Sir Edmund, that was the ſceene where they placed and diſplaced at

And for my own part, if that cant be obtained, I do not think the change of our governour will eaſe any thing, for the greater intereſt at court will add greatly to our burthens, and emboulden him that hath the power in his hand to ſqueaſe to extremity. I entreat you wholly to conceale my name from thoſe of our own people or others that you confer with, for it may do me much harm and no good to the publick.

               <p>It hath pleaſed God again to ſuffer the natives to do us miſchiefe in July laſt, three or more perſons killed at Quackeage on Connecticot river, one man at New Haven, and ſundry at the Eaſtward, ſome at Kenebeck and Cape Porpos, in all, about twenty ſix perſons killed, ſo that all the out towns are driven into garriſons, and under great affrightment. Sir Edmund hath lately been at New York, and from thence to Albany, &amp;c. thorow the country, was abſent about 11 weeks, and, as I hear, will not allow it to be called a war, but murtherous acts, and he will inquire the grounds; is not pleaſed that any ſoldiers were levyed, in his abſence, to ſend eaſtward, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from priſon Indians that were ſent thence, i. e. from eaſtward. The winter is now upon us, but whether that will occaſion the ſucceſſion of miſchiefe I know not, but people are generally much affrayd what will be the iſſue.</p>
               <p>In caſe ſomething be not obtayned for ſettlement of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and reſtreyning rigor in making orders, which they call lawe, and levying money, I fear what hath been done at court will exaſperate and poſſibly may double the tale of brick. I am exceeding ſenſible that it is very difficult for our friends on the place to do much, unleſs God do in more than ordinary manner inſpire the heart of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to favour us. Wee are in no capacity to do any thing, not ſo much as to pay what is of neceſſity to be done to officers, &amp;c. in caſe his Majeſties favour ſhould be great, nor may wee meet in our ſeverall towns to conſider of any thing for our own good, at home or abroad, (as the incloſed copie of their order will ſhew you, an unheard of tyranny) ſo that ſhould any diſburſe for us, I can't, for my own part, ſee how it can poſſibly be gained to repay, and yet people are at preſent in great expectation that, ſo many of our friends being on the place, ſomething will be gained.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOUR loveing lines were with much joy received and read by me, for which I humbly bleſs God, and return yourſelfe many thanks. By reaſon of the great expectation of your ſudden arrivall (with other of your friends) I did willingly omitt writeing unto you by the laſt opportunity, but now, conſidering the times are among thoſe things reſerved by God to his own diſpoſe, I ſhall adventure the riſke of a few lines, committing yourſelfe and my endeavours herein to the good providence of God.</p>
               <p>Its now 14 weeks ſince the revolution of the government here, the manner whereof, before theſe can reach you, will ſpread farr and neare; future conſequences wee are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, yet wee know that, at preſent, wee are eaſed of thoſe great oppreſſions that wee groaned under, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of an arbitrary and illegall commiſſion, ſome briefe account whereof is contained in the declaration publiſhed the ſame day, a coppie whereof I herewith ſend you. The buſines was acted by the ſoldiers that came armed into Boſton from all parts, to the great amazement of all beholders, being greatly animated by the Prince's declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which about that time came into the country, and
<pb n="568" facs="unknown:011300_0287_0F86CD42A5D75508"/>
heightened by the oppreſſions of the governor, judges, and the moſt wicked extortion of their debauched officers. The ancient magiſtrates and elders, although they had ſtrenuouſly adviſed to further waiting for orders from England, and diſcouraged any attempts of that nature ſo farr as they had opportunity, yet were they now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to aſſiſt with their preſence and councells for the prevention of bloodſhed, which had moſt certainly been the iſſue if prudent counſells had not been given to both parties. A coppie of that paper ſent Sir Edm. Androſs I have herewith ſent you, upon which he forthwith came and ſurrendered himſelfe. The ſame day, about 30 more of the principall perſons of that knot were ſecured, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome were quickly releaſed, and ſome yet remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſtraint, Eight of whom, viz. Mr. Dudley, Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, Mr. Randolph, Mr. Weſt, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Grai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Mr. Sherlock, Mr. Farwell, the repreſentatives of the people, at their laſt ſeſſions, voted unbailable. Mr. Dudley in a peculiar manner is the object of the peoples diſpleaſure, even thorow out all the colonies where he hath ſat judge, they deeply reſent his correſpondency with that wicked man Mr. Randolph for the overturning the government, and the manner of his procuring his preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, his extream covetouſnes, getting to himſelf ſo many bags of money, to the ruinating of trade, and ſince Sir Edmund's arrivall here, hath been his great inſtrument in the oppreſſion of the people, chooſing rather to do that baſe drudgerie then to diſpleaſe, and thereby endanger the loſſe of his honor and gaine. Theſe and ſuch like things have made him vile in the eyes of all generally both good and bad, ſo that the governor and councill, though they have done their uttermoſt to procure his inlargement, yet cant prevaile, but the people will have him in the jaile, and when he hath been by their order turned out, by force and tumult they fetch him in againe, and both he and the reſt of them there remaine till releaſed by orders from England. I am deeply ſenſible that we have a wolfe by the ears. This one thing being circumſtanced
<pb n="569" facs="unknown:011300_0287_0F86CD42A5D75508"/>
with much difficulty, the people will not permitt any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, they having accuſed them of treaſon againſt their king and country; and thoſe reſtrained, they, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at a high rate for being denyed an habeas corpus. I do therefore earneſtly entreat of you to procure the beſt advice you can in this matter that, if poſſible, the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the people and their loyalty to the crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land may not turn to their prejudice. The example of England, the declarations put forth by the Prince of Orange, now our King, the alteration of the government in England making the arbitrary commiſſion of Sir Edmund null and void in the law; theſe conſiderations, in conjunction with the great oppreſſions they lay under, were ſo far prevalent in the minds of all, that although ſome could not adviſe to the enterpriſe, yet are hopefull that we ſhall not be greatly blamed, but ſhall have a pardon granted for any error the law will charge us with in this matter. The exerciſe of Sir Edmund's commiſſion, ſo contrarie to the magna charta, is ſurely enough to call him to account by his ſuperiours, and alſo Mr. Dudley that led the van in that tragedy; and for others of them, may we be quit of them, as we hope for no good from them, ſo we are farr from deſiring to revenge our ſelves upon them, let what they have met with be a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others how they eſſay to oppreſs their Majeſties good ſubjects any more in that kind. I crave an anſwer hereunto by the firſt opportunity.</p>
               <p>I muſt alſo yet a little further acquaint you that ſundry of thoſe gentlemen and merchants that were very active in this matter on the day of the revolution yet, ſince, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of what they expected the people univerſally crying up their charter priviledges and urging the old governor and magiſtrates to reaſſume the former government all which they were deſigned to oppoſe but had hopes to advance their private intereſts of which finding themſelves now diſappointed, are greatly diſcontented and ſpeake high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the repreſentatives of the people and preſent government and, as we are informed, ſundry of them, moſtly
<pb n="570" facs="unknown:011300_0288_0F86CD433A8E6EC8"/>
factors and ſtrangers, have drawn a petition to the lords of the committee for forreign plantations, pretending loyalty and advance of revenue to the crown, and highly inveighing againſt the government and people, whereas, in truth, they are the tranſgreſſors of thoſe acts for trade and navigation, and thoſe whom they complain againſt are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally unconcerned in either, and ſo uncapable to do the thing they accuſe them of. If any thing of this nature be preſented, let me intreat you ſedulouſly to divert the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief intended and ſend me a coppie thereof by the firſt opportunity.</p>
               <p>Capt. George, commander of the Roſe frigott, was alſo the ſame day with the reſt of that knott ſeized, reports being ſpread by ſundry of his men, that he intended for France, there to waite on the late King James, and before his departure to ſhew his ſpleen againſt Boſton, ſo that the people were afraid of being murdered and burnt up in their beds, the lieutenant alſo a known papiſt. The ſails of the frigott are brought on ſhore and ſecured till the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment here receive their Majeſty's order, for which deed its hoped we ſhall not receive blame. We do crave that the circumſtances of our caſe and condition in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects may be conſidered. Nature hath taught us ſelfe preſervation: God commands it, as being the rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards our neighbour: Our great remotenes from England denys us the opportunity of direction and order from thence for the regulating ourſelves in all imergencies, nor have we meanes to know the laws and cuſtomes of our nation: Theſe things are our great diſadvantage: We have alwayes endeavoured to approve ourſelves loyall to the crown of England, and are well aſſured that none of our worſt enemyes dare to tax us in that matter, and we have alſo laboured to attend the directions of our charter, under the ſecurity whereof were laid by our fathers the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this his Majeſties colony, and we are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes but that before you do receive theſe lines we ſhall receive from their royall Majeſties the confirmation of our charter, with ſuch addition of privileges as may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

               <p>BY a heady multitude poſſeſſed with jealouſyes that our Governor, Sir Edmund Andros, was a papiſt and intended to bring on the French and Indians to cut off the inhabitants, a generall inſurrection was intended and ſo perfected on the 18th of Aprill laſt, that the Governor, hoping to ſecure himſelfe in our fort, miſſed an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of going aboard the Roſe frigott, then at anchor in the harbour, and ſo, being overpowered, wee were taken priſoners of warr, as the ſilly multitude told us. This proceeded from a dayly expectation (that one Mather, one of their miniſters in Boſton, had raiſed by his letters to them from court in the height of popery) of a new charter. I know he or any other (having firſt ſubſcribed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing their penall lawes and teſt) might for their money obtain fair promiſes of, and he had ſo far prevailed with Sir Thomas Powis, atturney generall, that he had obtained a report in their favour, upon many falſe ſuggeſtions, which, immediately on the P. of Orange his intending to viſit the court of England vaniſhed; however, he had no other engine to draw ſupplyes of money from the diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied party here, but to feed them up with aſſurances of a
<pb n="572" facs="unknown:011300_0289_0F86CD483B413C38"/>
new and much larger charter. They were impatient at his delay and, hearing the newes that all papiſts were either ſecured or fled out of England, and would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but Sir Edmund was a papiſt and his commiſſion ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and calculated onely for the ſuppreſſing all perſons of a different perſwaſion; they caballed and accordingly executed their principall reſolutions: They have not yet ſent to England, expecting Mather, their Mahomett, or at leaſt particular orders from court, which will not operate here unleſſe conſonant to their humours. We have, at this day, above 100 perſons equally concerned as conſervators of the peace, but their power ſignifies nothing, further than it pleaſes the people; ſometymes they are for having their old magiſtrates reaſſume their former government; ſometymes to form a new modell of government; but their being many more ready (and of neceſſity diſpoſed) to pull down than build up, they know not what to be att: Some, that have eſtates and ſhipping abroad, feare they have done more than they can anſwer, believing other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments will treat them as revolters from their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and give them neither protection nor lett them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till they have orders from home how to treat them. This you may pleaſe to communicate to the other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments leeward of you, to whom I have not an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to write, who, I am well aſſured, will alſo highly reſent it, and ſo will the preſent conſtitution at home, whoever be in the throne, and not ſuffer ſo high an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to be putt upon the moſt authentick authority any Prince can give his ſubjects for their ſecurity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, whilſt they act by a power confirmed by the broad ſeal. God onely knowes how affaires ſtand at home. I am confident they will never part with me, unleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, by a force or their ſhips ſtoped in the plantations till I am delivered up for their liberty and licence to trade. This country is poor, the exact execution of the acts of trade hath much impoveriſhed them; all the blame lyes upon me, who firſt attacked and then overthrew their charter, and was made the officer to continue their Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian

ſervitude, by my office of collector, &amp;c. I intreat you to repreſent my ſtate to the Earls of Clarendon and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, by the firſt opportunity, and that the Governor and I may be ſent for home by ſome frigotts. I muſt confeſſe there have been ill men from New-York, who have too much ſtuddied the diſeaſe of this people, and both in courts and councills they have not been treated well. However, nothing done can amount to countenance ſuch an open rebellion, and, were I in England, I muſt adviſe a generall pardon, many hundred of innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being forced to act, otherwiſe to be impriſoned; and the kingdome of England cannot looſe this country nor govern it without ſome reſpect and allowance to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thoſe who are miſlead and the force of education and the byas of common prejudices: However, we are, at preſent, as much diſtracted and as far from cementing into any ſort of government as at the building of Babell. God onely keeps them from deſtroying us.</p>
               <p>You will have one Robert Glanvill from Salem, maſter of a ketch, he was impriſoned here, for an abettor of py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and was impriſoned with 7 pyrates, he can tell you their names; he brought into this country 3700 and odd Spaniſh hides, robb'd from a Portugeſſe veſſell, the men thrown overboard, with other goods to the value of about 2000<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> This is all proved by ſufficient witneſſes and they kept in goal till ſome particular order from Sir Robert Holmes. About Oct. laſt, he ſent his commiſſion to the Governor and myſelfe, dated the 26 Aug. 88. which we receiving not till November, and the Governor and I ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the eaſtward till the limite was paſt, could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon a method of proceeding againſt them, in regard they ſtood upon their juſtification, but rather, wee could not be aſſured of a jury that would find againſt them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt evident proofe, but now they are at liberty, have their goods, and perhaps may bring ſome of the hides, or barrels of ſmall barrs of copper to your iſland: However, I think the ketch is forfeited for bringing in the pyrates and their goods to this country, knowing the
<pb n="574" facs="unknown:011300_0290_0F86CD49CA0BEA28"/>
men to be ſuch, for Glanvill, in his ketch, ſayled in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the pyrates, in the veſſell they tooke, as far as New England; he went to Salem, appointed to meet them at Port a Bear, in Nova Scotia, and did ſo and carried them ſupplyes and proviſions; when they burned the veſſell and brought away the goods in this ketch and other veſſels. This I heartily refer to your conduct and privacy, my life lying at ſtake for the leaſt diſcovery. I cannot truſt Mr. Rudger, father in law to Mr. Weſt, with us, who has been a great inſtrument in impoſing upon this people.</p>

That you have not ere this had an account of our affaires particularly directed unto your ſelfe, proceeded neither from forgetfullneſs nor neglect, but ſolely from our daily expectations of ſeeing you here, wee being ſo long time without any intelligence from England. Your providential deteinure behind our friends, who arrived about two months ſince, wee hope was in mercy, and will turn to our advantage. We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand there ſeem'd to be an abſolute neceſſity of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance for us.

You will not wonder to ſee ſo great a number of that ſociety of men come over, whom wee are glad to get rid of, they having been induſtriouſly diligent to interrupt and diſturb our publique affaires here to our no ſmall diſadvantage.
