            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

deſerved, yea, his wondrous Goodneſs in giving them a moſt undeſerved and <hi>inexpreſſibly Great Deliverance;</hi> and then (2) He by Implication or awakening Queſtions owns, that after all This, for them to brake his Commandments again, and join in Affinity with the People of theſe Abominations [i. e. of impious Idolaters] would be a moſt monſtrous, aggravated and provoking Sin, which might juſtly move Him to diſplay his Anger in their utter Ruin.</p>
            <p>And how exceeding applicable are the ſame Hiſtories and Reaſonings to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nations and their depending <hi>Colonies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the MOST HIGH has lately given us ſuch a <hi>Great Deliverance</hi> in the <hi>happy</hi> VICTORY over the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s <hi>Party</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of SCOTLAND, and we are eſpecially called this Day to adore and Praiſe our DIVINE DELIVERER therefor with the livelieſt Thankfulneſs and Admiration; it ſeems highly proper to conſider theſe <hi>Four</hi> Particulars—
<list>
                  <item>1. Who this <hi>dangerous Perſon</hi> is, and who are <hi>his Adherents and Abettors.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>miſchievous Conſequence</hi> of his obtaining his Deſigns.</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>great Danger</hi> of his ſucceeding in his late Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</item>
                  <item>4. Some of the <hi>ſignal Appearances</hi> of GOD for us in <hi>this great Deliverance.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great Deliverance</hi> is a General Term which comprehends a great Variety and Number of Particulars; both all the Evils delivered from, the Cauſes &amp; Danger of them, and the Way and Means of our Deliverance. But General Terms affect us not ſo much as the mention of Particulars. As the Term— <hi>Redemption by</hi> CHRIST would neither move nor enlighten, unleſs we conſider the particular Evils we are ſubject to and redeemed from, together with the particular Author, Way and Means of our Redemption. And He thinks not deeply in Religion, nor is duly engaged in it, who contents Himſelf with General Terms, without viewing the Particulars included
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005857_0005_102701FF2A434A48"/>
in them wherein He is greatly concerned: His Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is neither duly clear, nor can his Heart be ſuitably affected.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>the important Caſe before us</hi>—How can we be duly Thankful to or admire and praiſe our DIVINE DELIVERER, unleſs we are duly Senſible of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of our <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Deliverance?</hi> And how can we be duly Senſible of theſe, unleſs we take a particular View of the <hi>miſchievous Conſequence</hi> of <hi>the Head</hi> of our Enemies ſucceeding, or the dreadful Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we are delivered from? And how can we be apprehenſive of thoſe, unleſs we conſider his <hi>Education, Principles, Intereſts, Adherents</hi> and <hi>Abettors?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhould be as particular therefore as the Hour allows, and view each Particular as a <hi>Part</hi> of the wondrous <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> comprehended in our Great Deliverance, and as a <hi>particular Motive</hi> of our pious Admiration, Thankfulneſs and Praiſe: Eſpecially conſidering every Inſtance is under the <hi>Government</hi> of the SON of GOD as <hi>Mediator,</hi> made ſubſervient to his glorious Purpoſes, is a Fulfillment of his Will and Word, and a Means of diſplaying his adorable Perfections; yea my intire Subject will be a Part of the Execution of <hi>his Kingly Office</hi> among the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, they act too much like <hi>Atheiſts</hi> who view theſe Things as a meer Piece of News, or the meer Operations of created Cauſes, to pleaſe their vain Curioſity, and don't religiouſly behold them as the Works of GOD in Providence: And they don't act like <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who don't in the Exerciſe of Faith behold them as the <hi>Providential Works</hi> of our exalted SAVIOUR in the Rule of the World.</p>
            <p>With ſuch believing and religious Views as theſe, let us then conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Who this <hi>dangerous Perſon</hi> is, and who are <hi>his Adherents and Abettors,</hi> which the righteous GOD has raiſed up to moleſt and threaten us.</p>
            <p>Now, He is called <hi>the Pretender,</hi> not ſo much becauſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be the Son of King JAMES II; as becauſe he pretends in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005857_0006_10270203B1D6B290"/>
Oppoſition to all the Rights, Laws and Conſtitutions of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, to be their Sovereign.</p>
            <p>In 1623, his pretended Grandfather Prince <hi>Charles</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards King CHARLES I, ſolliciting a Match with a <hi>Spaniſh Papiſt,</hi> Siſter of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> in his Letter to the <hi>Pope</hi> declared, <q>He would never ſo vehemently deſire to be joined in a ſtrict and indiſſoluble Bond with any Mortal whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever whoſe Religion he hated:</q> And tho' the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> repreſented the miſchievous Influence of a <hi>popiſh</hi> Match, and the great Importance of marrying a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> yet <hi>two</hi> Years after, coming to the Crown, he forthwith married a <hi>French Papiſt,</hi> Siſter of King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII of <hi>France,</hi> which was the pernicious Fountain of almoſt all the Miſeries of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nations ever ſince. Of <hi>this popiſh Match,</hi> in 1630, was born Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> afterwards King CHARLES II; and in 1633, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> afterwards King JAMES II: And by the Articles of Marriage they were educated by their popiſh Mother 'till they were <hi>ten</hi> Years old; and then the <hi>civil Wars</hi> between the <hi>Parliament</hi> and their <hi>Father,</hi> beginning in 1641, 2 and ending in 1646, they followed their <hi>popiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> where they chiefly ſojourn'd with her 'till 1660: When King CHARLES II being reſtored, he <hi>two</hi> Years after married a <hi>Portugeſe Papiſt,</hi> Siſter of the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> About 1670, the ſaid Duke of <hi>York</hi> declar'd Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Papiſt, and appear'd the Patron and Head of their Party; in 1673, in Oppoſition to Two Addreſſes of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> He married an <hi>Italian Papiſt,</hi> Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Modena;</hi> and in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1684, 5, He ſucceeded his ſaid Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Throne. And thus the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation had none but <hi>Popiſh Queens</hi> for above <hi>Sixty-three Years</hi> together: Nor had ever any <hi>King</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Stuarts</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant Queen,</hi> except King JAMES I.</p>
            <p>When King JAMES II. came to the Crown, He publiſh'd <hi>his Brother</hi>'s private Papers to ſhow that <hi>He</hi> was a <hi>Papiſt</hi> alſo: But to quiet the People and rock them into Security, He firſt to his <hi>Privy Council</hi> and then to the <hi>Parliament</hi> Promiſed, and Printed his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> to maintain the national Liberties, Properties, Laws and Conſtitutions, and prove Himſelf a merciful and tender Prince: Yet quickly broke them all;

            <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1715, King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV of <hi>France</hi> dying, the <hi>Pretender</hi> was oblig'd in <hi>February</hi> 1716, 17, to retire to <hi>Rome:</hi> Where or near it He has lived almoſt ever ſince; married a <hi>Poliſh Papiſt,</hi> and had <hi>two Sons</hi> by Her, yet alive.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Beginning</hi> of 1717, the Government was threatened with an Invaſion by the then King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> attended with an Inſurrection of this <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Friends in GREAT BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN: But the Project being timely diſcovered, was quickly diſappointed.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Spring</hi> of 1719, the <hi>Pretender</hi> was received at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> with all the Honours of a crowned Head by the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Who declar'd him King of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND and IRELAND, engaged in another Invaſion for Him, and on a ſudden ſent a Fleet and Armament for GREAT BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN: But a mighty Storm for <hi>nineteen</hi> Days together diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed them.

            <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1727, King GEORGE I. Deceaſing, his only Son King GEORGE II. happily ſucceeded, and reigned ſeveral Years in great Quiet and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>Yet in the <hi>Winter</hi> of 1743, 4, the <hi>French</hi> King in a Time of Peace with us, fitted out another Fleet at <hi>Breſt</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> with <hi>Sixteen Thouſand</hi> Troops, and vaſt Quantities of Arms,  unexpectedly and ſuddenly at the End of <hi>Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary,</hi> in perfidious Breach of all his ſolemn Treaties, ſent them to invade the Kingdom for this <hi>Pretender,</hi> to the great Surprize of the Nation, while we were too ſecure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared: And having ſent them forth, proclaim'd Him our King and declared War againſt us. But juſt, as many of them arriv'd on the <hi>Southern</hi> Coaſt of ENGLAND and others were come out of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> before they had Time to join and land; GOD was pleas'd to raiſe another mighty Storm againſt them, which diſpers'd and drove 'em away, deſtroy'd diverſe Ships, drowned many Troops, and in one Day confounded this threatning Enterprize.</p>
            <p>But our inveterate and <hi>popiſh</hi> Enemies both without and within the Kingdom, are reſtleſs to enſlave and ruin us.</p>
            <p>For about <hi>twelve Months ago,</hi> the <hi>Pretender</hi> ſent his eldeſt Son <hi>Charles</hi> in the 26th Year of his Age thro' <hi>France,</hi> with the <hi>pretended Title</hi> of <hi>Regent</hi> in his Name of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND, to make another Attempt to gain the Throne, and bring the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nations to miſerable Popery and Slavery in Subjection to Him. And <hi>this young Pretender</hi> appears as zealous a <hi>Papiſt</hi> as any of his pretended Predeceſſors. As He was born at <hi>Rome,</hi> He has been trained up in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Tyranny, Superſtition, Bigotry, and cruel Principles. He has a riveted Perſwaſion, that <hi>Popery</hi> is the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005857_0011_10270217141334B8"/>
only true Religion; that all Chriſtians ought to be ſubject to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that none can be ſav'd without it; that all Proteſtants are damnable Hereticks and Separatiſts, no Faith or Promiſe is to be kept with ſuch, and it is his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Duty, and will be his greateſt Glory and Merit, to put an utter End to their horrid Hereſy and Separation, by bringing them into Subjection to <hi>that Man of Sin</hi> and <hi>Son of Perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is alſo fully perſwaded that <hi>his Father</hi> has a divine, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, abſolute, unalienable Right, by Birth, to rule the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nations, whether they will or not, or tho' they are ever ſo much againſt Him; that no Degree or Kind of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny can forfeit his pretended Right; that 'tis lawful for Him to deſtroy Half the Nation, that He may have the Pleaſure of reigning over the Reſt; that if <hi>his Father</hi> gets the Throne, let Him do what He pleaſes, and rule ever ſo cruelly, yet the Nation are but as Beaſts of Burthen for him, they muſt make no Reſiſtance, they muſt tamely ſubmit, and mayn't preſume to judge of Him or his Actions; and laſtly, That their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deliverer King WILLIAM and Queen MARY, Queen ANN, King GEORGE I, and King GEORGE II, are all <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers,</hi> and all their Actions <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>dangerous Perſon</hi> call'd <hi>the Pretender:</hi> And <hi>His Adherents</hi> and <hi>Abettors</hi> are the Courts and People of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Papiſts;</hi> as alſo many wretchedly deluded <hi>half-way nominal Proteſtants</hi> in divers Parts of BRITAIN.</p>
            <p>And this leads us to conſider</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>miſchievous Conſequence</hi> of his obtaining his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            <p>And here</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may be ſure that <hi>He</hi> and his <hi>Regent</hi> would in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral lay down theſe <hi>two Maxims</hi> as certain Rules which in all their Conduct they would in no wiſe vary from, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for ever; <hi>viz.</hi> (1) To do whatever they judge <hi>neceſſary</hi> for their own Safety and Eſtabliſhment, tho' ever ſo ruinous or barbarous to <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> (2) To do what ever their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh

and cruel <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the Directors of their Conſcience, judge their Duty and require on Pain of Damnation, as neceſſary to promote and ſecure the <hi>Catholick Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Under the Efficacy of theſe <hi>two</hi> Fundamental and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Maxims,</hi> it is to be feared that upon their Army's ſeizing <hi>London,</hi> He or his Regent would apprehend it neceſſary to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his Popiſh and barbarous Highlanders and other numerous Papiſts thro' the Nation, at once to <hi>maſſacre</hi> all the chief Friends of the <hi>Hanover Succeſſion,</hi> if not of the <hi>Proteſtant Party</hi> in the City and Kingdom, who would be in Danger of raiſing any Oppoſition to him: Or that he would ſurely do ſo, if He ſhould judge it <hi>neceſſary</hi> for his Preſervation in his uſurped Government; for then He wou'd think Himſelf to be ſafe from after dangerous Inſurrections, and all Things elſe would be eaſy to Him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As in ſuch an horrible Scene as this, the City of <hi>London</hi> wou'd run down with <hi>Blood;</hi> ſo all the immenſe <hi>Treaſures</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> therein wou'd be ſuddenly ſeized: Whereby their remaining Families wou'd be beggared and ruined, as alſo Multitudes of wealthy Families thro' the Kingdom who have their Wealth in <hi>London,</hi> and He and his Popiſh Party infinitely ſtrengthened.</p>
            <p>Or if he ſhou'd not judge this to be either feaſible or advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable <hi>at firſt;</hi> then</p>
            <p n="4">4. As he has made many plauſible and promiſing Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as did <hi>Charles</hi> IX, and <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV of <hi>France,</hi> with Reſpect to their <hi>reformed</hi> Subjects, whom they afterwards in convenient Time deſtroyed; ſo He might probably ſpeak fair <hi>at firſt,</hi> as his pretended <hi>Father</hi> did when He came to the Crown, to make the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Part of the Nation eaſy and ſecure, or lay 'em aſleep, 'till he ripened Things for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Deſtruction, which He might eaſily and quickly do.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="5">5. While he wou'd plauſibly repreſent the <hi>Danger</hi> of the <hi>Diſaffected</hi> to Him, and as we have for the ſame Reaſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed all the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> He would doubtleſs immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005857_0013_1027021F011563B8"/>
all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to bring in to Him their Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition; and make it Loſs of Eſtate and Life, for Arms or Ammunition to be found on any but by his Commiſſion, for a Month or a Year, or any Time He ſhould judge it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And thus all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> diſarmed wou'd lie at his Mercy, and he might eaſily do what He pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He wou'd no doubt immediately ſeize all the <hi>fortified Places</hi> in the Kingdom, all the <hi>Naval Stores,</hi> all the <hi>Men of War</hi> in <hi>Harbour,</hi> as alſo all the <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>abſent Seamen;</hi> that he might bring in their Huſbands and Fathers to ſubmit to his Government, which wou'd then be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the only lawful Government: And which 'tis probable wou'd have an Influence on many; eſpecially conſidering the Loſs of their Eſtates as well as Wives and Children, and the Unlikelihood or great Difficulty of ſubſiſting any where elſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As in Defiance of all the Laws and Conſtitutions of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nations, even thoſe made by King CHARLES II, He or his Regent in his Name had liſted a great Number of <hi>Papiſts</hi> into his Army, given <hi>military Commiſſions</hi> to them, and without Law or Act of Parliament raiſed <hi>Money,</hi> forced <hi>Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing, Carriages, Horſes, Cattle, Proviſion,</hi> and what ever he wanted, from whom he pleaſed, from the pretended Reaſon of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> of which he alone is <hi>Judge;</hi> ſo no doubt He wou'd continue the ſame arbitrary Courſe, from the ſame pretended Reaſon of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> of which he wou'd ſtill be the <hi>Judge,</hi> or as long as he ſaw good or pleaſed: And who cou'd preſume to judge or hinder Him?</p>
            <p n="8">8. As thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of ENGLAND who had been crying up <hi>Hereditary Right, paſſive Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> yet ſeeing the Church invaded, failed in his pretended <hi>Father</hi> at the <hi>Revolution;</hi> and as He cou'd only truſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> to ſupport him faithfully; He wou'd doubtleſs call all able bodied <hi>Papiſts,</hi> firſt forthwith in LONDON and GREAT BRITAIN, and then after in convenient Seaſon in IRELAND, to liſt in his <hi>Armies,</hi> both as <hi>common Soldiers</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> and put all the Arms, Ships of War and ſtrong Places of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into their Hands.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:005857_0014_10270225D47113F8"/>9. He would no doubt immediately declare the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> his good Friends, and enter into the ſtricteſt Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Alliance with them, if he has not done it already, they having declared him their Ally: Yea 'tis likely promis'd them for their paſt immenſe Expence and future Help, the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Return of their Countries, Cities, Towns and Prizes, both in EUROPE and AMERICA.</p>
            <p n="10">10. As 'twas a <hi>grand Miſtake</hi> in Policy, fatal to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Father,</hi> to refuſe an Army of <hi>Thirty Thouſand</hi> diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd <hi>Popiſh</hi> Troops which the <hi>French King</hi> offered Him at the threatened Enterprize of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange;</hi> He wou'd have Senſe enough to correct this Error. And as Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſabeth</hi> had <hi>cautionary Sea-Ports</hi> delivered Her in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> to ſecure her Stores, Troops and Ships in aiding the Parties She eſpouſed in thoſe Countries; no doubt the <hi>French King</hi> would require and have <hi>Portſmouth</hi> put into his Hands as a Place of Safety for his Magazines and Land and Naval Forces; and as many <hi>French Troops</hi> would be received into the Kingdom, as would be more than ſufficient to keep it in abſolute Subjection to Him.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As He has already declared King WILLIAM and Queen MARY, Queen ANN, King GEORGE I, and King GEORGE II, <hi>Uſurpers,</hi> and all their Actions <hi>void;</hi> ſo He muſt declare of Conſequence, that all the <hi>Patents</hi> whereby they have created ſo many Barons, Viſcounts, Earls, Marquiſes, Dukes, <hi>&amp;c</hi> both of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and GREAT-BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN, ever ſince the <hi>Revolution,</hi> to be null and void; as alſo all their Charters to Companies and Corporations, all their <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> Proclamations, Treaties, Orders and Commiſſions, with all the Executions of them: And ſo the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> Kingdoms of ENGLAND and SCOTLAND null, and every Thing conſequent thereon; as alſo Numbers of Corporations, the <hi>Bank</hi> of ENGLAND, the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>South-Sea</hi> Companies and <hi>Others,</hi> and all their Eſtates and Stocks belonging to Him and ſeized by Him: And what wou'd become of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of Multitudes who have receiv'd and acted on any Powers from thoſe he calls <hi>Uſurpers,</hi> we muſt leave his <hi>Popiſh Judges</hi> to determine: Or, if He ſhould reckon all who have ſworn Allegiance to any of thoſe Princes to be

               <hi>Rebels,</hi> He might declare the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of almoſt all the <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> thoroughout the Kingdoms with all their Rights of Praeſentations forfeited, and He would have no need of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to fill his Coffers, nor <hi>Plea</hi> to fill the Eccleſiaſtical Livings.</p>
            <p n="12">12. All the <hi>Biſhops</hi> both in ENGLAND and IRELAND, made by thoſe He calls <hi>Uſurpers,</hi> He wou'd declare to be no Biſhops; but Schiſmaticks and Intruders, and all their Elections, Conſecrations, Orders, and Ordinations of others, void, and all derived from them; or by his Conſtruction of their Canons, which is but the ſame the Epiſcopal Nonjurors gave of the <hi>ſecond Canon,</hi> for diſowning his only haereditary and lawful Authority, <hi>ipſo Facto</hi> Excommunicate; and ſo their ſacred Character, Office, Power and every Kind of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge intirely null, if not as Intruders accountable for all their received Revenues; but ſet in their Places others after his own Heart, unleſs in Violation of all their ſolemn free and repeated <hi>Oaths,</hi> they turn and receive new Orders from his <hi>Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:</hi> And how few wou'd turn is immaterial; for He wou'd have enough of others to ſupply their Places, and in the mean while order their Revenues and Arrears to his own moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Clergy.</p>
            <p n="13">13. It ſeems probable alſo, that the inſupportable Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party thro' the Nation would make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny riſe in Inſurrections or form Conſpiracies; which wou'd be rather provoked, eſpecially in different Parts and different Times, as has been the Device of other <hi>Romiſh</hi> Princes, for a better Occaſion to cut off the chief and moſt zealous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the <hi>Reform'd</hi> Religion, 'till they were wholly deſtroyed or ſubdued: Or if his <hi>popiſh</hi> Prieſts or Politicians ſhould think it beſt or ſafeſt, or the ſhorteſt Way, to fire the Cities of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Briſtol,</hi> and others, or commit a <hi>general Maſſacre,</hi> as have been in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> on the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party; He would have ſufficient Power by his <hi>popiſh Arms;</hi> yea, 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wou'd think, his Religion, Conſcience, Intereſt, eternal Salvation, and temporal Safety, wou'd conſpire to oblige Him: He would alſo get their remaining <hi>Eſtates</hi> into the Bargain; and as He has learnt in <hi>France,</hi> order their <hi>Children</hi> to <hi>popiſh</hi> Prieſts or Nurſeries; yea, for this End, the ancient <hi>Monaſtry</hi> and <hi>Abby-Lands</hi> wou'd no doubt be taken away from their

            <p n="1">1. Great Numbers in the Nation believing Him to be the real Son of King JAMES II; and the Univerſities and Pulpits both in ENGLAND and SCOTLAND, from the Reſtoration of King CHARLES II in 1660 to the Revolution in 1688, being continually filled with the ſlaviſh and deluſive Cry of <hi>abſolute Hereditary Right, paſſive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance:</hi> Whereby theſe pernicious Doctrines were riveted in the Minds of Multitudes, that nothing but the cruel Perſecution of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and Ruin of their Religion in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Realm of <hi>France</hi> between 1680 and 1688 in Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt ſolemn Promiſes, after all they had done to eſtabliſh their <hi>popiſh King</hi> upon the Throne—and the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Proſpect of the like Deſtruction of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the BRITISH EMPIRE, cou'd open their Eyes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for the Revolution: Nor cou'd even theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Proſpects, nor the cleareſt Arguments, open the Eyes of many; tho' the pretended <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> is a meer Deluſion; they deriving from a <hi>junior Daughter</hi> of the Royal Family, whoſe Son <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> was in 1306 exalted

to the Throne of SCOTLAND for the Good of the Nation, in the ſame Manner as more lately King WILLIAM and Queen MARY, Queen ANN and King GEORGE I.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In IRELAND the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are much more numerous than the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> we know are almoſt univerſally inclined to Him: In ENGLAND before King WILLIAM died, when the Parliament came to ſettle the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Crown on the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Houſe of HANOVER in the Beginning of 1701; King JAMES II'S Party is ſaid to be ſo great in the then <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> that the Vote came to a <hi>Tie,</hi> and was then happily decided for the <hi>proteſtant Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> by the <hi>Speaker only,</hi> and even a Gentleman who was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Chair by the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party: And ſo great was his Intereſt in SCOTLAND, that as far as I find, the <hi>Parliament</hi> There were ever hindred from agreeing to the <hi>Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> 'till the Time of the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> Kingdoms in 1706.</p>

               </note> who zealouſly ſtood up for the <hi>Revolution</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion:</hi> The Diſſaffection of the People to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of HANOVER grew more and more, and was plainly promoted by the <hi>Tory Miniſtry,</hi> who broke the grand Alliance, vaſtly increas'd the Power of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> yeilded it the <hi>Spaniſh Monarchy,</hi> pav'd the Way for the <hi>Pretender,</hi> and began to quarrel with the <hi>Houſe</hi> of HANOVER; when juſt before they had brought their Schemes to bear, the ALMIGHTY ſuddenly remov'd the QUEEN by Death, and daſh'd their Projects headlong.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the ELECTOR of HANOVER came to the Throne, the general Diſaffection ſoon appeared, both among the People, Clergy and other Gentry, and even in one of the Univerſities: Some of the late <hi>Tory Miniſtry</hi> fled to <hi>France;</hi> and ſome others rais'd a <hi>Rebellion</hi> in SCOTLAND, which cou'd not be ſuppreſſed 'till the Arrival of <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Yea ſo great was the Prejudice, that for the moſt Part of the Reign of King GEORGE I, tho' one of the beſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Conſpiracies were almoſt continually formed againſt Him, and the <hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> judg'd it needful for the Safety of the <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion,</hi> to keep up an Army of about <hi>Twenty

Thouſand</hi> in GREAT BRITAIN, beſides <hi>Ten Thouſand Seamen</hi> to mann the Navy, and <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> in IRELAND.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Ever ſince the ELECTOR of HANOVER came to the Crown, there have been great Numbers of plainly <hi>Jacobite</hi> News-papers and hiſtorical and political Books and Pamphlets continually publiſhed, diſperſed thro' and poiſoning the Nation; writing juſt as the <hi>Jacobites, Papiſts</hi> and <hi>French Court</hi> wou'd have 'em;—under popular and plauſible Colours, traducing the Miniſtry, vilifying all their Adminiſtrations, reviling the beſt and greateſt Friends of the <hi>Hanover Succeſſion,</hi> rendring the very Name of <hi>Hanover</hi> odious, and increaſing the Diſaffection of the People to that illuſtrious <hi>Houſe</hi> to a very dangerous Degree &amp; Extent; 'till it's Enemies apprehended the Nation ready to deſert it, or grown indifferent to it: While the <hi>Papiſts</hi> increaſed in LONDON and WESTMIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER, were repreſented as having loſt their perſecuting Spirit and Principles, and being become a harmleſs People to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants:</hi> And then the <hi>French King</hi> ſends to <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>Young Pretender:</hi> And preparing <hi>Sixteen Thouſand</hi> Troops, with vaſt Quantities of Arms,  in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1743, 4, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>ten Days</hi> before he declares War againſt us, ſuddenly ſends them forth to introduce Him into the Kingdom; tho' a Storm from Heaven, as we obſerved before, delivers us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To lull the honeſt Part of the Nation into a deep Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the great and moſt dangerous Artifice of our unwearied Enemies; the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> both Writers and others as uſual, laugh at the Mention of a deſign'd Invaſion, treat it as a meer Chimera, as if there were no ſuch Thing intended, but only a Feint to frighten us: And upon their happy Defeat, we ſeem to grow ſo ſecure again; as it is ſaid in the publick Prints, that of but <hi>Twelve Thouſand</hi> Troops in the Kingdom, <hi>Half</hi> are ſent over in the <hi>Spring</hi> of 1745 to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and but <hi>Six Thouſand</hi> left to defend the Throne.</p>

For</p>
            <p n="8">8. All this while, the Rebels grow, in <hi>one Week</hi> more, <hi>two Thouſand</hi> ſtrong: <hi>Auguſt</hi> 29 they march for <hi>Perth,</hi> and <hi>Sept.</hi> 4 without Oppoſition ſeize the City, where <hi>Maſs</hi> is publickly ſaid, moſt of the Army aſſiſting, many <hi>Scottiſh Lords</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> join them, and by <hi>Sept.</hi> 6 increaſe to <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>ſeven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi> Having the greater Part of the <hi>North</hi> of SCOTLAND under their Power, they on <hi>Sept.</hi> 13 paſs the <hi>Forth</hi> the River dividing between the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> and march for EDIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BURGH: <hi>Sept.</hi> 17 without Oppoſition, enter that Capital City, and proclaim the <hi>Pretender</hi> King: By <hi>Sept.</hi> 21, increaſe to <hi>Eight Thouſand,</hi> and before Break of Day <hi>Five Thouſand</hi> of them fall on his Majeſty's Army, of near <hi>Three Thouſand</hi> at <hi>Tranent</hi> about <hi>ſeven Miles</hi> from EDINBURGH, cut them to Pieces with a great Deſtruction, kill the valiant Col. <hi>Gardner</hi> with other Officers, threaten to march to LONDON, and ſpread a general Terror thro' the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Now indeed ſeems a Seaſon of diſmal Danger. For tho' the KING return'd to LONDON on the <hi>laſt</hi> of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> yet the moſt of our Troops with the brave DUKE of CUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERLAND their General, are yet over in <hi>Flanders,</hi> at a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Sea; <hi>Tournay, Ghent, Bruges, Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Nieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> taken and poſſeſſed by the <hi>French,</hi> who having an Army of <hi>One Hundred Thouſand,</hi> being more than double to <hi>His,</hi> lay between the DUKE and the <hi>Shoar:</hi> And as the Rebels might now get to LONDON long before the DUKE cou'd come with His Troops to ſave us; the Faces of the tho'tful People There are turn'd to Paleneſs: And 'tis apprehended that if this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing

Army, as they threaten, ſhou'd in this Time of general Conſternation march ſtrait to <hi>that Metropolis,</hi> great Numbers of Papiſts and others would readily join them; and the more they increaſe, the more wou'd others join them too; the very Rumour of their increaſing and triumphantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, which their ſubtil Friends wou'd by Speech and Printing magnify, wou'd encourage many, and all Oppoſition fly before them 'till they enter the <hi>City:</hi> Or to prevent Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition There, great Numbers of popiſh Tenants might in the Night Time ſet the <hi>City</hi> a Fire in a Hundred Places, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Inhabitants in ſaving their Families, Goods and Houſes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This is alſo in a hazardous Seaſon on this Account; That by the unhappy Conduct of the King of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> even after the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> had by the Treaty of <hi>Breſlaw</hi> yielded Him the <hi>Lower Sileſia,</hi> yet invading her other Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; whereby ſhe was hindered from ſupplying her Army in the <hi>Auſtrian Netherlands,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> with their vaſtly ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Armies had carried almoſt all <hi>Flanders</hi> before them, taken the Barrier Cities between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and were juſt at the <hi>Dutch</hi> Frontiers: Whereby we loſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Barrier Treaty, (which our Enemies well knew) our Allies the <hi>Dutch</hi> were in ſo dangerous a Caſe, that they could not tell how to leſſen their Troops to help us; nor <hi>they</hi> nor the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> to ſpare the DUKE and <hi>ours,</hi> to leave their Countries open to reſiſtleſs Deſolations.</p>
            <p n="11">11. This is alſo a Time of Year, when the Wind in the <hi>Britiſh Channel</hi> is wont to blow from the <hi>weſterly</hi> Quarter: Which threatens to hinder the the DUKE and his Troops, as well as the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other of our Friends in <hi>Europe,</hi> their Countries all lying to the Eaſtward, from coming over to help us in this Emergency; but at the ſame Time wou'd give a fair Opportunity for our <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Enemies to pour in upon us, who were alſo prepared and watching for it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the <hi>Young Pretender</hi> rules as if he were arbitrary Regent of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kingdoms, emits his many plauſible and enchanting Declarations, diſperſes them in Print abroad; ſends his tyrannical Orders to all the Places round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,

not to be refus'd on Pain of military Execution; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his Army with Cloathing, Food, Horſe, and Money, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it to <hi>Ten Thouſand;</hi> plunders and waſtes the Countrey all around Him; receives Recruits of Officers, Ammunition, Money and Arms from <hi>France;</hi> and divers other <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords and Gentlemen join Him. About <hi>November</hi> 3, with an Army of <hi>Nine Thouſand,</hi> He leaves <hi>that Capital,</hi> marches thro' the <hi>weſterly</hi> Road to ENGLAND: Saturday Night <hi>Nov.</hi> 9. arrives at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> her northermoſt City, Lord's Day Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning orders it to yeild, and <hi>Nov.</hi> 15 takes Poſſeſſion. Thence He marches unmoleſted thro' the Counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> as alſo <hi>Lancaſhire, Cheſhire</hi> and into <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> 'till <hi>December</hi> 4, when with <hi>ſix Lords</hi> and above <hi>ſeven Thauſand Soldiers</hi> He enters <hi>Derby</hi> the chief Town of the Shire and in the Heart of ENGLAND, but about a <hi>Hundred Miles</hi> North of LONDON. For tho' Marſhal <hi>Wade</hi> was at the Head of near <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> on the <hi>eaſterly</hi> Side of the Kingdom; yet the Roads acroſs are ſo mountainous, miry and fill'd with Snow, that he could not hinder this rapid Courſe of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on the <hi>weſterly</hi> Side: And in the mean while, there are other Rebels left in SCOTLAND, others riſing in the <hi>North</hi> thereof, divers Ships from <hi>France</hi> arriving and adding Succours to them, and others ready and expected.</p>
            <p>And thus far the Danger ſeems to grow: And yet that which adds to all, alas, is the prodigious <hi>Luxury, Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Prophaneſs</hi> of the Nation, which ſeem to render us ripe for entire Deſtruction; yea, as we are told in the publick Prints, the amazing and provoking <hi>Infidelity, Impenitence</hi> and <hi>Sottiſhneſs</hi> of the Bulk of the People, even while on the very Brink of univerſal Ruin. How cou'd we conceive any other than of the Holy GOD as now looking down upon us with ſuch awful Tho'ts of Reſentment as in Jer. v. 9, 29. <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe</hi> Things, <hi>ſaith the</hi> LORD? <hi>Shall not my Soul be</hi> now <hi>avenged on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi>—</p>
            <p>But tho' we ſeem to be ripe, and the righteous GOD ſeems in Providence to be preparing correſpondent Cauſes for our ſudden Deſolation; yet his Ways are not as our's, nor his Tho'ts as our's, but as far above them as the Heavens above the Earth: And when we come to tremble as a Bird out of

               <hi>Egypt,</hi> and as a Dove out of the Land of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> then our compaſſionate SAVIOUR ſeems to ſay as in Hoſ. xi. 8, 9. <hi>How ſhall I give Thee up</hi> Ephraim? <hi>How ſhall I deliver Thee</hi> Iſrael? <hi>How ſhall I make Thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>How ſhall I ſet Thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>Mine Heart is turned within Me, My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings are kindled together!

It was, even before, remarkable and happy for us, that when the <hi>Young Pretender</hi> was ſailing, unknown to us, from <hi>Breſt</hi> to the <hi>North Weſt</hi> of SCOTLAND in a ſmaller Ship of <hi>ſixteen</hi> Guns, but in Company with a <hi>ſixty-four</hi> Gun Man of War, loaden with Soldiers, Officers, Proviſion, Ammunition, Arms and Money; His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Ship the <hi>Lion</hi> of <hi>fifty-eight</hi> Guns, Capt. <hi>Brett</hi> Commander, ſhou'd on <hi>July</hi> 9, but <hi>four Days</hi> after their leaving <hi>France,</hi> happen undeſign'd, to meet them, and then ſo warmly engage the <hi>Larger</hi> Ship, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Her to proceed the Voyage and oblige Her to return to <hi>Breſt:</hi> Whereby the <hi>young Pretender</hi> was forc'd to go on alone in the <hi>other,</hi> and loſt a vaſt Advantage at the firſt of his Enterprize; there being Arms but for <hi>Five Hundred</hi> Men in the <hi>ſmaller</hi> Ship, but for <hi>Six Thouſand and Five Hundred</hi> in the <hi>Larger;</hi> for want of which he was much retarded; or wou'd have ſupplied his Men as ſoon as they join'd Him, and might have march'd to EDINBURGH and ENGLAND while the Roads were dry, and almoſt as ſoon as we heard of his Arrival.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>French</hi> Court ſeem'd infatuated, when they had <hi>ſix</hi> more Ships of <hi>ſixty,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> of <hi>ſeventy</hi> Guns in <hi>Breſt</hi> at the Time he ſail'd, that they ſhou'd ſend no more Aſſiſtance with Him; and that upon their <hi>ſixty-four</hi> Gun Ship returning, they ſhou'd not ſend ſome others with Supplies immediately:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005857_0025_1027024F4EA442B0"/>
Whereby He might have made a much ſwifter Progreſs. Or the Tydings of our taking <hi>Cape Breton</hi> arriving at <hi>Paris</hi> about the End of the <hi>Month,</hi> the triumphant Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> their intent Application to take <hi>Oſtend</hi> which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to them <hi>Aug.</hi> 12, and the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> being happily choſen <hi>Emperor</hi> on <hi>Sept.</hi> 2, might all under GOD conſpire to take up their Tho'ts and hinder them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When notwithſtanding all—The Pretender's Army had yet ſurprizingly grown and gone on without Oppoſition, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the <hi>chief City</hi> of SCOTLAND, increaſed to <hi>Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> in a few Minutes beat the King's Forces, made them fly, killed many, and ſpread a univerſal Conſternation thro' the Kingdom; when we had no Troops return'd nor the DUKE from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and but <hi>ſix Thouſand</hi> at home to defend our KING and <hi>Capital;</hi> when ſo many in ENGLAND were at that Time doubleſs ready to join them, if they had then fluſh'd with Victory march'd for <hi>London;</hi> and the <hi>young Pretender</hi> had ſeveral zealous able Generals and politick Counſellors; — It ſeems a wonderful Thing to ſee the <hi>Infatuation</hi> upon <hi>them</hi> alſo, in neglecting to improve their Victory and ſuch a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, but returning to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and ſtaying there <hi>ſix Weeks,</hi> as if on purpoſe to afford us Time to prepare againſt them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is ſome Encouragement to us, that on <hi>Sept.</hi> 23, which is but <hi>two Days</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Tranent, three Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> belonging to <hi>His Majeſty's</hi> Foot Guards, with <hi>ſeven Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments</hi> of Foot happily arrive in the <hi>Thames</hi> from <hi>Flanders: Sept.</hi> 26, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> orders ſeveral Battalions of Foot and ſome Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons to march directly for SCOTLAND in the <hi>eaſterly Road</hi> by <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Marſhal <hi>Wade;</hi> and <hi>two Days after,</hi> ſends for more in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſome to join them at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and others to come and defend Him at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon this and the happy Neglect of our Enemies, the <hi>Friends</hi> of our <hi>Proteſtant King</hi> in <hi>England</hi> recover from their Conſternation: Even thoſe who ſeemed to be diſaffected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are now made ſenſible of the ruinous Conſequence of the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s ſucceeding and gaining the ſovereign Power: GOD opens their Eyes, and they clearly ſee nothing elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005857_0026_10270251CE43E2D0"/>
them but horrid Scenes of Deſolation: And 'tis wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſee ſuch a Spirit riſing in the awakened People in every Quarter of <hi>England</hi> in Defence of their <hi>Proteſtant King</hi> and <hi>Country:</hi> The Nobility, Gentry and Populace both in the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Navy,</hi> awakening each other; entring into Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and ſubſcribing great Sums of Money for the preſent Emergency; raiſing warlike Companies; rouſing each other both by Writings, Words and Deeds, to make the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Oppoſition, and the People calling for Arms and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to teach them martial Exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our <hi>Men of War</hi> at Sea under Admiral <hi>Vernon</hi> and <hi>Martin,</hi> yea our <hi>private Veſſels</hi> are ſo moved with a publick Spirit, and ſo exceeding vigilent, active and hardy, even in the moſt cold and dangerous Months of the Year; that tho' the <hi>French,</hi> ſoon ſeeing their Error, get ready in all their <hi>Sea Ports</hi> near their Army, to come to the Supply of the Rebels; yet not many of thoſe Veſſels can find Opportunities to venture out of their Harbours: Several of them with Soldiers, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Proviſion, Ammunition, Arms and Money, are happily met with and taken by us; and but few can arrive to aſſiſt our Enemies.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Contrary to the uſual Courſe of the <hi>Winds</hi> at this Time of the Year from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which would have hindred our martial Friends in coming from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> it is very obſervable, that GOD orders them now to blow from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> even for a <hi>Month</hi> together: As if 'twere on purpoſe to bring the DUKE and <hi>his Forces</hi> over quickly in this Time of Extremity: And they have a ſpeedier Tranſportation from the <hi>Maes</hi> to <hi>England</hi> than was ever known.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is alſo remarkable, That at this very Conjuncture, GOD ſhould raiſe up even of the <hi>Children</hi> of our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> King GEORGE Himſelf, ſo extraordinary a Perſon and Soldier as <hi>Prince</hi> WILLIAM; ſo brave and reſolute, ſo active and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable, ſo engaging and popular, ſo beloved of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and of ſuch wondrous Conduct for a Youth of but <hi>twenty five</hi> Years of Age, and who had ſeen but <hi>two</hi> Campaigns;—to act on this great Occaſion for our Deliverance: That by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Diſappointments at <hi>Sea,</hi> he was diverted from the <hi>Navy</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005857_0027_10270253C9636970"/>
to the <hi>Army:</hi> That in the <hi>firſt</hi> Campaign, which was in 1743, at the Battle of <hi>Dettingen,</hi> wherein He was wounded, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and Valour were tried and proved: That in his <hi>ſecond</hi> in 1745, ſo young a Perſon ſhou'd have the <hi>chief Command</hi> of the allied Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi> when his ſuperiour Genius for martial Affairs appeared ſo illuſtrious, as to gain the Heart and raiſe the Wonder of every Soldier: And thus are his <hi>Britiſh</hi> Troops prepared to come over with <hi>Him</hi> now, and under <hi>Him</hi> to ſpend the laſt Drop of their Blood in defending their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. On <hi>Oct.</hi> 18, <hi>Prince</hi> WILLIAM happily returns from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> On the 25th a <hi>ſecond</hi> Tranſport of his Troops arrives in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and on <hi>Nov.</hi> 4, <hi>ſeven</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more: So that the Rebel Army ſtrangely ſtays in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 'till this <hi>Britiſh Hero</hi> with his valiant Soldiers are come over to fight them. Upon News arriving <hi>Nov.</hi> 25 at <hi>London,</hi> of the Rebels ſubduing <hi>Carliſle</hi> and coming to <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> the DUKE next Day ſets out from St. <hi>James</hi>'s to head his Army marching to meet them. And now while the <hi>young Pretender</hi> is in the Height of his Career and Hopes, arriving at <hi>Derby</hi> in the Heart of ENGLAND on <hi>December</hi> 4, and his triumphant Army bending their Courſe for <hi>London</hi> to ſeize the Throne; on <hi>Dec.</hi> 6, in the Morning, hearing that the DUKE and his Army of <hi>eleven</hi> Battalions of Foot, and <hi>ſix</hi> Regiments of Horſe and Dragoons were arrived at <hi>Litchfield</hi> within <hi>twenty</hi> Miles, on the <hi>Evening before,</hi> a ſudden Pannick ſeizes the Hearts of our Enemies, who had heard of the Bravery of the DUKE and <hi>his Troops</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and well concluded it would rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on this great Occaſion: For if they had fought ſo brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Defence of the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Country, how much more wou'd their Spirits riſe in Defence of <hi>their Own</hi> on the Brink of Deſtruction? And now how joyful to ſee the Rebels flying before Him, the DUKE purſuing as far as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi> and at the End of the Month recovering the City.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Now indeed their Progreſs ſeems to be over; their Forces dwindled and divided, the Remainder an eaſy Conqueſt for the other Generals with the Troops at <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> And as great Preparations are ready at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Ports of <hi>France</hi> to land an Army of <hi>twenty Thouſand</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005857_0028_1027025926DB1908"/>
in the <hi>South</hi> of ENGLAND, the DUKE is recalled with ſome of his Troops to <hi>London,</hi> where he arrives on the 5th of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> Upon which the Rebels rejoin, reſume their Courage, <hi>Dec.</hi> 26 ſeize the City of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> plunder the People, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Goods, and recruit with Money,  <hi>Jan.</hi> 3, march for <hi>Stirling,</hi> on the 8th enter the Gates, increaſe their Numbers to <hi>nine Thouſand</hi> again, receive Supplies from <hi>France,</hi> lay Siege to the Caſtle; and on the 17th at <hi>Falkirk</hi> attack our Army, break our left Wing, and oblige us to burn our Tents and retire to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> But it ſeems remarkable and happy for <hi>us,</hi> that the Rebels don't improve this great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and purſue our broken Troops much diſabled thro' the Wetneſs of our Powder by a Storm of Rain blowing againſt us in the Time of Action, to reſiſt them; but inſtead of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us, return to the Seige of the Caſtle: And this is bravely defended by General <hi>Blakeney</hi> in the moſt critical Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; it being a Fortreſs of vaſt Importance, as it is the <hi>Key</hi> or Guard to the Land-Paſſage between the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Parts of SCOTLAND.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Upon this, the DUKE inſpir'd with a glorious Ardour, even in the midſt of Winter, to go forth again, to ride in the moſt miry Roads by Day and Night almoſt inceſſantly 'till He comes to the Army; on the 25th in the Morning between <hi>Twelve</hi> and <hi>One</hi> He ſets out from <hi>London,</hi> and travels the eaſterly Road to <hi>Edinburgh, Three Hundred Miles</hi> by the 30th at <hi>Three</hi> in the Morning: Is receiv'd with the greateſt Joy; our Army is wondrouſly animated; and every Thing being ready, He immediately gives Order for marching: The next Morning He ſets out with <hi>fourteen</hi> Battalions, the <hi>Argylſhire</hi> Men, and <hi>two</hi> Regiments of Dragoons, for <hi>Stirling:</hi> Upon his advancing, GOD ſends a ſecond Terror into the Hearts of our Enemies; in Confuſion they immediately brake up the Seige, and fly before Him: About <hi>Two Thouſand</hi> to <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> about <hi>Four Thouſand</hi> to <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Reſt</hi> to their rocky and ſnowy <hi>Mountains: Feb.</hi> 2, His ROYAL HIGHNESS ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at <hi>Sterling,</hi> repairs the Arch of the Bridge; the 4th his Army paſſes over it; and the 6th arrives at <hi>Perth,</hi> lays in Magazines of Bread and Forrage, and reſts <hi>his Foot</hi> after their great Fatigues in ſuch a cold and miry Seaſon.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:005857_0029_1027025AE0363B28"/>12. At this Juncture of Time, viz. <hi>Feb.</hi> 8, it ſeems alſo remarkable; that while the <hi>Dutch</hi> are unable to help us, thro' the ſuperiour Armies of <hi>France</hi> at their Doors, the Proteſtant <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> Son in Law to the KING, with his Troops ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive near <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to help <hi>his Brother</hi> in ſuppreſſing our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: Whereby <hi>Stirling</hi> and <hi>Perth,</hi> thoſe important Paſſes, are fully ſupplied and guarded; and ſo the DUKE has a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Number of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Soldiers to purſue the Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 18 the Rebels enter <hi>Inverneſs:</hi> And there they gather again, with ſome freſh Recruits from <hi>France,</hi> and ſoon take Fort <hi>George</hi> at <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> and Fort <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> But the <hi>laſt</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> the DUKE arrives with his Army at <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> there ſtays for his <hi>Cannon</hi> and other Recruits from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> 'till the bad Weather is over, the Snows are melted, the Roads paſſable, and the Rivers fordable. In the mean while the Rebels are carefully guarded by Land and Sea, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>French</hi> who come to ſupply them are taken, they grow much ſtraitened for Food and Money, and greatly ſuffer for want of Bread for <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Days before the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 15, the DUKE compleats the <hi>Twenty-fifth</hi> Year of his Age; and the <hi>following Day</hi> goes on to the deciſive Battle. And now the Necks of <hi>the Horſe</hi> are cloathed with Thunder, the Glory of their Noſtrils is terrible; they paw in the Valley and rejoice in their Strength, they go on to meet the armed Men; they mock at Fear and are not affrighted, nor turn they back from the Sword; the Quiver rattleth againſt them, the glittering Spear and the Shield; they ſwallow the Ground with Fierceneſs and Rage; they ſay among the Trumpets, Ha, Ha; they ſmell the Battle afar off, the Thunder of the Captains and the Shouting: As GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Former repreſents them in <hi>Job</hi> xxxix,</p>
            <p>And here the <hi>following</hi> among other Particulars ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: — That the DUKE advances toward our Enemies ſooner than they expected — That in the very order of Battle and Way of Attack, <hi>their</hi> able <hi>Generals</hi> appear greatly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the DUKE and <hi>his</hi> to be guided with wondrous Wiſdom — That the Enemy's <hi>Cannon</hi> ſhoot over the Heads of

            <p>But yet in the midſt of all our Joys, it becomes us to bare in mind our Text, as extreamly applicable to us on this Occaſion. For <hi>after all that is come upon us for our evil Deeds and for our great Treſpaſs, ſeeing that Thou our</hi> GOD <hi>haſt puniſhed us leſs than our Iniquities</hi> deſerve, <hi>and haſt given us</hi> ſuch <hi>Deliverance as This; ſhou'd we again break thy Commandments and join in Affinity with the People of theſe Abominations? wouldſt not Thou be angry with us 'till Thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that</hi> there ſhou'd be <hi>no Remnant nor eſcaping?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For muſt we not freely own that the ſame glorious GOD is <hi>our's</hi> in <hi>Covenant</hi> by the moſt open and continual Profeſſions and Engagements? are not many Laws, and every Baptiſm and publick Prayer, moſt evident Acknowledgments of this? Have we not been generally and clearly guilty of Multitudes of <hi>evil Deeds</hi> and <hi>great Treſpaſſes</hi> of every Kind, againſt every Precept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too many now to be numbred? I ſhall only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

mention — Our Infidelity, Formality, Profanation of the Name and Day of GOD; our Contempt of the divine RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER and the Operations of his HOLY SPIRIT on the Souls of Men; our Oppoſition to the gracious Doctrines of his Goſpel, his pure Worſhip, his holy Diſcipline, the lively Practice and Power of Godlineſs, and the active Promoters of them; our Rebelliouſneſs to juſt Authorities; our Pride, Enmities, Murders, Robberies, Impoſitions and Perſecutions; Our Luxury, Profuſeneſs, Impurity and Intemperance; our Avarice and every Species of Oppreſſion and Injuſtice; Falſe-ſwearing, Lying, Slandering, Reviling and Defaming; our Envy, Selfiſhneſs and Coveting the Things of Others.</p>
            <p>Has not our highly diſhonoured and offended GOD, by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Means, and eſpecially the preſent War and late Rebellion, been juſtly bringing on us many grievous Calamities? Such as great Decay of Trade, heavy Debts, Plunders, Barbarities, Captivities, Loſs of Eſtates and Lives, Perplexities of Living, and a vaſt Variety of diſtreſſing Troubles. Muſt we not yet acknowledge, that in them all, <hi>our</hi> GOD has puniſhed us even infinitely leſs than our many and heinous Iniquities deſerved; yea, that in his wondrous Goodneſs, He has by the late glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and deciſive Victory, given us a moſt undeſerved and inexpreſſibly great Deliverance? — A Deliverance including an Infinity of Mercies!</p>
            <p>And now, after all this — ſhall we be ſo monſtrouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, baſe, wicked and perfidious to our GOD and SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, as to break his Commands again, and join in intimate Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the People of thoſe Abominations? Wou'd not this be a moſt aggravating Provocation? And cou'd we in Reaſon expect any other, than that he wou'd be angry with us, 'till He ſhou'd conſume us, ſo that there ſhou'd be no Remnant or eſcaping?</p>
            <p>We might eaſily ſee the <hi>juſt Grounds</hi> of ſuch an Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the moral Excellence and Government of GOD, in Concert with the moral Nature he has given us, our Relation and Obligations to Him; and the moral Ends of his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations among the Sons of Men, and eſpecially his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, covenant and obliged People. But we may yet more
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005857_0035_1027027222D30230"/>
eaſily and clearly ſee our awakening Danger, from his ſignal Conduct to <hi>that peculiar People</hi> refer'd to in the <hi>Text:</hi> Who for many hundred Years were highly favoured by Him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others in the Earth. He in a glorious Manner on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> enter'd into a ſpecial Covenant with them, gave them extraordinary Prophets and Revelations, wrought innumerable Wonders for them, and raiſed them, in the Days of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> to great Power and Glory above all other Nations round about them. But they greatly ſinned, and He grievouſly chaſtized; they cried for Mercy, and he delivered; they grew ungrateful, and ſinned on —; 'till the Wrath of the LORD aroſe and there was no Remedy; He wou'd deliver them no more; but forbid his Prophets even to pray for them, and proceeded to fulfill his Threatnings to their Deſtruction and Diſperſion, as warning Monuments, among the Nations; as the World has admir'd to ſee, for near <hi>ſeventeen hundred Years,</hi> to the preſent Day. And if we follow them in their Ingratitude and provoking Sins, as I fear we ſhall, we muſt expect to follow them in their Deſolations.</p>
            <p>Yea, by all that to me appears both in the divine <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> a more <hi>dreadful Time</hi> ſeems coming on the Nations than they have ever known, and by their growing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and other Provocations thence deriving, if they don't ſoon repent, they ſeem to haſten in their Ripeneſs for it. But I forbear to open the Scripture-Scene, leaſt it too much damp the Joy of the preſent Day.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I wou'd rather revive the Pious with the Proſpect, that whenever it comes it will be <hi>ſhort,</hi> but <hi>Three Years and an Half</hi> — And then a <hi>moſt glorious Time</hi> comes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: For then the loud Voice in Heaven will ſound; <q>Now is come Salvation and Strength, and the Kingdom of our GOD, and the Power of his CHRIST:</q> Then the Hour of his final Judgment on the papal Empire comes on: The <hi>Angel</hi> comes down from Heaven having great Power, and the Earth lightened with his Glory, and will cry mightily with a ſtrong Voice; <q>
                  <hi>Babylon</hi> the great is fallen is fallen — Rejoice over her thou Heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets; for GOD hath avenged you on her — and in her was found the Blood of Prophets and of Saints, and of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005857_0036_10270273C8226D90"/>
all that were ſlain upon the Earth:</q> Then will be heard a great Voice of <hi>much People in Heaven,</hi> ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>Alleluia,</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the LORD our GOD; for true and righteous are his Judgments; for He hath judged the <hi>great Whore,</hi> which did corrupt the Earth with her Fornication, and hath avenged the Blood of his Servants at her Hands;</q> and again they cry, <hi>Alleluia;</hi> and the <hi>Four and twenty Elders</hi> and the <hi>Four living Creatures</hi> fall down and worſhip GOD who ſitteth on the Throne, ſaying, <hi>'Amen, Alleluia:'</hi> And then the <hi>ſeventh Angel</hi> with his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounds; and there are great Voices in Heaven, ſaying, <q>The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our LORD and of his CHRIST, and He ſhall reign for ever and ever.</q>
