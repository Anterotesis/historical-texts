            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ISAIAH IV. 5.</bibl>
               <q>—FOR UPON ALL THE GLORY SHALL BE A DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FENCE.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>FOR the ſupport and comfort of thoſe among the Jews, who might eſcape the judgments predicted in the preceding chapter, the prophet in this fortels the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of happier times, and the flouriſhing ſtate of the true Iſrael of God, under the influence and protection of an illuſtrious perſon here called <hi>the Branch of the Lord.</hi> After the appearance of this divine Branch, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Zion, cleanſed from their pollutions <hi>by the ſpirit of judgment</hi> and adorned with vital holineſs, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in all the bleſſings of evangelical grace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. The favourable preſence of God with them ſhall ſecure to them the continued enjoyment of theſe bleſſings. For his preſence brings protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to all who are thus favoured. So long as he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the temple at Jeruſalem, and his viſible glory
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021353_0003_0FB3193F4632D678"/>
was beheld in the holy of holies, that city bid defiance to all earthly powers. But, after the voice had been heard "LET US DEPART HENCE," its defence was gone, its enemies prevailed againſt it, and <hi>Zion was plowed as a field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In alluſion to the pillar of cloud and fire, the ancient ſymbol of God's preſence with Iſrael in the wilderneſs, it is promiſed, with reference to the people of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, <hi>The Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Sion, and upon her aſſemblies a cloud and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night:</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that they ſhall be as certainly under the divine care and guardianſhip, as were God's people of old, while favoured with theſe extraordinary ſigns of his gracious preſence, and ſhall as fully experience the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects of his Almighty protection. <hi>For upon all the glory ſhall be a defence:</hi> Providence will watch for the ſafety of the church, and "the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt it."</p>
            <p>The prophecy evidently refers to the ſtate of the chriſtian church under the reign of the Meſſiah. As a part of this church, we may be allowed, perhaps, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the words of the text as applicable to ourſelves; and be led by them, on the preſent occaſion, into a view of thoſe ſignal and diſtinguiſhing advantages which are the glory of this land; and then, to ſome remarks on the means of defence as proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to crown theſe advantages and complete the glory.</p>
            <p>The latter idea is, indeed, the principal and ultimate deſign of the diſcourſe. This, however, will be aided by conſidering the worth of thoſe bleſſings and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021353_0004_0FB31943ADE3A670"/>
which we have to defend. All theſe are ſo many motives to the means of defence. And ſurely no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon earth can have more, or weightier. That their influence may be felt, this Aſſembly will allow me to ſet before them ſome of our natural, civil, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious advantages.</p>
            <p>Had it been left to our own election, on what part of the globe we would have wiſhed to ſpend the days of our pilgrimage here below, we could not, perhaps, have choſen better for ourſelves, than Providence hath choſen for us. "The lines are fallen to us in a pleaſant place, and we have a goodly heritage." Falling, as our country does, within the temperate climes, its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are ſubjected to the extremes of neither heat, nor cold: Both of which are deemed unfriendly to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frame, prejudicial not only to the body, but to the mind too, as tending to debilitate, or deaden its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and limit its exertions. Philoſophers tell us, that it is in the temperate climates only, other circumſtances being equal, that we are to expect the greateſt diſplay of human abilities. Upon this principle, ſhould we not feel grateful to HIM who "ſeparateth the ſons of Adam, and divideth to the nations their inheritance," for caſting our lot on a portion of the earth the moſt favourable to our growth and improvement in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dignifies and adorns the character of man?</p>
            <p>It is not pretended that the ſoil which we cultivate, equals, in richneſs and fertility, that of ſome other countries. In thoſe regions of the earth which lie more expoſed to the ſun, there is a greater variety of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and a more luxuriant and abundant growth. Theſe advantages, however, are often more than ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced by poiſonous productions, noxious animals, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021353_0005_0FB31944E0DE69D8"/>
a putrid air, breeding all kinds of diſeaſe; and by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, hurricanes, earthquakes, and ſuch violent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the elements as are frequently fatal to the wretched inhabitants. Exempt from theſe fatalities, our own country is rich in whatever contributes to the ſupport and ſolid enjoyment of life. The earth ſo far repays the labour of the huſbandman, that the horrors of famine, often experienced in other parts of the world, have never been known here.</p>
            <p>And it is a ſignal advantage in our ſituation, that the cultivators of the ſoil are alſo its proprietors. In the old countries the common people are in general tenants, having no other right or intereſt in the lands which they improve, but leaſes from great proprietors, upon whom they are ſo abjectly dependent, that they are often conſidered and treated as nearly upon a par with the other animals belonging to the ſoil. How incomparably more eligible is the condition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty of this country? In theſe northern States eſpecially, the lands are divided with a degree of equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a happy mediocrity generally prevails. The body of the people is compoſed of a ſubſtantial yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry, who cultivate their own freeholds, and feel no other dependence but upon Providence and their own induſtry.</p>
            <p>It is a fact known and acknowledged, that in no other part of the world, the generality of the people are ſo independent, or poſſeſs ſo large a ſhare of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of life. The facility with which the means of a comfortable ſubſiſtence are obtained, is the main cauſe of that rapid increaſe of population which here exceeds any thing, of which any other country can boaſt. From a few emigrants and ſcattered planters,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021353_0006_0FB319465F00D420"/>
in a little more than a century and an half, we are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied into millions. And this increaſe is likely to continue through the courſe of many future generations, until the immenſe wilderneſs on our back ſhall be turned into a fruitful field.</p>
            <p>The progreſs of cultivation and improvement muſt be greatly accelerated by the mild, gentle and free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments which are here eſtabliſhed. In this reſpect, theſe States are "the glory of all lands," and privileged above every other nation. As for liberty, it is a ſtranger hardly known to the reſt of mankind. In two quarters of the globe the ſound thereof is not heard, nor its likeneſs ſeen. If you range through the great empires of Aſia, and among all the millions that people Africa, you will hardly find an individual into whoſe mind the idea of a rational, civil freedom has ever entered. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope alone is the enlightened quarter of the world. But even in Europe deſpotiſm is almoſt univerſal. The governments of France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy are in general abſolute monarchies. Among theſe, indeed, a few republicks are interſperſed: But the moſt of theſe republicks partake of the ariſtocratick form. Venice the moſt ancient of them, and once the moſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, is a proper ariſtocracy, the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being wholly in the hands of the nobles, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the voice, the election, or the controul of the people. In a limited monarchy Britain boaſts of freedom; but, conſidering how far ſhe has deviated from the principles and ſpirit of her conſtitution—the manner in which her Houſe of Commons is elected, and the influence of the Crown in thoſe elections, her freedom ſeems but little more than a boaſt—a ſhadow without the ſubſtance. Nor is the government of the United Netherlands thought to be much better, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021353_0007_0FB31947D99E5598"/>
the weight of the ariſtocratick influence and the powers of an hereditary Stadtholder.—In ſhort, Liberty, baniſhed from the other quarters of the globe, has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn to the American ſhores. In theſe States ſhe has found an aſylum, and ſeems to be fixing her reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Her ſpirit breathes in, and animates the ſeveral branches of our political conſtitutions; and her features are ſtrongly impreſſed on the reſpective forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which have been here conſtructed. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves are made the guardians of their own rights; and from them all power originates. Rulers exiſt not but by their ſuffrages; and the greateſt of them are but ſervants to the publick, and are liable to be diſmiſſed from that ſervice whenever they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe their maſters. Created by the people, ſuch is their ſituation, they are made to feel their dependence upon their creators.</p>
            <p>We have no accounts of any republicks, whether an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern, in which ſuch principles of equal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty prevail. In this reſpect our glory outſhines that of the whole world beſides.</p>
            <p>I mean not, however, that our political conſtitutions are perfect. It would be next to a miracle, if in a ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to avoid impending danger from one extreme, we did not expoſe ourſelves to hazard on the oppoſite. Defects there certainly are in the modes of government adopted by theſe States—principally reſulting, in the opinion of the wiſe, from the exceſs of their popularity.</p>
            <p>But do we not hope, ere long, to ſee theſe defects happily ſupplied and remedied by that admirable form of federal government which is now rearing over the whole union? May God Almighty aid the exertions of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021353_0008_0FB3194967E1DE90"/>
true patriots in raiſing the remaining Pillars of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Structure! And when completed, may his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo ſmile upon the inſtitution, as to cauſe it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the moſt ſanguine expectations of its illuſtrious fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers! May it prove an effectual ſhelter from popular heats and commotions on the one part, and from foreign tempeſts and invaſions on the other!</p>
            <p>To the latter, indeed, our ſituation does not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately expoſe us. It muſt be reckoned among the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of theſe States, that they lie not in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of any formidable power. A thouſand leagues of ocean rolling between us and the wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling powers of Europe, leſſens the danger of our being involved in their quarrels.</p>
            <p>But, as another circumſtance reflecting a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glory upon our country, we may conſider the means of education which are here enjoyed, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we are under for puſhing our improvements in every branch of uſeful knowledge, and in all thoſe arts which embelliſh ſociety, and give to man his principal preeminence above the beaſts that periſh. From the beaſts, at his birth, he is no otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed but by a capacity for theſe improvements: Which yet he will not make, unleſs he be furniſhed with the means of education. If his hard lot be caſt in the regions of darkneſs, where he has no helps or advantages for culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating his reaſon, and meliorating and governing his paſſions; if he be nouriſhed in the dens of uncivil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized men—among ſavages and barbarians, he proves a barbarian himſelf, wild and intractable, and but little ſuperiour to the irrational animals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:021353_0009_0FB3194AD14DEE80"/>
It is a melancholy reflection, that this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belongs to ſo many tribes and nations of the poſterity of Adam. Was it owing to his apoſtacy, that his children who inhabit the regions of Africa, from the tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> to the <hi>Cape of Good-Hope,</hi> who form the clans and hords which range the immenſe tracts on the north of Europe, and north-weſt of Aſia; and who compoſe the tribes of Indians that are ſcattered in America, from the north of Canada to the ſtraits of Magellan?—Was it owing to the fall of our common anceſtor, that theſe his deſcendants ſuffer ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation of their nature, and are ſunk in deplorable, brutiſh ignorance and barbariſm?—Whatever may have been the original, meritorious or judicial; yet certainly the immediate cauſe is their neglect of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of all attempts towards mental improvement.</p>
            <p>The main difference in the characters of different nations reſults from the neglect or the improvement of thoſe powers of reaſon which their Creator has given them. In proportion as any people have cultivated arts and knowledge, they have riſen to diſtinction and eminence. The never fading luſtre of the Grecian and Roman name—the figure which they make in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of mankind—and the unceaſing eclat and renown with which they are tranſmitted from one generation to another—are all ultimately derived from the aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſucceſs with which they laboured in accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intellectual treaſures—in improving their own minds—in poliſhing ſociety—and civilizing the rude and barbarous nations around them. To thoſe learned ancients every ſucceeding age, and even the preſent, is indebted for many of the firſt rudiments of knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:021353_0010_0FB3194E7B0B0168"/>
In the convulſions and revolutions which attended the decline and fall of that immenſe fabrick, the Roman empire; the progreſs of ſcience, and of the arts of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation was not only at a ſtand; but many of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements which had been already made, were loſt. Nor did they revive again, until towards the cloſe of the fifteenth and beginning of the ſixteenth century of the Chriſtian era. At this period, many different cauſes conſpired for delivering the underſtandings of men from the bondage of ignorance—ſuch as the invention of the art of printing—the improvements in navigation—the extenſion of commerce—the breaking forth of a ſpirit of induſtry, enterpriſe and inquiry; and above all, the reformation from popery which emancipated the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind from the ſhackles of ſuperſtition, and gave ſcope to its various abilities.</p>
            <p>From that day to this, knowledge has been rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſing; new diſcoveries, new arts and new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements have been conſtantly adding to former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, until the learning of the preſent age as far exceeds that of the ancients, as their's did that of the rude ages which preceded them.</p>
            <p>When our anceſtors removed into this new world, they brought the learning of the old along with them; and upon their arrival here, their firſt care was, to plant it in this new ſoil. They founded colleges and ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of learning, and formed excellent regulations for the ſupport of publick ſchools, and a learned, pious clergy in all their different plantations. In conſequence of their early care and great exertions for the education of youth and training them up in the various branches of uſeful knowledge, the growth of the arts and ſcienceſ
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021353_0011_0FB31951DC6151E0"/>
has, from the beginning, kept pace with our other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements. Knowledge is generally diffuſed, and like our property and our government, is ſhared among the people at large. And though it ſhould not be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in new diſcoveries, and in the number of rare original geniuſſes, we have exceeded every other nation; yet, it is a truth which foreigners will not deny, that the body of the common people in New-England, at leaſt, are the moſt enlightened of any other now upon the globe. In a freedom from many ridiculous preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, whims and cuſtoms, the relicks of gothic bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, or of popiſh ſuperſtition, retained and handed down from age to age among the common people of Europe—in a freedom from theſe, and for a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, good ſenſe, and a ſound, enlarged underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the people here are diſtinguiſhed from, and riſe ſuperiour to, any other people of their rank in the known world.</p>
            <p>This is eſpecially true with reſpect to religious knowledge, and the advantages we are under for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the glorious privileges of the goſpel. Though it be more than ſeventeen hundred years ſince this religion was introduced and publiſhed to the world, ſtill the knowledge of it is far from being univerſal. A large proportion of the human tace are pagans to this day: The Jews perſiſt in adhering to the law of Moſes: Many of the eaſtern nations are the diſciples of Mahomet; and a great part of Chriſtendom remains under the deluſions of popery. It is in the reformed churches only, that the goſpel ſhines; and in theſe it too generally ſhines through the miſt of creeds and formularies. In the European reformed churches the rights of conſcience are too little regarded: Religious
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021353_0012_0FB31955A131B610"/>
liberty too much reſtrained. The people are rarely allowed to chuſe their own teachers: Their teachers themſelves are entangled and perplexed with human articles of faith and forms of ſubſcription: And their modes of worſhip are frequently encumbered with uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs rites and ceremonies. From all theſe clogs and embarraſſments the churches of New-England are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the freeſt of any in the world; and in their mode of worſhip and method of diſcipline approach the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the ſimplicity of the goſpel and the forms in uſe with the primitive chriſtians.</p>
            <p>We ought never to forget, that for the ſake of enjoying theſe privileges, and tranſmitting them to their children, our anceſtors encountered all the hardſhips and dangers which attended their emigration into this wilderneſs. After repeated efforts, they found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to obtain them in the land of their nativity. More than a century elapſed after the reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proteſtants could be perſuaded to entertain the idea of a religious toleration. The firſt reformers, though they renounced the Pope, yet retained one of the worſt dregs of popery—a ſpirit of intolerance and perſecution towards every one who ventured to diſſent from their creeds, or to profeſs what they deemed hereſy. The contending parties whether papiſts or proteſtants, and the different ſects among each of theſe, however oppoſed in other reſpects, yet, all agreed in this one horrible point, "that it was lawful to extirpate by fire and ſword the enemies of the true religion, and ſuch they reciprocally appeared to be in each other's eyes."</p>
            <p>To them all, and to the age in general, were appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable the words of our Saviour to his diſciples, when
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021353_0013_0FB31956DD0F9728"/>
they would have called for fire from heaven to conſume a village of Samaritans: "Ye know not what ſpirit ye are of: For the ſon of man is not come to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them." The people of theſe States are happy beyond our forefathers, and beyond all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages of the church, in having found out the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this text. It is a moſt important and intereſting diſcovery—a diſcovery of ſomething very eſſential to the chriſtian temper—a diſcovery of the gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and benevolent ſpirit of the goſpel. This is adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into all our reſpective forms of government, which expreſſly provide for the equal protection of all ſects and denominations, while they demean themſelves as good and peaceable ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Such, my reſpected hearers, are the peculiar and diſtinguiſhing advantages which conſtitute the glory of this land. But to crown all theſe advantages and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete our glory, DEFENCE is neceſſary. The value of every bleſſing riſes in proportion to the degree of ſecurity which we have for its continued enjoyment. And however advantageouſly ſituated theſe States may be, to eſcape foreign invaſion; yet, if like the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> we dwell <hi>careleſs, quiet</hi> and <hi>ſecure,</hi> unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for defence; we ſhall invite an evil of which we might otherwiſe have been in no danger: And thoſe advantages and privileges which are our boaſt and our glory, may ſtrongly tempt the ambition of an invader. Nor is it impoſſible but that the power, to which we were once in ſubjection, may ſtill wiſh to recover its loſt dominion, and for years yet to come, watch for an opportunity to effect its purpoſe. Nor are the other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world free from avarice and ambition, and thoſe unruly paſſions and luſts which occaſion wars and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021353_0014_0FB31958525469D0"/>
fightings. And while theſe luſts remain, the earth will be more or leſs, <hi>filled with violence.</hi> Partaking, as we all do, of the ſame depraved principles, we cannot be ſecure from inteſtine commotions, inſurrections and uſurpations. Among ourſelves Catalines have already appeared: Antonies and Caeſars may ere long ſpring up. Either by a foreign, or a home-bred tyrant, our liberties may be wreſted from us; if we do not ſtand prepared to defend them. A people ignorant of the art of war and deſtitute of the qualifications and virtues which adorn the character of ſoldiers, muſt be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant danger of falling under the yoke of bondage.</p>
            <p>Nor would our character as chriſtians, were it free from its preſent defects, and more perfect than we may venture to pretend, prove our ſecurity. For though upon all the glory of Chriſt's church a defence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the text; yet our own exertions are neceſſary in order to our receiving the fulfilment of the promiſe. In this ſenſe moſt of the promiſes in ſcripture, whether refering to things temporal or ſpiritual, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. To his church of old, the ſeed of Jacob, God promiſed the land of Canaan; but, in order to their getting poſſeſſion, they were obliged to fight many a rough battle, and to encounter the dangers and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of many ſucceſſive campaigns. They had alſo a promiſe of protection and defence when in poſſeſſion of this promiſed land; but were never ſo ſenſeleſs, as to expect the benefit of the promiſe without their own endeavours to defend themſelves. Hence, it was their care, in a time of peace, to provide againſt the breaking out of war. Their moſt pious as well as patriotick princes were vigilant in keeping their country in a ſtate of defence, in forming magazines of arms, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021353_0015_0FB3195D4215C488"/>
garriſons and ſtrong holds on their frontiers, and cheriſhing a military ſpirit among their ſubjects—<hi>teaching them the uſe of the bow</hi> and the art of war. In the uſe of theſe means good men of old relied upon providence for its promiſed protection.</p>
            <p>In the ſame way chriſtians are to expect the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe promiſes of defence which are made to the church under the goſpel diſpenſation. And, in this ſenſe, theſe promiſes have been always underſtood. As the religious character of the beſt chriſtians has not preſerved them from the aſſaults of enemies, ſo neither has it been conſidered by them as inconſiſtent with the profeſſion of arms: They have not ſcrupled to graſp the ſword in their own defence.</p>
            <p>No part of the chriſtian church, ſince the apoſtolick age, ſtood higher, perhaps, in the favour of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, than did the firſt ſettlers of this country; nor were more remarkable for relying upon his aid, or more diligent and fervent in ſeeking it. This, however, did not preſerve them from being expoſed to danger, nor was it conſidered by them as precluding the neceſſity of providing for their own defence. They had their trials, their fears and dangers from ſurrounding enemies.</p>
            <p>Great as were the diſtreſſes and horrours of the war in which we, a few years ſince, were engaged, it may yet be doubted, whether while ſuffering them, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in general was ſo dreadful as was that of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors in ſome of their wars with the natives of this land.</p>
            <p>Our fathers were few in number, remotely ſcattered
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021353_0016_0FB3195F15115750"/>
along theſe ſhores. The whole country was a thick wilderneſs, filled with numerous tribes of ſavages. Theſe were enemies in whom human depravity and wickedneſs appeared in all their naked deformity, neither diſguiſed nor reſtrained by the principles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and education, or the maxims of civilized ſociety. They were perfidious, inhuman and cruel beyond what we can eaſily imagine. Indiſcriminate deſtruction was their conſtant mode of war. They knew no diſtinction of ſex or age. Human miſery was their higheſt ſport. On their wretched captives they inflicted every torture which their barbarous invention could contrive Their attack was always a ſurpriſe. The dark foreſts conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their motions: From the thicket they ſuddenly dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the unapprehenſive huſbandman at his labour: They butchered or captivated his diſtracted family, rifled his houſe, and left it in flames. In the dead of night, or at the dawn of day, the vaſt ſilence of the neighbouring wilderneſs was interrupted; and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoop and ſavage yell announced to the ſlumbering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded village a hoſt of theſe monſters of cruelty. Having accompliſhed the deſolation, they retired with ſuch celerity, that purſuers knew not where to find them, until a repetition of the miſchief in ſome diſtant ſettlement gave the information.</p>
            <p>In times like theſe, and while expoſed to ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and fears, among other means of defence, our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, a century and an half ſince, honoured with char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered privileges THE COMPANY OF ARTILLERY, at whoſe requeſt we are now aſſembled. Not mere ſhow and parade, but publick utility was the laudable deſign of this ancient inſtitution. To learn the art of war, to keep alive a martial ſpirit, and diffuſe abroad in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021353_0017_0FB3196129838C58"/>
the country military knowledge, were the purpoſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by this eſtabliſhment. The worthy gentlemen now compoſing it, will ſtill keep them in view; and by their example and influence endeavour, that not only the preſent, but the riſing generation may poſſeſs all thoſe military accompliſhments requiſite to their prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able defenders of their country.</p>
            <p>At this juncture, our youth are under ſpecial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for obtaining theſe accompliſhments, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many among us able to inſtruct them, who have ſeen ſo much actual ſervice—had many years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the field—and whoſe characters are adorned with laurels acquired in the late war. Their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience muſt greatly facilitate the improvements to be wiſhed in the ſtate of our militia; while their recent example cannot fail to inſpire with martial ardour the boſoms of our young men.</p>
            <p>Such a country as this, is well ſuited to produce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued race of heroes. Our militia are naturally hardy, brave and reſolute—not eaſily appalled at the proſpect of difficulties and dangers. And ſhould they be well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined and inſtructed in the art of war, poſſeſſing a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and exactneſs in its exerciſes and manoeuvres;—ſhould they become, in the language of ſcripture, <hi>expert in war—mighty men of valour—fit for the battle;</hi> they will undoubtedly prove the beſt human defence. And if to theſe accompliſhments they add a publick ſpirit, the love of their country, juſt ideas of its rights and privileges, a reverential reſpect for its conſtitution and laws; and have all theſe virtues inſpired and animated by a true ſenſe of religion; they cannot fail to render us formidable to all who may attempt to moleſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021353_0018_0FB31962175FDF18"/>
us. At the ſame time, the regulations and habits of obedience and ſubordination eſſential to a well organized and diſciplined militia muſt, in their natural tendency, ſecure internal tranquility, and prevent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and inſurrections.</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with the weight of this motive alone, our civil fathers will be ever attentive in rendering our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia laws as perfect as poſſible. Nor will the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of our Commander in Chief be wanting in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe laws into effect, and giving them the fulleſt energy. Seated in the eſteem and affection of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he has every advantage for promoting their welfare: His plans for improvement will be received without jealouſy or ſuſpicion, and his orders obeyed without murmuring or reluctance. And that love of his country and zeal for its proſperity, which have aſſigned him ſo diſtinguiſhed a rank among the patriots of the age, will prompt his continued vigilance in providing for the common ſafety.</p>
            <p>It is the intereſt, and ought to be the endeavour of us all, in our reſpective places and ſtations, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and promote, in every ſuitable way, theſe means of defence. A ſenſe of the good land which heaven hath given us, and of the glorious privileges which are here enjoyed, ſhould quicken our citizens at large, to do all in their power, towards rendering the continued en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them as ſecure and permanent as poſſible. In concurrence with this care, and with whatever elſe prudence may dictate for our own preſervation, we may ſeek, and hope to obtain, the protection and defence of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:021353_0019_0FB3196988C72970"/>
I may not put an end to this diſcourſe without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that as chriſtians we all ſuſtain the character of ſoldiers under Chriſt Jeſus the Captain of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and are engaged in a warfare againſt Sin and Satan, the pollutions that are in the world, and our own luſts. Expoſed to the moſt alarming dangers from theſe ſpiritual enemies, we infinitely need the defence of heavenly grace. This is promiſed in the goſpel; but here as well as in what relates to our temporal ſafety, we are to expect the fulfilment of the promiſe only in concurrence with our own exertions in <hi>ſtriving againſt ſin,</hi> and <hi>fighting the good fight of faith.</hi> We are accordingly directed to <hi>put on the whole armour of God,</hi> and become expert in the uſe of our ſpiritual weapons. And in this way are encouraged to hope for victory and triumph, and to be brought off finally <hi>more than conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours through him who hath loved us</hi>—and <hi>given himſelf for us—to whom be glory forever.</hi>
