            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>LETTER I.</head>
               <p>EVERY free government ſhould conſiſt of three parts, viz. I. A BILL OF RIGHTS. II. A CONSTITUTION, And III. LAWS.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The BILL OF RIGHTS ſhould contain the great principles of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>civil liberty.</hi> It ſhould be unalterable by any human power.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The CONSTITUTION is the executive part of the Bill of Rights. It ſhould contain the diviſion and diſtribution of the power of the people.—The modes and forms of making laws, of executing juſtice, and of tranſacting buſineſs: Alſo the limitation of power, as to time and juriſdiction. It ſhould be unalterable by the legiſlature, and ſhould be changed only by a repreſentation of the people, choſen for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. LAWS are the executive part of a conſtitution. They ceaſe to be binding whenever they tranſgreſs the principles of Liberty, as laid down in the Conſtitution and Bill of Rights.</p>
               <p>Let us now apply theſe principles to the Bill of Rights, Conſtitution and Laws of Pennſylvania. But previous to my entering upon this taſk, I beg leave to declare, that I am not led to it by a ſingle party or perſonal prejudice; on the contrary, I honour moſt of the friends of the preſent government as the warmeſt Whigs among us, and I am proud of numbering ſeveral of the gentlemen who were concerned in making, and in attempting to execute the government, among my particular friends.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Bill of Rights has confounded <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>civil</hi> rights in ſuch a manner as to produce endleſs confuſion in ſociety.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Conſtitution in the groſs is exceptionable in the following particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. No regard is paid in it to the ancient habits and cuſtoms of the people of Pennſylvania in the diſtribution of the ſupreme power of the ſtate, nor in the forms of buſineſs, or in the ſtile of the Conſtitution. The ſuddenneſs of the late revolution, the attachment of a large body of the people to the old Conſtitution of the ſtate, and the general principles of human nature made an attention to ancient forms and prejudices a matter of the utmoſt importance to this ſtate in the preſent controverſy with Great-Britain. Of ſo much conſequence did the wiſe Athenians view the force of ancient habits and cuſtoms in their laws and government, that they puniſhed all <hi>ſtrangers</hi> with death who interfered in their politics. They well knew the effects of novelty upon the minds of the people, and that a more fatal ſtab could not be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015589_0003_0F998EC642953588"/>
given to the peace and ſafety of their ſtate than by expoſing its laws and government to frequent or <hi>unneceſſary</hi> innovations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Conſtitution is wholly repugnant to the principles of action in man, and has a direct tendency to check the progreſs of genius and virtue in human nature. It ſuppoſes perfect equality, and an equal diſtribution of property, wiſdom and virtue, among the inhabitants of the ſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It comprehends many things which belong to a Bill of Rights, and to Laws, and which form no part of a Conſtitution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is contrary, in an important article, to the Bill of Rights. By the ſecond article of the Bill of Rights, "no man can be abridged of any <hi>civil</hi> right, who acknowledges the being of a GOD;" but by the Conſtitution, no man can take his ſeat in the Aſſembly, who does not "acknowledge the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament to be given by divine inſpiration."</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is deficient in point of perſpicuity and method. Inſtead of reducing the legiſlative, executive and judicial parts of the conſtitution, with their ſeveral powers and forms of buſineſs, to diſtinct heads, the whole of them are jumbled together in a moſt unſyſtematic manner.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It fixes all theſe imperfections upon the people for ſeven years, by precluding them from the exerciſe of their own power to remove them at any other time, or in any other manner than by a ſeptennial convention, called by a Council of Cenſors.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The laws and proceedings of the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania are in many particulars contrary to the conſtitution. Only one half of the Members took the oath of allegiance, preſcribed in the tenth ſection of the conſtitution. The Speaker of the Houſe iſſued writs for the election of Members of Aſſembly and of Counſellors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this power is lodged, by the 19th ſection of the conſtitution, <hi>only</hi> in the Preſident and Council. Two gentlemen were appointed Members of Congreſs, who held offices under the Congreſs, which is expreſsly forbidden in the 11th ſection of the conſtitution. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution requires further in the 40th ſection, that every military officer ſhould take the oath of allegiance, before he enters upon the execution of his office; but the Aſſembly have diſpenſed with this oath in their Militia Law. The 15th ſection of the conſtitution declares, that no law ſhall be paſſed, unleſs it be previouſly publiſhed for the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the People; but the Aſſembly paſſed all the laws of their late ſeſſion, without giving the People an opportunity of ſeeing them, till they were called upon to obey them. Theſe proceedings of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly lead to one, and perhaps to all the three following concluſions: Firſt, That the Aſſembly have violated the principles of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; ſecondly, that the conſtitution is ſo formed, that it could not be executed by the Aſſembly, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the State; laſtly, that none of their laws are binding, inaſmuch as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſuperior and radical laws of the conſtitution. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are all of a moſt alarming nature. Farewel to Liberty, when the ſacred bulwarks of a conſtitution can be invaded by a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature! And if the conſtitution cannot be executed in all its parts,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015589_0004_0F998EC6E2568ED0"/>
without endangering the ſafety of the State, and if all our late; laws muſt be ſet aſide in a court of juſtice, becauſe they were not aſſented to by the People, previous to their being enacted, is it not high time for the People to unite and form a more effectual, and more practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ſyſtem of government?—</p>
               <p>If ſtrict juſtice ſhould poiſe the ſcale in the trial of tory property, I can eaſily foreſee from the virtue of the People, on which ſide the beam would turn; but it becomes us to reflect, that all trials for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited property muſt be held in courts of <hi>written</hi> law, and the flaws of our conſtitution and laws are ſo wide, that the moſt gigantic Tory criminal might eſcape through them.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="letter">
               <head>LETTER II.</head>
               <p>I SHALL now proceed to ſay a few words upon particular parts of the Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond ſection, "the ſupreme legiſlature is veſted in a '<hi>ſingle</hi>' Houſe of Repreſentatives of the Freemen of the Commonwealth." By this ſection we find, that the ſupreme, abſolute, and uncontrouled power of the whole State is lodged in the hands of <hi>one body</hi> of men. Had it been lodged in the hands of one man, it would have been leſs dangerous to the ſafety and liberties of the community. Abſolute power ſhould never be truſted to man. It has perverted the wiſeſt heads, and corrupted the beſt hearts in the world. I ſhould be afraid to commit my property, liberty and life to a body of angels for one whole year. The Supreme Being alone is qualified to poſſeſs ſupreme power over his creatures. It requires the wiſdom and goodneſs of a Deity to controul, and direct it properly.</p>
               <p>In order to ſhew the extreme danger of truſting all the legiſlative power of a State to a ſingle repreſentation, I ſhall beg leave to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a few ſentences from a letter, written by Mr. JOHN ADAMS, to one of his friends in North-Carolina, who requeſted him to favour him with a plan of government for that State above a twelve-month ago. This illuſtrious Citizen, who is ſecond to no man in America, in an inflexible attachment to the liberties of this country, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican forms of government, writes as follows,</p>
               <p>"I think a people cannot be <hi>long free,</hi> nor <hi>ever</hi> happy, whoſe government is in one Aſſembly. My reaſons for this opinion are as follow,</p>
               <p n="1">1. "A ſingle Aſſembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an individual,—ſubject to fits of humour,—ſtarts of paſſions,<note n="*" place="bottom">A Committee of the Convention, which formed the Conſtitution of Pennſylvania, publiſhed in the Pennſylvania Packet of October 15, 1776, as an apology for one of their Ordinances, that was thought to be arbitrary and unjuſt, that it was paſſed when "the minds of the Convention were agitated, and their paſſions inflamed."</note> flights of enthuſiaſm,—partialities of prejudice, and consequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015589_0005_0F998EC7AA5B71E0"/>
of haſty reſults and abſurd judgments. All theſe errors ought to be corrected, and defects ſupplied by ſome controuling power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. "A ſingle Aſſembly is apt to be avaricious, and in time will not ſcruple to exempt itſelf from burdens, which it will lay, without compunction, upon its conſtituents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. "A ſingle Aſſembly is apt to grow ambitious, and after a time will not heſitate to vote itſelf perpetual. This was one fault of the long parliament, but more remarkably of Holland, whoſe Aſſembly firſt voted themſelves from <hi>annual</hi> to <hi>ſeptennial,</hi> then for <hi>life,</hi> and after a courſe of years, that all vacancies happening by death or otherwiſe, ſhould be filled by <hi>themſelves,</hi> without any application to conſtituents at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. "Becauſe a ſingle Aſſembly poſſeſſed of all the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would make arbitrary laws for their own intereſt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge all controverſies in their own favor."<note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe reaſons are given by our Author for not lodging all power le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative, executive and judicial, in one body of men. This has been done, as will be ſhewn hereafter in the Conſtitution of Pennſylvania: But, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it had been otherwiſe, our Author adds, "ſhall the <hi>whole</hi> power of <hi>legiſlation</hi> reſt in one Aſſembly? Moſt of the foregoing reaſons (one is omitted) apply <hi>equally</hi> to prove, that the whole legiſlative power ought to be more <hi>complex.</hi>"</note>
               </p>
               <p>If any thing could be neceſſary upon this ſubject, after ſuch an authority, I might here add, that Monteſquieu—Harrington—Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton—Addiſon—Price—Bolingbroke, and others, the wiſeſt ſtateſmen, and the greateſt friends to Liberty in the world, have left teſtimonies upon record of the extreme folly and danger of a people's being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a ſingle legiſlature. I ſhall content myſelf with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extract from the laſt of thoſe authors. The ſentiments correſpond exactly with thoſe of our countryman before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>"By ſimple forms of government, I mean ſuch as lodge the whole ſupreme power, abſolutely and without controul, either in a ſingle perſon, or in the principal perſons of the community, or in the whole body of the people. Such governments are governments of arbitrary will, and therefore of all imaginable abſurdities the moſt abſurd. They ſtand in direct oppoſition to the ſole motive of ſubmiſſion to any government whatſoever; for if men quit the State, and renounce the rights of nature, (one of which is, to be ſure, that of being governed by their own will) they do this, that they may not remain expoſed to the arbitrary will of other men, the weakeſt to that of the ſtrongeſt, the few to that of the many. Now, in ſubmitting to any ſingle form of government whatever, they eſtabliſh what they mean to avoid, and for fear of being expoſed to arbitrary will ſometimes, they chooſe to be governed by it always. Theſe governments do not only degenerate into tyranny; they are tyranny in their very inſtitution; and they who ſubmit to them, are ſlaves, not ſubjects, however the ſupreme power may be exerciſed; for tyranny and ſlavery do not ſo properly conſiſt in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015589_0006_0F998EC86F0B7500"/>
the ſtripes that are given and received, as in the power of giving them at pleaſure, and the neceſſity of receiving them, whenever and for whatever they are inflicted."</p>
               <p>I might go on further and ſhew, that all the diſſentions of Athens and Rome, ſo dreadful in their nature, and ſo fetal in their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, originated in ſingle Aſſemblies poſſeſſing all the power of thoſe commonwealths; but this would be the buſineſs of a volume, and not of a ſingle eſſay.—I ſhall therefore paſs on, to anſwer the various arguments that have been uſed in Pennſylvania, in ſupport of a ſingle legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are told, that the perfection of every thing conſiſts in its ſimplicity,—that all mixtures in government are impurities, and that a ſingle legiſlature is perfect, becauſe it is ſimple.—To this I anſwer, that we ſhould diſtinguiſh between ſimplicity in principles, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity in the application of principles to practice. What can be more ſimple than the principles of mechanics, and yet into how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand forms have they been tortured by the ingenuity of man. A few ſimple elementary bodies compoſe all the matter of the univerſe, and yet how infinitely are they combined in the various forms and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which they aſſume in the animal, vegetable, and mineral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. In like manner a few ſimple principles enter into the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of all free governments. Theſe principles are perfect ſecurity for property, liberty and life; but theſe principles admit of extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, when reduced to practice:—Nay more, they require them. A deſpotic government is the moſt ſimple government in the world, but inſtead of affording ſecurity to property, liberty or life, it obliges us to hold them all on the ſimple will of a capricious ſovereign. I maintain therefore, that all governments are ſafe and free in proportion as they are compounded in a certain degree, and on the contrary, that all governments are dangerous and tyrannical in proportion as they approach to ſimplicity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are told by the friends of a ſingle legiſlature, that there can be no danger of their becoming tyrannical, ſince they muſt partake of all the burdens they lay upon their conſtituents. Here we forget the changes that are made upon the head and heart by arbitrary power, and the caſes that are recorded in hiſtory of <hi>annual</hi> Aſſemblies having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſhare with their conſtituents in the burdens which they had impoſed upon them. If every elector in Pennſylvania is capable of being elected an aſſembly-man, then agreeably to the ſixth ſection of the conſtitution, it is poſſible for an Aſſembly to exiſt who do not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a ſingle foot of property in the State, and who can give no other evidence of a common intereſt in, or attachment to, the community than having paid "public taxes," which may mean poor-taxes. Should this be the caſe, (and there is no obſtacle in the conſtitution to prevent it) ſurely it will be in the power of ſuch an Aſſembly to draw from the State the whole of its wealth in a few years, without contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting any thing further towards it than their proportion of the trifling tax neceſſary to ſupport the poor.—But I ſhall ſhew in another place
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015589_0007_0F998EC91A0C1F10"/>
equal dangers from another claſs of men, becoming a majority in the Aſſembly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are told of inſtances of the Houſe of Lords, in England, checking the moſt ſalutary laws, after they had paſſed the Houſe of Commons, as a proof of the inconvenience of a compound legiſlature. I believe the fact to be true, but I deny its application in the preſent controverſy. The Houſe of Lords, in England, poſſeſs privileges and intereſts, which do not belong to the Houſe of Commons. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they derive their power from the crown and not from the people. No wonder therefore they conſult their own intereſts, in preference to thoſe of the People. In the State of Pennſylvania we wiſh for a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, with <hi>no one</hi> excluſive privilege, and we diſclaim every idea of their poſſeſſing the ſmalleſt degree of power, but what is derived from the <hi>annual</hi> ſuffrages of the People, A body thus choſen could have no object in view but the happineſs of their conſtituents. It is remarkable in Connecticut, that the legiſlative council of that State has in no one inſtance made amendments, or put a negative upon the acts of their Aſſembly, in the courſe of above one hundred years, in which both have not appeared to the people in a few months to have been calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to promote their liberty and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are told, that the Congreſs is a ſingle legiſlature, therefore a ſingle legiſlature is to be preferred to a compound one.—The objects of legislation in the Congreſs relate only to peace and war, alliances, trade, the Poſt-Office, and the government of the army and navy. They never touch the liberty, property, nor life of the individuals of any State in their reſolutions, and even in their ordinary ſubjects of legiſlation, they are liable to be checked by <hi>each</hi> of the Thirteen States.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We have been told, that a legiſlative council or governor lays the foundation for ariſtocratical and monarchical power in a community. However ridiculous this objection to a compound legiſlature may appear, I have more than once heard it mentioned by the advocates for a ſingle Aſſembly. Who would believe, that the ſame fountain of pure water ſhould ſend forth, at the ſame time, wholeſome and deadly ſtreams? Are not the Council and Aſſembly both formed alike by the <hi>annual</hi> breath of the people? But I will suppoſe, that a legiſlative Council aſpired after the honors of hereditary titles and power, would they not be <hi>effectually</hi> checked by the Aſſembly?</p>
               <p>I cannot help commending the zeal that appears in my countrymen againſt the power of a King or a Houſe of Lords. I concur with them in all their prejudices againſt hereditary titles, honour and power. Hiſtory is little elſe than a recital of the follies and vices of kings and noblemen, and it is becauſe I dread ſo much from them, that I wiſh to exclude them for ever from Pennſylvania, for notwithſtanding our government has been called a ſimple democracy, I maintain, that a foundation is laid in it for the moſt complete ariſtocracy that ever exiſted in the world.</p>
               <p>In order to prove this aſſertion, I ſhall promiſe two propoſitions, which have never been controverted: Firſt, where there is wealth,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015589_0008_0F998EC9DDB7ECE8"/>
there will be power; and, ſecondly, the rich have always been an over-match for the poor in all conteſts for power.</p>
               <p>Theſe truths being admitted, I deſire to know what can prevent our ſingle repreſentation being filled, in the courſe of a few years, with a majority of rich men? Say not, the people will not chooſe ſuch men to repreſent them. The influence of wealth at elections is irreſiſtible. It has been ſeen and felt in Pennſylvania, and I am obliged in juſtice to my ſubject to ſay, that there are poor men among us as prepared to be influenced, as the rich are prepared to influence them. The fault muſt be laid in both caſes upon human nature. The conſequence of a majority of rich men getting into the legiſlature is plain. Their wealth will adminiſter fuel to the love of arbitrary power that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men. The preſent Aſſembly have furniſhed them with precedents for breaking the Conſtitution. Farewel now to annual elections! Public emergencies will ſanctify the moſt daring meaſures. The clamours of their conſtituents will be ſilenced with offices, bribes or puniſhments. An ariſtocracy will be eſtabliſhed, and Pennſylvania will be inhabited like moſt of the countries in Europe, with only two ſorts of animals, tyrants and ſlaves.</p>
               <p>It has often been ſaid, that there is but one rank of men in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and therefore, that there ſhould be only one repreſentation of them in a government. I agree, that we have no artificial diſtinctions of men into noblemen and commoners among us, but it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that ſuperior degrees of induſtry and capacity, and above all, commerce, have introduced inequality of property among us, and theſe have introduced natural diſtinctions of rank in Pennſylvania, as certain and general as the artificial diſtinctions of men in Europe. This will ever be the caſe while commerce exiſts in this country. The men of middling property and poor men can never be ſafe in a mixed repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation with the men of over-grown property. Their liberties can only be ſecured by having exact bounds preſcribed to their power, in the fundamental principles of the Conſtitution. By a repreſentation of the men of middling fortunes in one houſe, their <hi>whole</hi> ſtrength is collected againſt the influence of wealth. Without ſuch a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> violent efforts of individuals to oppoſe it would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and broken, and would want that ſyſtem, which alone would enable them to check that lust for dominion which is always connected with opulence. The government of Pennſylvania therefore has been called moſt improperly a government for poor men. It carries in every part of it a poiſon to their liberties. It is impoſſible to form a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more ſuited to the nations and intereſts of rich men.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But ſays the advocate for a ſingle legiſlature, if one of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of having a Legiſlative Council ariſes from the Counſellors poſſeſſing more wiſdom than the Aſſembly, why may not the mentors of the Council be thrown into the Aſſembly, in order to inſtruct and enlighten them? If ſound reaſoning always prevailed in popular Aſſemblies, this objection to a Legiſlative Council might have ſome weight. The danger in this caſe would be, that the Counsellors would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015589_0009_0F998ECB41491230"/>
partake of the paſſions and prejudices of the Aſſembly, by taking part in their debates; or, if they did not, that they would be ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in point of numbers, that they would be conſtantly out-voted by the members of the Aſſembly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But would you ſuffer twenty or thirty men in a Legiſlative Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to controul ſeventy or eighty in an Aſſembly? Yes, and that for two reaſons: Firſt, I ſhall ſuppoſe that they will conſiſt of men of the moſt knowledge and experience in the State: Secondly, that their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to wiſdom and integrity will be much ſtronger than the Aſſembly's can be, becauſe fewer men will be anſwerable for unjuſt or improper proceedings at the bar of the public. But I beg pardon of my readers for introducing an anſwer to an objection to a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men controuling the proceedings of a greater. The friends of the preſent Conſtitution of Pennſylvania cannot urge this objection with any force, for in the 47th ſection of the Conſtitution I find twenty-four men called a COUNCIL of CENSORS, inveſted with a ſupreme and <hi>uncontrouled</hi> power to reviſe and to cenſure all the laws and proceedings of not a ſingle Aſſembly, but of all the Aſſemblies that ſhall exiſt for ſeven years, which Aſſemblies may contain the united wiſdom of five hundred and four Aſſembly-men. They are moreover, inveſted with more wiſdom than the Convention that is to be choſen by their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; for this Convention, which is to conſiſt of ſeventy-two men, is to make no <hi>one</hi> alteration in the Conſtitution but what was ſuggeſted to them by the Council of Cenſors. I can eaſily conceive, that two houſes conſiſting of an unequal number of members, both viewing objects through the ſame medium of time and place, may agree in every thing eſſential, and diſagree in matters only of doubtful iſſue to the welfare of the ſtate; but I am ſure, a body of twenty-four men fating in judgment upon the proceedings of a body of men defunct in their public capacity ſeven years before them, cannot fail of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the moſt egregious miſtakes from the obſcurity which time, and their ignorance of a thouſand facts and reaſonings muſt throw upon all their deliberations. But more of the arbitrary power of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors hereafter.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We are told that the ſtate of Pennſylvania has always been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a ſingle legiſlature, and therefore, that part of our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is not an innovation. There is a ſhort way of confuting this aſſertion by pronouncing it without any foundation. The Governor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a negative power upon our laws, and was a diſtinct branch of our legiſlature. It is true, he ſometimes exerciſed his power to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of the people; for he was the ſervant of a King who poſſeſſed an intereſt diſtinct from that of his people, and in ſome caſes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor himſelf poſſeſſed an intereſt incompatible with the rights of the people. God forbid that ever we ſhould ſee a reſurrection of his power in Pennſylvania, but I am obliged to own, that I have known inſtances in which the <hi>whole</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> have thanked him for the interpoſition of his negative and amendments upon the acts of the Aſſembly. Even the Aſſembly themſelves have acknowledged the juſtice of his conduct
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015589_0010_0F998ECBCE8170A0"/>
upon theſe occaſions, by condemning in their cooler hours their own haſty, and ill-digeſted reſolutions.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But why all theſe arguments in favor of checks for the Aſſembly. The Conſtitution (ſays the ſingle legiſlative-man) has provided no leſs than four for them. Firſt, Elections will be annual. Secondly, The doors of the Aſſembly are to be always open. Thirdly, All laws are to be publiſhed for the conſideration and aſſent of the people: And, Fourthly, The Council of Cenſors will puniſh, by their cenſures, all violations of the Conſtitution, and the authors of bad laws. I ſhall examine the efficacy of each of theſe checks ſeparately.</p>
               <p>I hope, for the peace of the ſtate, that we ſhall never ſee a body of men in power more attached to the preſent Conſtitution than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Aſſembly, and if, with all their affection for it, they have broken it in many articles, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that future Aſſemblies will uſe the ſame freedoms with it. They may, if they chuſe, aboliſh annual elections.<note n="‡" place="bottom">The late Convention was choſen for the <hi>ſole</hi> purpoſe of making a government, and was compoſed of honeſt, well-meaning men, and yet, I have good authority to ſay, that ſeveral of them propoſed to their friends forming themſelves into an Aſſembly, to execute the government.</note> They may tell their conſtituents that elections draw off the minds of the people from neceſſary labour; or, if a war ſhould exiſt, they may ſhew the impoſſibility of holding elections when there is a chance of the militia being called into the field to oppoſe a common enemy: Or laſtly, they may fetter elections with oaths in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to exclude nine-tenths of the electors from voting. Such ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems for perpetual power will never want men nor a <hi>society</hi> of men to ſupport them; for the Aſſembly poſſeſſes ſuch a plenitude of power from the influence of the many offices of profit and honour<note n="*" place="bottom">The Preſident is appointed chiefly by the Aſſembly. His ſalary, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſalaries of the Judges, are fixed by the Aſſembly. Delegates in Congreſs, the Lieutenants and Sub-Lieutenants of counties, Pretonotaries, Regiſters of Wills, Money-Signers, &amp;c. &amp;c. are all appointed ſolely by the Aſſembly. Each of theſe officers brings with him the influence of his friends and family-connections. When collected together, they make a little army of placemen.</note> that are in their gift, that they may always promiſe themſelves ſupport from a great part of the ſtate. But I will ſuppoſe that no infringement is ever made upon annual elections. In the courſe of even one year a ſingle Aſſembly may do the moſt irreparable miſchief to a ſtate. Socrates and Barnevelt were both put to death by Aſſemblies that held their powers at the election of the people. The ſame Aſſemblies would have ſhed oceans of tears to have recalled thoſe illuſtrious citizens to life again, in leſs than half a year after they imbrued their hands in their blood.</p>
               <p>I am highly pleaſed with having the doors of our Aſſembly kept conſtantly open; but how can this check the proceedings of the Aſſembly, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> none but a few citizens of the town or county, where
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015589_0011_0F998ECD0C5CC798"/>
the Aſſembly ſits, or a few travelling ſtrangers, can ever attend or watch them?</p>
               <p>I ſhall take no notice of the delays of buſineſs, which muſt ariſe from publiſhing all laws for the conſideration and aſſent of the people; but I beg to be informed <hi>how long</hi> they muſt be publiſhed before they are paſſed? For I take it for granted, that each county has a right to equal degrees of time to conſider of the laws. In what manner are they to be circulated? How are the ſentiments of the people, ſcattered over a county fifty or ſixty miles in extent, to be collected? Whether by ballot, or by voting in a tumultuary manner? Theſe are inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable difficulties in the way of the people at <hi>large</hi> acting as a check upon the Aſſembly. But ſuppoſing an attempt ſhould be made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the ſingle legiſlature in this manner, are we ſure the diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the people would be ſufficient to put a negative upon impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or arbitrary laws? Would not the Aſſembly, from their partiality to their own proceedings, be apt to paſs over the complaints of the people in ſilence? to neglect or refuſe to enter their petitions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances upon their Journals? or to raiſe the hue and cry of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered junto upon them, as "<hi>tories</hi>" or "<hi>apoſtate whigs,</hi>" or "<hi>an ariſtocratic faction?</hi>"</p>
               <p>To talk of the Council of Cenſors, as a check upon the Aſſembly, is to forget that a man or a body of men may deceive, rob, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the public for ſeven years, and then may eſcape the intended efficacy of the cenſures of the Council by death, or by flying into a neighbouring ſtate.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We are informed that a ſingle legiſlature was ſupported in the Convention by Dr. Franklin, and aſſented to by Mr. Rittenhouſe; gentlemen diſtinguiſhed for their uncommon abilities, and deſervedly dear for their virtues to every lover of human nature. The only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, after what has been ſaid, that I ſhall give to this argument, is, that Divine Providence ſeems to have permitted them to <hi>err</hi> upon this ſubject, in order to conſole the world for the very great ſuperiority they both poſſeſs over the reſt of mankind in every thing elſe, except the ſcience of government.</p>
               <p>Thus have I anſwered all the arguments that ever I have heard of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in favour of a ſingle legiſlature, and I hope, ſilenced all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that have been made to a double repreſentation of the people. I might here appeal further to the practice of our courts of law in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of repeated deliberations and diviſions. In a free government, the moſt inconſiderable portion of our liberty and property cannot be taken from us, without the judgment of two or three courts; but, by the Conſtitution of Pennſylvania, the whole of our liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and even our lives, may be taken from us, by the haſty and paſſionate deciſion of a ſingle Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude my obſervations upon this part of the Conſtitution, by ſumming up the advantages of a compound or double legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the utmoſt <hi>freedom</hi> in a compound legiſlature. The
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015589_0012_0F998ECD9A620740"/>
deciſions of two legiſlature bodies cannot fail of coinciding with the wills of a great majority of the community.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>ſafety</hi> in ſuch a government, in as much as each body poſſeſſes a free and independant power, ſo that they mutually check ambition and uſurpation in each other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the greateſt <hi>wiſdom</hi> in ſuch a government. Every act being obliged to undergo the reviſion and amendments of two bodies of men, is neceſſarily ſtrained of every mixture of folly, paſſion, and prejudice.<note n="†" place="bottom">The Militia Law of the Delaware State received twenty-four amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Council after it had bad three readings in the Aſſembly; all of which were adopted at once by the Aſſembly. I grant, the wiſdom of men collected in any way that can be deviſed, cannot make a <hi>perfect</hi> law; but I am ſure a Legiſlative Council would not have overlooked many inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacies in the laws paſſed in the laſt ſeſſion of the preſent Aſſembly of Pennſylvania.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There is the longeſt <hi>duration</hi> of freedom in ſuch a government.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sparta, which poſſeſſed a compound legiſlature, preſerved her liberties above five hundred years.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There is the moſt <hi>order</hi> in ſuch a government. By order, I mean obedience to laws, ſubordination to magiſtrates, civility and decency of behaviour, and the contrary of every thing like mobs and factions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Compound governments are moſt agreeable to <hi>human nature,</hi> inaſmuch as they afford the greateſt ſcope for the expanſion of the powers and virtues of the mind.

               <p>THE powers of government have been very juſtly divided into legiſlative, executive and judicial. Having diſcuſſed the legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power of the government of Pennſylvania, I ſhall proceed now to conſider the executive and judicial.</p>
               <p>It is agreed on all hands that the executive and judicial powers of government ſhould be <hi>wholly independant</hi> of the legiſlative. The authors of the Pennſylvania Conſtitution <hi>ſeem</hi> to have given their ſanction to this opinion, by ſeparating thoſe powers from the powers of the Aſſembly.—It becomes us to enquire whether they have made them ſo independant of the Aſſembly as to give them the free exerciſe of their own judgments.</p>
               <p>The inſignificant figure the Preſident and Council make in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015589_0014_0F998ED24041B068"/>
from not having a negative upon the laws of the Aſſembly, alone would ſoon have deſtroyed their authority and influence in the State. But the authors of the Conſtitution have taken pains to throw the whole power of the Council at once into the hands of the Aſſembly, by rendering the former dependant upon the latter in the two following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Preſident is choſen by the joint ballot of the Aſſembly and Council. The Aſſembly being to the Council, in point of numbers, as five are to one, of courſe chuſe the Preſident. Each member will expect in his turn to fill the firſt chair in the State, and hence the whole Council will yield themſelves up to the will of the Aſſembly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſalaries of the Preſident and of each of the Counſellors are fixed by the Aſſembly. This will neceſſarily render them dependant upon them. It is worthy of notice here, that a rotation is eſtabliſhed in the 19th ſection of the Conſtitution, to "prevent the danger of an inconvenient ariſtocracy."—From what abuſe of power can this ariſtocracy ariſe? Are they not the creatures of the Aſſembly? But there is a magic terror in the ſound of a Counſellor. Call a man an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyman, or a Cenſor, and he becomes an innocent creature, though you inveſt him with the deſpotiſm of an eaſtern monarch. If the Council are dependant upon the Aſſembly, it follows of courſe that the Judges, who are appointed by the Council, are likewiſe depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon them. But in order more fully to ſecure their depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the will of the Aſſembly, they are obliged to hold their ſalaries upon the tenure of their will. In vain do they hold their commiſſions for ſeven years. This is but the ſhadow of independance. They cannot live upon the air, and their abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Aſſembly gives that body a tranſcendent influence over all the courts of law in the State. Here then we have diſcovered the legiſlative, executive and judicial powers of the State all blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.—The liberty, the property and life of every individual in the State are laid proſtrate by the Conſtitution at the feet of the Aſſembly. This combination of powers in one body has in all ages been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a tyranny. To live by one man's will became the cauſe of all men's miſery; but better, far better, would it be to live by the will of one man, than to live, or rather to die, by the will of a body of men. Unhappy Pennſylvania! Methinks I ſee the ſcales of juſtice broken in thy courts.—I ſee the dowry of the widow and the portion of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans unjuſtly taken from them, in order to gratify the avarice of ſome demagogue who rules the Aſſembly by his eloquence and arts.—I ſee the ſcaffolds ſtreaming with the blood of the wiſeſt and beſt men in the State.—I ſee the offices of government—But the proſpect is too painful, I ſhall proceed to take notice of ſome other parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>

obſervations that can be made on this part of the Conſtitution is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the public, that not above one half the people of the State choſe magiſtrates agreeable to the laws of the Aſſembly for that purpoſe; that more than one half of thoſe that were choſen have refuſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of commiſſions, and that many of thoſe who act are totally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified from the want of education or leisure for the office.—It has been said often, and I wiſh the ſaying was engraven over the doors of every ſtatehouſe on the Continent, that "all power is <hi>derived</hi> from the people," but it has never yet been ſaid that all power is <hi>ſeated</hi> in the people. Government ſuppoſes and requires a delegation of power: It cannot exiſt without it. And the idea of making the people at large judges of the qualifications neceſſary for magiſtrates, or judges of laws, or checks for Aſſemblies proceeds upon the ſuppoſition that mankind are all alike wiſe, and juſt, and have equal leiſure. It more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over deſtroys the neceſſity for all government. What man ever made himſelf his own attorney? And yet this would not be more abſurd than for the people at <hi>large</hi> to pretend to give up their power to a ſet of rulers, and afterwards reſerve the right of making and of judging of all their laws themſelves. Such a government is a monſter in nature. It contains as many Governors, Aſſemblymen, Judges and Magiſtrates as there are freemen in the State, all exerciſing the ſame powers and at the ſame time. Happy would it be for us, if this monſter was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only for his abſurdity; but, alas! he contains a tyrant-in his bowels. All hiſtory ſhews us that the people ſoon grow weary of the folly and tyranny of one another. They prefer one to many matters, and ſtability to inſtability of ſlavery. They prefer a Julius Caeſar to a Senate, and a Cromwell to a perpetual parliament.</p>
               <p>I cannot help thinking a miſtake lays rather in words than ideas when we talk of the rights of the people. Where is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my chuſing a Juſtice of Peace, and my chuſing an Aſſemblyman and a Counſellor, by whoſe joint ſuffrages a Governor is choſen, who appoints a Juſtice for me? I am ſtill the firſt link of the ſacred chain of the power of the State. But are there no caſes in which I may be bound by acts of a ſingle, or of a body of magiſtrates in the State, whom I have had no hand in chuſing? Yes, there are. Here then I am bound contrary to the principles of liberty (which conſiſt in a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governed by men choſen by himſelf), whereas if all the magiſtrates in the State were appointed by the Governor, or executive part of the State, it would be impoſſible for me to appear before the bar of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate any where who did not derive his power <hi>originally</hi> from me.</p>
               <p>By the 5th ſection all militia officers below the rank of a Brigadier General are to be choſen by the people. Moſt of the objections that have been mentioned againſt magiſtrates being choſen by the people, apply with equal force againſt the people's chuſing their military of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. By the militia law of this State we find the ſoldier ceaſes to be commanded by the officer of his choice as ſoon as he comes in the field. He might as well be commanded by an officer of another State as by one of his own State, for whom he did not vote. Had he been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015589_0015_0F998ED3E5397310"/>
by the executive power of the government, he might have looked upon him originally as the creature of his own power, and might have claimed his care in the camp, from his influence at elections, in moving thoſe ſprings in government, from which he derived his commiſſion. But the unſuitableneſs of this part of the Conſtitution to the genius of the people of Pennſylvania, will appear in the ſtrongeſt point of light, from attending to the two following facts: 1ſt: Moſt of the irregularities committed by the militia, that were in ſervice laſt year, were occaſioned by that laxity of diſcipline, which was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and kept up by officers holding their commiſſions by the breath of the people: And 2dly, Above one half of the State have refuſed or neglected to chuſe officers, agreeably to the recommendation of the Aſſembly.—And even in many of thoſe places, where elections for officers have been held, Colonels have been choſen by forty and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Subalterns by only four or five votes.</p>
               <p>In the 22d ſection of the Conſtitution it is ſaid, "every officer of the ſtate, whether judicial or executive, ſhall be liable to be impeached by the General Aſſembly, before the Preſident and Council, either when in office or after his reſignation or removal for maladminiſtration." Why is a man in this caſe to be deprived of a trial by jury? and what is the reaſon that no <hi>time</hi> is <hi>fixed</hi> for the commencement of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment after resignation or removal for maladminiſtration? A ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial or military officer may be innocent, and yet, from the delay of his trial for ſix or ſeven years, he may be deprived by death or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of the vouchers of his innocence. Woe to the man that ever holds one of the high offices of the State of Pennſylvania! He muſt ever, after his reſignation, hold his life at the pleaſure of the orator who rules the Aſſembly. The leaſt mark of diſreſpect ſhewn to him, or to any of the Aſſembly, rouſes the Conſtitution and laws of his country againſt him; and perhaps, after an interval of twenty or thirty years conscious integrity, his grey hairs are dragged with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the grave. Let not this be thought to be too high a picture of this part of the Conſtitution of Pennſylvania. It is a picture of human nature in ſimilar circumſtances, in every age and country. Men poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of unlimited and uncontrouled power are beaſts of prey.</p>
               <p>But, is there no power lodged in the Conſtitution to alter theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections? Has our Convention monopolized all the wiſdom of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding years, ſo as to preclude any improvements being made in the infant ſcience of government? Muſt we groan away our lives in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſubmiſſion to all the evils in the Conſtitution which have been deſcribed? Let the 47th and laſt ſection of the Conſtitution anſwer theſe queſtions. By this ſection it is declared, that after the expiration of ſeven years, there ſhall "be choſen two men from each city and county, (a majority of whom ſhall be a quorum in every caſe, except as to <hi>calling a Convention</hi>) who ſhall be called a Council of Cenſors, and who ſhall have power to call a Convention within two years after their fitting, if there appears to them an abſolute neceſſity of amending any article of the Conſtitution which may be defective, explaining ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015589_0016_0F998ED45B296E20"/>
as may be thought not clearly expreſſed, and of adding ſuch as are neceſſary for the preſervation of the rights and happineſs of the people." From this paragraph it is evident, that the Conſtitution was thought to be the perfection of human wiſdom, and that the authors of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that it ſhould laſt for ever. Every ſection of the Conſtitution, I believe, was determined by a <hi>majority</hi> of the Members of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and in the 12th ſection of the Conſtitution we find, that if only two-thirds of the people concur in the execution of it, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Aſſembly choſen by them, are to "poſſeſs all the powers of the General Aſſembly as fully and amply as if the whole were preſent." This is ſtrictly agreeable to the principles of good government; but, why are theſe principles to be trampled upon, when the great queſtion is to be agitated, whether the Conſtitution ſhall be altered? For, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs every county and city in the State concur in electing Cenſors, and unleſs <hi>two thirds</hi> of them agree in calling a Convention, there is no poſſibility of obtaining an alteration of a ſingle article of the Conſtitution. If the Aſſembly had not taught us that it was neither treaſon nor perjury to break the Conſtitution, I am ſure it would have remained inviolate for ever; for I am perſuaded that ſeveral of the counties would have refuſed to have choſen Cenſors. But ſuppoſe they had, if only one ſhort of <hi>two thirds</hi> of them refuſed to agree in the meaſure, we could have no Convention. The minority would give laws to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority. A ſoleciſm in government! But there is no end to the tyranny and abſurdity of our Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>But the Council of Cenſors have not yet finiſhed their buſineſs. They are empowered by the Conſtitution "to enquire, whether the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> has been preſerved <hi>inviolate</hi> in <hi>every</hi> part? and whether the legiſlative and executive branches of government have performed their duty, as guardians of the people; or aſſumed to themſelves, or exerciſed <hi>other</hi> or greater powers than they are entitled to by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: They are alſo to enquire, whether the public taxes have been juſtly laid and collected in all parts of this commonwealth;—in what manner the public monies have been diſpoſed of, and whether the laws have been duly executed: For theſe purpoſes they ſhall have power to ſend for perſons, papers and records; they ſhall have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to paſs public cenſures, and to recommend to the legiſlature, the repealing ſuch laws as appear to them to have been enacted contrary to the principles of the Conſtitution: Theſe powers they ſhall continue to have for, and during the ſpace of one year, from the day of their election, and no longer."</p>
               <p>Is this the commiſſion of the Grand Turk? or is it an extract from an act of the Britiſh Parliament, teeming with vengeance againſt the liberties of America?—No.—It is an epitome of the powers of the Council of Cenſors eſtabliſhed by the late Convention of Pennſylvania. Innocence has nothing to fear from juſtice, when it flows through the regular channels of law; but where is the man who can enſure himſelf a moment's ſafety from a body of men inveſted with abſolute power for one whole year to cenſure and condemn, without judge or jury,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015589_0017_0F998ED51AC8B080"/>
every individual in the State. I ſhall ſuppoſe the Council to conſiſt of a majority of thoſe Members of Aſſembly, who took the oath of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the Conſtitution, and who voted, that no officer ſhould be excuſed from taking it, who accepted of a militia-commiſſion under the authority of this State. I ſhall ſuppoſe them aſſembled for the buſineſs of their office. The work of an age is to be performed in a ſingle year.—Methinks I ſee ſuch of thoſe worthy gentlemen as are living, who, for the ſake of union, conſented to diſpenſe with the oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the Conſtitution, led like criminals to their bar.—I hear peals of wrath denounced againſt them. I ſee thoſe virtuous gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who compoſed the Executive Council in the year 1777, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear at their tribunal, to anſwer for their having abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the duties of their office, by an adjournment, at a time when the State was threatened with an invaſion. In vain they plead, that the Conſtitution had inveſted them with no power for the defence of the State. Their names and their families are branded with infamy by a "public cenſure." I ſee hundreds and thouſands coming, one after another, before the Council, to be cenſured for refuſing to chuſe magiſtrates and militia-officers, agreeably to the laws of the Aſſembly. But who are they who are dragged with ſo much violence to the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorial tribunal? They are a number of citizens who prayed for ſome alterations to be made in the Conſtitution. In vain they plead the obligations of reaſon and conſcience againſt ſubmitting to the government. In vain they plead their zeal and ſervices in the common cauſe of America. It is all to no purpoſe. They recommend to the Aſſembly to impeach them for high treaſon. They are condemned as traitors, and the ſtreets ſwim with their blood.—Good heavens! where was the mild genius of Pennſylvania, when this part of the Conſtitution obtained the aſſent of the Convention?—Spirit of liberty, whither waft thou ſled?—</p>
               <p>But perhaps the Conſtitution has provided a remedy for its defects, without the aid of the Council of Cenſors? No—this cannot be done; for every Member of Aſſembly, before he takes his ſeat, is obliged, by the 10th ſection of the Conſtitution, to ſwear that he will not "do nor conſent to any act whatever, that ſhall have a tendency to leſſen or abridge their rights and privileges as declared <hi>in the Conſtitution of this State,</hi>" as alſo, "that he will not directly or indirectly do or conſent to any act or thing prejudicial or injurious to the Conſtitution or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof, as <hi>eſtabliſhed by the Convention,</hi>" agreeably to the 40th ſection of the Conſtitution. Theſe oaths of infallibility and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience to the form of the Conſtitution, effectually preclude every man, who holds an office under it, from attempting to procure the leaſt amendment in any part of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">That it was the deſign of the Convention, that the Conſtitution ſhould not be touched by any power but a Convention to be called by the Council of Cenſors, appears from the oath contained in the 40th ſection, being required by one of their ordinances as the only condition upon which an Elector could vote for an Aſſemblyman. Strange! that men ſhould call God to witneſs their determination to ſupport a government, which a majority of them had not ſeen, and which even the minority of them did not underſtand or diſliked! But, for the honour of the State it ſhould be recorded, that not above 1500 of the 2500, who voted for the Aſſembly, took the oath required by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Convention.</note> It is a mere quibble upon
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015589_0018_0F998ED5DD204C80"/>
words to ſay, that a man may mend the Conſtitution, without "doing any thing prejudicial or injurious to it." The Convention did not intend any ſuch conſtruction to be put upon their oaths, and hence we find in the introduction to the Conſtitution, they "declare the frame of government to be the Conſtitution of this commonwealth, and to remain in force therein <hi>for ever, unaltered,</hi> except in ſuch articles as ſhall hereafter, upon experience, be found to require improvement, and which ſhall, by the ſame authority of the people fairly delegated, as this <hi>frame of government</hi> directs, be amended and improved." Now we know, that the frame of government forbids the leaſt amendment being made in the Conſtitution in any other than by the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Council of Cenſors.</p>
               <p>Had the Conſtitution appeared to me to have been unexceptionable in every part, and had it been the reſult of the united wiſdom of men and angels, I would not have taken an oath of paſſive obedience to it, for ſeven or nine years. The conſtant changes in human affairs, and in the diſpoſitions of a people, might render occaſional alterations, in that time, neceſſary in the moſt perfeft Conſtitution. But to take an oath of allegiance to a Conſtitution,—full of experiments,—a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution that was indeed a new thing under the ſun,—that had never been tried in ſome of its parts in <hi>any</hi> country,—and that had produced miſery in other of its parts in <hi>every</hi> country,—I ſay to ſwear to ſupport or even to ſubmit, for ſeven or nine years, to ſuch a Conſtitution, is to trifle with all morality, and to diſhonour the ſacred name of GOD himſelf.</p>
               <p>What would you think of a man, who would conſent to ſhut his eyes, and ſwallow a quantity of food that had never before been taſted by a human creature, and ſwear at the ſame time, that if it ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order him in ever ſo great a degree, he would take nothing to relieve him for eight and forty hours? Such a man would be wife, compared with the man who takes an oath of allegiance to the Conſtitution of Pennſylvania.</p>
               <p>It is to no purpoſe to talk here of the many excellent articles in the Bill of Rights; ſuch as religious toleration,—the habeas corpus act,—trials by juries,—the rotation of office, &amp;c. None of them can flouriſh long in the neighbourhood of a ſingle Aſſembly, and a Council of Cenſors poſſeſſing all the powers of the State.—Theſe ineſtimable privileges in the Conſtitution of Pennſylvania reſemble a tree loaded with the moſt luſcious fruit, but ſurrounded with thorns, in ſuch a manner, as to be for ever inacceſſible to the hungry traveller.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, while the government is upon its good behaviour, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015589_0019_0F998ED69C2D3220"/>
while the paſſions of the State are directed againſt a cruel and common enemy, we may not experience all the calamities that have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to flow from the Conſtitution.—But the revolution of a few years, and the return of peace, will moſt certainly render Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, under her preſent Conſtitution, the moſt miſerable ſpot upon the ſurface of the globe.</p>
               <p>I believe all the Members of the late Convention were true Whigs, and aimed ſincerely at forming a free and happy government: But, I am ſure, that if Filmar and Hobbes had ſat among them, they could not have formed a government more destructive of human happineſs; nor could Lord North or General Howe have formed one more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of union and vigour, in our public affairs, than the preſent Conſtitution of Pennſylvania.</p>
               <p>It is one thing to underſtand the <hi>principles,</hi> and another thing to underſtand the <hi>forms</hi> of government. The former are ſimple; the latter are difficult and complicated. There is the ſame difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween principles and forms in all other ſciences. Who underſtood the principles of mechanics and optics better than Sir Iſaac Newton? and yet Sir Iſaac could not for his life have made a watch or a microſcope. Mr. Locke is an oracle as to the <hi>principles,</hi> Harrington and Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieu are oracles as to the <hi>forms</hi> of government.</p>

               <p>A Queſtion very naturally ariſes from taking a review of the tyranny of the government of Pennſylvania, What meaſures ſhall be taken to amend them? There can be but two anſwers to this queſtion. 1ſt. To ſubmit to the Conſtitution for the preſent, till a peace with Great-Britain will give us leiſure to make a better; or, 2dly, to call a Convention immediately for the purpoſe of making a new Conſtitution. I believe the State is divided only about theſe two things; for the party who believe the government to be a <hi>good</hi> one, is too inconſiderable to be noticed in this place.</p>
               <p>I. I beg leave to offer a few objections to our <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and ſhall endeavour, II. to obviate the objections that have been made to the immediate calling of a Convention, for the purpoſe of altering and amending it.</p>
               <p>I. There is the utmoſt danger to the State of Pennſylvania to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ſubmiſſion to the Conſtitution from the following cauſes, 1. The government is a tyranny. The moment we ſubmit to it we become ſlaves. We hold every thing dear to us in ſociety upon the tenure of the will of a ſingle man in a ſingle Aſſembly. Perhaps the mark of the beaſt may not be fixed immediately upon us, but the contract is made, and we are ſold, together with our poſterity, the hewers of wood and drawers of water for ever. 2. The Conſtitution cannot be executed in part without being <hi>broken.</hi> Now there cannot be a more dangerous precedent in a free country, than a legiſlature violating in a

I am ſorry to find upon the Journals of the Aſſembly, an addreſs from a battalion of militia in Cheſter county, to the Honourable Houſe, aſſuring them, that "they will ſupport the preſent government with their lives and fortunes." Such addreſſes indicated the weakneſs, and foreboded the preſent contemptible ſituation of the court of Britain.

Our enemies are exulting, and our friends are weeping over our alarming ſituation. Our anceſtors look down, and our poſterity look up to us for a happier Conſtitution. We are engaged with our Siſter States in 2 bloody and expenſive war. The liberty of the whole world is the price for which we fight. Human nature looks to us to avenge the mighty ills ſhe has ſuffered from the tyrants of the old world. She has already dropped a tear of joy upon the proſpect of recovering among us her firſt and original dignity. A <hi>good government</hi> is an engine not leſs neceſſary to enſure us ſucceſs in theſe glorious purpoſes than ammunition and <hi>fire-arms.</hi> The way of duty is plain. Let a Convention be choſen, to alter and amend the government. This meaſure alone will reſtore vigor and union to Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. Say not, my dear countrymen, THIS IS NOT THE TIME, THE ENEMY ARE AT OUR GATES, LET US FIRST REPEL THEM. Look at our militia on a field day—ſee the attempts of the friends to the Conſtitution to open our courts—hear the complaints and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of the people. They all proclaim that NOW is the time for alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Conſtitution. No confuſion can ariſe from It. The gentlemen in the oppoſition declare their determination to ſupport the preſent Aſſembly in the execution of every law neceſſary for the ſafety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015589_0021_0F998ED88BA5A8B0"/>
of the State, and above all in the execution of the militia and teſt laws. They have no intereſt unconnected with yours. They ſee with the ſame diſtreſs as you do the Tories triumphing in our diſunion. Be not deceived. The Tories are not enemies to the preſent government; they enjoy the benefits of its weakneſs, and there is good authority to ſay they have <hi>ſecretly</hi> helped to carry it into execution. Let us beware of being impoſed upon by the popular cry of the <hi>neceſſity of the times.</hi> When the Diſſenters in Virginia and South Carolina prayed for the abolition of the Epiſcopal eſtabliſhment in thoſe States, the High-Churchmen acknowledged that their demands were juſt, but ſaid, that <hi>this was not the time</hi> for attending to them, and that ſuch a change in the government would throw all things into confuſion. The demands were notwithſtanding complied with, and an union unparalleled in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times was immediately produced in thoſe Spates. When a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of independance laſt ſummer appeared to be the only meaſure that could ſave America, the Tories and moderate men acknowledged the juſtice of our ſeparation from Great-Britain, but ſaid, "This is not the time." The event ſhewed that the time was come, for, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the advantages we have gained from it in foreign Courts, it ſerved to precipitate the timid, the doubtful and the diſaffected cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters from their mixture with the real Whigs, and although it leſſened the numbers in the oppoſition, it added to their ſtrength by producing union and deciſion among them. To delay juſtice (has been emphatically ſaid) is to deny it. In like manner to <hi>delay</hi> liberty is to <hi>take</hi> it away.</p>
               <p>The Convention of New-York formed their government within the reach of the thunder of the enemy's cannon, and while one half of their State was in their poſſeſſion. Is our situation more dangerous than it was laſt year? The members of the late Convention were choſen on a day when the Aſſociators of the whole State were in motion. The Conſtitution was made while above 5000 of them were in the field. The ſenſe of the people was not <hi>aſked</hi> upon the ſubject of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; but it was <hi>given</hi> in the moſt public manner. No more than 1500 freemen voted for its being executed, for that number only took the oath of allegiance to the Conſtitution at the election in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Let us talk no more then of the "<hi>necessity of the times.</hi>" This is the State apology at St. James's for all the crimes of the preſent reign and for all the ſavages and bloodſhed we have witneſſed in America.

               <p>But further, recollect, my dear countrymen, our conduct upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſolution of the Honourable Congreſs of the 15th of May, 1776. We ſeized it as a Warrant that proclaimed liberty to us and our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity for ever. It was ſaid by ſome people at that time, "Let the Aſſembly execute that reſolution;" but we ſpurned the advice, and we acted like men. We ſaid, that the "Aſſembly was not choſen by a majority of votes in the State," owing to the inequality of our repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, and that they wanted the "confidence of the people." We thought nothing then of the loſs of time occaſioned by the meeting of a Conference of Committees, to ſettle the mode and time of chuſing a Convention. The delay of months, the diſtractions of the State, and the danger of an invaſion, were thought to be trifling when compared with the proſpect of a good Conſtitution, that ſhould <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> collect and exert the Whig ſtrength of the State.</p>
               <p>Thus have I finiſhed my obſervations upon the Conſtitution of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. I have taken notice only of its moſt eſſential defects, and have aimed to diſcuſs them with candour. The occaſional remarks upon the proceedings of the Aſſembly, are to be charged entirely to the faults of the Conſtitution.—I believe the gentlemen in power have nothing in view but the freedom and independance of the State; and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015589_0023_0F998EDA520B6668"/>
ſuch has been the zeal and integrity of many of them in the purſuit of thoſe great objects, that it gives me pain to reflect, that I have been obliged to differ from them in the beſt means of obtaining them.</p>
               <p>With this declaration I ſhall cloſe my letters to the people of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. Accept thou dear aſylum of my anceſtors, nurſe of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, protectreſs of my childhood, and generous rewarder of the toils of my youth, accept of theſe humble efforts to reſtore thee to freedom and happineſs! If I have laboured in vain, I ſhall henceforth mourn in ſecret only over my beloved country, and lament the day that I was born a Pennſylvanian.</p>
