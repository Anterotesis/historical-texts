            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS FOR QUITTING The Methodiſt Society, IN ANWER TO A Printed Letter, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MY friend's letter needs no apology. And as it is an apoſtolic injunction, <hi>Be ready always to give an anſwer to every man that aſketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. iii. 15.</note> I wiſh to do it, <hi>with meekneſs and fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>It is aſked, What are your reaſons for quitting the Methodiſt connection?<note n="†" place="bottom">As I have been repeatedly called upon by a number of perſons in different parts of the kingdom, it ſeems neceſſary to give one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral anſwer to theſe queſtions, which I hope may not only prove acceptable, but alſo beneficial to my friends.
My principal inducement therefore, in the publication of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my apology for troubling the public with it, are, that I think I owe it as a duty to my friends to myſelf, and above all, that truth requires it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And, Have you read a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a perſon joined with the people called Quakers?</p>
            </q>
            <p>To the firſt queſtion, I reply, I had many reaſons, which will ſufficiently appear in my anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond query: And therefore, as I intend no reflection on a religious Society, many of whom I much eſteem, I ſhall only obſerve in general on this head, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a year ſince met with Barclay's Apology,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018525_0003_0FA7AD3F58E2C210"/>I was fully convinced, that the principles, worſhip and diſcipline of the people called Quakers,<note n="*" place="bottom">The purity and Goſpel ſimplicity of their principles, worſhip and diſcipline, I found my heart united to, before I was acquainted with any of that religious ſociety; and concluded, that if they, as a people, walked agreeably thereto, they were <hi>burning and ſhining lights.</hi>
               </note> were more conſonant to ſcripture, reaſon, and to my own feelings, than thoſe of the Society to which I was united. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I then ſaw the cauſe of the many painful feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with which I had been for years exerciſed, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my ſentiments coincided with theirs, though I knew it not, being carried away with the vulgar opinion of the erroneouſneſs of their principles, &amp;c. And as I believe, this is the ſtate of many well-diſpoſed minds; I wiſh that people of all denominations would not take things upon truſt, or on the authority of any man, or men; but ſimply turn their minds to the Divine Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in their own breaſt, even to the Lord Jeſus, who is <hi>the Life and Light of Men,</hi> as well as conſtantly <hi>ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> for I am perſuaded, that numbers ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity believe all they hear, that it may be ſaid they have no creed of their own,</p>
            <p>To the ſecond queſtion, I anſwer, I have repeatedly, and carefully peruſed that letter, and ſhall give my friend a few free remarks thereon.</p>
            <p>But it may be neceſſary to premiſe, that on the firſt ſuperficial view, it ſtruck me as ſomething plauſible; and I believe it has had the ſame effect on a certain claſs of readers, who either cannot, or will not look beyond the ſurface of things. This may account for its being deemed unanſwerable. But looking into it a ſecond and third time, it became leſs and leſs formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for as I more attentively conſidered the objections, and diſcovered the fallacy of the arguments, ſome difficulties, which reſted on my mind, were removed: On a cloſe inſpection, it appeared, that eight out of fifteen of Barclay's propoſitions, were granted to be agreeable to ſcripture; and theſe eight propoſitions,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018525_0004_0FA7AD3FFAEE0770"/>which the objector allows, do not 'differ from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,' contain the fundamental doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. More narrowly looking into thoſe to which he has objected, I found reaſon to conclude, that he now ſees things more clearly, and has therefore changed his mind with regard to the ſeventh propoſition on Juſtification, and the tenth on Women's preaching. My reaſons, I expect, will be ſufficiently clear, when they ſhall be given in their proper place.</p>
            <p>As to the fifteenth propoſition, reſpecting <hi>conformity to the world,</hi> he agrees with Barclay in ſome things; and how he can prove that his denying flattering titles to be given to men, makes <q>a difference between Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm and Chriſtianity,</q> is a myſtery indeed. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this I am certain of, that if Barclay was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſome particulars objected to, his miſtakes are harmleſs, being on the ſafe ſide, and ſuch as do not hinder thoſe who hold them, according to the objector's own words, from being <q>Real Chriſtians; men who have the mind that was in Chriſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">The objector's words are always encloſed in ſingle inverted commas.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I conclude therefore, that eleven out of the fifteen propoſitions, have nothing different from Chriſtianity in them. Let us then calmly conſider the reprobated ones, weighing the arguments which are brought to prove that they 'manifeſtly differ from Chriſtianity;' and in doing this, let us follow the objector ſtep by ſtep, entering more minutely into the particulars we have juſt glanced over.</p>
            <p n="1">The firſt objection, [P. 4.] is againſt the latter part of Barclay's ſecond propoſition, in which he treats of immediate revelation. The ſentence objected to is this, <q>Yet theſe revelations are not to be ſubjected to the examinations of the ſcriptures as a touchſtone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which the writer of that letter replies <q>Here there is a difference between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018525_0005_0FA7AD40B58A5838"/>The Scriptures are the touchſtone, whereby Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians examine all [real or ſuppoſed] revelations, In all caſes they appeal to the law, and to the teſtimony, and try every Spirit thereby.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer. Whatever <q>manifeſt difference between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity,</q> ſome people may ſee in Barclay's Apology, it is eaſy to ſee, there is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt injury done him, by a mutilated quotation, which quite alters the ſenſe of that paſſage, and makes him ſpeak a language, which both he and his friends diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow.</p>
            <p>He is here repreſented as delivering and conſequently the people called Quakers as holding a tenet, which muſt fix a ſtigma on them, as tho' they ſlighted the Scriptures, and refuſed to have their doctrines and practices tried by them. I will give Barclay's own words, and then my friend may judge how fairly he has been quoted, and whether there is juſt ground to charge him with under-rating the ſcriptures. His words are, <q>Yet from hence it will not follow, That theſe revelations are to be ſubjected to the examination, <hi>either of the outward</hi> teſtimony of the Scriptures, <hi>or of the natural reaſon of man, as to a more noble or certain touchſtone.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Was it deſigned, or only an overſight, to leave out almoſt half the ſentence, eſpecially the words <hi>"more noble or certain?"</hi> If it was <hi>only</hi> an overſight, it is highly blameable; for the omiſſion alters the ſenſe of the paſſage. It is very obvious, Barclay's meaning is, that however excellent the ſcriptures are, yet they muſt be conſidered as inferior to the Holy Spirit, by which they were dictated. And he is particularly careful, while he contends for the doctrine of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to guard againſt the abuſe of it, by ſaying, <q>Theſe divine, inward revelations, neither do, nor even can contradict the outward letter of ſcripture, or right and ſound reaſon.</q> And as this ſentnece was not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018525_0006_0FA7AD41727FEAE0"/>only joined with, but preciſely fixes the ſenſe of that objected to, I marvel that it could be overlooked.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am far from being ſatisfied with what is brought as a proof of Barclay's error. The objector ſays, <q>In all caſes they appeal to the law and to the teſtimony.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I could not help applying to this way of proving things, what a witty author ſays, <q>Clergymen generally ſet out with begging the queſtion.</q> This is exactly the caſe, in taking for granted, that the <hi>law and the Teſtimony</hi> always mean the letter of ſcripture. No ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for the ſcriptures ſpeak of <hi>the law written in the heart,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Room. ii. 15.</note> informing us of <hi>its accuſing, or elſe excuſing;</hi> they very frequently treat of <hi>the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the word of God</hi> and ſure <hi>teſtimony,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. xix. 10, 13.</note> teſtifying of him, that he is the inward <hi>life and light of men.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">John i. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The true light</hi> to the poor Gentile world, who are not ſo highly favoured as we are with the letter of ſcripture: <hi>The true light</hi> to the poor Papiſts, who, by deſigning men, are forbid the uſe of them: And <hi>the true light</hi> to multitudes, who through bodily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c. are deprived of the outward teſtimony of ſcripture. Yet all theſe have <hi>the Law written in their hearts;</hi> Jeſus being that glorious, univerſal, ſaving <hi>light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the World.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">John i. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I think it muſt clearly appear, to every enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, unprejudiced mind, that in this article, R. Barclay is far ſounder in the Chriſtian faith, than the objector. For the latter, in affirming, 'The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures 'are the touchſtone, whereby all Chriſtians exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>all</hi> revelations,' ſeems to me to renounce this glorious Goſpel promiſe and privilege, <hi>When the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">John xvi. 13.</note> That they are a touchſtone, is fully ſubſcribed to, but that they are the <hi>only</hi> touchſtone, is denied, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the office of the Holy Spirit, which is not only given to, but is <hi>to abide</hi> with the diſciples of Chriſt, <hi>to the end of the world.</hi>

4. That 'the Scriptures are' <hi>not</hi> 
               <q>the touchſtone to examine all revelations,</q> I prove thus.</p>
            <p>Holy men of old, who <hi>walked with God,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. v. 22.</note> were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently favoured with immediate revelations; yet theſe men had not the letter of ſcripture: And if <q>the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the touchſtone to examine all (real or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) revelations,</q> I ſhould be glad to know, as they were deſtitute of this touchſtone, how they diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the one from the other? I take it for granted, that they had the ſame Holy Spirit, which Barclay pleads for as the peculiar privilege of Chriſtians, it being promiſed under the Goſpel diſpenſation, <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John vi. 45.</note>

            <p n="6">6. We may bring the matter nearer to ourſelves. There is a variety of caſes, which we may be called to act in, reſpecting which, although we may earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire to know the will of God, the ſcriptures may be quite ſilent. Let me ſelect a ſingle inſtance, that of the Miniſtry. Pray what Scripture can ſatisfy a man,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018525_0008_0FA7AD42EFDE5D30"/>"That he is inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt,"<note n="*" place="bottom">When any perſon offers himſelf to the Biſhop, to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Church of England, he aſks him, <q>Do you Believe that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt to this office?</q> He anſwers, "I truſt I am." Were this really the caſe with all who are ſtyled Miniſters, we might reaſonably expect to ſee a ſpeedy and happy change take place amongſt men.</note> to that important office? It will not do to ſay he has gifts; for I preſume, that many have gifts, [if by gifts we underſtand man's natural and acquired abilities,] who are not called to that important work. And the queſtion is not reſpecting qualifications, but ſingly this, whether any ſcripture can fully ſatisfy a man thus exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that what he feels in his mind, is a 'real, and not a ſuppoſed revelation?'</p>
            <p>There is ſomething that looks like an objection to the third propoſition, which, I confeſs, gives the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector the appearance of one diſpoſed to find fault. However, he anſwers his own objection, when he ſays, <q>If by theſe words be only meant, that <hi>the ſpirit</hi> is our firſt and principal leader. Here is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity!</q>
            </p>
            <p>I aſk how is it poſſible to underſtand Barclay in any other ſenſe? And, is it not ſurprizing that the objector ſhould bring in an <hi>if,</hi> and ſeem at a loſs for his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when in the ſame ſentence, he quotes Barclay's words? "The ſpirit is our firſt and principal leader." I wiſh therefore, that inſtead of playing upon words, he had given a neceſſary caution againſt a common, but dangerous error, amongſt thoſe called ſpiritual people, of making the ſcriptures ſuperſede the neceſſity of the holy ſpirit, which our divine Maſter promiſed to all his followers, when he ſaid, <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things.</hi>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John ii. 10.17.</note> A glorious and comfortable truth! which, when experimentally known, will lead to the higheſt eſtimation of the ſcriptures, as they not only teſtify of the great love of Chriſt, in what he has done and ſuffered for ſinners, but alſo as they give a true teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of his redeeming power, which theſe have witneſſed in their own hearts. And without this liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge of the heart, however men may idolize the ſcripture, it is to them a <hi>ſealed book,</hi> and a dead letter; which is ſtrikingly ſet forth in theſe words, <hi>The letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I have dwelt the longer on this ſubject, on account of its great importance, and becauſe numbers of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, are not only ignorant of it as an experimental truth, but ſtrangers to it even in theory. And I am conſtrained to ſay, I know not any religious ſociety, except the people called Quakers, that bears a ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral teſtimony to the doctrine of immediate divine inſpiration. It is true, the eſtabliſhed church daily prays for, and others preach, and talk much about it; but when they come to the point, ſome laugh at all who make pretenſions of this kind, and others charge them with manifeſtly differing from Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>The third objection is brought againſt the ſeventh propoſition, which treats on juſtification, of which the objector ſays, <q>Here is a wide difference between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity.</q> 
               <q>This is flat juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works.</q> And adds, <q>The ground of this miſtake, is the not underſtanding the meaning of the word juſtification.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Barclay uſes the word in a ſound, proper ſenſe, for, being made juſt; which implies the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018525_0010_0FA7AD458B162A50"/>of ſins, as well as the renewal of the mind, and as theſe cannot be ſeparated in the experience of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, they are always connected in the ſcriptures. The Apoſtle Paul, ſpeaking of the wonderful change wrought on ſome perſons of the moſt abandoned cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, ſays, <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Cor. vi. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And it is worthy to be remarked, that the term juſtification is moſt commonly uſed for being made juſt, as in theſe words, <hi>For he that is dead, is freed</hi> (Gr. juſtified) <hi>from ſin.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 7.</note> I apprehend the reaſon why it is ſo frequently uſed in this ſenſe in ſcripture, as well as by Barclay, is becauſe it is leſs liable to be abuſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The miſtaken ſenſe in which ſome underſtand the term juſtification, as implying an imputation of righteouſneſs, without the implantation thereof, ariſes from the abſurd idea which men form of the ſupreme Majeſty; gloomy minds repreſenting to themſelves, and ſetting him forth to others, as an implacable Being, full of vindictive wrath, even againſt ſuch as have not only been convinced of, but earneſtly deſire to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the evil of their ways. So that for want of juſt conceptions of the divine Being, and properly advert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what the ſcriptures uniformly declare, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son that whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life;</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">John iii. 16.</note> and not clearly underſtanding that Chriſt's coming into the world was not the cauſe, but the effect of God's great love to all men, our gracious Creator is ſet forth in an unamiable light, ſtript of his divine perfections; and on this falſe foundation, a ſuperſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture raiſed, which, I think, is ſubverſive of holineſs, in heart and life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But I muſt do juſtice to the objector, by ſaying, he has publicly confeſſed, that he formerly leaned too
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018525_0011_0FA7AD466DCE70C0"/>much to Calviniſm, with reſpect to the doctrine of juſtification, and has therefore openly aſſerted, <q>We are every moment pleaſing or diſpleaſing to God, according to the whole of our inward tempers, and outward conduct.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If I miſtake not, this exactly coincides with Barclay, and is agreeable to <hi>ſound doctrine,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. iv. 3.</note> as well as to the divine teſtimony, which every man has in his own breaſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As there is a common, but very unjuſt charge brought againſt the people called Quakers, by ſome who are ignorant of, as well as by others, who, I fear, deſignedly miſrepreſent their principles, <q>That they deny the fall of man, and err in the nature and cauſe of our juſtification;</q> this ſeems to be a proper place to clear up theſe points, which I ſhall attempt to do, by making an extract from Barclay's Apology, hoping it will fully ſatisfy every unprejudiced mind, reſpecting theſe important ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Treating of juſtification, he ſays, [page 202<note n="§" place="bottom">I earneſtly intreat, that all ſenſible, well-diſpoſed perſons, would carefully read over Barclay's Apology, for the people called Quakers; and I am perſuaded they will not only be highly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but much profited, by one of the moſt rational, maſterly, as well as ſcriptural performances, of any perhaps, on ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in the Engliſh language. It manifeſts the beautiful unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and true goſpel ſimplicity of the doctrines, worſhip, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of that people, free from all the carnal inventions of men; and alſo contains a full anſwer to every objection brought againſt them. At the ſame time it may be diſcovered, that many ſtriking ſentiments, with which ſome late authors have enriched their works, were borrowed from the Apology.</note>]</p>
            <q>
               <p>Firſt, We renounce all natural power and ability, to bring us out of our loſt and fallen condition; and confeſs, that as of ourſelves we are able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good; ſo neither can we procure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, or juſtification by any act of our
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018525_0012_0FA7AD46B6E43F00"/>own, ſo as to merit or draw it as a debt from God due to us; but we acknowledge all to be of and from his love, which is the original and fundamental cauſe of our acceptance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God <hi>manifeſted</hi> this <hi>love towards us</hi> in the ſending of his beloved <hi>Son the Lord Jeſus Chriſt into the world,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John. iv. 9.</note>

                  <note n="**" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 23.</note> therefore all have need of this Saviour, to remove the wrath of God from them, due to their offences: In this reſpect he is truly ſaid to have borne in his own body, <hi>the iniquities of us all;</hi>

Neither do we think that remiſſion of ſins is to be expected, ſought, or obtained any other way, or by any works or ſacrifice whatſoever. So then, Chriſt by his death and ſufferings, <hi>when we were enemies, reconciled us to God,</hi>
                  <note n="*†" place="bottom">Rom. v. 10.</note> God is willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our iniquities, and to accept us; as is well expreſſed by the Apoſtle Paul, <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</hi>
                  <note n="††" place="bottom">Cor. v. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We conſider then, our redemption in a twofold reſpect, both which in their own nature are perfect, though in their application the one is not, nor can be, without reſpect to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:018525_0013_0FA7AD4787FE3038"/>
The firſt is the redemption performed by Chriſt, in his crucified body without us: the other is the redemption wrought by Chriſt within us; which no leſs properly is accounted redemption than the former. The firſt then, is that whereby a man, as he ſtands in the fall, is put into a capacity of ſalvation, and hath conveyed unto him a meaſure of that power, ſpirit, and grace, that was in Chriſt Jeſus; which, as the free gift of God, is able to counter-balance, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and root out the evil ſeed, wherewith we are naturally leavened.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is that, whereby we witneſs his pure and perfect redemption in ourſelves, purifying and redeeming us from the power of corruption, and bringing us into unity, favor, and friendſhip with God. By the firſt of theſe two, we that were loſt in Adam; plunged into the bitter and corrupt ſeed, unable of ourſelves to do any good thing, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally united to evil, forward and propenſe to all iniquity, ſervants and ſlaves to the power and ſpirit of darkneſs, are, notwithſtanding all this, ſo far <hi>reconciled to God, by the death of his Son,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. v. 10.</note> that we are put into a capacity of ſalvation, having the glad tidings of the goſpel of peace offered unto us in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>By the ſecond, we witneſs this capacity "brought into act, whereby receiving the light, ſpirit and grace of Chriſt revealed in us, we poſſeſs a real, inward redemption from the power and nature of ſin; and ſo come to be truly redeemed, juſtified, made righteous, and to a ſpiritual union with God." Thus <hi>he gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. ii. 14.</note> And thus <hi>we know him and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable to his death.</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Phil. iii. 10.</note>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Hence may clearly appear what a manifeſt miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation it is, to charge the people called Quakers
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018525_0014_0FA7AD484B45F898"/>with denying the fall of man, and his recovery by Chriſt. And they equally injure them, who aſſert, that they hold 'Juſtification by works,' when they aſcribe the whole of man's redemption to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The fourth objection to the tenth propoſition, which treats of the miniſtry is, that in ſuffering women to preach, 'There is a manifeſt difference between Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm and Chriſtianity.' And to ſupport this charge, there are two texts of ſcripture produced, which are the only ones that <hi>ſeem</hi> to ſerve the purpoſe; but that they are not uſed in their true ſignification, I hope fully to demonſtrate. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, that the ſilence which the Apoſtle enjoins, is, <hi>not aſking queſtions in the church,</hi> is evident from a great variety of particulars, as well as from the context. Pleaſe to read the chapter, and mark the connection. The Apoſtle had been treating of the gift of tongues, and of perſons propheſying one after another. There is reaſon to conclude, that in theſe public aſſemblies, there were people of different nations, as was the caſe on the day of Pentecoſt, and that one Miniſter had the gift of one tongue, and a ſecond of another, in the ſame diverſity, that they had the other miraculous gifts. For, that they all had not an univerſal knowledge of all languages, is clear from the Apoſtle Paul's words, <hi>I ſpeak with tongues more than you all.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 18</note> How reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then is this concluſion, that there were a few inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive women in the aſſembly, who, not underſtanding what the preacher was then delivering, but prompted by curioſity, [perhaps from a better motive] might have aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed queſtions, to the interruption of the ſpeaker and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory? Therofore the Apoſtle gives this admonition, <hi>Let your women</hi> [Gr. wives] <hi>keep ſilence, and if they will learn any thing, let them aſk their huſbands at home, for it is a ſhame for them to ſpeak</hi> [that is to aſk queſtions] <hi>in the church.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">verſe 34, 35.</note> The injunction, for <hi>wives to aſk their huſbands at home,</hi> clearly ſhews that the prohibition was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018525_0015_0FA7AD4900694D08"/>not a general one, and that it muſt be confined to aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtions; for what had aſking <hi>their huſbands at home</hi> to do with their preaching? It ſeems a reflection on an inſpired writer, to ſuppoſe he wrote ſo inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively. I think, therefore, that the expoſition I have given, is eaſy and natural, does no violence to any part of the paſſage, and prevents one ſcripture from mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating againſt another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the publication of the firſt edition,</note> I have ſeen the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious J. Locke's paraphraſe on the Epiſtles, and was pleaſed to find, that he has given the ſame expoſition on this paſſage.</p>
            <p>In his comment on 1 Cor. xiv. 34, 35. He ſays, <q>As to your women, let them keep ſilence in your aſſemblies, for it is not permitted them to diſcourſe there, that does no way ſuit their ſtate of ſubjection. But if they have a mind to have any thing explained to them, that paſſes in the Church, let them, for their information, aſk their huſbands at home; for it is a ſhame for women to diſcourſe and debate with men publicly in the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>comment be rejected, how ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the following ſcriptures with the common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of that paſſage? <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons, and your daughters ſhall propheſy.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Joel ii. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Philip had four daughters who propheſied.</hi>

3. To theſe ſtriking, and I think unanſwerable ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the objector only propoſes a very harmleſs queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'But how do you prove, that propheſying in any of theſe places means preaching?'</p>
            <p>I anſwer, This is an eaſy way of getting free from difficulties; for, if I miſtake not, the proof lay at his own door; and before he drew the haſty concluſion, <q>Here is a manifeſt difference between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity, he ſhould have proved that propheſying in any of theſe places <hi>does not</hi> mean preaching.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But as the whole is reſted on this ſingle point, I ſhall attempt to prove, that propheſying generally means preaching, and that in thoſe places we are more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned in, it has no other ſignification.</p>
            <p>And, Firſt, The apoſtle has joined praying and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying together; and as praying in public aſſemblies, (for of ſuch he was treating) is univerſally allowed to be a part, and indeed a very principal part of the miniſterial office; and women did exerciſe this part of the miniſterial function, in being the mouth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to God; we have here, at leaſt, a preſumptive proof, that propheſying means preaching; and, I think, a demonſtration, that the ſpeaking in the church, which the apoſtle reproves in women, muſt be wholly confined to aſking queſtions; otherwiſe it would be a prohibition againſt their praying, as well as preaching. For how could women pray in public, if it were a ſhame for them to ſpeak in the Church, in the ſenſe wherein it is generally underſtood?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The apoſtle when he uſes the word, preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixes the meaning thereof. <hi>He that propheſieth, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. He that propheſieth, edifieth the church.</hi>

And that there was nothing of an extraordinary nature in the propheſying, which the apoſtle treats of throughout the whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have been conſidering, may be learned from the cloſe of it; for the church was to judge of what was delivered. <hi>Let the prophets ſpeak, two or three; and let the others judge.</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Should it be granted, that it does not mean preaching, it makes the caſe worſe; for then it muſt have been ſomething greater, as the apoſtle informs us: <hi>Greater is he that propheſieth, than he that ſpeaketh with tongues.</hi>
               <note n="††" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 5.</note>And he exhorts them, <hi>Deſire ſpiritual gifts, but rather that ye may propheſy.</hi>
               <note n="‡‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 1.</note> Hereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that propheſying was above all the miraculous gifts, which abounded in that church. So that there is but this alternative, if they are not allowed to be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, then we make them extraordinary miniſters.</p>
            <p>Some perſons, when they have been cloſely preſſed, have ſought for refuge, by granting that theſe women, who propheſied, were called to an extraordinary work; which, I think, is giving up the whole point at once, as it grants more than is contended for. And hence
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018525_0018_0FA7AD4B48677958"/>we may infer, according to the well eſtabliſhed rule, He that is called to a greater, may be called to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior work.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſhould it be granted, that propheſying means foretelling things to come, an inſurmountable difficulty yet remains; for, if it was unlawful for women, who had that gift, to ſpeak in the church, how were they to communicate what was revealed to them? If by ſpeaking, what could this be termed, but the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preaching?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The ſimple fact ſeems to be this, that tho' propheſying ſometimes means predicting, or foretelling things to come, yet in the places which I have quoted, it only means preaching in the common acceptation of the word; and whenever it is uſed in the<note n="*" place="bottom">The much admired M. Henry, in his comment on Acts ii. 18.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it in both theſe ſenſes, and, I think, he is alſo full to the point, reſpecting the lawfulneſs of womens preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <q>By the Spirit they ſhall be enabled to foretel things to come, and to preach the Goſpel, without diſtinction of ſex, not only your ſons, but your daughters; without diſtinction of age, both your young men, and old men; and without diſtinction of outward condition, even the ſervants and handmaids ſhall propheſy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>J. Locke, in his paraphraſe on the Chapter we are treating of, gives another ſenſe in which the word Propheſy is to be underſtood. <q>When any one (ſays he) ſung to God, by the immediate motion, and impulſe of the Holy Ghoſt, which was one of the actions called propheſying, they ſung alone. And indeed how could it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? For who could join with a perſon ſo propheſying in things dictated to him alone by the Holy Ghoſt?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee the nature of ſinging in the primitive Church. former ſenſe, it always includes preaching, as publiſhing theſe predictions to thoſe concerned. Hence, under the law, ſuch perſons were ſtiled Nebiaim, prophets, (from Ba, which ſignifies to come, and to go) becauſe of their coming and going between God and the people. So under the goſpel-diſpenſation, they are called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, (from <hi>pro,</hi> and <hi>phemi,</hi> dico, I ſpeak, or utter forth) becauſe Miniſters are the Lord's meſſengers, to publiſh his word of reconciliation to the people. <hi>He hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 19.</note> is the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018525_0019_0FA7AD4BEDEDA8F0"/>language of an inſpired apoſtle; and therefore he adds, <hi>We pray you, in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other ſcripture, <hi>I ſuffer not a woman to teach, or uſurp authority over the man,</hi> has no relation to public teaching, but to her private character, which is very evident from the context. In this ſenſe J. Locke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it. Treating of 1 Cor. xi. 34. and 1 Tim. ii. 11. He ſays, <q>What in the one is expreſſed, by keeping ſilence; and not ſpeaking, but being under obedience, in the other is called, being in ſilence with all ſubjection, not teaching nor uſurping authority over the man. I apply the prohibition of ſpeaking only to reaſoning and purely voluntary diſcourſe, but ſuppoſe a liberty left women to ſpeak, where they had an immediate revelation and impulſe from the Spirit of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. I might have taken a ſhorter method to convince ſome perſons, that there is nothing unlawful in women's preaching, by ſaying, there are ſeveral female teachers in the Methodiſt ſociety; and hence I concluded, in the beginning of this letter, that the objector has chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his ſentiments in this particular. If he has not, there ſeems <hi>a manifeſt</hi> inconſiſtency in his ſuffering women to preach.</p>
            <p>The eleventh propoſition treats of religious Worſhip, of which Barclay ſays, <q>All true worſhip to God is offered in the inward and immediate moving of his own Spirit, and all worſhip, which man ſets about in his <hi>own</hi> will, is will-worſhip.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is well worthy my friend's particular notice, that altho' the writer of that letter objects to, yet he grants the whole of this propoſition, when, adopting Barclay's words, he ſays, 'It is true indeed,' <q>That all true worſhip to God is offered in the inward and immediate moving of his own Spirit,</q> 
               <q>and that we cannot truly worſhip God, unleſs his Spirit move or incline our hearts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:018525_0020_0FA7AD4EF4413668"/>
If ſo, the diſpute is at an end; as all that Barclay contended for, is granted.</p>
            <p>The objector's deſinition of inſpiration is this. <q>God moves man, whom he has made a reaſonable creature, according to the reaſon he has given him, He moves him by his underſtanding, as well as his affections, by light, as well as by heat. He moves him to do this or that by conviction, full as often as by deſire. And he does truly move you to preach, when in his light you ſee light, clearly ſatisfying you it is his will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I reply, Let the Holy Spirit move the heart in what manner he is pleaſed; for, I believe, that when the 'af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections' are divinely moved, ſo is the 'underſtanding;' and when there is divine 'heat,' 'light' and 'convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,' are its inſeparable attendants. But this moving of the Spirit on the minds of men muſt be conſidered, as ſomething which we have not at our own command, but is diſtinct from, and very ſuperior to, the mere exerciſe of the rational faculties. This diſtinction, I think, the objector has not ſufficiently attended to, or he would not have given us, what appears to me, an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of the ſubject, which explains away the very nature of inſpiration. He ſays, <q>You are as really moved by the Spirit, when God convinces you, you ought to feed him that is hungry, as when he gives you ever ſo ſtrong a deſire, impulſe, or inclination.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, If this aſſertion is confined to the action of feeding the hungry, or to any other civil or relative duty, it is an undoubted truth. But if it is intended to illuſtrate the doctrine of inſpiration, I object to it as very foreign to that ſubject, as it confounds things of a very diſſimilar nature. The fallacy of this way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning lies, in taking for granted, that they are ſimilar caſes, and conſequently, that there is no more need of divine inſpiration, to qualify us to worſhip the divine Majeſty, or preach the Goſpel, than to feed the hungry; the reverſe of which appears to be the truth; for I know it to be my duty at all times to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed; nor
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018525_0021_0FA7AD4FC8AA5A70"/>need I wait to be moved by the Holy Spirit to enable me to perform an action, which is in the power of bad as well as good men. But the caſe is widely different with regard to religious worſhip, or preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which require very different qualifications. The ſcriptures inform us, that <hi>we know not what to pray for as we ought:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom viii. 26.</note> And that <hi>the preparation of the heart, in man is from the Lord.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xvi. 1.</note> Whereas the above illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, as well as the practice of the objector, ſeem to inculcate this doctrine, That without immediate divine inſpiration, we are as well qualified at any time to pray or preach, as to feed the hungry. To this kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, I apprehend, there is not any infidel, who can have the leaſt objection.</p>
            <p>But how does this agree with his aſſertion, <q>God truly does move you to preach, when in his light you ſee light, clearly ſatisfying you it is his will?</q> Has Barclay ſaid any thing ſtronger on the ſubject? The queſtion therefore is, ſhould any, ſtand up to preach, without this <hi>clear ſatisfying light?</hi> Several perſons have frankly acknowledged to me, that they have attempted to preach, when not only this <hi>clear light</hi> has been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but when they have had a clear ſenſe of being diſqualified for the work; and have bewailed the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity they were under, of acting contrary to their own judgment. And this, I believe, (for I ſpeak from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) muſt frequently be the caſe with well-meaning men, who ſit or unfit, are in the practice of preaching at certain ſtated times. I fear there are others, who are ſtrangers to, feel no want of, and therefore do not wait for the divine aid, to qualify them for this great work. To ſuch perſons the words of our Lord, on a ſimilar oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, are quite pertinent, <hi>My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">John vii. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again: If that only is <q>true worſhip, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God, when his Spirit moves and inclines our hearts,</q> it naturally follows, that all other worſhip,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018525_0022_0FA7AD5076A31750"/>which is performed when the heart is not thus moved and inclined, muſt be falſe worſhip. It is therefore our indiſpenſable duty, to wait till his Spirit move and incline our hearts, without which we ſhall fall under the charge, <hi>This people draweth nigh to me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xv. 8.</note> Therefore it is that we have ſo many ſolemn cautions againſt inconſiderately ruſhing into the preſence of the Lord. <hi>Keep thy foot,</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>when thou goeſt to the houſe of God.</hi>
               <note n="††" place="bottom">Eccleſ. v. i.</note> That is, let thy mind be deeply and awfully ſenſible of the perfections of the ſupreme Majeſty, in whoſe preſence angels veil their faces, and in ſilent adoration bow before him. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; for God is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">ver. 2.</note> What a check, and juſt reproof is this to the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the creature, who, without waiting for divine aid, which qualifies for <hi>worſhipping the Lord in the beauty of holineſs,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">1. Chron. xvi. 29.</note> preſumes like <hi>Nadab and Abihu, to offer ſtrange fire before the Lord!</hi>
               <note n="†*" place="bottom">Lev. x. i.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we ſee the duty and reaſonableneſs of ſilent waiting on the Lord, as <hi>the preparation of the heart is from him,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xvi. i.</note> without which we ſhall incur the cenſure of <hi>offering unto God the ſacrifice of fools.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Eccleſ v. i.</note> This is ſtrongly inforced in the following words: <hi>We know not what to pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itſelf maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that ſearcheth the heart, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the ſaints according to the will of God.</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 26.27.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But of this ſilent waiting the writer of that letter aſſerts, <q>In this there is a manifeſt difference between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity. This is will-worſhip, if there be any ſuch thing under heaven. For there is neither command nor example for it in ſcripture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:018525_0023_0FA7AD513373E000"/>
I anſwer, This is merely begging the queſtion. For, if there is ſuch a <q>manifeſt difference between Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm and Chriſtianity,</q> in this particular, then ſome ſcripture condemns it, which ſcripture ſhould have been produced. But ſhould it be granted (which I muſt deny) that <q>there is neither command nor example for it in ſcripture;</q> yet unhappily this proves too much, and may be retorted with greater ſucceſs, that there is neither command nor example,' under the Goſpel-diſpenſation, for <hi>liturgies, ſinging men, organs,</hi> and all thoſe ſuperfluous ornaments, which have been borrowed from the Church of Rome, and are diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to the ſimplicity of the goſpel, being the inventions of men, and introduced into the Church in the times of apoſtacy, to ſupply the want of the divine preſence. We may therefore ſafely conclude, <q>This is will-worſhip, if there be any ſuch thing under heaven;</q> for there is neither command nor example for it in ſcripture; nor did it take place in any Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian aſſembly, till the inward <hi>glory</hi> had, in ſome degree <hi>departed</hi> from it.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. iv. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. All the objections, that are brought againſt this ſilent waiting on the Lord, ariſe from not rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the true nature of religious worſhip; which may be juſtly defined, a ſimple act of the mind; and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts, are at beſt, only ſo many outward expreſſions thereof.</p>
            <p>If this be granted, which, I think, is ſelf-evident, it will follow, that as there may be external acts of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which do not ariſe from the internal actings of the quickened foul, ſo, on the contrary, the mind may be reverently exerciſed in divine worſhip, when there are not any verbal expreſſions. Thus our bleſſed Maſter defines the nature of all true worſhip: <hi>God is a ſpirit; and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John iv. 24.</note> It therefore highly concerns all, who deſire to worſhip the divine Being acceptably, to beware of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018525_0024_0FA7AD52461115D8"/>
               <hi>ſparks of their own kindling,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. 1. xi.</note> and of the too common, but fatal deception, in ſuppoſing divine worſhip to conſiſt in mere outward acts, while the heart remains inſenſible of theſe divine feelings, contrition for ſin, poverty of ſpirit, and filial gratitude to the Father of mercies. If we are deſtitute of theſe diſpoſitions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſpecious our performances may appear, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever frequent we may be in the uſe of them, we ſhall only reſemble the carnal Jews, who fancied, that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conſiſted in the ſplendor of their temple, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of devotion, while they neglected to cultivate that rectitude of mind, which renders our offerings acceptable in the ſight of the divine Being.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From what has been ſaid, I think it is evident, that the neceſſity of ſilent waiting upon the Lord has its foundation in the nature and fitneſs of things. For, as it is the <hi>Holy Spirit which helps our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> and <hi>we know not what to pray for as we ought,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 26.</note> till we are thus aſſiſted; it follows, that <q>we cannot truly worſhip God, unleſs his Spirit move and incline our hearts;</q> a ſilent waiting therefore, for the moving of the Holy Spirit is not only reaſonable, but our indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty; and the not waiting for this divine aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, before we begin, any act of religious worſhip, is no leſs abſurd, than it would have been for a diſeaſed perſon, at the <hi>pool of Betheſda,</hi> to have ſtepped into the water before the <hi>angel came down to trouble it.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">John v. 4.</note> So that were the ſcriptures perfectly ſilent on this head, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the duty fully evinces its expediency. And I may ſafely add, that all thoſe, who are unacquainted with that reverential awe, which expreſſes itſelf in the ſilent breathings of the ſoul, in humble gratitude, to the Author of our being; and is what the ſcripture emphatically ſtyles, <hi>pouring out the ſoul before the Lord,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. i. 15.</note> are but outward-court worſhippers, who have not yet entered into <hi>the holy of holies.</hi>

I confeſs, that to natural, and I fear, to ſome who are called ſpiritual men, it appears the fooliſhneſs of folly, to ſee a congregation waiting upon God in ſilence; and therefore they are ready to condemn, and ſpeak evil of that which they do not underſtand; ſo true is the declaration of an inſpired writer, <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 14.</note> Whereas to the englight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened mind, it appears not only ſcriptural, but highly rational, and is at once an acknowledgment of all the divine perfections; the omniſcience, omnipreſence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, and boundleſs goodneſs of our gracious Creator and Benefactor; as well as of our entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on, and expectation of receiving ſpiritual good, immediately from him.

4. All that the objector hath urged, reſpecting the lawfulneſs of appointing times and places for public worſhip, falls to the ground, and only proves that he has miſtaken Barclay's meaning in theſe particulars; for the uniform practice of the people called Quakers, from the beginning, hath fully teſtified, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as a duty to appoint times and places for their religious aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>Many perſons alſo greatly miſapprehend Barclay, in ſuppoſing, that he pleads for entirely ſilent meetings, when he only pleads for a retired waiting for the divine aid, which alone qualifies to pray or preach.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us now more minutely conſider preaching, as it cannot properly be ſtyled worſhip; and yet ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant are the generality of mankind, that it is looked upon as almoſt the whole of religious worſhip: And at the ſame time ſo vitiated is the taſte of many profeſſors, that they cannot diſtinguiſh <hi>the chaff</hi> from <hi>the wheat;</hi>

            <p>From theſe paſſages of ſcripture we may infer the following particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That their diſcourſes were not premeditated; but they delivered to the people what was immediately
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018525_0027_0FA7AD55CFAB3330"/>given them from the Lord; ſo that in truth, they could ſay, <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And the things which we declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, <hi>we have heard, we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John i. ver. 1.3.</note> even that living word manifeſted in the heart, which David compares to fire; for, ſaith he, <hi>While I was muſing the fire burned, then ſpake I with my tongue.</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">Pſalm. xxxix. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As they <hi>propheſied one by one,</hi> there muſt have been ſome time of ſilence, to prevent two or three ſpeaking at once.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The preſent mode of one man's preaching for an hour, without the Goſpel privilege of admitting as many as are moved by the Lord to deliver his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, was not known among the firſt miniſters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The practice of the people called Quakers, in the miniſtration of the word, correſponds in all theſe particulars, with the conduct of the primitive miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And, if it is not too abſurd an idea, let my friend pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to himſelf, one of the Apoſtles writing down his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; conning over ſome old commentator;—picking out a ſentence, here and there; committing them to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; —and then retailing them to his auditory for the word of God.—But I have done;—as the very ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo abſurd, that to name it, is ſufficient!—For theſe miniſters were to be ſo led and influenced by the Holy Spirit, that they were enjoined, <hi>Take no thought, how or what ye ſhall ſpeak for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. x. 19.</note> And as all true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſtand on the ſame foundation, having the ſame commiſſion, as well as the ſame gracious promiſe, <hi>Lo, I am with you alway to the end of the world;</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018525_0028_0FA7AD56ABF8AEF0"/>and dependence on the Lord; ſpeaking <hi>from the ability which God giveth, and not in the enticing words of man's wiſdom.</hi>
               <note n="|" place="bottom">1. Cor. ii. 4.</note> Or as the Apoſtle has it in the ſame chapter, <hi>Which things we ſpeak, not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth.</hi>

The former under the divine influence, publiſhing the counſel of God, <hi>in the demonſtration of the ſpirit;</hi> the other only amuſing the people with his own inventions. Biſhop Tillotſon makes a pertinent remark, which is quite applicable to the laſt claſs. <q>Speculative men wrought a great part of their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity out of their own brains, as ſpiders do cobwebs out of their own bowels.</q>

            <p>Their characters are ſtrikingly contraſted in another inſtance: The one having <hi>freely received,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. x. 8.</note> according to his Lord's command, and the example of true miniſters, freely communicates to the people. The other whom our Lord calls an <hi>hireling,</hi>

            <p>And they are very conſpicuous in a fourth particular. Our Lord having drawn a ſtriking picture of the true and falſe Teacher; Of the latter he ſays, <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to walk in long robes,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The twelfth propoſition treats of Baptiſm, on which Barclay obſerves, "That as there is but <hi>one Lord and one Faith,</hi> ſo there is but <hi>one Baptiſm.</hi>"<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph iv. 5.</note> And that this <hi>one Baptiſm</hi> is not an outward one of water, I think he very fully demonſtrates.</p>
            <p>To which propoſition, the writer of that letter objects, 'Yea, one outward Baptiſm which you deny.' <q>Here therefore is another difference between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:018525_0030_0FA7AD57EFD6B058"/>
I reply, That this way of proving things, by ſimply affirming, or denying, is very far from being ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and yet I cannot find any thing elſe offered as a proof here.</p>
            <p>But as this is a ſubject of conſiderable moment, and ſeveral perſons, not rightly underſtanding it, have run into great errors themſelves, and at the ſame time have charged the people called Quakers with being <q>no Chriſtians;</q> it may be neceſſary to examine this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the bottom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Since <hi>life and immortality are brought to light by the Goſpel,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. i. 10.</note> there is an end to all ſhadows, ſigns and figures, <hi>which were</hi> only <hi>impoſed 'till the time of reformation.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 10.</note> Thus I underſtand our bleſſed Lord, in his converſation with the woman of Samaria, <hi>Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father. God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">John iv. 21, 24.</note> A plain intimation of the intire removal of all types and ſhadows, they being no longer neceſſary, when the ſubſtance is come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is confeſſed on all hands, that Water Baptiſm is only a ſign, or figure. And the ſign, and thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, are two diſtinct things. This is granted by the objector. For I ſuppoſe, when he ſays, <q>Yea, one outward Baptiſm,</q> he would not be underſtood, that this 'outward Baptiſm' of water, was the <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> which the Apoſtle intended. And yet he muſt do this, or hold two Baptiſms. R. Barclay makes this <hi>one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> an inward Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector allows this inward one, but ſays, <q>Yea, one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm,</q> in direct oppoſition to the Apoſtle's aſſertion, <hi>one Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That water-baptiſm was not inſtituted by Chriſt, as ſome ignorantly affirm, is very clear, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018525_0031_0FA7AD58B2BF1E90"/>that it was uſed by John, before our Lord made his public appearance. Not only ſo, but it is well known, by thoſe who are acquainted with the Jewiſh cuſtoms, that it was one of their ceremonies; therefore calling it, "an inſtitution of Chriſt," tends to miſlead the ignorant, and is contrary to truth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Taking things for granted, without examination, is the reaſon that ſome not only ſay, <q>It is an inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of Chriſt,</q> but that he commanded it, when he commiſſioned his diſciples to <hi>go and teach all nations, baptizing them in</hi> (or, as ſome render it, <hi>into</hi>) <hi>the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Math. xxviii. 10.</note> This, I grant, is Chriſt's baptiſm; but look at the text, and ſee if water is mentioned in it. That nothing of ſuch an outward, ſuperficial nature could be intended by our Lord, is evident from the nature of his ſuperior diſpenſation, which is all <hi>ſpirit and life.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John vi. 63.</note> Nor is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that our Lord ſhould aboliſh ſome ſhadows and outward figures, and ſubſtitute others. I conſider therefore the baptiſm enjoined by the Founder of the Chriſtian religion, as contra-diſtinguiſhed to, and eſſentially different from John's. The one outward, of water; the other inward, by the Holy Ghoſt. Were it not that the <hi>covering or veil is ſpread over all nations,</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Iſa xxv. 7.</note> and that the <hi>natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 14.</note> we ſhould marvel that the words of Chriſt have been ſo commonly interpreted in the moſt groſs and outward ſenſe; eſpecially in this inſtance, as John the Baptiſt in the cleareſt manner diſtinguiſhes between water-baptiſm, and the baptiſm of Chriſt. <hi>I indeed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>baptize you with water; but he ſhall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">Math. iii. 11.</note> And this exactly agrees with the prophecy of Malachi, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying of the Lord Jeſus, whom he ſtyles, <hi>The Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the covenant,</hi> he adds, <hi>For he is like a reſiner's fire, and like fuller's ſoap.</hi>
               <note n="††" place="bottom">Mal. iii. 1.2.</note> So his people know him, when by <hi>the brightneſs of his</hi> glorious inward <hi>appearance,</hi> he
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018525_0032_0FA7AD598342F218"/>
               <hi>conſumes the man of ſin;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſſ. ii. 8.</note> and they feeling the painful operation, pointed out by the expreſſive emblem of fire, are ready to aſk, in the ſtriking language of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming! And who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth! When he ſits as a refiner, and purifier of ſilver,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mal. iii. 3.</note>not to deſtroy, but to <hi>purge them as gold and ſilver, from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. vii. 1.</note> for this great and gracious purpoſe, <hi>that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in rightcouſneſs.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Mal. iii. 3.</note> The parallel text to this, and which ſeems to be a beautiful illuſtration of it, we find in the prophecy of Ezekiel, which contains a gracious promiſe of that change of heart, which is productive of all holy tempers, as well as uniformity of conduct. The paſſage is peculiarly expreſſive, and may every mind not only diſcover its beauty, but earneſtly deſire to experience the full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of theſe words, <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean; from all your filthineſs, and from all your idols will I cleanſe you. A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you; and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſt, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxvi. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Here our Lord's words appear in their true, ſpiritual meaning, <hi>Go, teach all nations.</hi> That is, inſtruct them fully into the great and gracious deſigns, for which the Son of God was manifeſted; and <hi>baptize them into the name,</hi> that is, into the nature <hi>of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               <note n="††" place="bottom">Math. xxviii. 19.</note> This interpretation ſeems to be confirmed by the words of the apoſtle Peter: <hi>And as I began to ſpeak, the Holy Ghoſt fell on them. Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he ſaid, John indeed baptized with water; but ye ſhall be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If it be objected, <q>That to baptize in this ſenſe of the word, is the office of the Holy Spirit,</q> I anſwer it is true; but miniſters may be ſaid to baptize inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018525_0033_0FA7AD5A2F3C73F8"/>and in this ſenſe we muſt underſtand the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Paul, when he ſays, <hi>I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To call any thing ſhort of this, the baptiſm of Chriſt, muſt prove, and indeed has proved a fatal miſtake to many. For multitudes have erred, by falſely conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that as they had been ſprinkled with water in their infancy, or immerged when adults, they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by "regenerate, and grafted into Chriſt's Church,"<note n="**" place="bottom">In the office of Baptiſm uſed by the national church, it is taken for granted, that all who are ſprinkled with water, are thereby "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and grafted into the church of Chriſt."

            <p n="5">5. That water baptiſm was ſometimes uſed in the Apoſtles days, is not denied; and it is equally true, that circumciſion, and ſome other parts of the ceremonial law, were not only in uſe, but pleaded for, by weak Chriſtians.

1. That as our bleſſed Lord was born under the law, he became ſubject to all its rites and ceremonies. His laſt act therefore, was the obſervance of the paſſover; ſo that this was no new inſtitution, but as one of the Evangeliſts informs us, <hi>eating the paſſover with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark xiv. 14.</note> which is confirmed by our Lord's words while they partook of the ſupper: <hi>With deſire I have deſired to eat this paſſover with you before I ſuffer.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xxii. 15.</note> And as it was the common practice for the maſter of the feaſt, after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to take bread and the cup, and after giving thanks to God, to diſtribute them among the gueſts, our bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Maſter conformed thereto, deſiring them to do that act in remembrance of him. Had it been a duty to be continued amongſt Chriſtians, no doubt but our bleſſed Lord would have been more explicit; for, from what then paſſed, as recorded by the Evangeliſts, we can only conſider the command as confined to that ſingle action performed by the Apoſtles.

            <p n="2">2. Whether it is the duty of all Chriſtians to be found in the practice of the ſupper, may be anſwered by aſking another queſtion.</p>
            <p>We are informed, that our divine Maſter, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the ſupper, <hi>poured water into a baſon,</hi> and waſhed the Diſciples feet, and then ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye call me Maſter and Lord! and ye ſay well, for ſo I am. If I then, your Lord and Maſter, have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">John xiii. 13, 14, 15.</note> Here we have both the precept and example of our Lord, for feet-waſhing, in a much more explicit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner laid down, than that of the ſupper. Is it not then, the indiſpenſable duty of all Chriſtians to be found in the practi of it?</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are very much attached to outward ceremonies, anſwer this queſtion, by ſaying, <q>That it was only a figure, by which our Lord deſigned to teach his followers the important doctrines of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and benevolence towards each other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And is there not the ſame reaſon for concluding with R. Barclay, that <q>the breaking of bread by Chriſt with his diſciples, was a figure,</q> by which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſtruct all his followers in the neceſſity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018525_0038_0FA7AD60F86DF410"/>eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood? As he has expreſsly declared, <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John vi. 53.</note> And to guard againſt a groſs, carnal ſenſe, which ſome nave put on theſe words, our Lord added, <hi>The fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing; the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit and they are life.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">ver. 63.</note> And which is fully explained, when he ſays, <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Why our Lord's words, in one place muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a figurative ſenſe, conveying ſpiritual truths to the mind; and in another place, be interpreted in the moſt groſs and outward ſignification, is ſomething myſterious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But it has been pleaded, that <q>the Apoſtles, who are ſuppoted to have known the mind of their Maſter, were in the practice of water-baptiſm, and the Lord's ſupper.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, This ſeems to be the ſtrongeſt argument, which can be urged in favor of them; but that it is not impregnable, will appear by conſidering the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars: Firſt, Should it be granted that the Apoſtles were in the uſe of them, it will not follow, that it becomes a duty to us; as nothing can be a duty without a divine precept; <hi>For where no law is, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle Paul's practice and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>I bapized Criſpus and Gaius, and the houſhold of Stephanas; beſides, I know not whether I baptized any other. For Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the goſpel,</hi> quite overturns the argument.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This argument falls under its own weight, as it proves too much: For, agreeably to this way of proving things, feet-waſhing; anointing with oil; love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſts;
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018525_0039_0FA7AC0FE8B2C708"/>ſaluting each other with the kiſs of charity; having all things in common; yea, and cirumciſion itſelf; muſt all he introduced into the church, as they were in uſe with the Apoſtles; which may be ſeen by conſulting the Texts in the margin.<note n="*" place="bottom">Tim. v. 10.

            <p>The fifteenth propoſition which is objected to, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from Chriſtianity, is moſt of all ſurpriſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that writer himſelf, as far as he went, has borne a true teſtimony againſt the the evil of conformity to this world. But why it ſhould be criminal, to conform to the world in dreſs, and yet make <q>a manifeſt difference between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity,</q> becauſe that people teſtify, that the world is equally evil in its cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and language, muſt appear myſterious to every thinking mind; and the moſt favorable conſtruction that can be put upon it, is to ſay, the writer's own mind has not attained to the clearneſs of the <hi>perfect day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It appears to me, that he has not done Barclay juſtice, in fixing only upon the word, <hi>thou;</hi> detaching it from the connection in which it ſtood; and then holding it up as a ſcare-crow, as tho' he made the whole of the plain language to conſiſt in uſing <hi>thou</hi> inſtead of <hi>you.</hi> Whereas it is the very ſmalleſt and loweſt link in the chain. And I am fully ſatisfied, that ſhould any one ſingle out from the objector's writings, ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſentence, quite detached from its connection, and then ridicule it, every candid mind would diſapprove ſuch treatment. Let me, out of many, ſelect a ſingle inſtance, which ſeems full to the point. The objector has wrote againſt conforming to the world in dreſs, and pointed out the danger of an imitation in the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſaying, <q>A ruffle, from one, may grow to twelve inches.</q> Now ſhould any perſon ſingle out this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, taking no notice of its connection, but in a kind of triumph, exclaim, Where do the ſcriptures forbid wearing a ruffle? <q>The placing religion in ſuch things
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018525_0040_0FA7AC10A8011E90"/>as theſe, is ſuch egregious triſling, as naturally tends to make religion ſtink in the noſtrils of Inſidels and Heathens.</q> Were any perſon thus to expoſe this well-deſigned caution to contempt, every fair reaſoner would condemn ſuch a procedure.</p>
            <p>And yet this very thing the objector is guilty of. Barclay has proved to a demonſtration, the apoſtacy of the Chriſtian world; and, among other things, that its preſent language and cuſtoms, are inconſiſtent with the ſimplicity, truth, and purity of the Goſpel. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute therefore, is not about the ſingle pronoun <hi>thou,</hi> whether it is more ſcriptural and grammatical, to uſe it to a ſingle perſon than <hi>you,</hi> for this is very obvious to all, who are not blinded by cuſtom or prejudice. For, after all the torturing of invention, to make <hi>you</hi> to a ſingle perſon proper, it can never be done, as it deſtroys the juſt and neceſſary diſtinction between the ſecond perſon ſingular and plural.</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>you</hi> to a ſingle perſon, was evil in its origin, being invented to ſlatter the vanity of one of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperors, by addreſſing him in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as if he was more than mortal.</p>
            <p>It is alſo evil in its nature, as it is contrary to truth to uſe the plural number to one perſon.</p>
            <p>And, it is a departure from that ſcriptural language, uſed by God himſelf, and by all holy men; to a falſe, flattering, heatheniſh language, invented by vile ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, to pleaſe men of corrupt minds.</p>
            <p>But as I hinted, altho' this is a part of the plain language, yet it ſtands connected with ſeveral things of greater importance. Therefore the objector ſhould not have paſſed them, but ought to have proved, if it could be done, that it is quite conſiſtent with <hi>ſpeaking the truth from the heart,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalms xv. 2.</note> to call perſons <q>Maſter and Miſtreſs;</q> and to ſubſcribe ourſelves, their <q>humble
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018525_0041_0FA7AC1169C2B068"/>Servants,</q> when no ſuch relation ſubſiſts between us. Not only ſo, but that it is lawful, indiſcriminately to give to poor, ignorant, ſinful mortals, [and ſome of them the moſt worthleſs characters,] the titles which belong to the ſupreme Being: Such as, "reverend;" "moſt reverend;" "right honorable; "worſhipful;" "majeſty;" "your holineſs, &amp;c." Whether this is <hi>ſpeaking the truth from the heart!</hi> Or, is it not, with a witneſs, giving <hi>flattering titles to men?</hi> Of which, one who lived under a much inferior diſpenſation, ſaid, <hi>I know not to give flattering titles; in ſo doing, my Maker would ſoon take me away.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job. xxxii. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. R. Barclay therefore, concludes, <q>It is not lawful for Chriſtians to give, or receive thoſe titles, your majeſty, your lordſhip, &amp;c.</q> And the reaſon he aſſigns, is, "They alone belong to the ſupreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
            <p>To which it is objected, <q>In this there is a difference between Quakeriſm and Chriſtianity.</q> 
               <q>St. Paul gives the title of Moſt Noble to the Roman Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From this objection we may learn, that it is not only lawful to give theſe titles to men, but alſo, that it is very criminal to withhold them, if it makes us differ from Chriſtianity. This, I think, is a perfectly new diſcovery; and what ſome would term, the oppoſite extreme.</p>
            <p>That Paul once gave the title of <hi>Moſt Noble</hi> to Feſtus, Barclay grants; but adds, <q>He would not have called him ſuch, if he had not been truly noble; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was, in not giving way to the fury of the Jews againſt him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which the writer of the letter objects, <q>The ſcripture ſays quite otherwiſe.</q> 
               <q>That he did give way to the fury of the Jews againſt him, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:018525_0042_0FA7AC1226B2EFC8"/>
If ſeems to me, that the objector is guilty of two miſtakes here. Firſt, In taking for granted, that Feſtus when he aſked Paul, <hi>Wilt thou go to Jeruſalem?</hi> was in the ſecret of the Jews' intention to kill him; which is highly improbable, as the event fully proves. And the ſecond error, is in aſſerting, that the ſcripture ſays, <q>That Feſtus did give way to the fury of the Jews againſt him.</q> I think, the ſcripture ſays the very reverſe. The deſire of the Jews was, that Feſtus would ſend Paul to Jeruſalem. But Paul's requeſt was to go to Rome, to be judged by Caeſar. Let the ſcriptures then decide, to whom Feſtus gave way. His words are theſe: <hi>Haſt thou appealed unto Caeſar? Unto Caeſar thou ſhalt go.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xxv. 12.</note> We may therefore ſafely conclude, that Feſtus acted nobly by Paul, in withſtanding the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful intereſt of <hi>the high-prieſt, and the chief of the Jews, who deſired favor againſt him, that he would ſend him to Jeruſalem.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But it has been objected by others, <q>that the Apoſtles themſelves frequently gave the appellation of Sirs to the people. As, <hi>Sirs, ye ſhould have heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to me. Sirs, be of good cheer,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts xxvii. 21, 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that it is univerſally allowed, that the word [<hi>andres,</hi> viri] rendered Sirs, has no ſuch ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ought to have been tranſlated men, as it is literally, <hi>Men, ye ſhould have hearkened unto me: Men, be of good chear.</hi> There is but one exception to this, throughout the Acts of the Apoſtles. There we are informed, that the awakened jailor, when in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of mind, addreſſed the apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Sirs,</hi> [Gr. Lords] <hi>what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 30.</note> This was his heatheniſh language, which he had not then parted with, but was never uſed by the apoſtles.</p>
            <p>That this corrupt language, and thoſe flattering ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, are not "ſuitable to the ſimplicity and dignity" of a Chriſtian, I can prove from a comment on theſe words,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018525_0043_0FA7AC13945C8640"/>
               <hi>The elder unto the elect Lady;</hi>

            <p>
               <q>Kuria (which our tranſlators have rendered Lady) is undoubtedly a proper name both here, and in verſe 5th. For it was not then uſual to apply the title Lady to any but the Roman Empreſs; neither would ſuch a manner of ſpeaking have been ſuitable to the ſimplicity and dignity of an Apoſtle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two things granted: Firſt, a corruption of language; and, ſecondly, that this corruption of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is incompatible with the "dignity and ſimplicity" of the goſpel diſpenſation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another branch of the plain language conſiſts in a teſtimony againſt that ſpirit of apoſtacy, in departing from the ſimple, ſcriptural language, uſed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by holy men in all ages, in calling months and days by thoſe proper names, which the Almighty gave them; and adopting in the place thereof, thoſe heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, idolatrous names, which were given them in honor of their falſe gods. This will clearly appear, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the origin of ſome of the months, and of all the days of the week, now commonly uſed; and which may be ſeen by conſulting Chambers's and Johnſon's dictionaries, from which I have moſtly borrowed the following remarks, reſpecting the change of the names of months and days.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt month was by the Romans called Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in honor of Janus, an idol with two faces, to whom the firſt day of this month was dedicated by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems, with feaſtings, dancings, maſquerades, &amp;c. In oppoſition to which, the Chriſtians obſerved it as a day of faſting and humiliation.</p>

               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:018525_0044_0FA7AC13A80F43A8"/>
2. The ſecond month, according to an ancient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, was called February, in honor of the Prince of the infernal regions. Pliny informs us, that the firſt twelve days of this month were ſpent in offering ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the infernal powers (devils) to render them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to their deceaſed friends: And as Pluto (the ſuppoſed prince of the infernal regions) was called Februus, in honor of him, this month was called Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third month was by Romulus, one of the Roman Emperors, ſtyled March, in honor of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended father Mars, feigned to be the god of war: He therefore commanded, that religious worſhip ſhould be paid him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth month is ſuppoſed to have been called April, in honor of an imaginary goddeſs, known by the name of Venus, who was worſhipped by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and to whom the moſt abominable, wanton rites were paid.</p>
            <p n="5">. The fifth month is thought by ſome to have been termed May, in honor of the ſenators of Rome. By others it is ſuppoſed to have been called ſo, in honor of Maia, the mother of Mercury, one of the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deities, whom the idolatrous Romans worſhipped.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixth month was ſtyled June, in honor of an heatheniſh goddeſs named Juno.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſeventh month has taken its name July, from Julius Caeſar, one of the Roman Emperors.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The eighth month was called Auguſt, in honor of one of the Roman Emperors, who was ſtyled Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus. The title of Auguſtus (which ſignifies vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſacred, magnificent) was firſt given to Octavius, one of the Emperors, as expreſſive of ſomething divine and elevated in him, above the common pitch of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and from that time all the Roman Emperors were flattered with the title of Auguſtus Caeſar; that is, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, Magnificent</hi> King.</p>

9. September, October, November, and December, are the old numerical Latin names for theſe months, which were not changed. But it would be improper to uſe them now, tho' quite proper before the ſtyle was altered. The Romans began their year with the month calied March, and therefore September was the ſeventh month of their year, but the ninth of ours.</p>
            <p>And as the idolatrous Romans made theſe changes in the names of ſeveral of the months, in honor of their Emperors, or falſe gods; ſo our Pagan anceſtors chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the names of all the days of the week, calling them by the name of the idol, which they worſhipped on that day. Hence</p>
            <p>The firſt day of the week was called by our idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Saxon anceſtors, Sunday, (the day of the Sun) becauſe it was ſet apart for the worſhip of the Sun.</p>
            <p>The ſecond day of the week they named Monday, (Moon's-day) as they commonly worſhipped the moon on this day.</p>
            <p>The third day of the week was termed Tueſday, in honor of an idol called Tuiſco Mars, who was wor ſhipped by that barbarous and idolatrous people on this day.</p>
            <p>The fourth day of the week was ſtyled Wedneſday, and dedicated to one of their idols called Woden, whom they worſhipped on this day.</p>
            <p>The fifth day of the week they named Thurſday, in honor of one of their idols called Thor, whom they worſhipped on this day.</p>
            <p>The ſixth day of the week they ſtyled Friday; and this day was dedicated to, and called after one of their idols, named Freya.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh day of the week they ſtyled Saturday, in honor of the planet Saturn, the ſuppoſed father of the heathen gods, to whom idolatrous worſhip was paid on this day.</p>

With regard to colour, it is very obvious, that they lay no ſtreſs upon it; and as to ſhape, they only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the continually changing with every new, uſeleſs, expenſive faſhion, and therefore they more nearly keep to the primitive dreſs of their forefathers, which was not peculiar to them, but the way the nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dreſſed at that time.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the quality and price of Clothes, it muſt be confeſſed, that many of that, as well as of every other religious ſociety, have widely deviated from the Goſpel precepts, which enjoins <hi>profeſſors of godlineſs, to adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or coſtly array.</hi>

               <note n="**" place="bottom">Math. xxvi. 64.</note> And becauſe the high-prieſt adjured him by the living God, to make this an act of Chriſt's, and ſo countenance that which he abſolutely forbids, is a ſtrange mode of wreſting the ſcriptures. What were our Lord's reaſons for not anſwering, does not become us to ſay, as the ſcriptures are ſilent on this head, but to ſuppoſe, that <q>he <hi>would</hi> not anſwer till he was put to his oath,</q> is indeed a moſt aſtoniſhing ſuppoſition! And I appeal to my friend, whether it is not more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Son of God, to ſuppoſe that he then anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to encourage, but to diſcountenance ſwearing. For its language ſeems to be, Stop, preſumptuous man! No more profane the ſacred name! <hi>Thou haſt ſaid.</hi> That is, <hi>I am the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, oaths are not only unlawful, as the great Maſter has enjoined his ſervants, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> but they are pernicious to civil ſociety; ſo much falſe ſwearing as we have in the land, having a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018525_0049_0FA7AC176793B2D8"/>to harden men's hearts, and ſo prepare them for every act of wickedneſs. For it is a melancholy truth, that what on account of the ſtrict nature of oaths, their frequent repetition, and the ſhameful, yea, ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner of adminiſtering them, (few knowing what they ſwear) there are hardly any offices a man can enter upon, but he has this alternative, either to be perjured, or elſe ruined by a faithful diſcharge of his office.</p>
            <p>As for Cuſtom-houſe oaths, little or no regard is paid to them, nor indeed is it hardly poſſible for a Maſter of a Ship, to invoice, or clear out his veſſel, without being guilty every time, of the heinous crime of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
            <p>How far oaths of Allegiance to Kings are binding, the hiſtory of our own nation, furniſhes us with awful inſtances. Here we are informed, of all ranks of men, now ſwearing Fidelity to the prince, and ſhortly after dethroning him. We may therefore ſafely conclude, <hi>Becauſe of ſwearing, the land mourneth.</hi>

            <p>That ſwearing was looked upon by the primitive Chriſtians as unlawful, we have ſeveral clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted teſtimonies handed down to us; all agreeing, that they conſidered ſwearing as forbidden by Chriſt. Therefore when an oath was tendered them, the general anſwer was, "I cannot ſwear: I am a Chriſtian."</p>
            <p n="9">9. R. Barclay has joined ſwearing and fighting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both being prohibited by our Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The writer of that letter ſays, <q>Whatever becomes of the latter part of this propoſition, <hi>(fighting)</hi> the former is no part of Chriſtianity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this was intended as a tacit acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that war is unlawful; or whether he was <hi>then</hi> ſenſible of the great impropriety, for one profeſſing to be a miniſter of Chriſt, to countenance that murderous Spirit which is gone forth into all Chriſtendom, cannot

            </p>
            <p>The paſſage I refer to, is as follows, <q>But there is a ſtill greater and more undeniable proof, that the very foundations of all things, civil and religious, are utterly out of courſe, in the chriſtian, as well as the heathen world. There is a ſtill more horrid reproach to the Chriſtian name, yea, to the name of man, to all reaſon and humanity. There is war is the world! War between men! War between Chriſtian! I mean between thoſe that bear the name of Chriſt and profeſs to <hi>walk as he alſo walked.</hi> Now who can reconcile war, I will not ſay to religion, but to any degree of common ſenſe?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But as wars have many advocates, who not only ſpeak for, but alſo take an active part in them, let us conſider what can be ſaid in juſtification of their conduct.</p>
            <p>As the practice is not only highly irrational, but quite contrary to the peaceable and loving ſpirit, which the Goſpel of Chriſt recommends, we muſt not expect that it gives any countenance to it; and yet the abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of war think, they can prove its lawfulneſs, from John the Baptiſt's anſwer to the ſoldiers. <hi>Do violence to no man, and be content with your wages.</hi>

            <p>To the firſt of theſe ſcriptures, I anſwer, Let all ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers take this advice, <hi>Do violence to no man,</hi> and I am bold to affirm, that there will be a final period to wars, for maiming and ſhedding the blood of our fellow-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and thereby ſending them (perhaps, unprepared) into an awful eternity, is the greateſt violence we can offer them.</p>
            <p>Should it be granted, (which I am far from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) that John tolerated the uſe of war, yet this is not to the point, as he was a Jew; and it is allowed, that war and ſwearing, were lawful for them, but prohibited
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018525_0051_0FA7AC18E72F0180"/>by the Founder of Chriſtianity. And as the Goſpel diſpenſation is far more excellent than John's, therefore our Lord aſſerted, that tho' he was the greateſt of all the Prophets, <hi>yet the leaſt in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Math. xi. 11.</note> That is, the Goſpel diſpenſation is eminently ſuperior to his. John was ſo ſenſible of this, that he bore this public teſtimony. <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe;</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John iii. 30.</note> which words undoubtedly referred to their different diſpenſations.</p>

               <note n="§" place="bottom">Math. xix. 8.</note> are unlawful for Chriſtians, is evident from the following ſcriptures, which are full to the point, and need no comment. <hi>It hath been ſaid, Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.

But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all, &amp;c. for whatſoever is more than Yea, yea; Nay, nay,</hi> (yes, or no) <hi>cometh of evil.

            <p>The other ſcripture brought to prove the lawfulneſs of war, is our Lord's ſaying to his diſciples, <hi>Let him that hath no ſword, ſell his garment and buy one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, That this ſcripture has its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but that our Lord never deſigned to countenance fighting by it, I am as ſully convinced of, as that I have an exiſtence. My reaſons are theſe.</p>

And the general opinion of thoſe, ſlyled the Fathers, was, that this ſcripture had a myſtical ſignification.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This ſeems to be confirmed by what paſſed between our Lord and Peter, who in his intemperate zeal, ſmote the ſervant of the High-prieſt, and cut off his car; for which our Lord reproved him, ſaying, <hi>Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

            <p>Not only ſo, but the pacific principles of that people, and their upright conduct towards the natives, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the land from them, (tho' it was granted by the crown) have made ſuch an impreſſion on the minds of this ſavage people, that they have lived in perfect harmony with them, and ſpeak of W. Penn, the firſt Proprietor of that province, with the greateſt reſpect.</p>
            <p>I have now freely delivered my ſentiments. I hope it has been done in a proper temper: For altho' truth leads to the greateſt plainneſs, yet it dictates no impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reflection, much leſs abuſive language, which are too common in ſome of the moſt admired, controverſial writings. I intended to cloſe the whole, with a few remarks on the concluſion of that letter; but on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, finding it made up of a number of mere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory aſſertions, calculated to miſrepreſent and fix a ſtigma on a religious ſociety of people, and totally deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018525_0055_0FA7AC1D67DF4680"/>of argument, I paſs it over, as a proper anſwer would lead to ſome degree of ſeverity, which it has been my ſtudy to avoid.</p>
            <p>However, I muſt ſay, that I fear ſome perſons are more concerned, to proſelyte to a name, than to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſubſtantial. When alas! What do names ſignify, if we are ſtrangers to the love of God, and the love of our neighbour? And what will it avail, that we are orthodox in our principles, while our hearts are heterodox? We may boaſt of our well-compoſed forms of prayer, or pique ourſelves that we have laid aſide theſe inventions of men, ſilently to wait on the Lord; yet if our own hearts are not divinely changed, from the love and ſpirit of the world, into the love and image of God, tho' we differ in name and ſentiment, we all belong to one family, and are out of the true church; having only a name to live, while we are in reality, <hi>without God in the world:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I therefore earneſtly wiſh, that all blind, party zeal may come to an end; that inſtead of laboring to fix a ſtigma on thoſe, who ſee it their duty to diſſent from us, our great concern may be, to guard againſt a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, unchriſtian ſpirit: And may the uniform language of our hearts and lives be, <hi>Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh.</hi>
