            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PErſons of higheſt improvement in the world, are ſubject to the Laws of GOD as well as others, and no leſs expoſed, (in caſe of Sin) to the Wrath of the impartial Judge of the world, who <hi>accepts not the perſon of Princes, nor regards the Rich more than the poor.</hi> Men that are Exalted to the Higher Places of the Earth, are more out of the reach of Mans ſhort Arm, but ſtill, as much as ever within the reach of an Omnipotent Arm; Indeed no place can be found, that will hide from God's Eye, or ſecure from his Hand; for he is ſtill above the higheſt Mountains, eaſily overturns them in his Wrath, &amp; makes the Pillars of the Earth to Tremble. The various Orders of Men in the World, that look at, either the outward, or inward good of a People, are of God's appointing; And the Lawful Power, Civil or Sacred, that any are Inveſted with, is from God, who is the Prime Seat, and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002017_0003_0FBA85B5C05DEEE0"/>
Original of all Power. The greateſt in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement are but Servants in Gods Family, whom he Improves, as the Inſtruments of his Providence. It is he that Advances one to Rule, calls another near to Miniſter, and to Bleſs in his Name; It is he that puts the Sword of Juſtice into one Hand, and that of the Spirit into another; Charging thoſe that receive ſuch Power, with the moſt awful Authority, that they have a regard to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory while they Improve the ſame in a Diſcharge of the Duties of their places. And that they may not want Motive, to reach the main Springs of action in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, they are forewarned, that God will deal with them in Proportion to their Carriage &amp; Deportment towards Him, as is expreſſed in the words Read; <hi>Them that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me I will Honour, &amp; they that Deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly Eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God who did Sanctify the whole Seed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be a Holy and Peculiar People to himſelf, did ſet apart <hi>Aaron &amp; his Sons</hi> to Miniſter in the Prieſts Office; And taught them, both by Precept and indeed, by Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things in Righteouſneſs, that <hi>he would be Sanctifyed in them that came nigh him, and had in Reverence of all about him;</hi> yet the moſt clear, and often repeated Precepts, the moſt forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Motives, were not Sufficient to keep Alive
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002017_0004_0FBA85B723764AF8"/>
in their Hearts, a ſenſe of their Duty, &amp; a care to attend it. That People had not been long Poſſeſſed of the Holy Land, before they defil'd it; they quickly turn'd out of the way; And there was not only a grievous Corruption in the Body of the People, but the moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred order of men were Defiled; the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Levi</hi> was Corrupted; thoſe that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Law, and were by Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Obliged to teach others the Knowlege of God, were themſelves ſhamefully Ignorant of him; and they that Miniſtred before the Lord with Clean Garments did it with Filthy &amp; Impure Souls. It was little better than this, in <hi>Eli's</hi> time, when his Prophane Sons Miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in the Prieſts Office; as appears by the Character given of them. (1) As to the diſpoſition and ſtate of their Souls, they were <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> they <hi>Knew not the Lord, Verſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

(3) And then, as to their doings in Holy things they were <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and Sacrilegious. Verſe</hi> 13, 14, 15. Not content with the bountiful Allowance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: God had not been an hard Maſter to them, he did not require them to kindle a Fire on his Altar for nought; but had made them partakers with himſelf at the Altar; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the large Proviſions other ways made for

their Comfortable and Honourable Support, God had allowed them, certain Portions out of the Offerings made by Fire unto himſelf; they were not content therewith, but in a Sacrilegious manner, did Seiſe on Gods Part; And Snatch to themſelves out of the beſt of it, to ſatisfy their luſting Appetite: Beſides they liked not the Appointed way of its being prepared for Uſe; Neither would ſtay until God was Served; whereby Foul Indignities were offered unto God, and the Holy things of God were brought into Contempt; for on theſe accounts, Men Deſpiſed the Offerings of the Lord: Theſe things were highly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to a Holy and Jealous God; he ſends a Meſſage to <hi>Eli</hi> rather than to his Sons, who was look'd on as a partaker with them in their Sins, in that he had not Interpoſed his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, either as a Parent, or an High Prieſt, for their Reformation or at leaſt Reſtraint. Indeed we find mention made of his Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting his Diſlike of their doings, <hi>Verſe</hi> 23.<hi>&amp;c,</hi> but its very Probable, he had Connived and kept Silence too long, till they were grown Shameleſs &amp; Obſtinate, &amp; then was too mild in his Reproofs; the caſe called for other Meaſures; for although, Mildneſs &amp; Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be rather to be Choſe, yet when the caſe calls for Severity, it may be a Sin rather than a Duty, and may be a reaſon of coming ſhort
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002017_0006_0FBA85BBACADED60"/>
of the end. Surely the caſe was ſuch as did call for a Flaming Zeal, both in Reſpect of the Honour of God which Suffered, &amp; in Reſpect of their beſt Intereſt in greateſt Hazard. By this Indifferency of Spirit and Sinful Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he forfeited the Character given of <hi>Levi</hi> long before; <hi>Deut.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and Threatens to Deal in a very Aſtoniſhing manner with his Houſe; and a reaſon hereof is Rendered from Gods Stedfaſt Purpoſe &amp; the Unvarying Method of his Practice, <hi>Them that Honour me I will Honour, &amp;c.</hi> God is wont to Proportion his Dealings with Men, to their Carriage and Deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf; ſuch Meaſure as Men Mete, is Wiſely and Juſtly Meaſured to them. He is truly a Bountiful Lord, who will abundantly Reward ſuch as faithfully Serve Him; and is wont to ſuit the Rewards to the Work; but he is a Juſt &amp; a Jealous God, who is tender of his own Honour, &amp; will not put up the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and Indignities that are offered to him by Prophane and Haughty Sinners; but will Repay them to their Faces, by pouring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon them, and ſtaining the Pride of their Glory.</p>

In the Words Read, we have an <hi>Honourable Work Propounded,</hi> and an <hi>Encouraging Reward Promiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the <hi>Work</hi> it ſelf Propounded and Expected, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> To <hi>Honour</hi> GOD. <hi>Them that Honour Me,</hi> &amp;c. Honour is a Word that is often uſed and indeed taken in various ſenſes; an Enumeration is needleſs, and would be tedious. It may ſuffice to obſerve the meaning muſt be determined by the Party or Object to whom it is to be Paid; Now the Object here mentioned, is GOD himſelf; A Being Exalted far above all Bleſſing &amp; Praiſe; &amp; therefore it cannot be by adding any Luſtre or Glory to him, but by ſuch actions as hold forth great thoughts of God, do become his Excellency &amp; tend to his Praiſe. We are to conſider, that God is a Being of all Poſſible Perfection; we are Creatures that are full of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections; and therefore we can add nothing to God; yet are we Creatures Capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining ſome ſenſe of the Perfection, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency &amp; Glory of God, &amp; of expreſſing the ſame in agreeable Actions, ſuch Actions as are becoming his Excellency; and when we do ſo, God is pleaſed to account it an Honour done to Him. Which Work, is excellently ſuited to the Nature of Man, &amp; Propounded unto all; not reſtrained or limited to Perſons of Publick Improvement, but a Work belonging
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002017_0008_0FBA85BEC40C6468"/>
to all: Indeed ſuch perſons have greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in their hands for the Glorifying of God, &amp; God expects a greater tribute of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; Glory from them: But it is a Work Propounded unto all, &amp; indeed fitted for every one; Not below the Higheſt, nor above the Meaneſt, but well ſuiting the Nature of Man, &amp; appointed to every one; indeed the very End of Mans Being, the Buſineſs of his Life, the Sum of his Duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the Glorious <hi>Reward</hi> ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Promiſe to ſuch as attend and perform this Work; and this is <hi>Honour from</hi> GOD. <hi>Them that honour Me, I will Honour.</hi> The work it ſelf is Honourable, &amp; Honour is promiſed in Reward thereof. The word Tranſlated Honour, Signifys Weightineſs, &amp; the Reward of Vertue hath Weight &amp; Worth in it. We add nothing to God when we Honour him; But when God Honours us there is a true Luſtre added; The Creature is ſet on high, he is made truly Great &amp; Glorious. Now God will certainly Honour ſuch as Honour Him: He is the Fountain of Honour, he is the God of Glory Riches &amp; Honour come of him, &amp; in his Hands it is to make great &amp; to ſet on high, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>

            <p>DOCT. GOD will beſtow Honour on ſuch as Honour Him.</p>
            <p>Honour is one of thoſe things the Mind of Man does Naturally deſire &amp; reach after, &amp; not in Vain. The wiſe Author of Nature has univerſally fitted &amp; apportioned an Object to each natural Power.

ſuch as <hi>Great</hi> Titles, <hi>Humane</hi> Applauſe, Place of <hi>Power &amp; Command,</hi> Splendid <hi>Living,</hi> Honourable <hi>Attendance, &amp;c.</hi> Which are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken by Men, for the true Object; and in purſuit of theſe, men do oftentimes ſtrain &amp; tire themſelves to no purpoſe; and if at any time they are Gained, they Advance little, add but little of Luſtre to the Enjoyers; after all, Perſons having nothing but theſe to Advance or Adorn them, they are but as a worthleſs <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> under a <hi>Guilded Cover;</hi> or a very <hi>ſmall Letter</hi> in the midſt of a <hi>great Gay;</hi> the Man may notwithſtanding all this be very mean &amp; contemptible in the account of true Wiſdom. Now, Religion which deſigns the true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; beſt Good of Man, makes Diſcovery of the true Object; tells what <hi>true Honour</hi> is, and wherein it conſiſts; raiſes up, &amp; helps the Mind of man to Diſcern it, &amp; preſcribes a ſure way to Attain it; a way that has been oftentimes tryed &amp; found Effectual; &amp; this is by Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions; In ſhort, by Honouring God. Religion does in its own Nature tend to raiſe up &amp; ennoble the Mind of man, &amp; Adorn it with a greater Luſtre &amp; Glory than a Multitude of empty Titles can poſſibly do; but beſides, hereby Perſons are entitled to the free &amp; rich Promiſe of God, who has ſaid, <hi>That he will Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them that Honour him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Handling of this point I muſt firſt of all,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002017_0011_0FBA85C56B789DC8"/>
Deſcribe the <hi>Work,</hi> and then Diſcourſe of the <hi>Reward.</hi>

            <p>I. <hi>I ſhall Attempt to Deſcribe the Work &amp; ſhew what it is for any to Honour God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in General, this Work conſiſts in ſuch Actions as proceed from, and teſtify the great thoughts are had of God, &amp; are intended and directed to his Praiſe.</p>
            <p>Its a matter that conſiſts mainly in Action; indeed Speech &amp; the inſtrument thereof were given to Praiſe God with, &amp; not to ly Silent; however, there is more in this than only ſome Verbal Praiſes; Chriſt himſelf has taught us thus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 8 <hi>Herein is my Father Glorifyed that ye bear much Fruit.</hi> And it was by Action that he himſelf Glorifyed God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>I have Glorifyed thee on earth, I have Finiſhed the Work given me to do.</hi> But then,</p>
            <p>Its by ſuch Actions as proceed from, &amp; teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the great thoughts that are had of God, &amp; are intended, &amp; directed to his Praiſe. It is not enough to perform ſuch Actions as relate to God, &amp; have been Commanded by him; but they muſt flow from this Principle, and be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to this end, otherwiſe whatever may be the end of the Work, this is not the end of the Workman; &amp; therefore an Act or Work that finds acceptance &amp; applauſe with Man, may be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002017_0012_0FBA85C6EB6A0B50"/>
Rejected by God; for tho' Men Honour God with their Lips (or any External Action) yet if their Heart be Removed from him, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts himſelf but Diſhonoured in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly right thoughts of God do lay the Foundation of all ſuitable Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; hence that Advice, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, &amp; ſerve him with a perfect Heart, &amp; a willing Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So long as the Mind is void of the true Knowlege of God, or leavened with unworthy &amp; unbecoming thoughts of him, the Carriage will never be reſpectful; but ſuch as holds forth Contempt, Thence Sprang the Profane Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Sons of <hi>Eli, they were Sons of Belial, they knew not the Lord, 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 12.

2. <hi>Perſons Honour God, by acting ſuitably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch Objects as relate to him.</hi> Its a known, &amp; a received Rule, that, that for which, any thing is what it is, is its ſelf much more ſo. Men uſually account, that they themſelves are Honoured, when any that relate or belong to them, are Honoured, and Reſpected for their ſakes. Now, there are Objects that do more peculiarly relate to God; and when they are treated in a Reſpectful manner, for Gods ſake, it argues the great thoughts that are had of God, &amp; God is pleaſed to take it as an Honour done to himſelf. There are perſons that come under this relative conſideration: And here it becomes us firſt of all to conſider Him, who in all things has the Preeminence, and is both related to, &amp; one with God; even Jeſus Chriſt; who is the Meſſenger of the Covenant, the Chief Apoſtle of our Profeſſion; both the Head of the Church, &amp; the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: God expects that his Son ſhould be Reverenced, yea that all men ſhould <hi>Honour the Son, even as they Honour the Father, Joh.</hi> 5 23. And Chriſt is Honoured when he is Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged &amp; Received as the Son of God, when his Teſtimony is Believed, his Religion is Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, his Mediation Relyed on, &amp; he is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Affairs of the Soul; And Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is done to God the Father, when Chriſt is Honoured: Hence <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 44. <hi>He that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth

                  </gap>n me, but on him that ſent me.</hi> But then the Civil Magiſtrate comes under this Relative conſideration; for he is the Deputy of the Supreme Ruler of the World, whom God has appointed to Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him, &amp; Act for him here below; to which end, he has given him his own Name, put a Ray of his own Glory upon him. Imprinted ſome Characters of Divinity on him; <hi>Dan. 5. 18, 19. The moſt high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy Father a Kingdom, &amp; Majeſty, &amp; Glory, and Honour. And for the Majeſty that he gave him, all People, Nations, and Languages Trembled and Feared before him.</hi> God expects they ſhould be Honoured under this Notion; and hence the Duty we owe to our Soveraign in Heaven, and to his Deputy here on Earth are both Joyned together. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 17. Fear God, Honour the King.</hi> God himſelf is Honoured, when theſe are duely Honoured; and he reſents it as a Diſhonour done to himſelf, when thoſe that Repreſent him in the world are Deſpiſed; 1 <hi>Sam. 8. 7. They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</hi> And hence was it taken ſo ill in thoſe that deſpiſed <hi>Saul,</hi> ſeeing God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to Rule over his People, 1 <hi>Sam. 10. ult.</hi> Again, There are thoſe that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in Sacred things, that come under conſideration; they are the Meſſengers of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002017_0017_0FBA85D2B84716D8"/>
Lord of Hoſts, Ambaſſadors that repreſent the great King; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. And it is required that they be reſpected on this account. 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 1. Let a man account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God.</hi> Honour or Diſhonour done to them is taken as tho' it were done to him whom they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent; <hi>Luk. 10.16. He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me: and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this conſideration extends it ſelf yet further, not only to the true Church of God, but to every Pious Member thereof; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a due Reſpect yielded thereto under this notion, is an Honour done to God. He that Honours ſuch as fear God, Honours God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. Hence that of Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 25.40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In as much as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then there are things as well as perſons that relate to God; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> His <hi>Word,</hi> His <hi>Works,</hi> His <hi>Ordinances,</hi> His <hi>Day,</hi> His <hi>Houſe:</hi> Now God is Honoured when there is a reverend regard to, &amp; a Holy uſe made of theſe. See in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13. Hence God complains of diſhonour done to him by his Peoples profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his holy things, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 26.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Perſons Honour God, by acting in a full and perfect Subjection to him;</hi> which includes both, an Obedience to his Laws, &amp; a due Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002017_0018_0FBA85D3D1201FF0"/>
to his Corrective Diſpenſations. Man in his very Make and Conſtitution is fitted for a Moral Government: It can Appertain to none but the Author of his Being, to Exerciſe it over him: From Creation ariſes abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and full right of Government, and God does really exerciſe the ſame: <hi>The moſt High does Rule among the Children of Men. Dan.</hi> 4. 17. He is the Governour among the Nations: He ſits King for ever; and his Kingdom Rules over all. He that diſpenſes ſome portions of Power to others, holds the Governments of the World, (yea of both Worlds) in his own Hands. He actually gives Laws to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to Live by; Laws that are moſt Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; moſt Extenſive, that reach every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; direct how to carry it towards every Object: <hi>Mic. 6. 8. He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, &amp;c.</hi> And he alſo upholds a Diſcipline in his Family: Indeed God does not willingly Afflict or Grieve the Children of Men, yet for Wiſe, &amp; Holy ends, He orders a variety of Evils to Men in a Corrective way: He does not only Chaſtize the Heathen, but he Chaſteneth his own Covenant People; <hi>Deut. 8. 5. As a man chaſteneth his ſon, ſo the Lord thy God chaſteneth thee.</hi> And God does not only Correct &amp; Chaſten thoſe among his People that are the Unfaithful, Slothful Servants in

his Family but even his deareſt Children, every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on whom he Loves. <hi>Heb</hi> 12. 6. The Law &amp; the Rod, were for a while together, in the Ark of the Covenant, and they will never be Separate in Gods Government of his Family; we read of Gods <hi>Fire in Zion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Furnace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. Iſa</hi> 31. 9. Now God is Honoured both by an Obedience to the one, and a quiet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the other. God is Honoured by an Obedience to his Laws; Sinners by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine Law Diſhonour God; <hi>Rom.</hi>2.23. By breaking of Gods Law Sinners caſt a ſlight on him, they deny his Sovereignty, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value his Favour, they ſlight &amp; contemn his Power; hence <hi>Pſal. 10. 13. Wherefore doth tho Wicked contemn God?</hi> But by an Obedience to Gods Law, God is Honoured. Sacrificing to God is called an Honouring God, <hi>Iſa. 43 23. Thou haſt not Honoured me, with thy Sacrifices;</hi> But Obedience is much more ſo, 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 22. Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings &amp; ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? To obey is better then ſacrifice; &amp; to hearken, than the fat of rams.</hi> Hence are we directed to Pray, <hi>Thy will be done; Mat. 6. 10.</hi> That Gods Name may be Hallowed, and his Kingdom come. And the Obedience by which, God is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, is a Univerſal Obedience; by ſuch Obedience did <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Joſhua, David,</hi> &amp; others endeavour to Honour and Glorify
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002017_0020_0FBA85DA83BE2910"/>
God, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 22. Again God is Honoured by that Obedience which is both Sincere &amp; alſo Cheerful, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. This gives God the Glory of his Omniſciency, Truth, Bounty. Again a reſolved Obedience Honours God; when Perſons refuſe to be allured, or affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the way of Duty; inſtances of ſuch Obedience might be taken notice of in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16, 17. and the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 29. But then a Submiſſion to God's Hand and a Compliance with his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, gives Honour &amp; Glory to him. When the Evils God is pleaſed to order to any in the way of his Providence, are quietly &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently born, it gives God the Glory of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Goodneſs; thus did <hi>Aaron, David, Hezekiah,</hi> and above all, CHRIST himſelf glorify God: <hi>Luk. 22. 42. Not my will, but thine be done. Joh. 18. 11. The cup which my Father hath given me to drink, ſhall I not drink it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Perſons honour God by endeavouring to the utmoſt to Act like him.</hi> Imitation is uſually a fruit of Eſteem; and gives evidence thereof. The Nature of Man is very Prone to be led by Example, &amp; eſpecially by the Example of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours that are Honoured &amp; Eſteemed: When once a perſon has taken up an high Eſteem of another, he is unaccountably carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away unto an Imitation of the perſon Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired:
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002017_0021_0FBA85DBF288E7A8"/>
And the force hereof is ſometimes ſo great as to carry away a perſon unto an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him in ſuch things as are the Defects &amp; blemiſhes of the perſon Admired, and the Irregularities of his Actions; and herein is Honour done to the perſon; ſuch a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to another teſtifies that he is had in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Now God is the Supreme &amp; Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>Standard</hi> of Perfection: his Nature is a Pattern for ours, and his Actions which are known in the Earth are for our Example. It was Mans primitive Glory, that he was made like to God, and it muſt be his brighteſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection &amp; Glory to be &amp; act like him The works &amp; actions of God are all done in Truth; He ever proceeds by the Rules of Wiſdom, Juſtice, Goodneſs in all his doings Now ſuch is the Nature of Man, that he is capable of ſome imitation of him, &amp; hereunto is obliged; <hi>Eph 5. 1. Be ye followers of God, as dear children.</hi> God is to be imitated in Purity and Holineſs; <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 2. He is to be imitated in hatred of Sin, in Juſtice, Truth, Faithfulneſs, Goodneſs, &amp; Kindneſs, in ſlowneſs to Anger, in readineſs to Forgive, &amp; to be Reconciled, in readineſs to Believe &amp; Help the Miſerable. <hi>Mat.</hi>5. ult. <hi>Be ye Perfect.</hi> And when we endeavour to the utmoſt to conform our ſelves to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God himſelf in our doings, it declares we have great thoughts of God; that our

Hearts are truly touched with a Senſe of his Perfections; It ſhows we Believe there is none in the Heavens or the Earth that may be likened unto him; nor any Works, like unto his Works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86 8.</p>

Him, God is pleaſed to take as done for him; for ſuch is the bounty of God that he does not only acknowledge thoſe actions to be a ſerving of him, which look nextly at his Glory, but thoſe alſo, which look this way but remotely, or in conſequence. There are a multitude of Neceſſities that attend man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for which, the Proviſion made is by the Miniſtry of men and therefore is God pleaſed to beſtow on men a very great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the filth that is ſpit at them does not ſtick. But ſuppoſe, Enemies are ſuffered to prevail by Iniquity, ſo that their Brightneſs is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, &amp; their Horn is defiled in the duſt, God does ſometimes appear very Wonderfully in pleading their cauſe, in rolling off Reproach from them, and cloathing their Enemies with Shame. He brings forth their Judgment as the light, &amp; their Righteouſneſs as the noon day; He turns the ſhadow of Death unto them, into the Morning. Thus God dealt with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, David, Daniel,</hi> and others; And it agrees with what he has ſaid, <hi>Pſal.91 15. I will deliver him &amp; honour him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>God Honours them that Honour him, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Favour and Reſpect in the Eyes of Men.</hi> Favour &amp; Reſpect amongſt Men is prized and hunted after by many as the greateſt good in the World. <hi>Saul</hi> was very fond to have Honour before the Elders of the People: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. And Chriſt ſpeaks of ſome, that loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 43. However tho' it be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued by the moſt, it is not to be undervalued by any. A wiſe mans greateſt care is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of account &amp; eſteem; &amp; had much rather be ſo, than only be ſo accounted of. A wiſe man values his own ſtock of ſufficiency &amp; real worth, beyound the higheſt Applauſes in the World: Yet notwithſtanding a juſt eſteem
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002017_0028_0FBA85EF64CD0540"/>
when yielded, is not to be ſlighted: Its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by God, as an encouragement unto Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, &amp; beſtowed as a reward thereof: <hi>Prov.3.4. So ſhalt thou find favour.</hi> And the wiſe man has obſerved, that he that ſeeks good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures favour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 27. God has the hearts of all men in his hands, and he inclines and turns them as he pleaſes; and many times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do's cauſe his faithful Servants to find Reſpect.</p>
            <p>And that,</p>
            <p>Both with Superiors and Inferiors. A Princes Favour is a thing highly valued; many will intreat it; and indeed it is as the Dew, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 12. And its very obſervable, how oftentimes holy and righteous Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have in a way of Serving and Honouring God been advanced unto it: Their Heavenly wiſdom, &amp; God-like goodneſs has made their faces to ſhine, and brought them into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of great men. So was it with <hi>Joſeph, Mordecai, Daniel,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>And this procures Reverence &amp; Eſteem in the minds of Inferiors; and that not only of the good and vertuous, but the evil. As for the Righteous, among them Piety &amp; Holineſs is in account: <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 9. Their very temper diſpoſes them to honour ſuch as fear God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. And altho' there may be ſome others that are Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> that deſpiſe, Yet of ſuch as theſe they will be had in Honour, 2. <hi>Sam</hi> 6. 22
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002017_0029_0FBA85F0E4F25020"/>
But beſides this, there is ſometimes a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony enforc'd from the Conſciences of the worſt men, in the Commendation of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; which is (as one ſays well) Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to an Univerſal good Report.</p>
            <p>(3) <hi>God Honours ſuch as honour him with his own Favour.</hi> It is a very great Honour to be a Favourite of God. The favour of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince is accounted a great Honour. Men uſually Value themſelves by it; and its the meaſure &amp; rule of Valuation &amp; Eſteem to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers He that is high in the favour of his Prince may hope for defence and protection from his Enemies; he has an advantage in his hand to procure good things for himſelf and others; indeed in the light of the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is Life, and his favour is as the latter rain, <hi>Prov</hi> 16. 15. But the Favour of the KING of Kings is by far a greater honour to any one. When the Beams of the Sun are darted directly on an Object, it makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear bright; and the favour of God and the light of his Countenance towards any one, does add a true luſtre; it argues a real worth, it affords a true refreſhment to the Soul; it recommends any one to the reſpect of the World, it ſets on high, and makes a mans mountain to ſtand ſtrong. Now <hi>this honour have all his Saints.</hi> It was not only the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Joſeph, David, Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> that they
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002017_0030_0FBA85F2A9429388"/>
were favourites of Heaven, but the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the King of Kings is towards every wiſe Servant. All his Saints are in his hand, he loveth the Righteous, &amp; his Countenance doth behold the Upright, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11 7. And their being dear to God and precious in his ſight, makes them Honourable, <hi>Iſa</hi> 43. 4. In his favour is their horn Exalted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 17.</p>
            <p>(4) <hi>God honours thoſe that Honour him with his own gracious Preſence.</hi> Indeed God is not very far from any of his Creatures. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27 God is every where Preſent by his All-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Eſſence, He fills Heaven and Earth with his Preſence: He is every where preſent by his Power, Upholding, Guiding &amp; Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all his Creatures. He is preſent in holy Places, by his Grace &amp; Bleſſing, He is preſent in the Conſciences of good and bad, by way of Teſtimony &amp; Judgment. But he is eſpecially Preſent with the Vertuous by Manifeſtation &amp; peculiar Influence. God is nigh unto all them that call upon him in truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 18 Perſons of greateſt Eminency and richeſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments have uſually low and mean thoughts of themſelves; and ready to plead unfitneſs &amp; inſufficiency, when it pleaſes God to call them forth to improvement; They have a ſenſe of the greatneſs of the Work, the difficulty and oppoſition, that attends it, and their own inability to grapple therewith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

they were furniſhed with a greater ſtock of Wiſdom, Courage, Strength, than they find themſelves to have; and hence, are wont to raiſe Pleas from thoſe Heads that they may be excuſed: As may be ſeen in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> Now to ſilence and remove theſe Objections, and free the heart from Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, GOD is Pleaſed to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his own Gracious Preſence with his Servants in the Work he Calls them to. So did he to <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, David, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed not to them only, but to Us in them: For what God ſaid to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> He ſays to every true and faithful Servant of his, <hi>Deut. 31. 8. Heb 13.5. I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Which Promiſe, as it contains in it all the good we want in the way of Duty, ſo it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly made good; His Promiſe doth not ever fail. GOD was preſent with <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> &amp; others, as he Promiſed; &amp; ſo He ever is, and will be Preſent with his faithful Servants to the end of the World. And this is an Honour, &amp; indeed ſuch an honour as Earthly Princes cannot poſſibly beſtow upon all their faithful Servants, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6. <hi>Zec.</hi> 8. 23.</p>
            <p>(5) Laſtly, <hi>God Honours thoſe that honour him by making them Inſtruments of great good in the world.</hi> Uſefulneſs in the world is a mans great Glory; &amp; is wont to procure for a man Repute &amp; Eſteem: 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>He was an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

man, becauſe by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria.</hi> It argues a mean, baſe, unworthy Spirit, in a man, to have a regard only to his own Private Intereſt, to make himſelf the Centre of his own actions; and to be careleſs about the good of others. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be neglected, that lives and does no good in the world: Such an one waſts and ſquanders away all the Talents given him to improve. He lives beſides the End of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; is ſunk below the Nature of Man; and does but only fill up the number of things in the World. But uſefulneſs makes a man Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable: It makes a man like to Chriſt, who was ever Employ'd in doing good, <hi>Act. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He gives this account of it, <hi>when the ear heard me then it bleſſed me, and when the eye ſaw me it gave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me: Becauſe I delivered the poor that cried, &amp; the fatherleſs, and him that had no helper. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame: I was a father to the poor; and the cauſe I knew not I ſearched, Job 29. 11,</hi>—He endeavoured by his Wiſdom, Wealth, Authority, to do all

the good he could. Now it is of GOD, that any are ſuch Bleſſings, and Inſtruments of ſo much good in the world. It is He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows on men gifts of Wiſdom, Knowledge, Wealth, Valour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is He that gives that Divine temper of Soul that diſpoſes men to lay out themſelves, in Endeavours to do good: And it is He, that gives unto men Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and by his Bleſſing renders Endeavours ſucceſsful; For except the Lord build the City, they labour in vain that build it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 1 And in this way does God many times Honour ſuch as honour him: So he did <hi>Joſeph, Joſhua, Nehemiah, Jehoiada,</hi> &amp;c.

of death,—Which brings men down from their Places of Dignity and Employment, breaks off their Purpoſes: In that very day their thoughts periſh. Yet Death does not put an end to the Honour of the Vertuous. Indeed the Pomp and Glory of ſinful Men, which they have gotten without Goodneſs, &amp; endeavoured to maintain without Vertue, uſually comes to an end at Death; Their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Beauty becomes like a fading Flower; it, paſſes away as a Dream: Their Mountain falling cometh to nought. But the Honour of the Vertuous reaches beyond Death &amp; the Grave.</p>
            <p>And here I might take notice of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that ſhall be done to their Spirits, Names, Bodies, whole Perſons,—</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Honour ſhall be done to the Spirits of the Vertuous after Death:</hi> For when the cloſe Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Soul &amp; Body is diſſolved, the Spirit which is yielded up to the care of its mighty &amp; faithful Redeemer, is ſafely Conveyed and Conducted to a place of reſt, &amp; united to that Heavenly Aſſembly, of the Spirits of Juſt Men made Perfect. It is ſaid of the Wicked; <hi>Joh 27. 19. He ſhall ly down, but he ſhall not be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered;</hi> Which is but rarely true of his Body's not being gathered into the Grave by Burial, but ever true of his Soul, which is not gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a place of Peace. But the Soul of the

Vertuous man is at Death gather'd to a ſtate &amp; place of Peace &amp; Refreſhment We find frequent mention made, of good mens being gathered to their Fathers at Death, ſo is it ſaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac, Jacob, Joſeph, Moſes, Aaron, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, &amp;c</hi> And it is thought, the Phraſe intends, their Spirits being gathered to a place of reſt &amp; refreſhment, and their being united to the great Aſſembly of Happy Souls in their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate However that be, we have a very clear Text for it; <hi>Luk.</hi> 16 22. Where we are told, that <hi>when the Beggar Dyed, he was Carryed by Angels into Abrahams Boſom.</hi> Which points out to us the ſafe and comfortable ſtate he was put into, &amp; the honourable Company he was United with. And indeed, it will be a very great Honour to be of that number, to be admitted a Member of that bright Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Holy Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, to ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac &amp; Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of God, a place perfectly free from all Sin &amp; Sorrow: a place that has no need of the Sun, nor the Moon to ſhine upon it, for the Glory of God does lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>Honour ſhall be done to the Names of the Vertuous:</hi> Which lies not in ſome bitter La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations at their Death, or in many Tears dropt over their Graves; tho' indeed, theſe are Evidences of Love &amp; Eſteem, and an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

However perſons that ſtand in places of Publick Truſt may do more; they have more Talents, and better Opportunities to Honour God than others: And indeed, God expects more from them. Now the Choice of Men to ſuch Publick Places does (among us) lie with the People; and its a Priviledge.

                  <p>And what can we propound to our Selves by continuing this Quarrel?</p>
                  <p>We cannot plead the Intereſt of God calls for it, &amp; will ſuffer if we leave off; It had been in better caſe had we never begun. We are not able to ſay, We cannot deſiſt with a good Conſcience, ſince it's hard to diſcern how a good Conſcience can be preſerved in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution thereof. But who can Expreſs the Confuſion &amp; Miſery we are threatned with, if it be Continued? Let us ſeriouſly Conſider, what Account we ſhall give up unto God of theſe things, and whether they will be for our Honour from the Lord! But</p>
