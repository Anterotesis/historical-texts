         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THOUGH the Journals already publiſhed, were printed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my Knowledge, yet as GOD has been pleaſed to let me ſee, by Letters ſent to me, that he has greatly bleſſed them, I now upon the Importunity of Friends, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the publiſhing a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of them, that thoſe pious Perſons who have interceded in my Behalf, may ſee what GOD, in anſwer to their Prayers, has done for my Soul.</p>

               <pb facs="unknown:004855_0002_100E02B5D91ED4F8"/>
I am ſenſible that this, as well as every Thing elſe of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt neceſſarily meet with great Contempt from natural Men, who are Strangers to the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the HOLY GHOST up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart. But what have I to do with them? If any of GOD's Children receive the leaſt Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from my Experiences, <hi>Let almoſt, formal Chriſtians be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Scoffers of theſe laſt Days mock on.</hi>—<hi>I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</hi>

            <head>A CONTINUATION OF Mr. WHITEFIELD's JOURNAL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SUNDAY, <hi>May</hi> 7. Arrived at <hi>Savannah</hi> Town about ſeven this Evening, and joined in Prayer, and a Pſalm of Thankſgiving with Mr. <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motte,</hi> and ſome pious Souls that were rejoiced at my Arrival: <hi>The Good LORD ſanctify our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Glory, and his People's Welfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spent the Remainder of the Evening in taking ſweet Counſel with Mr. <hi>Delamotte,</hi> who ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially left behind at <hi>Savannah</hi> againſt my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. How ſweetly does Providence order Things for us! <hi>Oh may I conſtantly follow it as the wiſe Men did the Star in the Eaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, May</hi> 8. Begun to read pubilck Prayers, and expounded the ſecond Leſſon at five in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeventeen Adults and twenty five Children. <hi>May GOD open their Hearts that they may attend to the Things that were ſpoken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Afternoon, Mr. <hi>Cauſlon</hi> ſent Word, that he and the Magiſtrates would wait upon me, but I choſe rather to wait upon them, I was received
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004855_0003_100E02B819CF0288"/>
with great Civility, and our chief Converſation ran upon the Place of my Settlement; at laſt it was reſolved that I ſhould have a Houſe and Tabernacle built at <hi>Frederica,</hi> and ſerve at <hi>Savannah,</hi> when, and as long as I pleaſed. I find there are many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions amongſt the Inhabitants, but GOD, I hope, will make me an Inſtrument of compoſing them: <hi>Grant this, O Lord, for thy dear Son's Sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, May,</hi> 14. After another Week's Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Return of my Fever, under which God ſhewed me great Mercies, and which went off with a Fit of the Ague, I attempted to read Prayers, but was ſo exceeding faint and weak, that I was obliged to leave off before I begun the ſecond Service. <hi>Oh that my Friends had ſeen me at that Hour, they then might have learnt not to have any Man's Perſon in Admiration, and not to think more highly of me than they ought to think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, May</hi> 16. Having by the Bleſſing of GOD gotten a little Strength, I went to ſee <hi>Tomo Chachi,</hi> who, I heard, was near expiring at a Neighbour's Houſe. He lay on a Blanket thin and meagre, and little elſe but Skin and Bones. <hi>Senauki</hi> ſat by fanning him with ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Feathers. There was no body that could talk <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo I could only ſhake Hands and leave him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, May</hi> 19. GOD ſtill ſtrengthening me more and more, I went this Morning to two little Villages, <hi>Hampſtead</hi> and <hi>Highgate,</hi> about Five Miles off <hi>Savannah:</hi> The former conſiſts of three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, making in all eleven Souls, one Man a <hi>Jew;</hi> two Men, one Woman and ſeven Children <hi>Swiſſers.</hi> I was much delighted with ſeeing the Improvements
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004855_0003_100E02B819CF0288"/>
a few pair of Hands had made in their reſpective Plantations, and was ſurpriſed to ſee what Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry will do. Surely they ſpeak not Truth, who ſay that the <hi>Georgia</hi> People have been idle; for I never ſaw more laborious People than are in theſe Villages. They live exceeding hard, but with a little Aſſiſtance may do very well. I was at a Loſs, becauſe I could not talk <hi>French;</hi> but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I reſolved, under GOD, to follow my worthy Predeceſſor's Example, and to viſit them once a Week, and read Prayers to as many as could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me. I alſo enquired into the State of their Children, and found there were many who might prove uſeful Members of the Colony, if there was a proper Place provided for their Maintenance and Education. Nothing can effect this but an Orphan-Houſe, which might eaſily be erected at <hi>Savannah,</hi> would ſome of thoſe that are rich in this World's Good, contribute towards it. <hi>May GOD in his due Time, ſtir up the Wills of his faithful People, to be ready to diſtribute, and willing to communicate on this commendable Occaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, May</hi> 20. Went once more to ſee <hi>Tomo Chachi,</hi> hearing his Nephew <hi>Tooanoowee</hi> was there, who could talk <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I deſired him to enquire of his Uncle, Whether he thought he ſhould die; who anſwered, He could not tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I then aſked, where he thought he ſhould go after Death? He replied, to Heaven. <hi>But alas, how can a Drunkard enter there!</hi> I then exhorted <hi>Tooanoowee</hi> (who is a tall proper Youth) not to get drunk, telling him, he underſtood <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore would be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed the more, if he did not live better. I then
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004855_0004_100E02B9FA48E9E8"/>
aſked him, Whether he believed a Heaven? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Yes. I then aſked, Whether he believed a Hell? and deſcribed by pointing to the Fire; he replied, No, From whence we may eaſily gather how natural it is for all Mankind to believe there is a Place of Happineſs, becauſe they wiſh it may be ſo, and on the contrary, how averſe they are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Place of Torment, becauſe they wiſh it may not be ſo. But GOD is true and juſt, and as ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Good ſhall go into everlaſting Happineſs, ſo the Wicked ſhall go into everlaſting Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, May</hi> 24. Went to Day to <hi>Thunderbolt,</hi> a Village about ſix Miles off <hi>Savannah,</hi> ſituated very pleaſantly near the River, and conſiſting of three Families, four Men and two Women, and ten Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; I was kindly received, expounded a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, uſed a few Collects, called on a Family or two that lay near our Way, and returned home to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah</hi> very comfortably, with my Friend <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motte,</hi> about ſix o'Clock in the Evening. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD for ſtrengthning my weak Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, June</hi> 2. This Evening parted with kind Captain <hi>Whiting,</hi> and my dear Friend <hi>Delamotte,</hi> who embarked for <hi>England</hi> about 7 at Night. The poor People lamented the Loſs of him, and went to the Water-ſide to take a laſt Farewel. And good Reaſon had they to do ſo: For he has been inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in feeding <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s Lambs with the ſincere Milk of the Word, and many of them (<hi>bleſſed be GOD</hi>) have grown thereby. Surely, I muſt labour moſt heartily, ſince I come after ſuch worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. The Good Mr. <hi>John Weſley</hi> has done in <hi>America,</hi> under GOD, is inexpreſſible. His
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004855_0004_100E02B9FA48E9E8"/>
Name is very precious among the People; and he has laid ſuch a Foundation, that I hope neither Men nor Devils will ever be able to ſhake. <hi>Oh, that I may follow him, as he has CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, June</hi> 5. Had a Conference with a certain Perſon of the Pariſh, who, I heard laſt Night, had been broaching many heretical Doctrines to one of my Friends, particularly in denying the Eternity of Hell-Torments. I therefore invited him this Morning to Breakfaſt: and after imploring GOD's Aſſiſtance, in the Spirit of Meekneſs, I aſk'd him, Whether he believed the Eternity of Hell-Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? He anſwered frankly, No. I replied, What do you mean, Sir, when you repeat the twelfth Article of our Creed? He ſaid, he believed wicked Men were to be annihilated. I then read <hi>Pearſon'</hi>s Expoſition of the laſt Article, but he denied it all, ſaid he thought himſelf in the right, and believed it his Duty to inform Mankind, that they were to be annihilated. Upon which I repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him that Paſſage out of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> 
               <q>If any Man ſhall take away from, or add unto the Words that are written in this Book, GOD ſhall take away his Name out of the Book of Life, and add unto him all the Plagues that are written in this Book.</q> This, he ſaid, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Afterwards we diſcourſed afreſh, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him reſolute to propagate his Principles, I then told him with the utmoſt Calmneſs that I was ſorry, that I gave him the Cup yeſterday at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but for the future, he muſt pardon me, if I refuſed ever to give it him again. This ſtaggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a little, but he bore it pretty patiently, yet
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004855_0005_100E02BBC07CE0C0"/>
thought me uncharitable. But I told him I ſhould meet him at the Judgment- Seat of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and then he would ſee upon what Principles I acted. <hi>May GOD give me Grace not to regard the Faces of Men, but with an humble well guided Zeal and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to watch the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt has made me Overſeer.</hi>
            </p>

Placed one that came with me, at <hi>Highgate,</hi> to teach the Children <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that belong to that Village, and <hi>Hampſtead.</hi> They are about twenty in all, of <hi>French</hi> Extraction, but ſome few of them are able to ſpeak a little in our vulgar Tongue. I thought placing a Maſter there, would be of great Conſequence, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I cannot think Children will ever be naturalized to the Colony, till they can talk our Language. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Becauſe the preſent Generation will ſoon wear off, and theſe Children being well inſtructed in ours, will make them forget their own Tongue, and ſhould they marry and have Children, they would naturally teach their Children the ſame; ſo that at length we ſhall all be of one Speech. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As they are but few in Number, and no likelihood of any <hi>French</hi> Miniſter to come amongſt them; I or my Succeſſors ſhall be unable to Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe or bring them to hear the Word of GOD at our Church, unleſs they are acquainted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, June</hi> 11. Opened a School to Day for the Girls of <hi>Savannah,</hi> a Friend, whoſe Heart GOD was pleaſed to touch on Board the Ship, having at my Requeſt undertaken to teach them. The Work is for my Maſter, &amp; therefore I doubt not

               <hi>Thurſday, June</hi> 22. Was taken (as all about me thought for Death) with a violent Purging and Vomiting, which in the Space of five Hours quite exhauſted my Spirits, and brought me in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance almoſt to the Point of Death. But GOD ſupported me by his inward Comforts, cauſed me to rejoice in it; and caſt me into a deep Sleep, out of which I awoke perfectly well, to the Surprize of all about me. <hi>O who can expreſs the loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the LORD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſhew forth all his Praiſe!</hi> My Pariſhioners in general ſhewed they loved me; for they ſeemed moſt follicitous for my Welfare.

               <hi>Tueſday, July</hi> 11. Returned this Evening from <hi>Ebenezer</hi> (Whither I went Yeſterday) the Place where the <hi>Saltzburghers</hi> are ſettled; and was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully pleaſed with their Order and Induſtry. Their Lands are improved ſurpriſingly for the Time they have been there, and I believe they have far the beſt Crop of any in the Colony—They are bleſt with two ſuch pious Miniſters, as I have not often ſeen: The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> have no Courts of Judicature, but all little Differences are immediately and implicitly decided by their Miniſters, whom they look upon and love as their Fathers. They have likewiſe on Orphan-Houſe, in which are ſeventeen Children, and one Widow, and I was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to ſee the Regularity wherewith it is manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Oh that GOD may ſtir up the Hearts of his Servants to contribute towards that and another which we hope to have erected at</hi> Savannah—Mr. <hi>Boltzius,</hi> one of their Miniſters, being with me on <hi>Saturday,</hi> I gave him ſome of my Poor's Store for his Orphans, and when I came to <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> he called them all before him, catechiſed and exhorted them to give GOD Thanks for his good Providence towards them; then prayed with them, and made them pray after him; then ſung a Pſalm, and afterwards the little Lambs came and ſhook me by the Hand one by one, and ſo we parted, and I ſcarce was ever better pleaſed in my Life—Surely, whoever contributes to the Relief of the <hi>Saltzburghers,</hi> will perform an acceptable Sacrifice to our Bleſſed Maſter, They are very poor; but with a little

               <hi>Tueſday, July</hi> 18. About ten o'Clock this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to <hi>Savannah,</hi> having ſet out from thence Yeſterday to viſit four or five Families that live at ſome of the outward Settlements about twelve Miles off.—Their Beginnings as yet are but ſmall, but I cannot help thinking there are Foundations laying for great temporal and ſpiritual Bleſſings in <hi>Georgia,</hi> when the Inhabitants are found worthy.—Bleſſed be GOD, in <hi>Savannah</hi> they will hear the Word gladly, and People every where receive me with the utmoſt Civility, and are not angry when I reprove them.—<hi>May GOD keep them always thus minded, and prepare me for whatever Sufferings he ſhall permit to fall upon me for doing my Duty.</hi>

            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning at five o'Clock, I publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound the ſecond Leſſon for the Morning or Evening Service as I ſee moſt ſuited to the People's Edification; at ten I preach and read Prayers, at three in the Afternoon I do the ſame, and at ſeven expound Part of the <hi>Church Catechiſm,</hi> at which great Numbers are uſually preſent. I viſit from Houſe to Houſe, read publick Prayers, and expound twice, and catechize (unleſs ſomething extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happens,) viſit the Sick every Day, and read to as many of my Pariſhoners as will come thrice a Week.—And bleſſed be GOD my Labours have not been altogether vain in the LORD.

               <p>This Evening had Prayers in a Houſe which Mr. <hi>Horton</hi> hired for us during my Stay, and moſt of the Inhabitants, I believe, were preſent.

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, Aug.</hi> 12. This Afternoon was alarmed with the News of a Family Diſaſter. My dear Friend <hi>H'</hi>s Brother going to find a Horſe that was loſt in the Woods, was loſt himſelf, and many Guns ſhot after him for ſeveral Days, but in vain. I endeavoured to give Thanks to GOD for this and every Thing that befalls me, becauſe it is his Will, and reſolved to ſet out for <hi>Savannah</hi> immediately, knowing what Concern my dear Friend <hi>H.</hi> muſt

               </p>
               <p>In the Evening, becauſe I was to go about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, I gave Notice I would preach as well as expound, at which almoſt all the Inhabitants were preſent; for many were obliged to ſtand without the Door. The Leſſon was very applicable to my Cricumſtances. It was the firſt of St. <hi>James</hi> wherein the Apoſtle bids us <hi>rejoice when we fall into divers Temptations.</hi> GOD enabled me to enlarge on it pretty much. I told the People that God called me and I muſt away, at which ſome wept. <hi>Oh GOD how doſt thou follow me with thy Bleſſings wherever thou ſendeth me! I looked for Perſecution, but lo!

Mr. <hi>Horton</hi> was extreamly civil, and did every Thing he could to oblige me. This Afternoon after Sermon intended to go with him to preach to the Soldiers at the Fort of St. <hi>Simon'</hi>s, and then the next Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to go to St. <hi>Andrew'</hi>s, <hi>but Lord thou calleſt me elſewhere.

Many of them going out all Day and Night after him.—Aſſoon as I had refreſhed myſelf I went and viſited my Pariſhioners from Houſe to Houſe to return them Thanks for their Kindneſs to my Friends. An unuſual Joy appear'd in their Faces at my unexpected Return, and they were ready to ſay, <hi>How beautiful are the Feet of him that bringeth the glad Tidings of Salvation!</hi> At Evening Prayers (and a very large Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was preſent) I returned my dear Hearers hearty Thanks for the late Inſtance of their ſincere Affection, I publickly exhorted my Friend that was loſt to ſhew forth his Thankfulneſs not only with his Lips but with his Life, and deſired their Prayers to GOD for me that I might now more and more devote myſelf to my Bleſſed Maſter's Service, and ſtudy daily to purify my corrupt Nature, that I might be made an Inſtrument under him of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Souls to GOD.</p>

A Neceſſity was laid on me to Day to expreſs my Reſentment againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity by refuſing to read the Burial Office over the moſt profeſſed Unbeliever I ever yet met with—GOD was pleaſed to viſit him with a lingering Illneſs, in which Time I went to ſee him frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.—Particularly about five Weeks ago, I aſked him what Religion he was of, he anſwered, <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was divided into ſo many Sects he knew not which to chuſe.</q>—Another Time, I offered to pray with him, but he would not accept it, upon which I reſolv'd to go ſee him no more;—But being told two Days before he died, that he had an Inclination to ſee me, I went to him again, and after a little Converſation I put to him the following Queſtions, "Do you believe JESUS CHRIST to be GOD, the one Mediator between GOD and Man?" He ſaid, "I believe CHRIST was a good Man."—<q>Do you believe the Holy Scriptures? I believe, replied he, ſomething of the Old-Teſtament, the New I do not believe at all. - Do you believe, Sir, a Judgment to come? he turned himſelf about, and replied, I know not what to ſay to that.—Alas, ſaid I, Sir, if all theſe Things ſhould be true—</q> which Words, I believe gave him Concern, for he ſeemed after to be very uneaſy, grew delirious, and departed in a Day or two.—Unhappy Man, how quickly was he convinced that all I ſaid was true. Now he and I are of one Mind: The Day after his Deceaſe he was carried to the Ground, and I refuſed to read the Office over him, but went to the Grave and told the People what had paſſed between him and

me, warned them againſt Infidelity, and aſked them whether I could ſafely ſay, "as our Hope is this our Brother doth." upon which I believe they were thoroughly ſatisfied that I had done right.—<hi>GOD grant this may be a Warning to ſurviving Unbeliever's.</hi>

For upon my ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Maſter to teach their Children, one offered to give me a Part of his Lot, and the reſt to give their Labour. Accordingly I accepted of it, found Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and to Day it was fit to preach in, and be made a School-Houſe. The Children tho' Foreigners, anſwer'd admirable well, which gave me great Hopes that the other Foreign Children of the Colony may alſo learn our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue when a proper Maſter is provided.—After Service we refreſhed ourſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thanked our Good GOD, and eat our Bread with Gladneſs of Heart.</p>

                  <hi>Monday, Auguſt</hi> 28. This being the Day of my Departure, it was moſtly ſpent in taking Leave of my Flock, who expreſſed their Affection now more than ever. For they came to me from the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Time I left them with Tears in their Eyes, wiſhing me a proſperous Voyage and ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and gave me other Tokens of their Love.

               <p>About Four in the Afternoon I went into the Boat provided for me by Mr. <hi>Cauſlon,</hi> who with the Recorder came to my Houſe and took their Leave.

               <p>My Heart was full, and I took the firſt Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of venting of it by Prayers &amp; Tears. I think I never parted from a Place with more Regret; for <hi>America</hi> in my Opinion is an excellent School to learn CHRIST in; and I have great Hopes ſome good will come out of <hi>Savannah,</hi> becauſe the longer I continued there, the larger the Congregations grew.

                  <hi>Saturday, Sept.</hi> 16. Had contrary Winds all the Week, and got but a few Leagues from <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> yet GOD ſhewed me great Mercies: For he enabled me to write ſeveral Things, and correct others. I have been but a little Sea-ſick; and though I have not had my Cloaths off, and lay upon Deck or on a Cheſt every Night, yet the Goodneſs of GOD keeps me healthy and ſtrong, and gives me a feeling Poſſeſſion of, his Holy Spirit. My Sphere of Action is now contracted into a very narrow Compaſs. There are but few Souls on Board, and all that I can do is to read publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and add a Word of Exhortation twice every Day, and catechiſe thoſe I brought with me. The Captain and all are very civil, my Chriſtian Friends have been much upon my Heart, and cauſed me ſome Dejections, but GOD was my Comforter. Had I my own Will, I could wiſh myſelf a ſpeedy Paſſage, that I may return the ſooner to thoſe few Sheep I have left at <hi>Savannah;</hi> but GOD knows beſt, and this Retirement, I hope, will break my Will, purify my Heart, and fit me for the great Work that lies before me. <hi>Even ſo</hi> LORD JESUS, <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, Sept.</hi> 23. Still GOD is pleaſed to ſend us contrary Winds, except one Night about the Middle of the Week.—However, he enables me to give Thanks—and great Reaſon have I ſo to do—<hi>For the Holy Spirit has been with me of a Truth!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have obſerved, that before GOD calls me to a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004855_0011_100E02C89751AE48"/>
publick Work, he always ſends me into ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, but never to ſo great a one as now.—A Sign this, I hope, that a greater Work is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. <hi>Lord, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it and prepare me for it!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Mind bleſſed be GOD, has been compoſed and eaſy. Only the Abſence of my Friends, now and then ſtruck a Damp upon my Spirits.—But the Friend of all is with and in me, and he by his Spirit, I truſt, will ſupply the Want of their dear Company.—<hi>Amen, LORD JESUS, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday,</hi> 24. <hi>Monday Sept.</hi> 25. Was oppreſſed much in Spirit theſe two Days. The Wind was contrary and the Sea wrought, and was tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but bleſſed be GOD, he enabled me to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to his Will, this outward and inward Trial being only what was to be expected after my late Aſſiſtances. <hi>We muſt not always be upon the Mount in this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ever ſince <hi>Monday</hi> Evening, GOD has been pleaſed to ſend us fair Winds, particularly to Day, when our Ship has ſail'd ſeven Miles an Hour, <hi>Bleſſed be GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been chiefly buſied about writing Letters, to engage more Labourers, and to get Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for my poor Flock.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be GOD! he has made me frequently rejoice in Spirit, and now quite reconciles me to my preſent Retirement. <hi>When ſhall I have no Will but GOD's!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, Octob.</hi> 1. Had very little Sleep all Night, and was like to fall of the Cheſt whereon I lay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times, the Sea being very rough, and the Wind turning in an Inſtant directly contrary. <hi>Oh
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004855_0012_100E02CACCF84448"/>
that I could learn from Winds and Storms to obey my Maſter!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Buried a young Man that came from <hi>Georgia,</hi> and died this Morning. LORD, what is Man? He ſolaced himſelf with the Tho'ts of ſeeing his Friends in <hi>England.</hi> But GOD ſaw fit to prevent it by ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Days. <hi>LORD, thy Judgments are like the great Deep!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I buried him, I could not ſay much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the rowling of the Ship; but at Evening-Prayer I took occaſion from the Leſſon (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially was the 15th <hi>Chap.</hi> of the firſt of <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>) to exhort all my Ship-mates to conſider ſo, as to prepare for their latter End. I believe my Words came with Power. <hi>GOD grant they may have a due Effect. Amen,</hi> LORD JESUS, <hi>Amen!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday, Octob.</hi> 6. Before I left <hi>Savannah,</hi> the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appointed for the Morning, was St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and before I left <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> the Leſſon was the Firſt of <hi>Jonah,</hi> both which made ſuch a deep Impreſſion upon me, that I wrote to my Friend <hi>Haberſham,</hi> to acquaint him I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive we ſhould have a dangerous Voyage: Since I have been on Board, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to his Companions, <q>That he perceived their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age would be to their great Damage,</q> has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been preſs'd upon my Heart; and GOD has now ſhewn me wherefore he gave theſe previous Notices. For on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night laſt, after we had ſailed 150 Miles, the laſt twenty Hours, about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven o'Clock aroſe a ſudden violent <hi>Eaſt</hi> Wind, which continued till about Four in the Morning, and put all the Sailors to their Wits End.—Moſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004855_0012_100E02CACCF84448"/>
of them declared they never had ſeen the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The main Sail was ſlit in ſeveral Pieces, and ſeveral of the other Sails, and much of the Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all to Tatters; not a dry Place was to be found in all the Ship: The Captain's Hammock, in the great Cabbin, was half filled with Water; and though I lay in the moſt dry Part of the Ship, yet the Waves broke in upon me twice or thrice. In ſhort all was Terror and Confuſion, Men's Hearts failing them for Fear, and the Wind and the Sea raging moſt horribly. But GOD (<hi>for ever be adored his unmerited Goodneſs</hi>) was exceeding gracious unto me. For I felt a ſweet Complacency in my Will, in Submiſſion to his. Many particular Promiſes GOD has made me from his Word, that I ſhould return in Peace, flowed in upon my Heart. And he enabled me greatly to rejoice.—This is the firſt Day we have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to pull down any of our dead Lights, which put me in Mind of the long Night the <hi>Egyptians</hi> once ſaw. But I ſpent my Time in reading, and fervent Interceſſion for abſent Friends, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted my ſelf much with the Remembrance of them; moſt of our freſh Proviſions are waſhed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Board, and our Tackling much out of Order, ſo that we have a Proſpect of but an indifferent Voyage. But bleſſed be GOD, the Proſpect pleaſes me. For now I ſhall learn, I truſt, how to want as well as how to abound, and how to endure Hardſhip like a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. <hi>O Lord, let thy Strength be magnified in my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſay unto my Soul, <q>It is I, be not afraid, and then let Storms and Tempeſts do their worſt.</q>

                  <hi>Saturday, Octob.</hi> 7. This has been a Week, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be GOD, though not of much Action, yet full of Opportunities of exerciſing my paſſive Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! To Day, adored be the Divine Goodneſs, the Weather has cleared up more and more, and our Ship has ſailed directly before the Wind, at the Rate of four or five Miles an Hour.</p>
               <p>A Deſire to ſee my Friends in <hi>England,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch my Buſineſs, and to return to my poor Flock, prompt me ſecretly to wiſh for a Continuance of this proſperous Gale. <hi>But LORD I know not what to pray for as I ought. Do with me as ſeemeth good in thy Sight. Only I beſeech thee to ſanctify my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Retirement; that the longer I am upon the Sea, the more zealous I may be in thy Service, when I come upon dry Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saw a <hi>Jamaica</hi> Ship, Captain <hi>Phillips,</hi> who has been out nine Weeks, <hi>What Reaſon have we to be thankful!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having had no Opportunity before, ſince the Storm, of getting many of our People together, gave a Word or two of Exhortation to my Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, to bleſs GOD for our late Deliverance, and to ſin no more leaſt a worſe Storm ſhould befal us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, October</hi> 14. Sailed this Week about 600 Miles; but Yeſterday GOD was pleaſed to ſend us a contrary Wind, which ſtill continues. <hi>Father, thy Will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A few Days ago I flattered myſelf we ſhould be ſoon at our deſired Port, but GOD is pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Accompliſhment of my Hopes: However, <hi>bleſſed be his Name, He enables me to give Thanks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt of this Week has been ſpent in ſearching
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004855_0013_100E02CD2C94B840"/>
the Scriptures; and particular Retirements for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſſiſtance in the Work before me.—GOD has been pleaſed to ſend me many inward Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. And now my freſh Proviſions are gone, and the People are put to the Allowance of a Quart of Water each Man for a Day. So that I hope now the Spiritual Man will grow, having ſo little for the natural Man to feed on. <hi>Amen, LORD JESUS.</hi>—Bleſſed be GOD I can by his Grace ſay that I rejoice in Neceſſities, and do in every Thing give Thanks. <hi>Keep me thus minded, O Dear Redeemer, till thou perfect thy Work in my Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had this Sentence out of <hi>Henry</hi> much preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Heart to comfort me in my Retirement;—<hi>The Mower loſes no Time whilſt he is whetting his Scythe.</hi>—Thus ſhall all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be taught of GOD.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, October</hi> 15. The Weather being calm, and I being kindly invited Yeſterday, went on board the <hi>Conſtant,</hi> Captain <hi>Philips</hi> bound from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> who now ſails in Company with us, and was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received both by the Captain and his Paſſengers, and not only ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they ſpared me what they could of their Proviſions. A moſt providential Supply; for ours was quite out. But our Extremity is GOD's Opportunity. <hi>Bleſſed be his Name for thus ſtrengthning our Faith. May this be looked upon as a Pledge that he will never leave or for ſake us.</hi>

               <p>Our chief Diſcourſe was about <hi>Georgia;</hi> and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little longer than was thought, my Shipmates were very ſuſpicious I ſhould be detained on board. But tho' their was Proviſion for the Fleſh, yet I like my own Situation beſt, becauſe here are greater

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, October</hi> 21. Made but ſlow Advances in our Voyage, having had but one or two Days of fair Wind. But notwithſtanding, I believe we ſhall now ſoon reach Shore; for GOD has been pleaſed to viſit me all the Week with Variety of inward Trials, which is a Sign to me that I ſhall experience yet more and more of his Mercies. <hi>How good is GOD thus to prepare me by Sufferings, that ſo his Bleſſings may not he my Ruin; theſe Things to the natural Man are not joious, but grievous; but GOD enables me to take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort only in him, to thank him ſincerely for his loving Correction, and therefore when I am ſufficiently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed thereby, I hope it will bring forth in me the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fruits of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, Octob.</hi> 22. At the Deſire of the Captain preach'd my Sermon on raſh Anger, having hitherto uſed to expound only. In the Leſſon were theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Words, <hi>Return to thy own Houſe, and ſhow how great Things God has done unto thee.</hi> And again, <hi>It came to paſs that when Jeſus was returned, the People gladly received him, for they were all waiting for him.</hi> Theſe laſt Words were remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſſed upon me at <hi>Savannah,</hi> when I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting GOD by Prayer, whether it was his Will that I ſhould go to <hi>England. Thus GOD's Word is in particular Caſes as well as in general, a Light unto our Feet, and a Lanthorn unto our Paths.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday, October</hi> 25. Was much comforted this Evening in reading the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> &amp; 34th Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> wherein I could not but obſerve many
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004855_0014_100E02CF4043DB18"/>
Circumſtances of GOD's dealing with him correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with what I have experienced in myſelf: The following Verſes in particular were ſet home to my Heart,—<hi>Alſo thou Son of Man, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thy People are ſtill talking againſt thee by the Wall and in the Doors of the Houſe, and ſpeak one to another, ſaying, Come, I pray you, and hear what Word cometh from the LORD.</hi>—<hi>And they came unto thee as the People cometh, and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them, for with their Mouth they ſhew much Love, but their Heart goeth after Covetouſneſs. And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely Song of one that hath a pleaſant Voice, and can play well on an Inſtrument: For they hear thy Words, but do them not.</hi>—Who that knows how GOD has dealt with me ſince I have been in the Miniſtry, ſees not that this Paſſage anſwers to my Circumſtances, as Face anſwers to Face in the Water? However, this I know, what I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from GOD will come to paſs (lo it will come) and then ſhall theſe Scoffers and Deſpiſers know, that a Miniſter of CHRIST has been amongſt them. <hi>O that I may never be brought forth as a ſwift Witneſs againſt any; but we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of</hi> CHRIST.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, October</hi> 28. Sailed about 300 Miles the four firſt Days of this Week: Had a little Storm on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night, and a great Calm ever ſince. We are now within 150 Leagues of Land, and our Proviſions and Water very ſcanty, and our Ship very weak; but the Hour of our Arrival is not yet come. <hi>Lord, Teach me to be reſigned and thankful, and then deal with me as ſeemeth good in thy Sight.</hi>

                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:004855_0015_100E02D1978967E8"/>
Bleſſed be God! he has this Week enlarged my Heart, and filled me with great Comfort, after great inward Conflicts. Is not all this to prepare me for further Trials we are yet to endure e're we get to <hi>England? LORD, thy Grace I know will be ſufficient for me, and therefore I rejoice in the Proſpect of enduring Tribulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had Reaſon to believe one on board was offended at my enlarging one Night on the Sin of <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>—I always endeavour to ſpeak with the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gentleneſs of CHRIST.—But if People will account me their Enemy, becauſe out of Love I tell them the Truth, I cannot help that. <hi>Lo, I have delivered my Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday, October</hi> 30. Still GOD is pleaſed that the Wind, what there is of it, ſhould be contrary, and our Ship's Company are now brought into great Streights. Their Allowance of Water is a Quart a Day, and our conſtant Food for ſome Time has been on Salt Beef and Water Dumplins, which do not agree with the Stomachs of ſome amongſt us. But GOD enables me to rejoice in that and all other our Neceſſities, yea, He ſo comforts me that many I believe are ſurpriſed at my Chearfulneſs. But when we are deſtitute of outward Comforts, then does GOD more comfort our Souls. This Morning when I awoke, the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was greatly preſſed upon me; and the Example of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the three Children, who were fat and well favoured, notwithſtanding they were fed with Pulſe and Peaſe, is continually before my Eyes. Some ſay we are within a hundred Leagues of Land. But what does that ſignify, if GOD ſays, <hi>Hitherto ſhall you go, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004855_0015_100E02D1978967E8"/>
no further. LORD, in thy due Time, let that which now letteth be taken away, but not before this Trial has done what it was ſent for, tho' it make us ſmart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I warm myſelf by ſmiling on, and exhorting them, and this Afternoon we joined in ſolemn Prayers ſuitable to our preſent Circumſtances. <hi>LORD, let our Cry come unto Thee.</hi> I know it will, and that we ſhall be anſwer'd, if it be beſt. But great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings await me on Shore, and great Trials muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede. <hi>Oh that I may by theſe ſmall, be prepared for greater Sufferings. Amen, LORD JESUS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday, October</hi> 30. Was comforted to-Night in my preſent Circumſtances, by theſe Verſes out of this Evening's Leſſon.—<hi>I have learnt in whatſoever State I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abaſed, and how to abound; every where, and in all Things I am inſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer Need. I can do all thro'</hi> CHRIST <hi>which ſtrengthneth me. Even ſo come,</hi> LORD JESUS. Amen <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>Reading afterwards in the Book of <hi>Maccabeus,</hi> and thinking of my preſent Situation, this Verſe was preſſed with unſpeakable Comfort upon my Soul. <q>After this, they went Home, and ſung a Song of Thankſgiving, and praiſed the LORD in Heaven; <hi>Becauſe it is good, becauſe his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for ever.</hi>
                  </q> I hope my Friends will take care to fulfil this when we meet together on Shore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday, Nov.</hi> 1. This Afternoon, about 4 o'Clock, as I was in Secret, humbling my Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD, interceeding for my Friends, &amp; had been praying for a fair Wind, &amp; Aſſiſtance in the great
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004855_0016_100E02D3BB97D048"/>
Work lying before me, News was brought that the Wind was fair; which put me in Mind of the Angel's being ſent to <hi>Daniel,</hi> to tell him his Prayer was heard, when he was humbling his Soul with Faſting, and praying for the Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Indeed I cannot ſay, I have purpoſely, for theſe three Weeks, eat no pleaſant Food, or faſted, as he did; but our Food is ſo ſalt, that I dare eat but little, ſo that I am now literally in Faſtings often. <hi>Oh! that I may improve this bleſſed Seaſon for Humiliation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts of Devotion, that I may be duly prepared to approve myſelf a faithful Miniſter of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>whether by Honour or Diſhonour, by evil Report or good Report.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as we found the Wind fair, we joined in Thankſgiving, and in ſinging the firſt Part of the 34th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> (new Verſion) which was very applicable to our Circumſtances. For they tell me they have not above three Days Water on Board, allowing a Quart to each Man a Day. But he, that at one Time, at the Requeſt of his Diſciples, conſidered the Multitude, and worked a Miracle for their Relief; and, at another Time, at the Interceſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> gave Water to the wandering <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> I truſt, now, has heard our Prayers, and ſent this Wind with a Commiſſion to bring us where he will ſupply all our Wants, <hi>If not, O bleſſed</hi> JESU, <hi>thy Will be done. Give me Grace, I moſt humbly beſeech thee, to hold out my three Watches, and at the fourth Watch I know thou wilt come. Even ſo come</hi> LORD JESUS.</p>

               <p>Laſt Night he lifted up the Light of his bleſſed Countenance upon me, and to Day fills me with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory; ſo that though I have little to eat, yet I inwardly poſſeſs all Things. I am ſometime afraid leſt continued Abſtinence may occaſion a bodily Sickneſs. But wherefore do I fear? If it does, that and every Thing elſe I know will work for my Good.—What I moſt dread, is leſt any on Board ſhould charge GOD fooliſhly; but I check the firſt Motions I diſcern ariſing in any one's Heart, and endeavour to juſtify our good GOD, in all the Evil that he hath brought upon us. I put before them the Example of the Widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> and caution them againſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the Waters of <hi>Meri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is now the eighth Week I have been Aboard. If my Friends aſk me, why I arrived no ſooner, I may truly anſwer, <hi>Satan</hi> hindered us. For I believe it is he who is permitted to do this; but this ſtill gives me greater Hopes, that a more effectual Door than ever, will be opened in <hi>England,</hi> for
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004855_0017_100E02D630C64848"/>
preaching the everlaſting Goſpel. <hi>O Satan, Satan, I defy thee to do thy worſt; thou mayeſt toſs me up and down, and bring me into Jeopardy on evey Side; but Jeſus Chriſt is praying for me on the Mount. And when the Time appointed by the Father is come, and my Soul hereby prepared, he whom Winds and Storms obey, will ſpeak the Word; and then I ſhall have a happy Meeting with my dear Friends!</hi>

                  <hi>Sunday, November</hi> 5. This Day we rejoiced with trembling. For though we thereon commemorated our Deliverance from the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> yet as our Circumſtances called for Acts of Humiliation, I uſed Part of the Office of Commination, (beſides ſolemn Prayer and Pſalms three Times) and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on theſe Words of St. <hi>James,</hi> 
                  <q>My Brethren, count it all Joy, when ye fall into divers Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; knowing this, that the trying of your Faith worketh Patience: But let Patience have her perfect Work.</q> I hope this had a good Effect upon my Hearers Hearts, and calmed their Spirits. For indeed we are brought very low: But I can ſay with the penitent Thief, <q>That I ſuffer juſtly, and do not receive the ten thouſandth Part of the Reward due to my Crimes.</q> 
                  <hi>Lord, remember me now thou art in thy Kingdom!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday, November</hi> 6. Laſt Night, about ſeven o'Clock, GOD was pleaſed to ſuffer a violent Wind to ariſe, which would not permit me to riſe till this Afternoon, about which Time it began in ſome Meaſure to abate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bleſſed be GOD, through the Precaution uſed by our Ship-Mates, we ſhip'd but little Water, only we were driven ſome Leagues back. The Weather was pretty cold, and a little

Cake or two baked on the Coals, and a very little Salt-Beef was all my Proviſion for the Day; but thus <hi>Elijah</hi> lived for a long while, and why not I? Nay, he faſted forty Days and forty Nights. And though I dare not preſume to do ſo, yet if GOD ſtill brings me into greater Wants, I doubt not, but I ſhall find that Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of GOD. <hi>Lord, I deſire not to be exempted from ſuffering, but to be ſupported under them. If thy Glory can be promoted by my Trials, lo, here I am, ſcourge me, try me as it ſeemeth good in thy Sight!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday, November</hi> 8. Preached myſelf, Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and this Morning, inwardly weak and fainting, and unable to read ſcarce any Thing. <hi>But, bleſſed be God! though he kill me, yet will I put my Truſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When my Spirits are gone, I then find my Faith, as it were, leſs lively: But I truſt that is only ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Frame of my Body. For at all other Times I have great Confidence in GOD! And was he now to put it to my Choice, whether this Trial ſhould continue, or he ſhould ſend us a fair Wind, I ſhould humbly refer it to him again. <hi>For I know not what is beſt for me!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt in the great Cabin now begin to be weak, and look hollow Ey'd, yet a little while, and we ſhall come to Extremities; and then GOD's Arm will bring us Salvation. <hi>May we patiently tarry the LORD's Leiſure!</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
               <p>Great Part of this Day I lay down, being weak and much oppreſſed in my Head; but at Night when ſome doubted what the End of this Viſitation would be, the following Verſes were with great
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004855_0018_100E02D9431736C8"/>
Comfort preſſed upon my Soul. <q>For I am in a ſtrait between two, having a Deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with CHRIST, which is far better. Nevertheleſs to abide in the Fleſh is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for you. And having this Confidence, I know that I ſhall abide and continue with you all, for your Furtherance and Joy of Faith: That your rejoicing may be more abundant in JESUS CHRIST for me, by my coming to you again.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus Chriſtians have Meat to eat, which the World knoweth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In confidence of this, and ſuch like Texts, that have been from Time to Time applied to my Soul, I ſtill, (as often as my Strength will permit) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to write Letters ready to ſend when I come on Shore. Which reminds me of <hi>Jeremiah'</hi>s being commanded to buy Land, when his whole Country was about to be carried into Captivity. <hi>Bleſſed are they that walk by Faith, and not by Sight!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though one in his Haſte the other Day cried out, "What <hi>Jonah</hi> have we on Board?" And I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, I am he; yet many now, I believe, bleſs GOD, that I am with them. For, ſay they, <q>How ſhould we have been blaming and curſing one and other, had not Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d</hi> been amongſt us?</q> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed be God, if my Miniſtry or Preſence can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to prevent Sin againſt thee, O Lord, toſs me on the Ocean as long as it pleaſeth thee! O my dear Lord, I deſire to be reſigned!</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday, November</hi> 9. Enjoyed great Peace of Mind to Day, and was ſtronger in Body than uſual. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord!</hi> We are now making for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and are advanced ſome Leagues towards it.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004855_0018_100E02D9431736C8"/>
Whether we ſhall arrive there or not, GOD only knows. I find all Uneaſineſs ariſes from having a Will of my own. And therefore I ſimply deſire to will what GOD willeth. <hi>Oh! when will this once be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday, November</hi> 10. Was much ſtrengthened in our preſent Diſtreſs by the ſecond Leſſon for the Day. It was our Saviour's turning the Water into Wine at the Marriage of <hi>Canaan.</hi> We have appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him as the Holy Virgin did, and told him in Prayer, that, "We have but very little Water?" At preſent, he ſeems to turn away his Face, and to ſay, "What have I to do with you?" But this is only becauſe the Hour of Extremity is not yet come. When it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doubt not but he will now as richly ſupply our Wants, as he did theirs then. <hi>May we in Patience poſſeſs our Souls!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, November</hi> 11. Still we are floating about, not knowing where we are. But our People ſeem yet to have Hopes of ſeeing <hi>Ireland.</hi> I know not whether I am out in my Conjecture, but I imagine ſome of thoſe Ships we have ſeen, are arrived at <hi>England</hi> before us. Upon which, perhaps, my Friends will expect me, pray for me, and at laſt give me up for loſt. <hi>And then God will reſtore me to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Weather now begins to be cold, ſo that I can ſay, with the Apoſtle, <hi>I am in Hungrings and Thirſtings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cold and Faſtings often.</hi> Hereafter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, I may add <hi>moreover in Bonds and Impriſonments.</hi> But I truſt the Sufferings of this Life will not move me. <hi>For they are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My outward Man ſenſibly decayeth, but the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004855_0019_100E02DB50FCC140"/>
Spiritual Man, I truſt, is renewed Day by Day. I have beſought the LORD many times to ſend us a fair Wind: But now I ſee he does not think fit to anſwer me. I am wholly reſigned, knowing that his Grace will be ſufficient for me, and that his Time is beſt.</p>
               <p>Our Ship is much out of repair, and our Food by no means, enough to ſupport Nature in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Way, and that of the moſt indifferent Kind too: An Ounce or two of Salt-Beef, a Pint of Water, and a Cake made of Flower and Skimmings of the Pot. But I think often on him who preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Ark of <hi>Bulruſhes.</hi> And ſo long as I look upwards my Faith will not fail.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be GOD for theſe Things, I rejoice in them daily. They are no more than what I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I know they are Preparatives for future Mercies. <hi>GOD of his infinite Mercy humble and try me, till I am rightly diſpoſed to receive them. Amen.</hi> LORD JESUS. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It pities me often to ſee my Brethren, lying in the Duſt, as they have done theſe many Weeks and expoſed to ſuch Streights: For GOD knows both their Souls and Bodies are dear unto me. But thanks be to GOD they bear up well, and I hope we ſhall all now learn to endure Hardſhips, like good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday Nov.</hi> 12. This Morning the Doctor of our Ship took up the <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> and obſerved that he opened upon theſe Words, <hi>Bleſſed be the LORD GOD of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for he hath viſited and redeemed his People.</hi> And ſo indeed he has, for about 8 o'Clock this Morning News were brought,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004855_0019_100E02DB50FCC140"/>
that our Men ſaw Land, and I went and was a joyful Spectator of it myſelf. The Air was clear, and the Sun ariſing in full Strength, ſo that 'tis the moſt pleaſant Day I have ſeen theſe many Weeks. <hi>Now know</hi> I <hi>that the LORD will not always be chiding, neither keepeth he his Anger forever.</hi> For theſe two or three Days laſt paſt, I have enjoyed uncommon Serenity of Soul, and given up my Will to GOD. And now he hath brought us Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.—From whence I infer, that a Calmneſs of Mind, and entire Reſignation to the Divine Will, is the beſt Preparative for receiving Divine Mercies. <hi>LORD evermore make me thus minded!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as I had taken a View of the Land, we joined together in a Prayer and Pſalm of Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and already began to reflect with Pleaſure on our late Streights. Thus it will be hereafter, the Storms and Tempeſts of this troubleſome World will ſerve to render our Haven of eternal Reſt dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly agreeable.—I fear now nothing ſo much as the Treachery of my Heart, leſt like the ungrateful Lepers, I ſhould not turn to GOD and give Thanks by leading a Holy Life. <hi>But all Things are poſſible with GOD, on whoſe rich Mercies and free Grace in</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>I alone depend for Wiſdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Spent a good Part of this Afternoon in walking upon Deck, and bleſſing GOD for the Proſpect I ſaw all around me. His good Providence has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bring us into a fine large Bay, ſurrounded on each Side with high Lands and Hommocks, much like thoſe near <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and a large Light-Houſe on the Fore-Land, from which in the Evening was
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004855_0020_100E02DD52D57CC8"/>
ſhewn a Light. It lies on North-Weſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> and moſt ſuppoſe we are near <hi>Limerick,</hi> but are not certain, only one of our Men having been here before. There are no Soundings till you come very near the Land. The Wind being againſt us (that little that was of it) we could not get much forward: <hi>But GOD in his due Time will bring us on ſhore.</hi> Bleſſed be his Name, the Weather is exceeding clear, and this is the moſt comfortable Day I have ſeen along Time. <hi>LORD make me mindful of theſe thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies all the Days of my Life!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tueſday, Nov.</hi> 14. Let this Day, my Soul, be noted in thy Book, for GOD has viſited thee with his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.—On <hi>Monday</hi> midnight, as I was lying on my Bed, my Sleep departed from me, and I had no reſt in my Spirit, becauſe although the Weather was ſo exceeding Calm, and we in ſo great Diſtreſs, yet no Boat was ſent to fetch us Proviſions. Upon this I ſpoke to the Captain, and he to the Mate, who in the Morning went with a Boat, and about Noon this Day returned loaded with Proviſions and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not only ſo, but told us, he was kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by the People he met with, eſpecially by a great Country Gentleman, who came to his Seat at midnight, on purpoſe to relieve him and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; furniſhed them with a freſh Boat and other Neceſſaries, moſt kindly invited me, though unknown, to his Houſe, to ſtay as long as I pleaſed; and has order'd Horſes to wait ready to take me thither.</p>
               <p>Who is ſo great, ſo good a GOD, as our GOD? Our Hour of Extremity was indeed come: For we had but half a Pint of Water left, and my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004855_0020_100E02DD52D57CC8"/>
was exceeding weak, through my long Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; but now his Almighty Arm hath brought us Salvation.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thro' all the changing Scenes of Life,</l>
                  <l>In Trouble and in Joy,</l>
                  <l>The Praiſes of my GOD ſhall ſtill</l>
                  <l>My Heart and Tongue employ.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Of his Deliverance I will boaſt,</l>
                  <l>Till all that are diſtreſt</l>
                  <l>From my Example Comfort take,</l>
                  <l>And charm their Grief to reſt.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Fear him ye Saints, and you will then</l>
                  <l>Have nothing elſe to fear;</l>
                  <l>Make you his Service your Delight,</l>
                  <l>Your Wants ſhall be his Care.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>As ſoon as the Proviſions came, we kneeled down and returned hearty Thanks to our good GOD, who has heard our Prayers, and ſent his Angel before us, to prepare our Way.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Therefore my Lifes remaining Years,</l>
                  <l>Which GOD to me ſhall lend,</l>
                  <l>Will I in Praiſes to his Name,</l>
                  <l>And in his Service ſpend.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>A little before our Proviſions came, I had been noting in my Diary, that I believed Deliverance was at Hand; for laſt Night and this Morning, I had the moſt violent Conflict within myſelf that I have had at all. Thus GOD always prepares me for his Mercies. <hi>Oh that this may ſtrengthen my Faith, and make me willing to follow the Lamb whereſoever he ſhall be pleaſed to lead me, Amen,</hi> LORD JESUS, <hi>Amen!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:004855_0021_100E02DF52D19C98"/>
Still greater Mercies GOD confers on his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Servant. For after our Proviſions were brought aboard, the Wind ſtill continued fair, and by ſix at Night blew us to a little Place on <hi>Karrigholt</hi> Iſland, before which we caſt Anchor. <hi>Praiſe the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me praiſe his Holy Name!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ever ſince I have been on Board the <hi>Mary,</hi> theſe Words, <q>Howbeit we muſt be caſt upon a certain Iſland</q> (which were Part of the Leſſon I read laſt at <hi>Savannah</hi>) have been continually preſs'd upon my Heart, ſo that I have often mention'd it to one of my Companions. Behold they are now fulfilled. <hi>Oh how unſearchable are thy Doings, O LORD, and thy Ways paſt finding out!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why GOD dealeth thus with me, I know not now, but I ſhall know hereafter. However this I know, that this Voyage has been greatly for my Good.—For I have had a glorious Opportunity of ſearching the Scriptures, compoſing Diſcourſes, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Letters, and communing with my own Heart.—We have been on Board juſt nine Weeks and three Days.—A long and perilous, but profitable Voyage to my Soul: For I hope it has learnt him, in ſome meaſure, to endure Hardſhips as becometh a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of CHRIST. My Cloaths have not been off (except to change me) all the Paſſage: Part of the Time I lay on open Deck, Part on a Cheſt, and the Remainder on a Bed-ſtead cover'd with my <hi>Buffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe'</hi>s Skin. Theſe Things, tho' little in themſelves, yet are great in their Conſequences; and whoſoever deſpiſeth ſmall Acts of bodily Diſcipline, it is to be feared, will inſenſibly loſe his ſpiritual Life by little
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004855_0021_100E02DF52D19C98"/>
and little.—Many inward Trials alſo GOD has been pleaſed to ſend me, which I believe, he has ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my great Good. I am now going on Shore, to the Houſe of a wealthy Gentleman, whom GOD has commanded to receive me. I may yet be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to many Perils by Land e're I ſee my dear Friends. But his Grace who has preſerved me from ſo many Perils by Water, will alſo be ſufficient for me on dry Land. Whilſt I continue on this ſide Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I never expect to be free from Trials, only to change them. For it is neceſſary to heal the Pride of my Heart, that ſuch ſhould come: With a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fear and trembling, I think of going to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> But he that preſerved <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den of Lions, and the three Children in the fiery Furnace, will, I hope, preſerve me from the fiery Trial of Popularity, and from the miſguided Zeal of thoſe, who without Cauſe, are my Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Hands I commend my Spirit. Magnify ſtill thy free Grace in me. Guide me by thy unerring Wiſdom, receive, O receive me for thy infinite Mercies ſake, in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, <hi>into Glory hereafter!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Succeſs of my Miniſtry, whilſt on Board, I ſhall only ſay, That I hope much Sin has been prevented, and one I hope effectually conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who is to be my Fellow Traveller to <hi>England. LORD if I can but be made inſtrumental to ſave one Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I care not if I am toſſed on the Ocean through my whole Life. Glory be to GOD on High!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable that juſt as we had caſt Anchor, a violent Wind roſe, which (had it happen'd ſooner) muſt have greatly hurt us. <hi>Marvellous are thy Works,</hi> O LORD, <hi>and that my Soul knoweth right well!</hi>

About ſeven at Night I dreſs'd myſelf and went on Shore, and was received in a ſtrong Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Mr. <hi>Mac Mahon,</hi> the Gentleman who ſent me an Invitation.

                  <hi>Friday, Nov.</hi> 17. Had a very pleaſant ride, over a fine fruitful open Country to <hi>Fourthfargus,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage as was reckoned only ten, but at a moderate Computation thirty <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles from <hi>Kilruſh:</hi> But this is not the firſt Piece of <hi>Iriſh</hi> I have met with.—<hi>Their innocent Blunders often extort Smiles from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I ſtopped to have my Horſes ſhoe'd I went into one of the Poor Peoples Cabins, as they call them; but it may as well be called a Stye, a Barn, or a Poultry Coop. It was about twenty Feet long, and twelve broad, the Walls built with Turf and Mud. In it, was a Man threſhing Corn, two Swine feeding; two Dogs, ſeveral Geeſe; a Man, his Wife, three Children, and a great Fire.—<hi>Georgia</hi> Hutts are a Palace to it.—Indeed the People live very poorly in this Part, ſome walk barefoot with their Shoes in their Hands to ſave them from wearing out, others out of Neceſſity.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004855_0023_100E02E3B2B8C590"/>
And I obſerved many of their Feet to be much ſwell'd, and ready to guſh out with Blood, through extremity of Cold.—<hi>LORD, Why is my Lot caſt into a fairer Ground? Thy free Grace alone has made the Difference!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt I was in the Cabin, as they call their little <hi>Iriſh</hi> Huts, I talk'd with the Woman in the Houſe, and found ſhe was a <hi>Roman Catholick:</hi> And indeed the whole Commonalty almoſt, are of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Profeſſion, and ſeem to be ſo very Ignorant, that they may well be termed the <hi>Wild Iriſh.</hi> No Wonder, when the Key of Knowledge is taken from them. Wo unto their blind Guides. I can think of no likelier Means to convert them from their erroneous Principles, than to get the Bible tranſlated into their own native Language, to have it put in their Houſes, and Charity-Schools erected for their Children, as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> has done in <hi>Wales,</hi> which would inſenſibly weaken the <hi>Romiſh Intereſt:</hi> For when once they could be convinced that they were impoſed upon, they would no longer ſuffer themſelves to be miſled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Oh that ſome Man, in whom is the Spirit of the Holy GOD, would undertake this!</hi>

About two this Afternoon we reach'd <hi>Limerick,</hi> a large Garriſon Town, with a Cathedral in it, about twenty one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles from <hi>Fourthfargus.</hi> The Roads, as we came along, grew better; but the People much more ſubtle and deſigning. Here are alſo many Beggars, which I impute to the Want of Pariſh Proviſions for them.—At Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Prayer we went to the Cathedral, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publick Thanks for our ſafe Arrival. The Remainder of the Night was ſpent in neceſſary Buſineſs, refreſhing our Bodies, religious Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and in writing ſome Things I ſtood in need of.</p>
               <p>Good GOD! Where was I laſt <hi>Saturday?</hi> In Hunger, Cold and Thirſting; but now I enjoy Fulneſs of Bread, and all Things convenient for me, GOD grant, I may not, <hi>Jeſhurun like, wax fat and kick.</hi> Perhaps it is more difficult to know how to abound, than how to want. But I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to receive both with Thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, Nov.</hi> 20. Having ſent laſt Night to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Dr. <hi>Burſcough,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Limerick,</hi> that I was lately arrived: At his Lorſhip's appointment, I waited on him this Morning, and was received with the utmoſt Candour and Civility. At his Lordſhip's Requeſt, I preached this Morning at the Cathedral, to a very numerous Audience, who ſeem'd univerſally affected, and full of expectation that I would preach in the Afternoon; but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did not ſeem to open a Door. But why ſhould not a Strange Miniſter always offer his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? I think it is a wrong Piece of Modeſty not to do it. For a Sermon from a Stranger may do more Good than many from thoſe the People are conſtantly uſed to.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:004855_0024_100E02E6DB53D598"/>
After Sermon the Mayor ſent twice to invite me, but I was pre-engaged to the Biſhop, who kindly invited both me and my Friend, thanked me for my Sermon, and offered me the free Uſe of his Palace, and would have inſiſted on my accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, had I not told his Lordſhip I was to leave <hi>Limerick</hi> in the Morning: <hi>Oh into what a wealthy Place has my Good GOD brought me?</hi> How does he every where command ſome or other to receive me? As I was eating at Dinner, I was meditating on the Divine Goodneſs in ſpreading ſuch a Table for me, when laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> I was in danger almoſt of periſhing with Hunger. But I thought at the ſame Time, if this was ſo great a Bleſſing, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater one will it be, after the Troubles of this Life, to ſit down and eat Bread in the Kingdom of GOD. <hi>O that I may be accounted worthy of that heavenly Banquet!</hi>

                  <hi>Monday, Nov.</hi> 20. Went about <hi>Limerick</hi> Town this Morning, to diſpatch ſome neceſſary Buſineſs. And found the good Seed ſown yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, had received a Bleſſing from above. For all the Inhabitants ſeem'd alarmed, and look'd moſt wiſhfully at me, as I paſſed along. One ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Tradeſman in particular even compell'd me to come in, and ſhewed me and my Friend uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civilities, and told me how ſolicitous the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were for my ſtaying longer.—Another came to my Inn, and begg'd me to come and ſee him, which I did.—And the good Biſhop, when I went to take Leave of his Lordſhip, kiſſed me, and ſaid theſe Words, <q>Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> GOD bleſs

               </p>
               <p>About four in the Afternoon, againſt much Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion to the contrary, we left <hi>Limerick,</hi> and reach'd <hi>Tuller-Bridge,</hi> about ſix Miles diſtant from thence by ſix o'Clock, where I and my Friend were agreeably refreſhed, and ſpent the Remainder of the Evening in writing to ſome at <hi>Limerick,</hi> and ſtrengthning one another, and bleſſing GOD for theſe freſh Inſtances of his unmerited Mercies. Who knows what a great Matter this little Fire may kindle? This I am aſſured of, GOD did not ſend me to <hi>Ireland</hi> for nothing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In my Way I had a ſhort Conference with a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> who ſeem'd more knowing than the Generality of thoſe of that Perſuaſion, but ſadly miſguided.

               </p>
               <p>As far as I can find by all I converſe with, they place Religion in being of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Communion, and are quite ignorant of the Nature of inward Purity and Holineſs of Heart. <hi>Lord, the Chriſtian World is caſt into a deep Sleep, ſend forth, I beſeech thee, ſome faithful and true Paſtors to awaken them out of it!</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Two Things I can remark much for the Credit of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Roads, eſpecially to <hi>Dublin,</hi> are ſurpriſingly Good, and Proviſions exceeding cheap. A Perſon may travel without much Expence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday, Nov.</hi> 24.

And the People, as it were, not only hung upon me to hear me in the Morning, but alſo flock'd to the Church where I preached in the Afternoon; ſo that it was like a <hi>London,</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
