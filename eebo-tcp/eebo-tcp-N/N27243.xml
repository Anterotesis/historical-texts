         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The MONTHLY REVIEWERS, after quoting thoſe parts of the Preface which ſketch out the deſign and object of this publication, add, "Such is the editor's account of her undertaking; and it muſt be acknowledged, that ſhe has ſucceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her wiſhes, the 'Romance of real Life' being a collection of intereſting and well authenticated facts.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A LITERARY friend, whoſe opinion I greatly value, ſuggeſted to me the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of producing a few little volumes, that might prove as attractive as the moſt romantic fiction, and yet convey all the ſolid inſtruction of genuine hiſtory. He affirmed, that the voluminous and ill-written French work, entitled <hi>Les Cauſes Célébres,</hi> might furniſh me with very ample materials for ſo deſirable a purpoſe.</p>
            <p>He adviſed me to ſelect ſuch ſtories from this collection, as though disfigured by the affectation and bad taſte of the compiler, Guyor de Pitaval, might lead us to form awful ideas of the force and danger of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man paſſions. He wiſhed me to conſider my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s under no reſtriction, but that of adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o authenticated facts; and, by telling each ſtory in my own way, to render it as much as poſſible an intereſting leſſon of morality.</p>
            <p>This hint appeared to me ſo captivating, that I began the attempt ſuggeſted, with great pleaſure; but ſoon became ſenſible of many
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:036316_0005_1008D7ED76F3E6D0"/>
difficulties I had to encounter. The ſtyle of the original is frequently obſcure; the facts are often anticipated, and often repeated, in almoſt the ſame words, in different parts of the ſtory: they are alſo often interrupted by remarks, or by relations wholly foreign to the ſubject, by which the attention is bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and the intereſt weakened. I found, indeed, ſo many minute and unneceſſary details, and ſo much improper and ridiculous deſcription, intermixed with the moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic events, that I was ſometimes on the point of relinquiſhing my undertaking.</p>
            <p>Yet it occurred to me, that the reaſon which made the work difficult and unpleaſant for me to write, would render it, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhed, a deſirable book to thoſe who may wiſh to obtain ſome idea of a celebrated publication, without wading through the obſcurities and extraneous matter of M. de Pitaval.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of my work, I met with a new edition of my original, by M. Richer. This gentleman tells his reader, that he has elucidated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e difficulties and obſcurities of his predeceſſor; and I hoped to receive great aſſiſtance from his labours: but I cannot ſay the production of M. Richer entirely anſwers the promiſes of his preface. The ſtyle is certainly clearer, and the narrative more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, but it is alſo leſs intereſting; and in ſome inſtances he ſets forth the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and even the cataſtrophe, in a light
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:036316_0006_1008D7EF0C8882E8"/>
very different from that in which they are placed by M. de Pitaval. I have, however, let the facts remain as related by him from whom I happened to ſelect them, mentioning only at the end of each ſtory, the author I have followed.</p>
            <p>It is probable, that ſome of theſe ſtriking ſtories may have already found their way to the Engliſh preſs; but, as I have been my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable to find any preceding tranſlation of thoſe I had ſelected, I may preſume that, with moſt Engliſh readers, my work will have the attraction of novelty.</p>
            <p>I am aware, indeed, that it is a kind of work from which little ſame can ariſe to its author; but I have not the falſe pride and delicacy to wiſh, that my reader ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me uninfluenced by humbler motives to publication.</p>
            <p>My ambition will be ſatisfied, if a number of candid readers allow, that, by dint of ſome irkſome labour, I have produced a little compilation, not inelegant in it ſtyle; and, in the matter it contains, both intereſting and inſtructive.</p>

            <head>THE MARCHIONESS DE GANGE.</head>
            <p>IT has been aſſerted, that there is in human nature a propenſity to every kind of evil; and that perſons of the beſt diſpoſition, and moſt liberal education, may find themſelves in ſuch ſituations as will, if their paſſions are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to predominate, betray them into the moſt frightful exceſſes, into crimes which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be related without horror.</p>
            <p>Under the dominion of ſuch dreadful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the abbé and the chevalier de Gange muſt have been, when they committed the inhuman cruelties which are the ſubject of the following narrative.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate victim of their malice and inhumanity, was the only daughter of the ſieur de Rouſſan of Avignon; and though her birth was not noble, the ſplendid fortune ſhe was to inherit from the ſieur de Nocheres, her maternal grandfather, made her to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a deſirable match by the firſt nobility

in the province.—Mademoiſelle de Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blanc (as ſhe was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſled before her marriage), was not only a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ch heireſs, but one of the lovelieſt women in France; and the deſcription that remains of her perſon, which paints her as poſſeſſed of almoſt every perfection that adorns the female form, correſponds with the minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is extant of her, drawn by Mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, and allowed to be one of his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite performances.</p>
            <p>With ſo much perſonal beauty, with a ſoft and compaſſionate heart, ſenſe rather ſolid than lively, a temper ſerene and gentle, and manners calculated to adorn and enjoy ſociety, ſhe was married, at the age of thirteen, to the marquis de Caſtillane, grandſon of the duke de Villars. This young man was of an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious family, handſome and well made, and had received an excellent education, which heightened the good qualities be inherited from nature.</p>
            <p>They were married in the year 1649, and the marquis ſoon afterwards carried his wife to court, where ſuch a blazing ſtar could not appear withoutattracting univerſal admiration.—She was immediately acknowledged the reigning beauty of the ſeaſon, and that gay and gallant monarch Louis the fourteenth, was himſelf ſenſible of her uncommon attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—admiration of ſo flattering a nature as would have intoxicated any other young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.—At ſome of thoſe magnificent ſpectacles
<pb facs="unknown:036316_0009_1008D7F95C55F3B8"/>
that were then given at court, the king choſe madame de Caſtillane for his partner in danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—where her elegant dreſs, which was moſt fortunately choſen, and the grace with which ſhe performed, gave new luſtre to her charming face and figure.—She was leſs known at court by the name of the marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs de Caſtillane than by that of the beautiful Provençal.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this diſſipated circle, ſo dangerous to a very young perſon, the fair madame de Caſtillane continued perfectly to poſſeſs her reaſon; and to thoſe with whom ſhe was intimate declared, that ſhe felt the emptineſs and fallacy of the pleaſures with which ſhe was ſurrounded, and that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her no real ſatisfaction.—It is not to be ſuppoſed, however, that envy would wholly ſpare a woman ſo univerſally admired. Some adventures of gallantry were attributed to her, which thoſe who knew her beſt, declared to be totally void of foundation; and, as no better proof was ever offered of their reality than the ſcandal of the day, it is probable they were the inventions of malice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, always ready to raiſe, againſt ſuperior excellence, reports, which idleneſs and folly are as ready to propagate.</p>
            <p>Surrounded with gaieties and luxuries; admired by thoſe who ſaw her, beloved by thoſe who knew her, madame de Caſtillane continued ſome time at court. And there ſhe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036316_0010_1008D7FB2FE087E0"/>
heard the melancholy account of the loſs of the galley in which her huſband ſome ſhort time before had embarked, who being overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a ſtorm on the coaſt of Sicily, periſhed, together with all who were on board.—Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely afflicted at his death, ſhe retired to the houſe of a friend, madame d'Ampus, till the regulation of her affairs obliged her to return to Avignon.</p>
            <p>When ſhe arrived at her native place, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pleaſures of liberty, which ſhe might now enjoy, being a widow in the earlieſt bloom of youth, nor the effect that her charms (which received new ſplendour from the dark contraſt of her weeds) had on all who beheld her, could engage her to continue in the world—and ſhe retired for a conſiderable time to a convent, where ſhe permitted none to ſee her but her particular friends, or ſuch as had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with her relative to her eſtate.</p>
            <p>But as ſoon as the ſevere confinement to which ſhe thought it right to conform, during the firſt year of her widowhood, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax, through the ſolicitation of her friends, a crowd of lovers ſurrounded her—and among the moſt conſpicuous, was the young marquis de Gange. His perſon was not leſs a model of manly beauty, than that of the marchioneſs de Caſtillane of female grace and lovelineſs. His fortune was perfectly ſuitable, and his rank illuſtrious, being baron de Languedoc, marquis de Gange, and governor of St. Andre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:036316_0011_1008D7FCB594DBA0"/>
—His manners were extremely engaging, and his age did not much exceed twenty—and ſo well did the exterior qualities of theſe young perſons appear to correſpond, that it ſlruck all who know them, that they were deſigned by Heaven for each other.—Madame de Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillane, inſenſible of every other paſſion, ſoon felt and returned that of monſieur de Gange. This ſecond marriage took place in 1658, and the world applauded a union, which ſeemed ſo likely to ſecure the happineſs of both parties. But however in outward advantages they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to agree, their ſouls were very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Proud, fierce, capricious, obſtinate, and gloomy, how little the marquis de Gange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled her, with whom his deſtiny was united! For ſome time, however, after their marriage, he concealed, under the fond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the lover and the bridegroom, that unhappy temper, and thoſe unpleaſant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that afterwards appeared in the huſband—and the beautiful marchioneſs, who was herſelf all truth and mildneſs, never ſuſpected him to be otherwiſe than he then appeared.— Alas! to theſe halcyon days ſucceeded others, in which the ardour of his paſſion being abated, he no longer thought it worth his while to diſguiſe his diſpoſition.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036316_0012_1008D805381208D0"/>
turned to be again the admiration of the crowds ſhe had deſerted for him; but it was merely for amuſement ſhe did ſo; and not with any deſign of engaging in affairs of gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—She never ſeriouſly liſtened to any of her admirers; but, as ſoon as ſhe perceived an attachment forming, that was likely to create any real uneaſineſs, ſhe either wholly excluded ſuch pretenders from her ſociety; or, if ſhe admitted them to it, received them with ſo much coolneſs, that the vaineſt among them ſoon found they had nothing to hope.—But though her conduct was perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, the marquis (conſcious perhaps of the inequality of their minds) beheld it with jealouſy and miſtruſt. His temper, naturally moroſe and vindictive, was much diſpoſed to ſuſpicion; and his humour became every day more teaſing and diſagreeable to his wife—Yet, as a jealous huſband is in France an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ridicule, and as he could find nothing in the conduct of madame de Gange, on which to found any real complaint, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained himſelf as much as he could, and ſuffered the uneaſineſs of his mind to appear only in the invincible ill temper with which he received his wife—by which, if ſhe had really had the inclinations he ſuſpected her of, he would only have accelerated the evil he ſo greatly dreaded.</p>
            <p>Such was his ſituation of mind, when his two brothers, the abbé and the chevalier de
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036316_0013_1008D80267AD3DE8"/>
Gange, came to reſide at his houſe. The elder of them, who was called the abbé de Gauge, poſſeſſed an uncommon ſhare of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, with the malice and cunning of a fiend. Violent, proud, and ambitious, he ſtudied to govern every one about him; in which, from his ſuperior abilities, he uſually ſucceeded too well. Having neither prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of honour or ſentiments of humanity, no conſiderations, no laws, either divine or human, could prevent his carrying any point on which he had once reſolved. Yet this diabolical ſpirit he had art enough to conceal, with the profoundeſt diſſimulation, and could aſſume the appearance of the moſt amiable, benevolent, and honeſt man in the world, while his heart was the receptacle of every vice that diſgraces human nature. He was not in orders, but took the equivocal title of abbé, as being the moſt favourable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of his licentious paſſions. The che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, whoſe underſtanding w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> below medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity, ſeemed born only to be directed by others; and the abbé, without his perceiving it, governed him entirely. Over the marquis alſo the abbé acquired the ſame aſcendancy. His eſtate and his family were ſoon given up to the management of this aſſiduous brother; who left him the name of maſter, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all the power. The uncommon charms of the marchioneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Gange made an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and deep impreſſion on the heart of this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036316_0014_1008D806D1D0C2B0"/>
bad man; nor did the conſideration of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his brother's wife deter him a moment from forming deſigns upon her honour. Scorning to put any reſtraint on his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, however unwarrantable, he determined to attempt ſeducing madame de Gange; and for this purpoſe, knowing the influence of gratitude on ſuch a heart as hers, he began by endeavouring to oblige her. He ſaw how uneaſily ſhe lived with his brother, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued her inceſſantly with jealouſy and ill-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour—and the firſt uſe he made of his power over the marquis was, to induce him to alter his conduct towards his wife: of whom the abbé ſpoke ſo advantageouſly, that his jealouſy began to give place to thoſe ſentiments of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem and tenderneſs which he had at firſt felt for her. The marchioneſs, ſenſible of this change in her huſband's behaviour, gave way to the natural goodneſs and ſweetneſs of her diſpoſition, and forgot the harſh treatment ſhe had lately ſuffered; treatment which was on the point of changing her former attachment into a ſettled coldneſs, if not averſion. The abbé, however, did not intend that madame de Gange ſhould enjoy the ſatisfaction ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her huſband's returning affection, without knowing to whom ſhe owed it. As ſoon as an opportunity offered, he took care to tell her, that the marquis's preſent attention and kindneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſequence of what he had ſaid in her favour—and he gave her at the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036316_0015_1008D80A48EF4AE0"/>
ſame time to underſtand, that the heart of his brother was ſo entirely in his hands, that her treatment muſt depend wholly on him. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at ſuch a declaration, the marchioneſs anſwered coolly, that ſhe thanked him. The abbé was a good deal diſappointed at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſhe gave him on this occaſion. He had flattered himſelf that ſhe would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with more vivacity his proffered ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and that, by firſt engaging her grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he ſhould in time create in her breaſt warmer ſentiments in his favour. But though a man of abilities, ſuch as he poſſeſſed, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to make himſelf agreeable, and has ſuch continual opportunities of doing ſo, is above all others the moſt dangerous object a young woman can encounter, it happened that the diſlike, even bordering on antipathy, which madame de Gange had conceived, on the firſt ſight of the abbé, was an invincible obſtacle to his deſigns. Her manner towards him was civil, bnt ſo cold and diſtant, that he could very ſeldom find an occaſion to ſpeak to her apart. And after ſome time, as he ſaw ſhe ſtudied to avoid him, and that all his aſſiduities made no impreſſion on her, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſpeak plainly, and to acknowledge his paſſion, in terms that ſhe could not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand.</p>
            <p>The marchioneſs had engaged herſelf to paſs ſome days at the country reſidence of a friend.—Thither the abbé followed her,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036316_0016_1008D80D44BE0CE0"/>
and as his converſation was extremely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he was received with pleaſure by the whole party.—He was uſually the life of whatever company he was in, and now he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted himſelf to the utmoſt, and was more brilliant and entertaining than ever. A hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party being propoſed, at which every gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was to attend on a lady, the abbé of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to eſcort madame de Gange; which ſhe accepted, with her uſual cool civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as a matter of perfect indifference.—As ſoon as the company began to diſperſe in the woods, the abbé, who now ſaw the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at hand that he had ſo long wiſhed for, led madame de Gange into the moſt unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented ſpot he could find, and then, with very little preface, made the confeſſion he had meditated—but ſo abruptly, and with expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo ſtrong and ardent, that they inſpired madame de Gange with terror rather than pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—who turning pale with ſurpriſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, could not immediately form any reply; while the abbé continued to declare himſelf with ſuch violence of manner, and in terms ſo unequivocal, that ſhe could not doubt of his being very much in earneſt—and ſhe ſaw, that to endeavour to laugh it off, us ſhe would have done ſuch a declaration from a leſs reſolute lover, would have availed her nothing; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, therefore, an air more reſerved than before, ſhe ſaid—<q>I will not, monſieur Pab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bé, affect to miſunderſtand you—but you
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036316_0017_1008D8113A124D70"/>

Stung to the ſoul, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation entirely forſook him, and he fiercely anſwered—<q>Know you not, madam, when you brave my vengeance thus, that your fate is entirely in my hands?

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036316_0019_1008D816C3198C70"/>
paſſion with which the abbé had dared to trouble her, never failed to be greatly in his favour. But unhappily the chevalier, equally ſuſceptible of the power of beauty, could not be continually with her, and receive marks of her eſteem, without feeling the ſame paſſion riſing in his boſom. The regard ſhe teſtified for him on all occaſions, and the pleaſure ſhe took in his ſociety, inſpired him with hopes, that ſhe was very far from meaning to give. The abbé ſoon ſaw the ſituation of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's heart, and ſaw it with inexpreſſible rage and anguiſh. He determined to watch them narrowly; but having done ſo for ſome time, all his malice did not enable him to diſcover any one circumſtance, that was at all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the pureſt virtue, on the part of madame de Gange. Though he was irritated to diſtraction, by the partiality ſhe ſo avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſhewed the chevalier, yet he wiſhed to try whether it was to him only that her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was impregnable; and he determined to ſpeak to the chevalier, and to engage him to puſh his good fortune. For this purpoſe, he took the firſt opportunity of their being alone, to ſay to him—<q>Brother, we are both in love with the marchioneſs; if you can make yourſelf acceptable, I will withdraw my pretenſions, and ſhall be ſatisfied to rejoice in your happineſs; but if you fail, I expect you will have the generoſity to acknowledge it, und give me leave, in my

turn, to try my fortune. I truſt that we are ſo much united, that we ſhall not be embroiled about a woman.</q> The cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, who was a dupe to this pretended gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, proteſted, that, rather than give his brother, the abbé, any unaſineſs, he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to conquer his paſſion. "No," ſaid the abbé, <q>if I ſee you happy, I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. My friendſhip is yet dearer to me than my love.</q> They embraced on the ſtrength of this convention, and the chevalier agreed immediately to open the ſiege. In conſequence of which, though he never had the courage to declare himſelf in ſuch direct terms as the abbé had done, he threw ſo much paſſion into his eyes and manner, and redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his aſſiduities in a way ſo much warmer than mere brotherly ſentiments would have inſpired, that madame de Gange could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſtake their ſource; and ſoon found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to avoid his company, as much as ſhe had till then ſought it. But as ſhe perceived, that this alteration in her conduct, marked as it was, did not ſufficiently diſcourage him, ſhe ſometimes mingled in her converſation the moſt poignant raillery, on the miſtakes the chevalier often made in company: and though ſhe was naturally very candid, and wiſhed to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate or conceal ſuch errors, ſhe made uſe of this method to let the chevalier ſee how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible he appeared to her, and by that means to deprive him of all the hopes her

kindneſs had made him entertain; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to this ſeverity ſhe owed the cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge he harboured againſt her, ſince nothing is ſo likely to pique ſuch a man and to irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him beyond forgiveneſs, as to let him ſee he is contemned and deſpiſed, for weakneſs of which he is conſcious.

For this purpoſe he affected to remark, that madame de Gange had lately taken particular delight in aſſociating with a certain party, among whom was a young man of a moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging perſon and manners; and in fact, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Gange was fond of his ſociety, and frequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The abbé having ſuffered her to continue for ſome time under the ſufferings he had himſelf occaſioned, determined again to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt moving her in favour of himſelf.

               </gap>ound an opportunity of ſpeaking to her alone. At length he contrived to join her in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, "Well, madam," ſaid he, attempting to take her hand—<q>are we always to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Why do you oblige me to make you unhappy, when you know I would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice my life to your ſatisfaction.

moſt unhappy of women: and you know that you may, on certain terms, engage me to uſe that power only to contribute to your felicity.</q>—Madame de Gange heard him without interruption, and, as ſoon as he had concluded his harangue, ſhe caſt on him a look expreſſive of the moſt profound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and walked from him without deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reply; leaving the abbé more enraged and mortified than before.</p>
            <p>It was about this time that the marchioneſs de Gange, and ſeveral perſons who were with her, eat of ſome cream in which arſenic had been infuſed, but in ſo ſmall quantity, that the oily nature of the vehicle, in which it was adminiſtered, prevented its having the ill effect that had been intended. On this occaſion, a prediction, that had been made to her ſome years before, at Paris, returned to her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:—an aſtrologer, whom it was the faſhion to conſult, aſſured her ſhe would die a violent death; and though ſhe had too much ſenſe to give much credit to the vain and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious ſcience of divination, ſhe could not, on this event, forbear ſpeaking of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that had been made.

poſſeſſion of a very large fortune, which he left to her ſole uſe and diſpoſal. The marquis now thought it neceſſary again to alter his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and to treat with reſpect a woman who had ſo much in her power. The abbé was the forwardeſt to adviſe him to aſſume the ſemblance of his former affection, ſince he ſaw that he could himſelf gain nothing, but that his family might loſe a great deal by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary behaviour. As to the chevalier, he was a mere cypher, whom the abbé directed as he pleaſed. But the change was too great, at this time, to deceive madame de Gange. Whatever their profeſſions were, ſhe believed their hearts were ſtill the ſame, and that their preſent complaiſance ſhe owed entirely to her acquiſition of fortune, and her power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of it. As the affairs of this wealthy ſucceſſion were likely to occupy a great deal of their time, and to prevent their going to Gange ſo much as they uſed to do, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis deſigned paſſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhe declared madame de Rouſſan, her mother, her ſole heir, for life, to all her fortune, with liberty to give it, at her death, to either of the children which ſhe (the marchioneſe de Gange) had by the marquis.

This lady, who was of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter uncommonly amiable, and had a very ſuperior underſtanding, was charmed with her daughter-in-law, and on this and every other occaſion had behaved to her with the greateſt politeneſs and regard. Her uſual reſidence was at Montpellier, but ſhe now came to paſs ſome time with her ſon, and endeavoured to contribute, as much as poſſible, to make her reſidence at Gange agreeable to the young marchioneſs. The marquis himſelf, as well
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036316_0027_1008D82DC85FFB60"/>
as the abbé and the chevalier, ſeemed alſo to ſtrive, by their preſent kindneſs and attention, to make her forget every impropriety in their former behaviour, and left nothing undone that they thought would convince her that their hearts were entirely changed.—The moſt inſinuating manners, the moſt delicate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were employed to perſuade madame de Gange of their ſincerity; and the abbé and chevalier, as if convinced that their preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous attachment had juſtly incurred the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the marchioneſs, now appeared no longer as importunate lovers, but as tender friends; and they aſſumed this character with ſo much eaſe, that ſhe, who was the moſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ſincere of women, forget inſenſibly the diſlike ſhe had conceived, and lived with them on a footing of unreſerved friendſhip and intimacy; flattering herſelf that her future life would be tranquil, and even happy. After the whole family had continued together for ſome time, the dowager madame de Gange returned to Montpellier, and the marquis ſaid he was obliged by buſineſs to return to Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. But before he went, there is reaſon to believe he held a long conſultation with his brothers; which contributed but too much to the tragical event that ſo ſoon followed his departure.</p>
            <p>The dowager marchioneſs and her eldeſt ſon being gone, madame de Gange found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone with two perſons who were in fact
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036316_0028_1008D82F50D89770"/>
her greateſt enemies, but who hid their enmity under ſuch refined hypocriſy, that ſhe not only believed them entirely cured of their former diſhonourable thoughts of her, but that they had been converted by her conduct to a juſt ſenſe of what they owed her and her huſband. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſoon as the abbé ſaw that his diſſimulation had on her ſoft and ingenious mind all the effect he had hoped for, he contrived, under pretence of conſulting only her happineſs, to mention to her the will the had made at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon, which he beſought her to alter, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to her, that while ſuch a will remained in force, the world, as well as the marquis her huſband, would believe, that ſhe ſtill har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured anger and reſentment againſt him; and that, as he was determined to live with her for the future in the moſt perfect harmony, it was her part to convince him, by revoking that will, that ſhe no longer remembered their former diſagreements. Madame de Gange, whoſe heart was formed for affection and forgiveneſs, could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot reſiſt theſe reaſons; ſhe conſented to make a new will, in which ſhe gave every thing to her huſband. The abbé either did not know of the declaration ſhe had ſigned at Avignon, or did not believe it would inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate a ſubſequent act. Certain it is, that he did not aſk her to revoke that act; but having, as he thought, ſecured her property to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he prepared to execute the infamous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he had formed; and, by his influence with
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036316_0029_1008D834118CB8B8"/>
the infatuated chevalier, he forced him to enter into all his views, and even to keep pace with him in the moſt atrocious crimes.—Some time in May, 1667, madame de Gange, being ſlightly indiſpoſed, ſent to the apothecary of the place for a medicine ſhe had occaſion to take; but when it came, it was ſo black and thick, that ſhe found her averſion to it invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and refuſed to ſwallow it. She contented herſelf with taking ſome pills ſhe had by her. It is more than probable, that the abbé and the chevalier had mixed poiſon in this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; for, as they did not know, for ſome hours, that the marchioneſs had not taken it, they ſent in the courſe of the morning ſeveral times, to the door of her chamber, to enquire how ſhe did; undoubtedly expecting, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, to hear, that the potion had the effect they intended; but being undeceived, as to her having drank it, they formed the diabolical reſolution of deſtroying, at all events, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate object of their malignity.</p>
            <p>Madame de Gange, who found it neceſſary to keep her bed all day, invited ſeveral ladies of the neighbourhood to come and paſs the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon with her, and, though ſhe was not quite well, ſhe never appeared more intereſting or entertaining. The abbé and the chevalier, who were admitted to join the party, ſeemed unuſually abſent and melancholy, particularly the chevalier, whom the marchioneſs laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly attacked on his abſence of mind, and at
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036316_0030_1008D832119C02C8"/>
length obliged him to return her raillery. The abbé, though he alſo ſeemed much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved than uſual, failed not to enliven the converſation by ſome of thoſe agreeable ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, for which he was ſo remarkable. But ſtill there was in the behaviour of them both, ſomething that the company remarked as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Neither of them partook of a collation that was ſerved up to the ladies, of which madame de Gange not only did the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with her uſual graceful eaſe, but alſo eat heartily. When it was over, the ladies took their leave; the abbé attended them to the door, but the chevalier remained ſitting by the bed ſide, buried in thought, and with a countenance ſo gloomy, as very much puzzled the marchioneſs, who knew not how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it. The dreadful myſtery was ſoon cleared up, on the return of the abbé into the room. She ſaw him enter in about ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, holding in one hand a piſtol, and in the other a glaſs filled with a black liquid. Fury and diſtraction was in his eyes; his hair ſeemed briſtled on his head, and his features were con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulſed with paſſion. No deſcription can do juſtice to the terror his whole figure inſpired. He faſtened the door, and advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s towards the bed where the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted marchioneſs lay, he ſtopped us if to contemplate his victim, and, fixing on her his glaring eyes, which ſeemed forced out of their ſockets by the rage that poſſeſſed him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036316_0031_1008D83981B63F68"/>
for above a minute to ſtand ſtaring on her with a petrifying look, as if to announce to her all the horrors of her fate!—On the other ſide of her appeared the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier; his countenance as expreſſive of the rage that conſumed him, as was his brother's, but the expreſſion was different, and when he drew his ſword, ſome ſaint hope aroſe in the marchioneſs, that he drew it to defend her; but ſhe did not long continue in that error. Theſe two wratches, with the hearts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of demons, came cloſe to her bed, and the abbé, with a hollow, but determined voice, ſaid,—<q>Now, madam, you are to die—chooſe whether it ſhall be by ſword, piſtol, or poiſon.</q>—"To die!"exclaimed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Gange—<q>Good God! what have I done? how have I deſerved this exceſs of cruelty? and why are you to be my judge and executioner?</q>—Finding that remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance ſeemed to aggravate his fury, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed herſelf to the chevalier, and, turning on him her lovely eyes, ſhe cried—<q>Ah! my dear brother, are you too armed againſt me? is it poſſible that you can have the heart to become my murderer? and does all my kindneſs and regard for you deſerve no other return?</q> (She had often lent him ſums of money of her own, and only a few days before given him a draught for five hundred livres.) But far from being ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by this pathetic addreſs, it ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036316_0032_1008D83C0CB1A628"/>
his rage againſt her, and, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and voice yet more terrible, he cried, <q>Our reſolution is taken, madam—you muſt die—chooſe therefore the means, for we can heſitate no longer.</q> — If the fact were not well authenticated, it could not be believed that two young men, on whom the beauty of madame de Gange had had ſuch an effect, ſhould now harden their hearts againſt her, pleading with all that beauty, and with the moſt moving remonſtrances, for her life, and determine to dip their hands in her blood: but ſo it was!—and, while the abbé held the piſtol to her head, and the chevalier his ſword to her heart, ſhe took out of the abbé's other hand the poiſon, and, finding there was no remedy, ſwallowed it. The nature of it was ſo corroſive, that ſome of it falling on her breaſt turned the ſkin quite black, and her lips were alſo burnt and parched by drinking it. Not content with having made her ſwallow the liquid, the chevalier took a ſilver bodkin, and collecting the dregs, that remained on the ſides and at the bottom of the glaſs, he put them on its edge, and inſiſted on her ſwallowing that alſo, uſing expreſſions of indecency and brutality which embittered his cruelty. The unhappy marchioneſs obeyed; but though ſhe took this laſt deſtructive mixture into her mouth, ſhe did not ſwallow it, but held it there till ſhe had an opportunity, unperceived, to conceal it in the bed-clothes. But, as ſhe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036316_0033_1008D83D9270A848"/>
had now ſwallowed more than enough to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy her, ſhe exclaimed, in a voice of the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſnatched at her petticoat, and caught it with ſuch force, that a piece of it remained in his hand; and the turn this gave to her whole body, ſo broke her fall, that ſhe came to the ground with her feet firſt, which were terribly cut by the ſtones. The wicked prieſt, who was entirely devoted to the ſervice of the abbé and the chevalier, ſeeing ſhe had reached the ground without being materially hurt, threw at her a very heavy pitcher of water, which ſtood in the window next to that from whence ſhe had jumped; and which, if it had fallen on her head, muſt have certainly killed her; but it fell within two or three inches of her. The firſt thought that occurred to her, as ſoon as ſhe reached the ground, was to endeavour to diſcharge the poiſon that ſhe had ſwallowed: for this purpoſe ſhe took one of the treſſes of her long hair, and put it as far as ſhe could down her throat; the expedient ſucceeded, and ſhe brought up the noxious mixture, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with what ſhe had eaten, and then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make her way out of the incloſure where ſhe was; but every door was faſtened. She then went towards the ſtables; they were ſhut alſo; and ſhe now deſpaired of eſcaping before her cruel aſſaſſins could reach her. At length ſhe ſaw a groom, "—Oh friend!" cried ſhe, <q>ſave my life—I am poiſoned—let me go through the ſtables, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive help before it is too late.</q> The man, moved by her ſituation, took her in his arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and carried her through his ſtables into the road, where he put her under the care of ſome women who were paſſing by.</p>
            <p>The prieſt, in the meantime, haſtened to the abbé and the chevalier, to inform them of her eſcape; and they reſolved not to leave their work imperfect. While ſhe ran wildly along, imploring ſuccour from every one ſhe met, they purſued her, crying out that ſhe was delirious in a fever, and had eſcaped from her attendants. The people, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her almoſt without clothes, her feet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and bleeding, her hair diſhevelled, and running along ſhe knew not where, were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſuaded that ſhe was indeed out of her ſenſes. At length, as ſhe reached the door of the ſieur des Prats, about three hundred yards from the cheateau, the chevalier over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her; and forcing her into the houſe with him, ſhut the door, while the abbé re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained on the outſide with a piſtol in his hand, proteſting that he would kill the firſt perſon that offered to approach, for that he would not ſuffer his ſiſter-in-law, in the ſitu, ation ſhe then was, to become a ſpectacle to ſtrangers. His real deſign was to prevent her receiving any aſſiſtance that might counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the effect of the poiſon.

But in God's name, my dear brother, have compaſſion on me! pity me, my dear brother, pity me! and do not precipitate a death, which is perhaps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inevitable.</q> This ſupplication, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with all the touching energy of deſpair, all the perſuaſive eloquence of beauty, only irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cruelty of the monſter to whom it was addreſſed: he took a ſhort ſword which he wore, and, uſing it as a dagger, ſtabbed the marchioneſs twice with it in her breaſt. She flew from him, and called for help: he purſued her, and gave her five other blows on the back; and having ſnapped his ſword; left the broken end in her ſhoulder. As he now thought he had concluded this bloody ſcene, he quitted the room, and going haſtily to the door, he ſaid to the abbé, who was waiting there, <q>Come, abbé, we muſt be gone, the buſineſs is done.</q>—By this time the ladies were returned to the room where madame de Gange lay weltering in her blood, and to all appearance, breathing her laſt. Her blood ran from her in ſtreams; her reſpiration was

The enraged abbé, ſeeing this blow which he thought ſo effectual, defeated, gave madame Brunel a violent ſtroke with his fiſt, and then attempted to ſtun the marchioneſs with the end of his piſtol; but the women now all preſſed round him, overwhelmed him with blows, and driving him in ſpite of all his efforts to the door, they thruſt him out and ſhut it upon him. They then returned to the unhappy lady; and one of them, who knew ſomething of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urgery, ſtaunched the blood, and took from her ſhoulder the end of the ſword, encouraged by madame de Gange her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who, weak and fainting as ſhe was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her to put her knee againſt her ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to force out the broken weapon.

have been mortal. She was put to bed, and hopes were entertained that ſhe might yet ſurvive. In the mean time the two aſſaſſins, taking advantage of the night, fled from the ſcene of their cruelty. It was nine o'clock in the evening when they ſet out together for Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, another eſtate of the marquiſs's, about a league from Gange. There they remained ſome time, conſidering what they ſhould next do; and the reproaches they made each other, for not having completed their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous undertaking, roſe at length to ſuch a height, that they were ready to draw their ſwords on each other. They talked of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Gange, there to finiſh their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but they recollected is was improbable they ſhould ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The marquis de Gange was at Avignon when the news of this bloody cataſtrophe reached him; and though there is little doubt but that he had agreed with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and even that the deſign originated with him, yet it is probable that he expected they would have completed their undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the certain but ſilent mode of poiſon, and not in a manner ſo open and undiſguiſed. As ſoon as he learned the particulars, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the utmoſt concern and diſtreſs, and proteſted he would revenge the cruel treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his wife had received from his brothers, by putting them to death with his own hands. In a word, he rather over-acted his part at firſt, in ſome reſpects; for it was remarked that, inſtead of ſetting out immediately for Gange, he deferred his departure for four and twenty hours, though it ſhould ſeem that not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been loſt by a man who really loved a wife, ſoſiuated as was madame de Gange. It appeared alſo very extraordinary, that to the friends he ſaw at Avignon after he received the intelligence, he never mentioned what had happened, though it is ſo natural for a perſon under the preſſure of a new affliction to ſpeak of it to every body, and to think of nothing elſe. When the marquis arrived at Gange, a monk announced his being there to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he marchioneſs, and ſhe received him with all
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036316_0041_1008D8544CDD22F8"/>
the tenderneſs and regard that the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved huſband could have expected; ſhe only gently reproached him for having left her in the power of his cruel brother. The great judge of hearts, only knows what paſſed in that of the marquis. If he was indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to her murder, which there was great room to believe, this reception, ſo kind and forgiving, muſt have been one of the moſt cruel puniſhments he could undergo: he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad the art, however, to compoſe his countenance, and not to betray, in his behaviour, the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which muſt have torn his heart with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and anguiſh.</p>
            <p>Such was the delicate ſenſibility of madame de Gange, that recollecting, after ſome time, that ſhe had perhaps hurt him by her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches in regard to his brother, ſhe apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſed to him, and intreated him to impute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe had ſaid not to any want of affection for him, but to the extremity of her ſufferings, which extorted ſuch complaints from her; and ſhe held out her hand to him in token of perfect amity, and with a ſweetneſs peculiar to herſelf. This exceſs of goodneſs, which one would imagine muſt have been a new puniſhment to the marquis, only renewed his hopes of availing himſelf of her affection, to ſecure the fortune of the dying victim. He deſired her to revoke the act, by which ſhe had confirmed her firſt will made at Avignon; and to confirm that which ſhe had made
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036316_0042_1008D855F3AC93A0"/>
ſince at the inſtigation of the abbè, which the vice-legate, in conſequence of the deed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, had refuſed to regiſter. But ſhe firmly and poſitively proteſted againſt making any alteration; and it is believed, that this attempt of the marquis's perſuaded her that he had had but too great a ſhare in the dreadful reſolution of taking away her life, though ſhe did not ſhew her ſuſpicions by any change in her behaviour. Certain it is, that thoſe about her, whoſe notions of the marquis's guilt were before very ſtrong, were by this ill-timed and improper requeſt confirmed in their evil opinion of him. As he found how fixed madame de Gange was in her determination, he forbore to renew the diſcourſe, but continued aſſiduouſly to attend on her every day, at the houſe of the ſieur des Prats, where ſhe ſtill remained, not being judged in a ſituation to reach Montpellier, though ſhe earneſtly deſired it.</p>
            <p>Her mother, madame de Rouſſan, and ſome of her relations from Avignon, arrived at Gange the day after the marquis. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Rouſſan, who had no doubt of the marquis's guilt, was aſtoniſhed to find him attending on her daughter, and to ſee them on good terms. Perſuaded as ſhe was, that he was the original projector of the infamous ſcheme to deſtroy her daughter, ſhe could not with any patience endure to ſee him with her; her blood ſeemed to reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l at the ſight
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036316_0043_1008D85A1A3D9720"/>
of him; and, as ſhe was unable to conceal or conquer the averſion ſhe felt for him, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in three days to Avignon, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all her daughter's endeavours to prevail on her to ſtay.</p>
            <p>Nothing could be more affecting than the pious ſentiments of madame de Gange, who declared, that ſhe ſincerely forgave her mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and prayed to God to forgive them, and to accept her prayers for their ſalvation. As there were ſometimes faint hopes of her recovery, but oftener total deſpair of it, ſhe deſired to receive the ſacrament. What was her aſtoniſhment, when ſhe behe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> it preſented by Perette, the ſame prieſt who had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to aſſiſt in her aſſaſſination! Dreading leaſt even under the form of the ſacred wafer, poiſon might be again adminiſtered, ſhe inſiſted on the prieſt's partaking it with her; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and then in the moſt ſolemn manner ſhe called God to witneſs, while ſhe received the hoſtie, that ſhe forgave her murderers, and all who had abetted their crime.</p>
            <p>It was with perfect indifference ſhe heard thoſe praiſes of her beauty, which all who now ſaw her could not help giving it; for never in the moſt brilliant health, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with all the means of happineſs, did her charms appear to greater advantage, and never perhaps were they ſo intereſting. Her eyes had ſometimes all their dazzling luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, at others, that ſoft langour which added
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036316_0044_1008D85E3706FD88"/>
to, rather than diminiſhed their attractions. Her complexion retained all its delicacy; and her ſentiments and converſation were calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to inſpire all who ſaw her with regret, that ſuch an aſſemblage of perfections was ſinking into an early grave!</p>
            <p>Her ſon, of whom ſhe was paſſionately fond, was conſtantly at her bedſide; and as ſhe knew that nothing was ſo likely to make a deep and indelible impreſſion on his tender mind, as the ſight of his dying mother, and hearing the advice ſhe ſhould give, ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed almoſt all the hours ſhe did not paſs in religious exerciſes, in endeavouring to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs on his memory maxims of charity, piety, and forgiveneſs, while her own conduct gave the pureſt example of their practice. Above all, ſhe ſought to call away his thoughts from thoſe ideas of vengeance, which, young as he was, aroſe in his mind towards the cruel wretches who had deſtroyed his mother.—The parliament of Toulouſe nominated mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Catalan, conſellor of the parliament, as a commiſſioner to interrogate madame de Gange; he arrived on the third of June, but ſhe was then too ill to ſee him, however the next day he was admitted to her apartment, and was ſhut up with her alone for ſome time, when he forgot nothing that was likely to clear up the horrid ſtory, into which he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned to enquire. When he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

to him her earneſt deſire to be removed from Gange, where the dreadful ideas of the ſcene ſhe had paſſed through were ever before her eyes, and where ſhe had ſeveral reaſons to fear for her ſafety. Monſieur de Catalan aſſured her, that he would take care ſhe ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved as ſoon as poſſible—but it was too late; for after paſſing a night, in which ſhe ſuffered inexpreſſible torments, the next day, June the fifth, her complaints ſeemed to recur with new violence; and about four o'clock that evening ſhe breathed her laſt, ſurrounded by her friends, who were drowned in tears; and who were ſo much affected by her death, that for many years afterwards they felt as lively a ſorrow whenever it recurred to them, as they did when they ſaw her expire.</p>
            <p>Thus died the marchioneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>On opening her body, it was found that her death had not been occaſioned by the wound ſhe received, but by the poiſon, which had burnt the coats of her ſtomach, and turned her brain quite black; ſuch was the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive quality of the potion ſhe had ſwallowed that though it did not all remain in her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, it is aſtoniſhing that her conſtitution could ſo long reſiſt its effects. But nature, who had adorned her perſon with ſo many

               </gap>he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. As ſoon as ſhe was dead, monſieur de Catalan ordered the marquis, who was ſtill at Gange, to be arreſted. He ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to purſue by law the aſſaſſins of his wife; however the magiſtrate put his ſeal on the chateau, and ordered him to be carried to the priſon of Montpellier; where, though it was night when he arrived, the windows and the ſtreets were filled with ſpectators, and the populace, who, as well as thoſe of ſuperior rank, were convinced of his guilt, received him with groans, hiſſes, and imprecations.</p>
            <p>Madame de Rouſſan, the mother of madame de Gange, took poſſeſſion of her daughter's eſtates, and loudly declared her reſolution of avenging her death on the marquis and his execrable brothers. She publiſhed a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial againſt him, which, as it is only a repetition of the foregoing facts, need not be here noticed—except that in one ſhe accuſes the marquis of having once beat her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhut her up in a kind of tower for ſeveral days, where ſhe was ſeized with a diſorder reſembling an apoplexy. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Gange gave to this memorial a very
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036316_0047_1008D86652664808"/>
ſhort anſwer, of which this is the ſenſe:—He ſays, that having the misfortune to have two brothers who have taken away the life of his wife, of a wife he tenderly loved, he, in completion of his unhappineſs, is accuſed of being one of the accomplices. Overwhelmed and confounded by a deſtiny ſo ſevere, his innocence has not the power to manifeſt itſelf; all he can ſay is, that on ſuppoſition only can he be thought guilty, and that much of what has been ſaid againſt him is founded on calumny. Such is the ſtory of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs's being poiſoned in cream, and of the ill treatment ſhe is ſuppoſed to have received. And as to his being a party concerned in the murder, it is founded merely on conjecture, and without any ſhadow of proof. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeals to the juſtice and equity of the judge, againſt this ſlight and merely preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evidence.</p>
            <p>The popular clamour continued loud againſt the three brothers; but the judges, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated examinations of the marquis, could find no proof againſt him, that could juſtify their condemning him to capital puniſhment. Yet they could not by any means acquit him. On the 21ſt of Auguſt, they pronounced ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that the abbé and the chevalier de Gange ſhould be broken alive on the wheel; the marquis degraded from his nobility and baniſhed the kingdom for ever, and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune confiſcated to the uſe of the king; and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036316_0048_1008D8AD2305BA90"/>
the prieſt Peret te, after being deprived of his office by the eccleſiaſtical power, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the gallies for life. The ladies of Montpellier, who reſented the aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of madame de Gange, as if every one of them had loſt a ſiſter, murmured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely at the inadequate puniſhment of the marquis; which was perhaps the reaſon that, ſome time afterwards, the marquis de la Douze, accuſed of poiſoning his wife, was condemned to capital puniſhment, though there was only ſtrong preſumptive evidence againſt him.—Let us now ſee what became of the murderers; for there is little doubt but that the marquis may be reckoned among them; ſince, inſtead of purſuing his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to revenge the death of his wife, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined them, it ſhould ſeem, in perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. He and the chevalier offered themſelves together to ſerve the republic of Venice, who were then at war with the Turks. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public accepted their ſervices, and ſent them to the iſland of Archipel (formerly Crete), where they ſignalized themſelves by their courage: till the chevalier was killed by the burſting of a bomb; and the marquis ſurvived him only a few days, being blown up by a mine that the beſieged ſprung in the outworks; a death too glorious for two wretches ſtained with ſo infamous a crime. The prieſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rette was chained to go to the gallies, but died on the road.</p>

The hiſtory of the abbé, who was the moſt atrocious criminal, is longer. He took refuge in Holland, and got by ſome means or other a recommendation to the count de la Lippe, ſovereign of the Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne, a country two leagues from Utrecht, where he changed his name and embraced the proteſtant religion. The count, to whoſe converſation he was admitted, found his underſtanding highly cultivated, and his manners elegant and refined, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to entruſt him with the education of his eldeſt ſon, then about nine or ten years old. The abbé, by the pains he took with his pupil, and the noble ſentiments with which he inſpired him, made him a moſt accompliſhed youth, and gained for himſelf the eſteem of the count and counteſs de la Lippe, He carefully concealed his birth, and ſuffered it to be believed, that his origin was obſcure and mean. He became every day more and more in favour with his patrons; who had ſuch an opinion of his judgment and capacity, that they conſulted him on all occaſions. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that a number of French proteſtants, who had quitted their country on account of their religion, were deſirous about this time of ſettling in the Viane, and aſked permiſſion of the ſieur de la Fare, the chief juſtice of the country, to build houſes there; who told them they muſt obtain it of the count de la Lippe, to procure which he adviſed them to addreſs themſelves to their countryman, the ſieur de la
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036316_0050_1008D8AFF73408C8"/>
Martelliere (which was the name the abbé went by); but he, fearing that if a body of French refugees were ſuffered to ſettle there, he ſhould be known either by them of ſome of their connections, perſuaded the count to refuſe his permiſſion; and, in ſhort, he entirely governed the count and his whole family; yet his heart was a prey to remorſe and vexation, Notwithſtanding which, he paid his addreſſes to a young lady nearly related to the counteſs, under whoſe protection ſhe was, and inſpired her with a mutual paſſion; which ſoon became known to the counteſs, who, though ſhe had a great regard for de la Martelliere, could by no means think of ſuffering him to form an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with her relation, and therefore told the young lady, that though both the count and herſelf highly eſteemed de la Martelliere, and meant to reward him generouſly for his ſervices to their ſon, yet that they never would hear of her uniting herſelf with a man of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and perhaps of ſcandalous birth, and that ſhe muſt therefore think of it no more. The young lady, however, was not to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated or perſuaded; but immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to her lover the counteſs's objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his birth; which occaſioned his taking the moſt abſurd reſolution that ever entered the head of a man of ſenſe. He thought that in diſcovering his real ſituation, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the obſtacle to his wiſhes; taking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an opportunity of being alone with the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036316_0051_1008D86A74831D80"/>
counteſs, he threw himſelf at her feet, and told her, that ſince the ſuppoſed obſcurity of his birth made him be thought unworthy the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to which he aſpired, he was going to declare to her highneſs a ſecret of the utmoſt importance to his life—that he was not a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering adventurer of mean origin, but that unhappy abbé de Gange, whoſe name was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately but too well known, and whoſe crime had ever ſince purſued him with remorſe and ſorrow. The counteſs was ſo ſhocked at this declaration, that ſhe flew from him in terror and confuſion, and often declared, that every time ſhe thought of the wretch who dared to make it, her blood ran cold to her heart. Thunder-ſtruck to find that the man to whom they had entruſted the education of their ſon, was a murderer of the blackeſt die, the count and counteſs deliberated, at firſt, whether they ſhould not ſeize him, and ſend him to France, to receive the puniſhment due to his crimes—he owed his ſafety, however, to the entreaties of the young prince, his pupil, but was ordered inſtantly to quit the count's territories, and never again to dare to appear in any part of them.</p>
            <p>This order he was forced to obey, and he then went to Amſterdam, where he taught languages ſome time for his ſupport. The young lady of whom he was enamoured fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, and was ſecretly married to him; and his pupil, the young count, generouſly
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036316_0052_1008D8B1848F4068"/>
contributed to their ſupport, till her fortune came into their poſſeſſion. His good conduct obtained his admiſſion into the proteſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and he died ſome time afterwards in that religion, well reſpected. One of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance, to whom he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpoken of his former life, ſaid, that he complained often of horrors of mind, and that he fancied he continually ſaw before him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Gange, ſuch as ſhe appeared when he ſtood before her with a piſtol in his hand and ſaw her drink the poiſon. It is not for us to judge how far his ſubſequent repentance, and the remorſe that purſued him, might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate his dreadful crime—or what ſuffering may hereafter be reſerved for the horrid mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who ſeems to have eſcaped in this world, the puniſhment due to his atrocious villany!</p>
            <p>[This is from Guyot de Pitaval's relation. That made by Richer, relates the death of the marquis de Gange very differently, and ſays, that he was ſuffered to return to France, where he reſided many years with his ſon—ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted for the ſhare he was ſuppoſed to have in his wife's murder; and ſuſpected of the moſt vicious inclinations to the laſt period of his life.]</p>

            <head>THE DESERTED DAUGHTER.</head>
            <p>AMONG the many miſeries that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained paſſions or prejudices of parents bring on their unfortunate offspring, none is more ſingular, or worthy of compaſſion, than ſuch as reſemble the calamities which the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this hiſtory ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>Joachim Cognot, a phyſician, reſiding at Bar ſur Seine, married, when in his ſixtieth year, Mary Naſſier, a woman of reputable parents, then about twenty-nine years old. They had ſeveral children, who all died very ſoon after their birth, except Claude Cognot, who was the laſt born before a temporary ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the parents. Doctor Cognot, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he ſhould find more buſineſs at Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, in Poitou, removed thither, as it ſhould ſeem, to try his ſucceſs, and did not, from conſiderations of prudence, remove his family till he ſaw a probability of his expectations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing anſwered. He continued there near twelve months, and then, finding his progreſs proportioned to his hopes, he ſent for his wife,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036316_0054_1008D8B5C2DA4D08"/>
whom he had not ſeen during his reſidence at Fontenay. Seven months after madame Cognot rejoined her huſband ſhe was delivered of a daughter, who is the ſubject of this hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The doctor, already diſpoſed to ſuſpect his wife's fidelity, and perhaps having heard ſomething of her conduct, during his abſence, that diſpleaſed him, imagined that this infant had no right to call him father, or to ſhare with his ſon, of whom he was paſſionately fond, the fortune he now ſaw a probability of raiſing. The injurious thoughts he conceived of his wife, he kept however ſecret, and the little girl was baptized in the uſual form, and regiſtered as the daughter of Joachim Cognot, and Mary Neſſier, his wife. She was put out to nurſe; and about eighteen months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the doctor, whoſe fame as a phyſician encreaſed, removed to Paris, and was ſoon eſtabliſhed there in good practice.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate victim of his jealouſy, or of his wife's indiſcretion, was left behind at Fontenay—and Cognot though he had, in conſequence of his removal, a fair opportunity of concealing this child, whom he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to conſider as a diſgrace to himſelf, and an intruder on the property of his ſon. For this purpoſe he ordered her to be ſent to Paris by a common carrier; whom he met, and took her, immediately on her arrival, to the Orſine, in the Fauxbourg St. Marceau, where
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036316_0055_1008D871364572A8"/>
lived a woman named Frances Fremont, the wife of a lockſmith, called John Boutet, with whom he agreed to take the little girl at four livres a month. He paid a month's advance, gave the woman a piece of green ſerge to clothe the child, told her her Chriſtian name was Mary, but that ſhe need not enquire her ſurname, and that ſhe was ſomething leſs than three years old.</p>
            <p>The mother of the infant thus abandoned, had been forced, through dread of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and perhaps the terror of being expoſed, to agree to this cruel concealment; but her heart revolted againſt it, and, after a ſtruggle of ſome months between her fear and her affection, ſhe at length went privately to ſee her daughter. On entering the houſe, ſhe enquired of the woman, whether ſhe had not taken a little girl to nurſe? The woman anſwered that ſhe had, and then, looking in the face of madame Cognot, ſhe was ſtruck with the likeneſs between her and the child, and exclaimed—"You, madame, are certainly this little girl's mother."</p>
            <p>Madame Cognot anſwered, in confuſion, that ſhe was not; but her heart refuſed to confirm her denial and unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal what ſhe felt, ſhe embraced the child, and burſt into a paſſion of tears. She quitted, however, the houſe as ſoon as ſhe could recover herſelf, and, apprehending the effects of her huſband's anger if ſhe went thither again, ſhe wholly forebore to ſee her
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036316_0056_1008D8B9870A0080"/>
daughter, and in laviſhing on her ſon all her tenderneſs, endeavoured to forget the deſerted infant who had a right to ſhare it; but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as if to puniſh the cruelty and injuſtice, of which ſhe and her huſband had been guilty, took from them this beloved ſon. This ſtroke did not bring back the heart of madame Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not to a ſenſe of her duty; the only uſe ſhe made of it ſeems to have been, that of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately prevailing on her huſband to ſign a deed, in which they agreed, that the ſurvivor of them ſhould poſſeſs the whole property which Cognot had accumulated.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the woman who nurſed the little girl, took great care of her, though ſhe was no longer paid. The child was of an amiable temper, and had ſo good an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and a perſon ſo agreeable, that ſhe intereſted every body in her favour, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly her nurſe, who loved her as her own child, and, though ſhe was very poor, never murmured at the burden which had been impoſed upon her. Till at length, ſickneſs having diſabled her and her huſband, ſhe ſell into ſuch extreme indigence, that ſhe could no longer provide for her nurſeling the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſaries of life; ſhe therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, though with the utmoſt reluctance, to put her into the hoſpital, till ſhe was old enough to earn her ſubſiſtence in a ſervice, or till a more favourable hour ſhould arrive to herſelf, when ſhe hoped again to be in
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036316_0057_1008D87413FE1E48"/>
condition to procure food and raiment for the unfortunate infant which ſhe ſo tenderly loved.</p>
            <p>Time however paſſed away, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted girl continued in the hoſpital; where, notwithſtanding the meanneſs and poverty of her condition, the underſtanding ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from nature unfolded itſelf, and her gentleneſs and propriety of manners procured her the eſteem of all who approached her. When ſhe was almoſt fourteen years old, and qualified for a ſervice, her nurſe took her from the hoſpital, and put her, at very low wages, to be a ſervant to a writing-maſter; where, while ſhe earned her bread by hard labour, and was employed in the moſt ſervile offices, doctor Cognot and his wife enjoyed affluence and proſperity beyond what they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dared to hope. His practice had very much encreaſed, and he was appointed phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to Margaret de Valois, then queen of France; yet, perſuaded that this poor girl was not his own, he determined not to let her benefit by his ſucceſs, though he had no longer any child who would have been injured by her participation. Sudden proſperity which too often hardens the heart, had made that of madame Cognot callous even to the tender ſentiments of maternal pity and affection.

As ſhe ſtood at the door talking with this friend, ſhe ſaw doctor Cognot paſs along the ſtreet; and though ſhe had only ſeen him once before, and fourteen years had elapſed ſince, his figure, which was very remarkable, was ſo deeply engraven on her memory, that ſhe immediately recollected him—"Look," ſaid ſhe to her acquaintance, "look at that little old man who is paſſing by. It is the ſame man who, fourteen years ago, brought poor little Mary to me—Can you tell me who he is?"—To this the other woman replied, that ſhe knew him well; that he lived at an houſe but a few doors from thence, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>me was the ſieur Cognot, a phyſician in good practice.</p>
            <p>The woman, Frances Fremont, determined to avail herſelf of this diſcovery, and ſoon learned that he attended the ſick of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring convent. There ſhe waited for him; and, as he left the door, ſhe approached him, and ſaid—<q>Sir, it is now near fourteen years ſince you brought to me a little girl to nurſe—will you not now take her back, and pay me for the time I have kept her?</q> The doctor, who was at firſt very much ſtruck by this unexpected application, ſoon recovered
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036316_0059_1008D8759965C908"/>
his preſence of mind, and told Frances Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont that the child was not his, but belonged to the man who was with him: he inquired, however, where ſhe was? and, being told that ſhe was ſervant to a writing-maſter near the great ſteps of La —, and that ſhe was then ill with a fever, he took a direction to her, and promiſed to ſee her; which he did.</p>
            <p>This diſcovery he immediately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his wife; who, on hearing her daughter's ſituation, could not forbear feeling again that ſhe was a mother, and that ſhe wiſhed to have her child reſcued from the melancholy deſtiny to which ſhe had been ſo long abandoned. Frances Fremont was not diſpoſed to let theſe good diſpoſitions languiſh for want of reminding the parents of their duty. She called upon them in a few days, and deſired to be paid for her trouble, and the food and clothes ſhe had provided for the little girl. The doctor bid her bring the girl thither, which ſhe did the next day; and on her being introduced to madame Cognot, the latter ſtill affecting to conceal her real ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began to enquire of Frances Fremont, what where her qualifications and what wages ſhe expected; as if ſhe intended hiring her as a ſervant; to which Fremont anſwered, that ſhe had not brought her thither to get her a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but to be paid for the many years during which ſhe had kept her, and to reſtore her to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036316_0060_1008D8BD91DD1AD8"/>
Cognot, ſhe exclaimed,—<q>You, madam, are the ſame lady who came to ſee Mary once, and wept over her, and I know you are her mother.</q> It was agreed that Mary ſhould, for the preſent, remain with doctor Cognot; but to people ſo avaricious it was leſs eaſy to determined to pay Fremont the long arrear due to her. They put her off from time to time, till her patience being exhauſted, and her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities preſſing, ſhe determined to apply to a lawyer; and doctor Cognot was ſummoned to appear before the bailiff of St. Germain.</p>
            <p>Alarmed at this meaſure, and perceiving that if he ſuffered a ſuit againſt him to go on, the whole tranſaction, which he was ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to conceal, would be diſcovered; he thought it better to ſatisfy Fremont, and yet to conceal the birth of his daughter. For this purpoſe he cauſed a deed to be drawn up by a notary, to this effect:—That whereas he was ſued by Frances Fremont for a certain ſum due to her, for the care and board of an infant called Mary, for the ſpace of fourteen years, which child was not his, but belonged to the man whom he acknowledged to have been with; and as he might be thought in ſome meaſure acceſſary to the expenſe brought on Frances Fremont, though it was merely by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that it happened, yet he did agree, through motives of charity, to take the ſaid Mary into his ſervice, and to pay the ſum of four hundred livres to the ſaid Francis Fremont,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:036316_0061_1008D8771F588558"/>
on condition of having no further trouble on the ſubject. This deed was ſigned properly, and Mary was eſtabliſhed in the houſe of her parents. At firſt ſhe appeared there as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; but a ſervant whom her maſter and miſtreſs could not reſolve to treat as ſuch. Her ſole employment was working in the room with madame Cognot, keeping her keys, and doing ſuch little eaſy offices as might be required of a daughter. She dined at their table, was dreſſed better than a ſervant, and money was given her for which ſhe was not expected to account. Still, however, ſhe was not to be conſidered as any other than a ſtranger; and ſhe was told that ſhe was the daughter of a perſon called Croiſſant, and was called Mary Croiſſant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while the acquaintance of madame Cognot, who obſerved the great likeneſs between her and this girl, concluded ſhe was her niece, or ſome very near relation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. But the old doctor, who never loſt the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his wife's infidelity (whether real or ſuppoſed), continued ever to look on her as a ſervant, whoſe uncommon merit (which made an impreſſion even on him) could not efface the prejudice he had conceived againſt her birth. Under the conviction of her illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, he made his will anew, and, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former act between him and his wife, which left the ſurvivor in poſſeſſion of the bulk of his fortune, he gave to Mary Croiſſant, whom he called his ſervant, the ſum of ſix hundred

            <p>When he was dead, and his widow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the poſſeſſion of his effects, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to obſerve the ſame conduct towards her daughter, and, making a kind of compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe between her avarice and her affection, ſtill kept her with her, but ſtill refuſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her as her daughter; becauſe in that caſe ſhe muſt have ſhared the property ſhe now excluſively enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Some time after a ſuitable match offering with Auguſtus de Seine, a man eſtabliſhed in a reputable profeſſion, ſhe married her, under the name of Mary Croiſſant, her god-daughter. In this, as in every other part of her conduct, ſhe ſeemed to unveil the myſtery ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conceal; doing too much for her if it was only an orphan taken out of charity, as ſhe pretended, and too little if it was her daughter. It happened that Marie de Seine (as ſhe ſhould now be called, in conſequence of her marriage), was one day aſſiſting her mother to look over and arrange ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the old doctor's. In doing ſo ſhe caſt her eye on a letter from her mother to him, in which were theſe words,—<q>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend our children to your care: Attend to our little Mary, and ſee her often: I am buſy making clothes for her.</q> Mary had before had ſuſpicions of the truth; on the peruſal of this letter, conviction flaſhed upon
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036316_0063_1008D87B27E4B138"/>
her; but her mother coming into the room from whence ſhe had been a moment abſent; ſhe tried to conceal the letter in her pocket. The mother, however, inſtantly recollecting what it was, inſiſted on her returning it, which ſhe for ſome time tried to evade: but her mother's commands being peremptory, ſhe yielded to give up the letter which had taught her to know to whom ſhe belonged; but ſhe ſaid, with tears, to her mother, <q>Ah, madam, I am your daughter; I am the little Mary of whom you here ſpeak ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately; why would you continue to diſown me? I conjure you not to perſiſt in being ſo cruel to me; but reſtore me to the place I have a right to, and you will not find me ungratetful.</q>—This pathetic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance had its effect on the heart of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Cognot; ſhe owned that ſhe was her mother, and declared ſhe would take proper meaſures to enable her to own her as ſuch, without diſgrace; for ſhe repreſented to her, that to do it ſuddenly, and without preparing her friends, would occaſion many ill-natured reflections and much inconvenience; and, ſhe added, that a monk of the order of St. Francis, whom ſhe had conſulted, had told her, that ſhe was not in conſcience obliged to own her; but that ſhe muſt nevertheleſs ſupport her as her daughter, and give her her fortune at her deceaſe. With a promiſe of being ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly reſtored to her right, the young woman
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036316_0064_1008D8C56394D748"/>
was for ſome time content, as ſhe was every day in hopes that her mother would find the opportunity ſhe pretended to wait for; but ſhe had ſoon the mortification to find, that other views occupied her, and that to do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to her daughter was farther than ever from her intention. A man called Nicholas Coquant, who was without any property, and had a great number of children, was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the widow Cognot; he ſoon found the means of gaining her good opinion; ſhe married him, and from that period though only of ſtifling the claims of her unfortunate daughter, and enriching the family on which ſhe now had placed all her affections.</p>
            <p>Her daughter, who ſaw all the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this new connection, conjured her by all that was juſt, by every conſideration o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> moved by her tears and entreaties. The mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage took place, and her ſolicitations were re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>newed afterwards, though there was then little proſpect of their ſucceſs. Wearied at length with their ineffectual efforts, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to move the implacable heart of her mother, ſhe determined, in vindication of her own and her childrens' rights, to have recourſe to law; though it was with extreme reluctance ſhe was driven to take ſuch a reſolutions—Madame Cognot being now again ſummoned
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036316_0065_1008D87DDC179EB0"/>
before the bailiff of St. Germain, had recourſe to all the chicane of the law. She was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged however to undergo an examination<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> in the courſe of which a perpetual conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her avarice, her fear of detection, and her conſciouſneſs of the truth, evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. On being aſked if ſhe had not a daughter born at Fontenay de Compte, called Mary, and in what year? ſhe anſwered, that ſhe had, but the year ſhe could not remember. On being farther aſked, what was become of her? ſhe ſaid, the child was put to nurſe with the wife of a baker; and that four or five months afterwards, on her return from a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Bar fur Seine, where ſhe had paſſed ſome time, her huſband informed her that the child was dead; and that ſhe never enquired any more about it. On being queſtioned, how ſhe came to receive the plaintiff into her houſe, and to place her in a rank ſo different from ſervitude? ſhe replied, that in returning home one day, ſhe found at her houſe two women and a little girl; and that her huſband ſaid to her, theſe women have brought a little girl to be your ſervant, who will be very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. That ſhe aſked Fremont, one of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, how much wages ſhe was to give her? who anſwered, that wages were no object; that ſhe thereupon detained her in her ſervice, and that the girl had lived with her from that time till ſhe ſettled her in her marriage. Many other contradictory and incoherent anſwers
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036316_0066_1008D8C6EA1F2460"/>
plainly evinced the difficulty of concealing the truth. This appeared ſo clearly to the bailiff of St. Germain, that he gave ſentence; wherein he ordered madame Coquant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and acknowledge Mary Cognot, the wife of Auguſtus de Seine, as her daughter; and condemned her to pay twenty-four louis as coſts; to divide all the property of the deceaſed Joachim Cognot with her daughter; to whom liberty was alſo given to ſue for the arrears and profits received ſince his death.</p>
            <p>From this ſentence madame Coquant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the parliament; a proviſion of four hundred livres was allowed to Mary de Seine, to enable her to carry on the ſuit; they both underwent an examination; and the ſuit went on in the uſual forms.</p>
            <p>But madame Coquant having found that her daughter had been put into the hoſpital by her nurſe, contrived to get acceſs to the book, where all the children received into that aſylum, are regiſtered. She found the name of her daughter written there; but ſimply as Mary the daughter of —, a blank being left after the incomplete name. This blank ſhe contrived to have filled up, ſo that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter ran thus—Mary Boutet, a foundling; ſuckled by the wife of John Boutet, deceaſed.</p>
            <p>When the cauſe came on, monſieur de Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, counſel for Mary de Seine, recapitulated the events of her life with great preciſion and exactneſs,—he proved all the facts here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036316_0067_1008D880AA3C1A70"/>
incontrovertibly; and as to the regiſter of the hoſpital, he made the alteration clearly appear, as well as the falſehood it aſſerted. For Frances Fremont the wife of John Boutet, whoſe name had been inſerted, had never had a child, and of courſe could not have ſuckled a foundling; whom in fact ſhe never ſaw till ſhe was three years old.</p>
            <p>The defence ſet up by the mother and her huſband was ſo feeble, and the legitimacy of Mary de Seine was proved ſo much to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the court, that a definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was obtained in ſavour of her and her children; whereby the gift of Joachim Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not to his wife was annulled—half the effects left by him at his death was awarded to his daughter, after deducting half his funeral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes, the proviſion made for his wife on her marriage, and his legacies.—Nicholas Coquant and his wife were to bear the coſts; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to damage, conceal, or diſſipate the reſidue of the effects of Joachim Cognot, which, after the death of the mother, were to deſcend to the daughter and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>By this equitable deciſion the unnatural pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent was puniſhed for her avarice and cruelty; the hitherto unhappy young woman reinſtated in the rank to which ſhe had an undoubted right; and the injury done her by the jealous ſuſpicions of one of her parents, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded conduct of the other, was repaid by
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036316_0068_1008D8C9D88FD780"/>
the juſtice of her country. She appears to have merited her good fortune, and to have been an inſtance that the force of natural good ſenſe and a virtuous diſpoſition can alone counteract all the diſadvantages of birth, and all the influence of a mean or neglected edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. While her ſtory may ſerve to guard the mother, who reſpects the peace of her children, from being guilty of indiſcretions which may raiſe, in jealous and ſuſpicious minds, opinions and prejudices, ſo fatal to the innocent objects on which the puniſhment of guilt, or of imprudence, too frequently falls.</p>

            <head>LA PIVARDIERE.</head>
            <p>LOUIS de la Pivardiere, ſieur du Bouchet, was a gentleman of a very ancient family, but being a younger brother, and his family having loſt much of its former opulence in the convulſions that had agitated the kingdom, his fortune was hardly enough to ſupport him with decency, in the province of which he was a native; and it muſt have been inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable indeed, if the ſmall poſſeſſions of the woman he married, induced him to unite himſelf with her, for they did not amount to above a thouſand livres a year; and ſhe had the five children of her former huſband to maintain; being the widow of the ſieur de Menou, and about five and thirty years of age. Her income aroſe from the eſtate and cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Nerbonne, which he poſſeſſed in right of his wife, and obtained a lieutenancy in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of dragoons. This abſence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably equally agreeable to monſieur and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de la Pivardiere, for they had long lived very uneaſy together.

After a ſhort ſtruggle with his pride, and his apprehenſions of detection, love got the better of both.

He determined to go back to Nerbonne, to receive what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was due from the tenants, and to return with it as ſoon as poſſible to his new family at Auxerre. On his arrival at the chateau of Nerbonne, he found the prior with madame de Pivardiere; of which, being wholly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by the purpoſe of his jourdey, he took no notice.

            <p>The fourth of theſe journies, however, was leſs fortunate than the preceding three. Juſt before he arrived at his chateau, his wife had received the intelligence of his infidelity, and knew how to account for his yearly viſit, which ſhe found was not to obtain money to ſupport his rank in the army, but to beſtow on another family. Though already eſtranged from him, the mortifying aſſurance of his preference of another, was too painful to her vanity, and ſhe determined not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the bitterneſs and anger which ſhe felt. It happened that he arrived at Nerbonne on the fete of Notre Dame, in the month of Auguſt; on occaſion of which feſtival madame de la Pivardiere had entertained a party of friends at dinner, among whom her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendant, the prior of Mezaray, was not forgotten.

One of them arrived at Nerbonne, where he examined fifteen witneſſes. Two ſervants, who were more immediately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the apartments, were taken into
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036316_0076_1008D8D4AA49BAB8"/>
cuſtody. They both, on being interrogated, owned that monſieur de la Pivardiere had been aſſaſſinated. The firſt, who was called Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Mercier, and who was her miſtreſs's god-daughter, and a great favourite with her, declared that ſhe had ſent every body away, who was likely to prevent the murder, and had introduced two ſervants of the prior of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeray into her maſter's bed-chamber, who had killed him; to which ſhe added ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which ſeemed to confirm the truth of her ſtory. The other maid-ſervant, named Catharine le Moine, corroborated this account; and what appeared yet more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, the daughter of de la Pivardiere, a girl about eight or nine years old, ſaid, that in the night ſhe was alarmed by hearing her father's voice, who cried,—"Oh my God, have mercy upon me!"</p>

            <p>On receiving theſe depoſitions, the officers of juſtice, of whom the judge of Chatillon was chief, ordered madame de la Pivardere to be
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:036316_0077_1008D88F0FE2F888"/>
proſecuted; and, as the prior of Mezeray was included in the accuſation, a like order was iſſued againſt him. The judge of Chatillon was ſaid to be the inveterate enemy of the prior de Mezaray; and, from the circumſtances that attended the affair, it ſeems probable that that enmity was the cauſe of all the meaſures which were taken, to fix on the prior a ſhare of a crime which had not been committed, and that the evidence given by the two maids, was in conſequence of the rewards offered them by this officer, who wiſhed to gratify, under the cloak of juſtice, his private hatred and revenge.</p>
            <p>The circumſtance of madame de la Pivar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diere's quitting her houſe, ſeemed to be a ſtrong argument of her guilt. As ſoon as ſhe was gone, the lieutenant of the police went thither to examine the chateau; and in his account he aſſerted, among many other particulars, which ſeemed to confirm the aſſaſſination, that blood was found on the floor of the room where de la Pivardiere had ſlept. Madame de la Pivardiere then went to Paris, where ſhe laid before a ſuperior court, an account of the proſecution that had been commenced againſt her, and deſired that cognizance might be taken of it, by its being referred to an officer of the law more impartial than him who had inſtituted the proceſs. Her requeſt was granted, and the judge of Remorentin was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to inveſtigate the whole.</p>

He ſoon found that agents from his wife were in purſuit of him; and, fearing that ſhe was now about to have him confined for bigamy, he fled from his houſe; but his purſuers overtook him at Flavigny, and quieted his fears on that account by informing him that he had nothing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from his wife at preſent, in regard to his liberty, for that his appearance was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſave her life. He no ſooner learned this, than, forgetting all their animoſity, he haſtened to clear her from the imputation of ſo horrid a crime. His ſecond wife generouſly encouraged him to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion; and, far from reſenting the injury he had done her by a feigned marriage, or wiſhing to deſtroy her rival, ſhe was anxiouſly deſirous of ſaving her from the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a falſe accuſation.</p>
            <p>De la Pivardiere went before a notary at Auxerre, where he ſigned a declaration of his being living and in health. He wrote
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036316_0079_1008D890DE19B040"/>
alſo to his wife and to his brother, who in their anſwers informed him his preſence was abſolutely neceſſary at Nerbonne. Thither, therefore, he went, and found his chateau plundered of every thing: the beſt of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects his wife had removed, to ſecure them; the reſt, as ſhe had foreſeen, were the prey of the officers of juſtice.</p>
            <p>He preſented himſelf before the judge of Remorentin, and deſired that the authenticity of his appearance might be teſtified by the proper perſons, and that he would accompany him to Nerbonne. On their arrival, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the village, the tenants and neighbours of La Pivardiere, ſigned the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial of his being alive; he went from thence to the little town of Jeumaloches and being deſirous to ſhew himſelf as publicly as poſſible, he entered the church juſt as veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers began on St. Anthony's day, who being the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had the moſt frightful ſpectre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it could hardly have cauſed a greater alarm, or more ſudden ſurpriſe; for ſo much pains had been taken to perſuade the people of the death of la Pivardiere, that they could hardly believe he was living, though they ſaw him before them.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the undoubted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his being alive, ſuch was the ſingular power lodged in the hands of the provincial
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:036316_0080_1008D8DA52D3ABF0"/>
judges in France, and ſuch the abuſe often made of it, that the judge of Chatillon ſtill carried on the proſecution; the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the prior of Mezaray was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and his benefices for the time remained under confiſcation. To ruin him, ſeems to have been the ſole reaſon for ſo extraordinary and ſo abſurd a procedure, as that which ſtill attempted to eſtabliſh proof of the death of a man, who was living and preſent.</p>
            <p>The two ſervants were confined in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chatillon, where this magiſtrate had them entirely in his power, and where his offers of reward and threats of puniſhment were all employed to bring them to his purpoſe. The judge of Remorentin took de la Pivardiere to theſe women; who, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing now conſummate in perjury, alleged that the perſon they at preſent ſaw, pretending to be monſieur de la Pivardiere, their maſter, was an impoſtor, whom they knew not. But the judge of Chatillon, apprehending that they would not have ſtrength of mind long to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a falſehood ſo glaring, forbade the judge of Remorentin and la Pivardiere admiſſion to the priſon; and he ordered de la Pivardiere to be ſtopped, that he might be examined.—La Pivardiere was by no means inclined to put himſelf in the power of a man, who had gone ſuch lengths to prove him dead; he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides apprehenſive, that the affair of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two wives would be productive of fatal

conſequence, from which, if he were once in cuſtody, he could not eſcape. For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he refuſed to obey the order of the judge of Chatillon, and went from thence with the judge of Remorentin, who afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him to all his relations, to thoſe who were preſent when he arrived at the chateau of Nerbonne, the night of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed aſſaſſination; to his two ſiſters, nuns in the Urſul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the judge of Chatillon would not ſo eaſily relinquiſh the prey he held with the ſtrong graſp of authority. He found, that as he had gone ſo far, the boldeſt ſteps only could carry him on. He arreſted the prior of Mezaray, put irons on his legs, and threw him into the priſon of Chatillon; and began a ſuit againſt the judge of Remorentin, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering in his diſtrict; and at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an arret againſt his future proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>After various appeals and evaſions, which, as the principal facts are known, it would be tedious and unintereſting to recapitulate, the cauſe was heard before the parliament of the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:036316_0082_1008D8DD085F0548"/>
province. The judge of Chatillon died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came on; and his heirs, aſhamed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably of a tranſaction that would throw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy on his memory, petitioned for leave to withdraw; but de la Pivardiere, and the prior of Mezaray, now inſiſted on its being brought to an iſſue. It was heard accordingly. No damages were allowed de la Pivardiere for all the injury he had ſuſtained, as the judge was ſuppoſed to have proceeded origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally on good grounds. But Margaret Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier, the principal witneſs, who had perjured herſelf in three or four inſtances, was to make the <hi>amende honourable,</hi> by ſtanding in a ſheet at the door of the church of Chatillon, holding a torch in her hand; and there, on her knees, and in an audible voice, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſhe had borne falſe witneſs, for which ſhe aſked pardon of God and the injured parties; afterwards ſhe was to be whipped, burned with a hot iron, and baniſhed the province for ever.</p>
            <p>Madame de la Pivardiere, the prior of Mezaray, and his ſervants, were declared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and diſcharged from any future trouble.</p>
            <p>This affair terminated, de la Pivardiere could not determine to reſide with his wife, whoſe attachment to the prior he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered—nor would he now return to his imaginary wife and her children, unleſs to bid them an eternal adieu.—The duke de

            <head>THE CONTESTED MARRIAGE.</head>
            <p>COURTIN de Villiers, a young officer of a noble family, being in garriſon at Metz, became acquainted with, madame Geoffroi, who having been left a widow, while yet in the earlieſt bloom of youth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided there with the mother of her deceaſed huſband. De Villiers, who was at firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the beauty of the young widow, found the charms of her underſtanding, and the ſweetneſs of her temper, equal to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of her perſon. He found alſo, that all hopes of forming with her a connection of gallantry, were raſhly entertained; and that his addreſſes muſt be open, and authoriſed by the laws of honour. The longer his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance continued, the more impoſſible he found it to quit her; but he knew he muſt not hope for the conſent of his father and mother; yet, flattering himſelf, that if he were actually married he ſhould obtain their pardon, and his inſurmountable paſſion urging him to hazard the trial, he, prevailed on madame
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:036316_0085_1008D89B5217E5A0"/>
Geoffroi, who was not inſenſible of his merit or his affection, to conſent to a union, which it was not poſſible for them to celebrate in France with the uſual forms. Her father was yet living, and had not been conſulted; and the parents of de Villiers, he was ſure, would refuſe their conſent, without which, as he was but two-and-twenty, and the lady only three months older, they could not be married according to law. The mother of her firſt huſband, with whom madame Geoffroi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, moved by the importunities of Villiers, and the wiſhes of her daughter, conſented to aſſiſt at, and to conceal the marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as no prieſt dared ſolemnize it at Metz, they were ſtill embarraſſed with difficulties, that ſeemed unſurmountable, till the almoner of the regiment to which Villiers belonged told them, he could marry them in Lorraine, that country being then under the government of its own princes, and the laws in force there, in regard to marriage, did not require the conſent of parents to the marriage of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</p>
            <p>The almoner therefore was ſent into Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, with the ſecrecy his ſcheme required. Thither he was followed by Villiers and the fair widow; and as ſoon as they were married they returned to Metz, equally happy in their union, and not doubting its legality; after the precautions they had taken. Madame Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, about ten months afterwards, was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:036316_0086_1008D8E25D20D920"/>
of a ſon; an event which, while it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the happineſs of her huſband, made him reflect with anxiety on the diſadvantage under which this beloved infant might lie, from the clandeſtine manner of its parents' marriage. Not daring to baptize it by his own name, he called it Tincour de Virilles, an anagram on the name of Courtin de Villiers.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as his wife was well enough to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to quit her, Villiers, who grew more uneaſy every day for the fate of his ſon, went to Paris. He there addreſſed himſelf to the ſieur de Lalande, the father of madame Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, and beſought, in the moſt affecting manner, his approbation of their marriage; but he found only anger and indignation, which embittered the abſolute refuſal he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. To add to his unhappineſs, his father and mother were by this, time informed of his connection, and he heard that they had not only paſſed an act, which diſ-inherited him, if he did not immediately relinquiſh his wife, but had commenced a ſuit againſt her for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and having made a pretended marriage with a minor.</p>
            <p>Their firſt meaſure was, to petition for leave to collect information. It was obtained, and the wife of Villiers was ſummoned to appear. She appealed againſt the ſummons, and procured an arret, in the name of the widow Geoffroi, which delayed any further
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:036316_0087_1008D89FC7D6E1B8"/>
proceedings for ſome time. In the mean time Villiers, and every friend he could inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt on his behalf, tried, by intreaties and ſupplications, to prevail on his parents to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify by their conſent a union on which the happineſs of their ſon depended. But it was in vain he endeavoured to move them by tears and prayers; in vain his friends inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded for him, with remonſtrance and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: his parents were inexorable; and, hoping that time and poſſeſſion, which ſo often cure exceſſive paſſions, would, before many months were elapſed, make their ſon as anxious to break his connexion as he now was to confirm it, they perſevered in thoſe meaſures, by which they hoped to render the marriage abortive, and the child illegitimate. While they were proſecuting theſe meaſures, Villiers and his family were reduced to the crueleſt exigence. His allowance had been withdrawn, and he had no longer money to ſupport his rank in his regiment, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his wife and his child the neceſſaries they required. The expenſes of the ſuit filled up the meaſure of thoſe inconveniencies to which they were expoſed; and when he found that his father would furniſh him with nothing till he diſowned his marriage, he was obliged, rather than ſee thoſe he ſo tenderly loved ſubject to the diſtreſs of poverty, to agree to ſay whatever they would have him, and even to procure a certificate, which on being
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:036316_0088_1008D8E688AF2500"/>
delivered to the miniſter<note n="*" place="bottom">It does not appear how the ſieur de Villier's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage could intereſt this miniſter.</note> of the war depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, monſieur Chamillard, he received a ſum of money, with which he determined to wait his majority, and then to endeavour to have his marriage confirmed, or at leaſt to try whether his parents could then prevent his renewing an engagement, in which only the ſatisfaction of his life conſiſted.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as that period arrived, he produced to a notary the certificate of his marriage; he had by this time prevailed on the ſieur Lalande, his wife's father, not only to forgive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion ſhe had been guilty of, but to enter warmly into their mutual intereſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſecure a marriage, which could not be diſſolved, without covering with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour a daughter of whom he was deſervedly fond. Villiers now ſignified to his parents, that he was determined to maintain the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of his marriage: whereupon they again applied to have it ſet aſide, as being wholly illegal.</p>
            <p>Their ſon, at the ſame time, preſented to the ſame tribunal a requeſt, that if his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was found good, it might be legally eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed. The parents oppoſed it, and in their oppoſition were ſuſtained by the whole power and intereſt of the families allied to that of Villiers, who became almoſt all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The ſieur Dupin, who was appointed to

In this ſtate the contending parties brought the cauſe on an hearings; and the ſieur Guyot de Cheſne undertook the pleadings for the father and mother of Villiers.</p>

He ſaid that his clients believed that their honour required them to oppoſe a marriage, which was degrading to their ſon and injurious to his family; ſince he was of illuſtrious rank; and the woman with whom he deſired to ally himſelf, greatly inferior to him. Men of high birth ſhould carefully guard againſt their children's forming alliances with thoſe beneath them, and ſhould preſerve untainted the honourable blood they derive from a long line of anceſtors. But in fact, the connection which captain de Villiers had formed with the widow Geoffroi, had as yet thrown no blemiſh on his exalted birth, for it was no marriage. That therefore being out
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:036316_0090_1008D8E80ECD13E8"/>
of the queſtion, all that remained was to know, whether, nowithſtanding his being no longer a minor, be could now contract a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to which his parents were determined never to conſent.</p>
            <p>To prove that the marriage was not only illegal in itſelf, but that the very certificate was a forgery, he ſaid it was ſigned by the prieſt, with a title which exiſts not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e church; and the place of celebration, which at the firſt writing of the certificate had been omitted, had been afterwards interlined. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the defence ſet up was in the name of the widow Geoffroi; which name ſhe ſhould certainly not have continued, while conſcious ſhe was the wife of De Villiers. The young man had, moreover, given to the miniſter, Chamillard, an aſſurance in writing that he was not married, and had repeated the ſame in letters to his mother. And if he afterwards affirmed what he had ſo repeatedly denied, it could be imputed only to the influence which the ſieur Lalande, with whom he now lived, had acquired over him, and of his love for the widow, who employed all her art, and all her charms, to retain him in the ſetters ſhe had forged for him. Why, if the parties were conſcious that they were married, did they baptize the child, born of the marriage, by a fictitious name? and not ſuffer it to bear that of either of its parents? The proofs that the intended marriage was invalid, being thus
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:036316_0091_1008D8A3E1233338"/>
indiſputable, it remained to be known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſon of an illuſtrious family, connected with the nobleſt houſes in the kingdom, could, without the conſent of his parents, ally him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the daughter of an obſcure man, who, from a very low ſtation, had by dint of long ſervice obtained the rank of brigadier; and, though it could not be denied, that his wife, who was of the houſe of Balletrier, in Artois, was the daughter of a very ancient family, yet the nobility of his wife could not conceal or amend his own low origin.</p>
            <p>Beſides the inequality of birth, the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of fortune was alſo great, between the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Geoffroi and captain de Villiers. The ſieur Lalande, her father, boaſted, it is true, of an income of twenty-five thouſand livres a year; but when he was aſked to name the eſtates, or ſource, from whence this revenue aroſe, he brought no proof that he really poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed it. In the contract of marriage made between his daughter and monſieur Geoffroi, her firſt huſband, he had agreed to give her a portion of twenty-five thouſand livres; but they did not appear ever to have been, paid. Yet ſhe poſſeſſed nothing elſe, or any ſecurity that her father would give her a ſhare of his fortune, wherever it lay. It was ſaid that the mother of monſieur Geoffroi meant to make her her heir; but of this there was no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: as to the jointure of a thouſand livres a year, which ſhe was paid from the property
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:036316_0092_1008D8EB0B20FBD8"/>
of her firſt huſband, it was not only trifling in itſelf, but terminated with her life.—Captain de Villiers, though his parents had three other children, another ſon and two daughters, was yet to be conſidered as heir to the greater part of his father's property, amounting to above four hundred thouſand livres; his brother being in the order of Malta, and his two ſiſters having only very ſmall portions, if they did not (as they proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would) take the veil. The diſparity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore between his fortune, and that of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Geoffroi, was evidently ſo great, that his parents thought they had on that account, as well as on that of the inequality of birth, a right ſteadily to oppoſe the confirmation or renewal of a match, ſo ruinous to the intereſt of their ſon, and ſo diſagreeable to themſelves. But were not their objections to the marriage ſo numerous, and ſo invincible, from theſe reaſons, the ſeduction which had been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed on their ſon, was a circumſtance, in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficient to make them determine, never to conſent to his marrying a woman capable of ſuch practice. Her mother-in-law had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted her, and her father had joined in the unjuſtifiable means that had been uſed to faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinate his judgment and ſubvert his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding—whence he had become, not only eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranged from his family, but careleſs of the evil with which he was threatened; that of being diſinherited and diſowned by a juſtly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

offended father. And though the parents, and their relations, could not poſitively affirm that the widow Geoffroi was a woman of looſe character, yet a widow of her age, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the viſits of officers in garriſon, could certainly not be thought entirely blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and as ſhe was older than the chevalier Villiers, who had juſt left the boſom of his family, there was every appearance, that very diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable means had been uſed to obtain his affections; means, which amounted to the crime of ſeduction, and which therefore ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her incapable of being received as his wife, and even liable to puniſhment. <hi>That,</hi> however, the ſieur de Villiers and his family did not inſiſt on; they only deſired that the chevalier Villers might for ever be ſeparated from her, and reſtored to his family. And as to the child, who muſt at all events be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the natural ſon of the chevalier Villiers, he might be acknowledged as ſuch, if the chevalier choſe to acknowledge him; but cannot be received into ſociety, or into the family of Villiers, in any other rank.</p>
            <p>Theſe pleadings for the ſieur de Villiers and his family, againſt the marriage, being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, monſieur Blaru undertook the defence of madame Geoffroi and her infant ſon. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pleadings of the ſieur Blaru, on behalf of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Geoffroi, and her ſon.</note>He ſaid, that if ever a marriage was made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſonant to reaſon, it was that which
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:036316_0094_1008D8EEE1191178"/>
was now attempted to be broken, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable ambition and unjuſt prejudices, of the ſieur de Villiers; though reaſon, juſtice, and, above all, the ſituation of the child, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded its confirmation. That it was in vain the adverſe parties aſſerted that the celebration of the marriage was merely ſuppoſitious, and affected to bring the miſtake in the certificate, and the interlineations, as proofs. The firſt was a mere error, originating in the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the perſon who wrote it; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond only an omiſſion. Had it been a forgery, more care would have been taken to avoid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. It was objected, that this certificate had not been produced till the parties were out of their minority. But this was occaſioned by the fear of their being parted forever by the power of the ſieur de Villiers, if they had braved his authority before the laws in ſome degree had emancipated his ſon. For the ſame reaſon, the wife of the chevalier de Villiers, had anſwered her ſummons in the name of the widow Geoffroi. And if the chevalier de Villers had denied his marriage, it was through the preſſing exigence to which he was reduced; when his father no longer allowed him money, and he could not either ſupport his wife and his child, or furniſh himſelf with neceſſaries for the campaign, on which his duty obliged him to ſerve. On reference to the letters and papers, wherein he had diſowned his marriage, it appeared that he had ſaid
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:036316_0095_1008D8AB9D420938"/>
only that "he was not married at Paris;" which was in fact true, and by this equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he had obtained the money, without which he muſt have ſuffered both in his love and in his honour; and though an equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was certainly derogatory to his ſentiments of rectitude, yet neceſſity, from which there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

good family in England; and, though he could not from thence be accounted noble in France, yet he had obtained a certificate of his rank from the king of England, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which the king of France had granted him letters of nobility. His father had from them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> taken the title of ſeigneur de Lalande, which his elder brother now poſſeſſed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſeveral eſtates belonging to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.

               </gap> himſelf gentleman, for he was a knight of St. Louis, governor of the citadel of Metz, and a brigadier in the army.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond plea, that of diſparity of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, was equally ill-founded. The ſieur de Lalande was poſſeſſed of ſeveral eſtates; his wife was of an illuſtrious family in Artois, and by the death of her relations ſhe now poſſeſſed, in her right, the eſtates of the family, to the amount of more than ten thouſand livres a year; beſides which, the ſieur de Lelande poſſeſſed other property, which made the whole of his income above twenty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand livres: and if the ſieur de Villiers would agree to let the cauſe be concluded by the union of the young people, on condition that
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:036316_0097_100A314DC6654C70"/>
he ſhould produce for his daughter a ſum equal to what the ſieur de Villiers would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately give his ſon, he was content to abide by the iſſue. In this part of his pleading, the counſellor Blaru addreſſed himſelf to madame de Villiers, mother of the chevalier, who was in court: "Do you hear, madam," ſaid he <q>the offer I make, and do you underſtand that I am authorized by my client to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe terms to you?</q> The lady remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilent, he repeated this propoſal; to which no anſwer being given, he ſaid, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended his client, ſo far from being very much inferior to the ſieur Villiers in point of fortune, was really in a condition to wiſh to be put to this proof, which his adverſary could not venture to accept.</p>
            <p>The third objection, brought by the ſieur de Villiers againſt the daughter of his client, was founded on reflections on her conduct, equally injurious and unjuſt, ſince the adverſe party knew it was ſo irreproachable, that, though they had employed every poſſible me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to diſcover ſome indiſcretion, ſome error, none could be produced againſt her; they were therefore forced to content themſelves with remote hints and groundleſs preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but, as the honour of a woman, and above all of a young and beautiful woman in her ſituation, is the moſt delicate, and moſt eaſily blemiſhed, he determined to wipe off the ſtain theſe cruel, though remote hint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:036316_0098_1008D921C8C81BA0"/>
might leave, by producing teſtimony of her conduct. He then proved by witneſſes, that not only during her firſt marriage and widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, her character had been unimpeached, notwithſtanding her youth, and the uncommon attractions of her perſon; but that ſince ſhe had been connected with the chevalier de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, it had been ſo irreproachable, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice itſelf had never dared to throw on it the ſlighteſt reflection. The beſt proof, that the chevalier himſelf was as much attached to her from the conviction of her virtue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as by her perſonal beauty, was, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs with which he ſought to confirm, or to renew, a marriage which he preferred to all the ſatisfaction a great fortune could beſtow; and was content to be cut off from his family, and loſe his inheritance, rather than abandon a wife ſo worthy of his tenderneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. Had not the excellent character and numerous virtues of his wife ſecured the heart her eminent beauty firſt attracted, it was probable, that a young man, after a three years marriage, would willingly avail himſelf of the opportunity he now had to recover his liberty, and reconcile himſelf to his father. The conduct of the chevalier de Villiers was the beſt eulogy on the merit of his wife.</p>
            <p>The charge of ſeduction, the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of all the allegations againſt Julie de Lalande, the widow of the ſieur Geoffroi, alone remained to be controverted. The plaintiffs
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:036316_0099_1008D93508D6F850"/>
had aſſerted, that being a widow, and older than the chevalier de Villiers, and being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides aſſiſted in her enterprize by her father, and her late huſband's mother, ſhe had art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inveigled the chevalier into a clandeſtine marriage; who was, from his inexperience and youth, liable to fall into the ſnare. But the facts were here greatly miſrepreſented. In regard to age, the chevalier was only three months younger than madame Geoffroi; and in point of experience, it is inconceivable that a young man, who had been two years a mouſquetaire, as long aid de camp to marſhal Bouff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, and three years a captain of horſe, ſhould be without knowledge of the world, and unable to diſcover the artful practices of the defendants, had any ſuch been uſed; yet he is repreſented as a novice, without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and incapable of conducting himſelf.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould madame Geoffroi wiſh to engage the chevalier Villiers, had not a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affection bound them to each other? She lived eaſy and reſpected with her mother-in-law; ſhe was young, beautiful, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently much followed and admired, and had among her lovers ſeveral of eſtabliſhed fortune, and of higher rank; with whom ſhe would not have experienced the inconveniences and perſecutions to which her preſent union had expoſed her. Her proſpects of fortune from her father were at leaſt equal to thoſe of the chevalier de Villiers; and, being born a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:036316_0100_100895B68ABE0BB8"/>
ſhe might juſtly aſpire to an union wiſh a man of family; why, therefore, ſhould the chevalier Villiers be an object to her, and what ſhould attach her to him, but that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted and ſincere affection, which induce her to prefer him to the reſt of mankind, and even to her own peace and convenience?—The charge of ſeduction, brought againſt the ſieur de Lalande, her father, was equally ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. He was at firſt ignorant of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and, when he was informed of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed what he really felt, anger and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, foreſeeing all the ill conſequences of ſuch an indiſcreet connection. But the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his daughter, and the welfare of his grandſon obliged him, ſince the thing was done, to receive his daughter, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have her marriage confirmed. He is accuſed of keeping the chevalier de Villiers always with him, and by that means depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of the freedom of choice. That aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is contradicted by the notorious fact of the chevalier's having made two campaigns ſince his marriage, when he was many months abſent from his wife and her family. On his return to winter at home, he preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his father's houſe; he was refuſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; it was then natural for him to go where his wife and child were, and to make his abode with the ſieur de Lalande. In fact, he had, during his minority, neither home or ſupport but with his wife; ſince he attained
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:036316_0101_1008D9368EC5A978"/>
his majority, he had removed from the houſe of his wife's father: the idea therefore, of his being under guidance or influence, was wholly unfounded. It was alſo ſaid, that the ſieur de Lalande had impreſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ars on the mind of the chevalier de Villier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. He did indeed fear—but what?—he feared to become perjured and faithleſs; to act againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, againſt the laws of nature and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; againſt the peace and honour of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and innocent woman, and a child who claimed all his tenderneſs and protection.—Theſe crimes he certainly was afraid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and the fear of ſuch guilt was ſo great, that he loſt the leſſer fear of being diſinherited, though the conſequence were to be the loſs of a ſplendid fortune, and, what he valued more, his father's favour. However flattering it would be to him to poſſeſs both, he could not do it by an act which would make him guilty and unworthy in his own eyes, and in thoſe of every man of honour; his hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was, that in his profeſſion he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that fortune which he would not owe to perjury and injuſtice, and that his ſword would be the means of repairing the injuſtice of his father: and, if he muſt chooſe between poſſeſſing unſtained the honour of his wife, his child, and himſelf, though in the loweſt indigence; or of forfeiting it all to become the heir to his father's fortune, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his favour; he preferred poverty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured

            <p>When the pleadings on behalf of the ſieur de Lalande and his daughter were finiſhed, the force of what had been advanced on both ſides was thus collected by the celebrated monſieur le Nain,<note n="†" place="bottom">Solicitor general for that court.</note> advocate general.</p>

            <p>The point therefore to be decided was, whether, under the preſent circumſtances, his parents ſtill refuſing their conſent, the cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier de Villiers being major, might marry Julie de Lalande, the widow of the ſieur Geoffroi?</p>

But that is not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: the ſieur de Lalande was a gentleman, if not by deſcent by his perſonal merit and eminent ſervices, and his family at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed, if not noble. The difference of fortune no well founded cauſe of oppoſition. If it were, it is here out of the queſtion, as the ſieur de Lalande is willing to make that of his daughter equal to whatever the ſieur de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers will give his ſon—If Julie de Lalande had been guilty of any irregularities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, either previous or ſubſequent to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the chevalier de Villiers, ſuch conduct might render effectual the oppoſition of his parents; but no ſuch fact has appeared; on the contrary, ſtrong teſtimonies of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and rectitude have been produced. If, however, ſeduction could be proved on the part of the lady, it is a crime ſo heinous, that the parents would be juſtified in their refuſal to conſent to the marriage, and the law would maintain them in it; but nothing had been alleged which could fix that imputation on <hi>her.</hi> Between two perſons ſo nearly of the ſame age, love was the ſeducer of both; and
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:036316_0105_1008D93E442BB408"/>
with a perſon ſo calculated to inſpire it, with temper and talents ſo likely to fix it, there was no need of ſeduction. But her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſieur de Lalande, was not equally clear from this charge; for though it appeared that he was not at Metz when the connection began, yet it was clear, that as ſoon as he was appriſed of his daughter's ſituation, he tried by every means in his power to make the chevalier de Villiers adhere to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. In doing ſo he had acted like a father anxious for the honour of his child. But there ſtill was an appearance of conſtraint; the chevalier had lived with him during his minority; and immediately on its expiration, and before he could be ſaid to be out of the influence of the ſieur de Lalande, this cauſe had come on. For theſe reaſons, the ſolicitor general propoſed, that the chevalier de Villiers ſhould be obliged to return to his family for a certain time, in order that it ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of the power of the ſieur de Lalande to affect his judgment; after which, if he ſtill perſiſted in uſing his right to marry Julia de Lalande, it ſhould not be denied him. In regard to the danger he might incur in the enſuing campaign, as he had already returned ſafe, it was probable he might do ſo again; at leaſt the hazard muſt be incurred, where the rights of paternal authority, and the good order of ſociety, were in queſtion. Though the ſolicitor general ſeemed by this ſpeech to
<pb facs="unknown:036316_0106_1008D8F85DE8FB80"/>
act as a moderator, it appears probable, from the cloſe of it, that he was influenced by the parents of the chevalier de Villiers; who hoped if he could detach their ſon from the family of his wife, they ſhould prevail on him to give up a connection ſo contrary to their views—But the judges were not, in their ſentence, guided by the opinion of the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor general. Their ſentence was to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect—That the marriage contracted between the chevalier Villiers, and the widow Geoffroi, was null and invalid; but that ſhe was cleared from all charge of ſeduction; and that he was at liberty, being now of age, to contract marriage with her, due regard being paid to the requiſite forms; and the parents muſt withdraw their oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The relation of this cauſe appears defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; not only in the confuſed manner in which the parties are indiſcriminately called the ſieur de Villiers, without duly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the father from the ſon, but in the obſcurity of the recital, which ſays, that the ſieur de Villiers (who, for diſtinction ſake, is here called the chevalier) was married at the age of twenty-two—and, after three years, claimed, as he was major, his right to affirm or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his marriage. He could then be only twenty-five. Yet the laws of France fix the majority of a woman at twenty-five; and that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:036316_0107_1008D940D27E2180"/>
of a man at thirty years old—till which time they cannot marry without the conſent of both their parents.</p>

            <head>THE BEGGAR OF VERNON.</head>
            <p>ON the 6th of May 1640, Jane Vachero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was married to Launcelot le Moine, a notary of the Chatelet at Paris; in 1645, Launcelot le Moine made his will, in which he named his wife the ſole guardian of his three ſons, Peter, James, and Louis, and died in January 1649. His will was confirmed by the ſenate of the Chatelet. The mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guardian of the boys, to whom ſhe gave ſuch an education as was ſuitable to their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. She ſent them to ſuch ſchools as inſtruct children in reading, writing, and the rudiments of the Latin tongue. She had ſeveral farms in the neighbourhood of Vernon; and, as there were conſiderable arrears of rent due from her tenants, and other affairs which required her preſence, ſhe went thither in September 1654, carrying her youngeſt ſon, Louis, with her, and leaving the other two, Peter, who was about fourteen, and James, who was about ten, under the care of her mother and a female ſervant. While their

mother was abſent, theſe two boys, weary of reſtraint, ran away, no one knew whithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the ſons of another tradeſman named Coutard. The children of Coutard were met with by an extempt of the grand provoſt, who brought them back to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but of the children of madame le Moine, no intelligence could be gained. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy mother, overwhelmed with grief and conſternation, flew from place to place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating every body ſhe met to aſſiſt her in finding her children. Wherever ſhe went the idea of her loſt boys followed her; and to find them appeared the firſt wiſh of her heart. In this diſpoſition ſhe paſſed one day by the Hotel Dieu, and obſerved fitting on the ſteps, a beggar, whom ſhe had often ſeen aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charity, in the ſame place. His child was with him, and a likeneſs between this child and her ſecond ſon, James le Moine, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſtruck her. She approached and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the lad more nearly, and found that though there was ſome reſemblance, he was not ſo very like her ſon as ſhe had at firſt imagined. She gave ſome relief to the beggar, and beſought him to enquire, wherever he went, for her children: ſhe deſcribed the marks by which they might be known, and again entreating the mendicant to attend to her requeſt, ſhe left him with tears, after having received from him hopes, that in the courſe of his wandering he might meet with
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:036316_0110_1008D8FF16C91588"/>
the objects of her ſearch. Some months paſſed, and every enquiry this wretched mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had made was yet of no avail: ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went to a commiſſary, in May 1655, and having informed him of the circumſtances of her loſs, deſired ſuch aſſiſtance as the civil power could give her.</p>
            <p>In the month of July following, buſineſs obliged her to go again to Vernon, where ſhe little expected to become an object of public deteſtation and hatred, on account of thoſe children, whoſe flight had almoſt broken her heart. On Sunday the 25th of that month, the beggar, whoſe name was John Monrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau, whom ſhe had ſeen on the ſteps of the Hotel Dieu, entered the town of Vernon with his boy. He placed himſelf, as uſual, in the great church to aſk alms, and the reſemblance between this child and James le Moine, ſtruck a number of people who ſaw him, and they, as is uſual in ſuch caſes, communicated their ideas to others. It was aſſerted, however, that it originated with the ſieur Mordant, lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant general of the police for that town and the ſieur Louis, procureur du roy; and that vengeance rather than juſtice, influenced their proceedings, madame le Moine having refuſed to ſell them ſome parcels of land; which lay contiguous to theirs, and which they were very deſirous of poſſeſſing. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that was a notion that the little beggar was James le Moine, became univerſal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:036316_0111_1008D9461CAD52E8"/>
le Moine was conſidered as a cruel and unnatural mother, who had, in concert with the pauper Monrouſſeau, agreed to condemn one of her children to miſery and want, for the ſake of aggrandizing the youngeſt, who was ſuppoſed to be her favourite. The crowd eagerly caught the news, and a ſort of tumult enſued as the gate of the town, where the mendicant ſtood with his child. There the procur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> du roy appeared, and, it is ſaid, rather excited the indignation of the people, than attempted, as he ought to have done, to educe them to reaſon. Monrouſſeau, the pauper, was ſeized and hurried before the judge, who, without hearing him, in a very illegal manner ſent him to priſon, ordered irons to be put on his fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and that his ſon ſhould be taken from him and ſent to the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. At the ſame time the magiſtrate iſſued an order for the arreſt of madame le Moine. One of the officers was diſpatched for her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a guard. They brought the unfortunate woman by force through an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe crowd, who lined the ſtreets, quite from her own houſe to that of the judge; and theſe people overwhelmed her with abuſe, and loaded her with reproaches, ſuch as only the moſt da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Dieu; but he aſſerted that the child was not her's but his own, by his wife Jane le Blond, the widow of a ſhoemaker. He related all the particulars of his wife's death, and what had ſince happened to him. This examination being over, the child of the beggar was brought in, and confronted with madame le Moine. The child ſaid the was his mother. She remained a whole day ſhut up in the apartment of the judge, who uſed, it is ſaid, every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace and every art to force her to acknowledge that the little beggar was her ſon, James le Moine. She continued, however, firm in her refuſal to aſſert an untruth, and, as ſoon as ſhe was diſmiſſed, ſhe took the earlieſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to fly from her perſecutors, and returned to Paris. But to ſuch a pitch had the fury of the populace by this time riſen, that as ſoon as they heard ſhe was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lown, they entered her houſe, and broke to pieces her glaſſes, and furniture of every kind; and had ſhe remained there, ſhe would, in all probability, have become herſelf the victim of their rage. A ſuit was now commenced. The procureur du roy directed Claude le Moine, the neareſt relation of the children of the deceaſed Launcelot le Moine, to name a guardian for the ſuppoſed child; and on the 21ſt of Auguſt the judge gave ſentence, that the child ſhould have a proviſion aſſigned him of an hundred livres. Madame le Moine appealed, and obtained a ſentence, whereby
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:036316_0113_1008D9490FC385C0"/>
all proceedings were ſtopped till the cauſe could be heard before the parliament of Paris. But Vernon being in the juriſdiction of the parliament of Normandy, the judge would not attend to the decree, but proceeded to force from the tenants of madame le Moine, the ſum he had awarded as a ſupport for the ſuppoſed Jame le Moine, her ſon. In hopes of ſtopping theſe proceedings, ſhe obtained a new arret, and ſerved it on the lieutenant and procureur, in the public capacity, as well as by their private names; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to acknowledge the authority of the parliament of Paris. A conteſt now aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two juriſdictions, the parliaments of Paris and of Normandy; which obliged the parties to have recourſe to the ſource of power, and carry the cauſe before the privy council.</p>
            <p>Monrouſſeau and his child were conducted to Paris, and ſent to fort I'Eveque; there they were interrogated by monſieur de Lamoignon: before him the boy acknowledged Monrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau for his father. The cauſe was now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, by the privy council, to be heard and examined by the parliament of Paris. Eight days after this laſt ſentence of the privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Peter le Moine, the eldeſt of the children who had left their mother, returned. The youngeſt of her three ſons (Louis, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with her) was dead, and the diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late mother received her eldeſt ſon as a gift from Heaven; but her tranſports, on ſeeing
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:036316_0114_1008D90506CA4030"/>
him ſo unexpectedly reſtored to her, were checked, when ſhe found that ſhe ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her ſecond ſon no more. Peter gave his mother an account of his unhappy travels. He told her, that when he and his brother ran away, they went to Vernon, and from thence to St. Waaſt, where they were obliged, having no money, to aſk charity; a gentleman, named Montaud, ſaw by their manner that they were children of ſome creditable perſon: he took them to his houſe, and kept them twelve days, during which time the youngeſt of them, James le Moine, ſickened and died; and Peter produced a certificate, ſigned by the curate, and the monks called the brothers of charity, ſignifying that his brother was buried in the burying-ground belonging to the church of St. Waaſt.</p>
            <p>This certificate was alſo ſigned by monſieur Montaud, and ſeveral inhabitants of the pariſh. Peter, after his brother was dead, left the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of monſieur Montaud, and had ſince been a wandering beggar, ſuffering all the miſeries of extreme poverty: till he determined to return, like another prodigal, to the boſom of his mother, who received him as the father in ſcripture received his repentant ſon. At length the cauſe was brought to a hearing, and mr. Pouſſet de Montauban pleaded in behalf of the widow of Launcelot le Moine.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pleading of Pouſſet de Montauban, of the widow le Moine.</note>

After opening the cauſe, he proceeded to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the judge and procureur of Vernon, of being the cauſe of the accuſation made againſt madame le Moine; and of many illegal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings throughout the affair. They had confined madame le Moine a whole day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any authority, and by irritating the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace againſt her, had obliged her to fly like a criminal, from a place where her life was endangered. He proceeded to prove the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his client, the birth of her children, the flight of the two elder, and the diſtreſs into which their loſs threw their mother;—the means ſhe took to recover them; her application to the police for their aſſiſtance, witneſſed by eight perſons, which evinced a ſincere deſire in madame le Moine to recover her ſons. He proved, by Gabriel Alexander, a writing-maſter, that both Peter and James le Moine could read and write; the boy who was now produced as James le Moine could do neither; but was buried in that profound ignorance, in which thoſe in his unhappy ſtation live. He produced, on the evidence of Peter le Moine, proof that James le Moine, his brother, was dead; and the certificate of his interement put it beyond a doubt.</p>
            <p>He then went on to examine the evidence of Monr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſſeau the pauper: What did that ſay? It gave a clear account of his wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. His wife Jane le Blond, the widow of a ſhoemaker, lay-in of twins, a boy and

at girl, at Mondidier; but theſe children died three days after their birth. They then (the pauper and his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e) went to Neuville, where they earned a precarious ſubſiſtence by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in guardens, or in the woods; and there the woman was again delivered of twins, a boy and a girl, but the boy only ſurvived; whoſe baptiſmal regiſter was produced. The man (Monrouſſeau) and his wife, afterwards went into the Limouſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n being reduced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty, and to the neceſſity of begging, they returned, after ſome time, towards Neuville; but on the way the woman was taken ill, and was ſent to the Hotel Dieu at Tours, where ſhe died. Monrouſſeau and his boy then proceeded to Paris; he related his being ſpoken to on the ſteps of the Hotel Dieu by madame le Moine, who had loſt her two children, and he repeated the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had with her. Monſieur de Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban then produced the examination of the little beggar. He ſaid that James Monrouſſeau was his father; he related the death of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Hotel Dieu at Tours; he ſaid that he had always been accuſtomed to beg with his father, and that he could neither read nor write. When he was aſked whether he would always beg with his father, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered yes, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, for he could not leave his father. Theſe ſentiments proved that he was the ſon of Monrouſſeau. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his father, though poor and deſtitute
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:036316_0117_1008D94D44059638"/>
of the means of ſupporting him, to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mother, though rich, and ſurrounded with conveniencies. The miſeries of cold, hunger and nakedneſs, to which he was born, were become habitual to him, and with his father he was content to ſhare them. Here the voice of nature ſpoke. The interrogatory and anſwers of madame le Moine were next produced: anxious as ſhe was to recover her children, her heart refuſed to acknowledge the ſuppoſitious one; ſhe felt no emotion to perſuade her that it was her ſon. A ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance at firſt attracted her towards the little beggar, but on a nearer inſpection ſhe found him not to be her ſon. She ſhed tears at the bitter recollection of her loſt child, and entreated Monrouſſeau, the pauper, to enquire for him and his brother; ſuppoſing it likely, that in travelling from place to place, he might meet them. A reſemblance there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was between the child madame le Moine had loſt, and the child of the pauper Monrouſſeau, ſince it had ſtruck madame le Moine herſelf; but becauſe this boy had hair and eyes of the ſame colour, and ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in features, it did not therefore follow that the beggar was James le Moine. In fact, their ages by no means correſpond. The ſon of Monrouſſeau was proved to be not more than eight years old; whereas the ſon of madame le Moine would have been, had he been living, in his twelth year. Had James
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:036316_0118_1008D90945382A98"/>
Monronſſeau then ſtolen the ſon of madame le Moine, as beggars have been known to do? Had he taken him to excite the pity of the charitable, by intereſting their feelings? No, it was his own ſon, who has been accuſtomed to beg with him from his earlieſt infancy.</p>
            <p>The people of Vernon had conceived a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that this is the child of madame le Moine; but why?—The likeneſs at firſt gave the idea, which the magiſtrate encouraged. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people love wonders; a diſcovery of this ſort is exactly ſuited to their taſte; and when fire is once laid to the train of popular preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and enthuſiaſm, who ſhall ſay where it will ſtop? The magiſtrate, to gratify a pique againſt the widow le Moine, endeavoured to force her to acknowledge a child not her own; and would have torn from the mendicant, the only bleſſing he had, a child whom he had brought up, and who aſſiſted him to gain his miſerable ſubſiſtence.—Then, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the parliament, monſieur de Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban exclaimed, <q>Gentlemen, puniſh theſe iniquitous judges—give back the child to his father — let the unhappy mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore at liberty the death of the child we cannot reſtore to her.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pleadings of — Foureroy, for John Monrouſſeau.</note>Monſieur de Foureroy, pleaded for John Monrouſſeau. He related his hiſtory; that he was the ſon of a ſtone-cutter, and, when a boy, was employed to keep ſheep; that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards became a ſoldier, and being in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon at Bapaume, married the widow of a ſhoemaker. He then related all that monſieur de Montauban had before gone through, of the ſubſequent life of James Monrouſſeau. This man did not abandon his child, though left to him an helpleſs infant, and without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The tenderneſs of the father prevailed over the inconveniences of his ſituation. He nurſed, he protected his ſon; he ſhared with him the miſerable morſel obtained from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and as he grew bigger, he became more and more attached to him; neither could live without the other.

of the magiſtrates of Vernon, and committed in irons to priſon. Though the little Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſſeau had ſaid, on being confronted with madame le Moine, that ſhe was his mother, yet it was eaſy to imagine that he had been tutored to do ſo, by the perſons in whoſe hands he was; for ſince he had left them, he had conſtantly perſiſted in affirming that Monrouſſeau, the mendicant, was his father, and that he had never known any other. When he was aſked at Paris, whether madame le Moine was his mother, he anſwered, that he wiſhed he had ſo rich a mother; but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame le Moine was not; that his mother died at Tours. More than forty relations of the family of le Moine depoſed, that the child now ſhewn them was not either of thoſe which madame le Moine had loſt; added to which, the eldeſt of thoſe children was returned, and had brought proof of his brother's death. Many teſtimonies were produced of the joy that madame le Moine expreſſed at the ſight of her eldeſt ſon, and no reaſon could be given why ſhe would not with equal pleaſure have received the ſecond, who was equally dear to her; for why ſhould ſhe refuſe to obey the voice of nature in one inſtance and not in the other?—why ſhould ſhe diſclaim the little Monrouſſeau, if he were really her ſon?—The great warmth with which meſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

very remarkable; they themſelves became proſecutors, and heard witneſſes. Monſieur Mordant was at the trouble and expenſe of ſending him to Bois Gerome, one of madame le Moine's farms, endeavouring to make her tenants and others acknowledge him for James le Moine, and all this at his own expenſe, pretending to undertake it all, and to diſburſe money for the ſake of juſtice only, when in reality his zeal, far from being produced by ſo commendable a motive, was occaſioned by his unjuſtifiable thirſt of vengeance, and his deſire to diſtreſs and harraſs a woman who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him.</p>
            <p>Monſieur Foureroy concluded, by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the impriſonment of his client Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſſeau, the beggar, ſhould be declared ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, his examination eraſed, and his ſon reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored to him; finally, that meſſieurs Louis Mordant, and Claude Louis, the magiſtrates acting againſt him, ſhould be condemned to pay all the damages and coſts, with intereſt.</p>

Couturien, two relations of the family. A ſtonger evidence even than theſe, was obtained from William Aubert, a ſurgeon, who knew him by the ſcar formed by a wound, which he himſelf had dreſſed. Notwithſtanding all this evdience, the ſieur Mordant determined to act with candour, and took the child to the houſe where the mother lodged, and where every thing appeared familiar to him. The ſame thing happened at Bois Gerome, the farm belonging to the widow le Moine. He knew his way thither, knew the farmer, and was known by him. With all theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in favour of his being really James le Moine, and with the voice of the people ſo loudly demanding juſtice for him, what could monſieur Mordant do otherwiſe than he did.

            <p>Monſieur Robert then pleaded for the child.

He then attacked the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity of the evidence that went to prove the death of James le Moine. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, produced by Peter le Moine, the eldeſt brother, proved indeed that ſome child was at that time interred; but it by no means proved that the child was the identical James le Moine: it might be any other child, ſince they who aſſiſted at the interment did not know him. The certificate itſelf was defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and without date; and Peter, the eldeſt ſon, from motives of avarice, or from being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by his mother, might have attempted to eſtabliſh the death of James le Moine, which never happened. Monſieur Robert then demanded, in the concluſion, that the boy ſhould be declared the legitimate ſon of the deceaſed Launcelot le Moine, by his wife Jane Vacherot; that the acts of the magiſtrates of Vernon ſhould be confirmed; and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſſeau, the pauper, proceeded againſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law.</p>

            <head>THE COUNT DE ST. GERAN.</head>
            <p>THE marſhal de St. Geran, of the noble houſe of De la Guiche, was firſt married to mademoiſelle de Tournon, by whom he had a ſon, Claude de la Guiche, count de St. Geran; and a daughter, married to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Bouillé. His ſecond was Suſannah aux Epaules, the widow of the count de Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenay, to whom ſhe had borne a daughter, Suſannah de Lonquenay.

The young count was about eighteen, and the lady between thirteen and fourteen; and the extreme youth of the parties made their friends think it expedient for the count to travel into Italy, where he continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="unknown:036316_0127_1008D95B44D06430"/>
thirteen years he ſurvived this marriage, ſaw with regret that it produced no children and to his death which happened in 1632, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that this branch of the noble houſe of which he was the principal, was likely to be extinct in his ſon. He left, by his ſecond lady, two daughters.</p>
            <p>On his deceaſe, the count de St. Geran ſucceeded him in his government of the Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnois; and the king gave him the ribands of thoſe orders with which his father had been honoured.</p>
            <p>For many years after this period the count and counteſs of St. Geran continued without children; but at length, in 1640, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs became pregnant; a circumſtance that gave the greateſt joy to her mother, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaleſs, and to all who were attached to the family of de la Guiche. This pleaſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation was however in ſome riſk of being diſappointed, by a fall which the counteſs had in her ſeventh month. On this occaſion all the ladies related to the family, women of the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and brought with her as preſents the moſt ſuperb linen and neceſſaries ſhe could purchaſe, for the infant ſo ardently deſired.</p>
            <p>But at the caſtle of St. Geran were alſo two perſons, who, influenced by the moſt cruel avarice, contrived to render all their preparations uſeleſs; to deprive the parents of the object of their tender ſolicitude, and fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the hopes of thoſe who were intereſted in beholding an heir to the virtues and eſtate of the count de St. Geran, The marchioneſs de Bouillé was ſiſter, by the ſame mother, to the count; ſhe had been early married to the marquis de Bouillé, who was ſeventy years of age. The diſparity of their years was probably the real occaſion of their parting, not long after their marriage; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ugh the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs pretended many cauſes of complaint againſt him.

The caſtle of St. Geran was an aſylum alſo to the marquis de St. Maixant, a man whoſe addreſs and talents found a patron in the count de St. Geran, who in the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the marquis ſeemed to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his crimes and his errors.

man of ſo abandoned a character as St. Maix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; who had been accuſed of having occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the death of his wife, in hopes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying another woman, the life of whoſe huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band he had alſo attempted. He had been ſuſpected of coining, and other atrocious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for ſome of which he had fallen into the hands of juſtice; but he eſcaped from the marechauſſe of Auvergne, and had found ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in the protection of count de St. Geran. The marquis St. Maixant concealed the baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſpoſition, and moſt abandoned principles, under elegant manners and agreeable talents. His perſon too was handſome, and his addreſs inſinuating; and leſs exterior advantages than he poſſeſſed, would probably have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to recommend him to the notice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Bouillé. Accuſtomed to avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of every advantage, he ſoon ſaw thoſe which might accrue by a connection with her. He ſaw that the great age of her huſband made it improbable, that the obſtacle of her being already married would be long in his way; and perhaps depended on his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſhortening the lives of thoſe who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed his views. That impediment once removed, he found that he might become the huſband of madame de Bouille, who but for the expected infant was heireſs to property which would not only reſtore his ruined for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but raiſe him to a rank that would by its ſplendor vaniſh his crimes, or even give
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:036316_0130_1008D91B678B8900"/>
eclat to his vices. With theſe hopes, and with talents calculated to pleaſe, he ſoon poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf of the heart of the marchioneſs; and her conſcience became wholly at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. They paſſed whole hours together alone, and in their long evening walks in the park, they found opportunities enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the ſchemes that were to gratify their avarice, and their love.</p>
            <p>The midwife, Louiſa Goillard, the two women immediately attending the perſon of the counteſs St. Geran, who were ſiſters of the name of Quinet; and the maitre d'hotel, called Beaulieu; were engaged by St. Maixant and madame de Bouillé in this cruel conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and, by dint of preſents, and promiſes of boundleſe reward, entered into the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deſign of robbing the count and counteſs of their child.

               </gap>, were all attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her chamber; the weather was very hot, and madame de Bouillé, affecting great tenderneſs and anxiety, repreſented, and with great appearance of reaſon, that ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the room could not fail to increaſe the heat of the air and of courſe the faintneſs of the patient. She therefore beſought the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaleſs to order every body to retire; and, that nobody might think ſuch an order unkind, that ſhe would herſelf ſet the example. To this the marſhaleſs conſented, madame de Bouillé undertaking to ſtay with the counteſs, and give from time to time information of the ſituation ſhe was in to the reſt of the family. For two hours after they quitted the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſufferings of the counteſs were ſo acute, that the midwife declared ſhe would inevitably ſink under it, if ſome reſt could not be procured. She gave her therefore to drink a mixture ſhe had prepared, which threw her almoſt immediately into total inſenſibility; and in that ſtate ſhe continued till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. During the night the count and the marſhaleſs ſent continually to the door to enquire after her; and the intelligence which was always given by madame de Bouillé
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:036316_0132_1008D91CECF48B80"/>
was, that all was going on well. The domeſtics were not ſuffered to enter the room, but received the anſwers at the door; where it was obſerved that St. Maixant continually attended, with thoſe marks of ſolicitude and uneaſineſs ſo natural to the ſtate of mind he muſt have been in, while the ſucceſs of his execrable plot was precarious. The unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate counteſs, now left in the hands of the cruel woman whoſe intereſt it was to deprive her of her child, was delivered of a ſon, while totally unconſcious of his birth, the draught given her by the midwife having reduced her to a ſtate ſo nearly reſembling death, that ſhe no longer knew what befel her. As ſoon as the infant was born, the midwife prepared to deſtroy him, by cruſhing his head; but ſhe was prevented, either by madame de Bouillé, who could not reſolve to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the innocent creature, or by Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu, the maitre d'hotel, who was now in the room, and who might have received orders from St. Maixant, or perhaps be influenced by humanity to ſpare the life of the victim, whom they were determined to rob of every thing elſe: however that was, the poor little creature was not reſcued from the hands of the midwife, till ſhe had injured the ſkull; a deep mark on which, left by her barbarous hands, the young count bore as long as he lived.</p>
            <p>The unhappy child, thus abandoned to the

They put him into a little baſket, wrapt in a linen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu took the baſket, and hiding it under his cloak, carried it down ſtairs to a private door that opened to the foſſé of the caſtle; from thence he croſſed the terrace and the bridge, and made his way through a private part of the park, all the keys of which he kept. He then mounted a ſwift horſe, and rode to Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherolles, a village three miles from St. Geran, where he ſtopped at the houſe of Claude Gautier, whoſe wife gave ſuck. He entreated the woman to give the breaſt to the infant he carried, which ſhe did; but not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long in the neighbourhood of the caſtle, he continued his journey immediately, and croſſing the river Allier, diſmounted with his helpleſs charge at the houſe of another man named Boucard, whoſe wife alſo gave ſuck to the child; after which, entering A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The poor babe by this time had ſuffered ſo much, that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu was apprehenſive for his life; and meeting with a waggon, driven by Paul Boiton, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon carrier, who uſed the road from A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to Riom, he agreed with this man to carry the child to a certain diſtance in his waggon; and getting in himſelf took it in his arms, and tied his horſe behind. As they went along, the carrier entered into diſcourſe with him; and, in the courſe of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Beaulieu told the carrier that he was ſo careful of the child becauſe he belonged to the nobleſt family of the Bourbonnois. This conveyance brought him to the village of Ché; and the miſtreſs of the houſe where it ſtopped ſuckled the infant, and, ſeeing the miſerable condition it was in, heated ſome water and waſhed it; after which Beaulieu took it again, and, getting into the waggon, was ſet down near Riom, where he paid the waggoner, and gave him a falſe direction where to find him: then remounting his horſe, and paſſing by the abbey of Lavoine, he arrived at the village of Deſcoutoux, which is among the mountains near Thiers, and where the marchioneſs de Bouillé had a ſeat, where ſhe ſometimes paſſed a few weeks. Here Beaulieu put the infant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o nurſe, with Gabriella Moiniot, to whom he paid a mouth before-hand; but as he refuſed to tell her the names of its parents, or where ſhe ſhould ſend news of her foſter child, this woman would not keep it, and returned it to B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The detail of this journey was ſubſtantiated by the evidence of the carrier, and the various women who had ſuckled the child. We will now relate what happened at the caſtle of St. Geran, and then return to trace the ſubſequent fate of the ſtolen infant.</p>
            <p>In the morning the counteſs de St. Geran ſlowly recovered her recollection, and enquired eagerly for her child, being convinced, from the ſituation in which ſhe found herſelf, that ſhe had been delivered. The midwife and madame de Bouillé proteſted that ſhe had not; and the former told her, that, ſince ſhe had paſſed the time when the moon was favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as her pains had left her, ſhe would not be brought to bed till the next change of the moon. The counteſs, who had the moſt convincing proofs that the birth had already taken place, could not be pacified; ſhe wept, ſhe implored them to tell her what was become of her child; but they hardened their hearts againſt her tears and anxiety, and continued
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:036316_0136_100895B4AB5FFD18"/>
to endeavour to perſuade her, that her delivery was only delayed. The midwife artfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that ſuch delays very frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in her practice; and by her arguments gained the belief of the marſhaleſs, who the more eaſily credited the aſſertion, as ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that with one of her children ſhe had gone ſix weeks, after having all the ſymptoms of an immediate delivery. The mention of a circumſtance ſo favourable to their project, was eagerly caught at, and inceſſantly repeated by madame de Bouillé and her confidants. But the counteſs could not be perſuaded, but that ſhe had loſt her child. She felt too great an alteration to doubt for a moment of the fact; and her anguiſh was not to be deſcribed, when ſhe found the whole family perſiſted in refuſing to believe her, and to look forward to a future day for the birth of the infant ſo ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. The midwife obſtinately inſiſted on the truth of her aſſertion, the counteſs as determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately adhered to hers, and her tears and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair appeared ſo dangerous to the confederates, that the midwife, fearful that nature and truth would unveil the cruel myſtery, endeavoured to put an end to the life of the counteſs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome days, ſhe perſuaded her, that if ſhe were to go into a carriage, and be driven over rough ground, it would bring on the labour. The counteſs, who was weak and exhauſted, would not conſent to undergo this fatiguing and dangerous experiment; but the count
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:036316_0137_1008D969C3414C38"/>
and the marſhaleſs beſought her to attempt it. To ſatisfy them ſhe conſented, all unable as ſhe was, and being carried to her coach, was violently driven over ploughed grounds, and along the rougheſt roads that could be choſen in the neighbourhood of St. Geran. After undergoing this cruel experiment for two hours, ſhe was brought home, fainting, and put again into her bed, whence her inhuman perſecutors hoped ſhe would ariſe no more. But the ſtrength of her conſtitution prevented her ſinking under the means uſed to deprive her of life. She began, though very ſlowly, to recover her health; but the conviction of her having loſt her infant was every day ſtrengthened. Nobody ſuſpected ſuch a crime as had been committed; and at length as time advanced, and no delivery took place, every one began to ſuppoſe ſhe had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as has ſo often happened to others, by ſymptoms reſembling pregnancy, and by ſo much wiſhing to find it ſo. This opinion gained univerſal belief; but the counteſs was not to be ſo argued out of her ſenſes—till, finding that nobody attended to her complaints, but imputed them to her fondneſs for an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion ſo flattering to her wiſhes, ſhe tried to ceaſe ſpeaking of what was deeply engraven on her heart, and, ſince ſhe ſaw no remedy, to forbear to complain:—ſtill however per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that ſhe had borne a child, her grief and melancholy often got the better of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:036316_0138_1008D925A14E5A18"/>
not to afflict the count by renewing the memory of their diſappointment; but, after ſome months had elapſed, theſe burſts of affliction became leſs violent; till a ſingular circumſtance again awakened the recollection of what had happened, together with ſuſpicion of its cauſe. While this interval paſſed, we will return to trace the fate of the child thus vainly lamented by its mother.</p>
            <p>Beaulieu had a brother, who had been a fencing-maſter at Paris, and who died, about two years before this period, in great poverty, leaving his wife, the daughter of an actor, whoſe name was Mary Pigoreau, in wretched circumſtances: to the care of this woman Beaulieu determined to give the child, who was very glad to undertake it; two thouſand livres being left in the hands of de Raguenet, a grocer, at Paris, which he was from time to time to pay her, without knowing, or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>La Pigoreau bought for the infant, every neceſſary that is furniſhed for a child of faſhion, and took the greateſt care of him. She procured him a nurſe at Jorcy en Brie, whoſe name was Paillard, and with whom ſhe was intimate. This woman, after ſuckling him a ſhort time, was taken ill, and gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to La Pigoreau, that ſhe might get ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nurſe; la Pigorea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

little boy belonged to a great nobleman, who one day or other would reward thoſe who brought him up. As another nurſe, however, was to be found, la Pigoreau put him to a woman in the ſame village, who was lately a widow, and whoſe name was Sequin. To this woman ſhe alſo ſaid, that he was the ſon of a great lord, who was able to make her a rich woman. In conſequence of this report, and of the woman's being regularly paid every month, great care was taken of the young count; who was at the age of eighteen months, fetched by la Pigoreau from this wet-nurſe, and weaned. La Pigoreau had been mother of two ſons, the eldeſt called Anthony, the youngeſt, born after his father's death, called Henry, who uſed when only a few months old. Had this youngeſt ſon been liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he would have been three years older than the young count; but when la Pigoreau brought him to her houſe, ſhe pretended he was her laſt child, Henry, by this means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling the myſtery or his birth, and putting an end to all enquiries—for, that nobody might remark the age of the child, who knew that her youngeſt by her huſband muſt be much older, ſhe diſcharged her lodgings, took leave of her acquaintance, as if going into the country, and went to another part of Paris, where ſhe produced the little count as her youngeſt ſon.</p>
            <p>Whether it was by agreement between La
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:036316_0140_1008D92A44D3A050"/>
Pigoreau and Beaulieu, or whether the money was no longer ſo punctually paid, which made her weary of her charge, is uncertain; but at two years and a half old ſhe carried the child to Beaulieu, who was then at Paris with the count and counteſs, ſaying, that ſhe was no longer able to maintain both her children, and that as Beaulieu was their father's brother, and having ſo good a place, was in a ſituation to help her, he muſt take the youngeſt. To this Beaulieu agreed, and aſked leave of his lord and lady (who were extremely kind to him) to take the child into the Hotel de St. Geran. The counteſs told him he was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but at the ſame time repreſented to him how little he could afford to burden him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with any additional charge, who had five children of his own. His wife, too, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely chagrined, to find he meant to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to provide for his nephew; but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that if his lord and lady would ſuffer the little boy to be at their hotel, he would be very little expenſe to him; and the count and counteſs with their uſual goodneſs, conſented to indulge him. La Pigoreau had often been heard to ſay, ſhe was in no pain about the fate of her youngeſt ſon, who was ſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provided for; ſome of her neighbours therefore repreſented to her, that ſince ſhe was certain of an eſtabliſhment for one of them, ſhe had better avail herſelf of it for Anthony, the eldeſt, who was a plain coarſe

boy, and keep Henry with her, whoſe beauty would always be a recommendation; to which ſhe anſwered, that ſhe could not act otherwiſe than as ſhe had determined; which was to ſend Henry to his uncle.</p>
            <p>The child therefore was brought to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel de St. Geran, juſt as the counteſs and her ſuite were getting into the carriages, which were to carry them from Paris to Moulins; ſhe bid them put the little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="142" facs="unknown:036316_0142_1008D92CE0CF17F8"/>
not determine to part with him: ſhe ordered him to remain in her own apartments, and to be attended by her own women; and her attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him hourly encreaſed. The count was almoſt as fond of him as his lady; and the little boy, as if attracted towards them by the force of blood, was never ſo happy as when they allowed him to play round them, and return their fondneſs. In all his little diſtreſſes he ſought ſhelter in their arms, and every hour their mutual affection increaſed. The counteſs often looked on him till her eyes were filled with tears, and ſhe would ſigh and ſay—Alas! had the dear babe lived, whom I thought to have called mine, it would have been juſt the age of this, and perhaps as lovely and as engaging!</p>
            <p>The marquis de St. Maixant, and the marchioneſs de Bouillé were very much alarmed, when they found that Beaulieu had placed the child ſo near his parents; yet they dared not uſe any means to ſeparate them, as their interference in ſuch an affair would only have awaked thoſe ſuſpicions they were ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of evading.</p>
            <p>Beaulieu, who had been ſeduced by hopes of ſuddenly enriching his family by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards promiſed him, which a long courſe of ſervice could do but ſlowly, now ſaw the fallacy of thoſe viſionary proſpects with which he had been miſled, and remorſe of conſcience purſued him, from which he found no reſpite.
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:036316_0143_1008D970E05C4570"/>
To reveal the crime he had committed, would have been the moſt immediate remedy; but the fear of St. Maixant, and the dread of his maſter's reſentment, prevented this from time to time; though the anguiſh of his ſoul would not ſuffer him to remain wholly ſilent. He was ſometimes heard to ſay, that the honour and the life of madame de Bouillé were in his hands; ſometimes, that the count and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs had more reaſon to love little Henry than they were aware of; and to his confeſſor he propoſed this queſtion—Whether a man, having aſſiſted to ſecrete a child from its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, was exculpated from guilt, if he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſtored their child to them as the child of a ſtranger, and did not reveal the myſtery? It is probable that the anſwer given by the confeſſor did not calm thoſe ſcruples, which ſtill ſeemed to hang heavy on Beaulieu's heart, ſince he often appeared under great agitation and abſence of mind; and once, when a perſon at Moulins congratulated him on the affection which his lord and lady ſhewed to his nephew, he haſtily anſwered, that it was natural enough, for that he was nearly related to them. Theſe words, and many others of the ſame tendency, ſeemed to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape him in ſpite of himſelf, and perhaps were the reſult of the perpetual combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his conſcience and his fear.</p>
            <p>St. Maixant, who lived in continual dread of detection, now began to apprehend, that,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:036316_0144_1008D92E679AF250"/>
long ere he ſhould be able to reap the fruits of his crime, the remorſe of Beaulieu would not only render it ineffectual, but plunge him into all the horrors of thoſe puniſhments he had ſo well deſerved. He was not of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, after having gone ſo far, to leave any thing undone, and therefore determined to take away by poiſon the life of the man who daily ſubjected his to hazard. Beaulieu fell into a diſorder, which put an end to his life in a few days; but which firſt ſeemed to have affected his reaſon. He raved of the injury he had done his lord and lady, and beſought them to forgive him: while they, ſuppoſing him delirious, fearful of haſtening his death by enquiry, and beſides ſuſpecting nothing of the real meaning of his words, endeavoured only to have him kept calm; and he died without revealing the ſecret which burdened his heart.</p>
            <p>The little Henry, notwithſtanding the death of his ſuppoſed uncle, ſtill continued to be the favourite of the count and counteſs, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for him maſters of all ſorts, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themſelves to the cultivation of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and the regulation of his morals. When he was ſeven years old, they dreſſed him in a ſilk veſt of the colour of their livery, and called him their little page; in which quality he continued to ſerve them till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his birth was diſcovered.</p>
            <p>The ſpeeches of Beaulieu did not fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

By degrees they made their way to higher circles, and at length reached the count and counteſs de St. Geran.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time, the count being ill, went to Vichi, where the midwife then lived, to drink the waters. The counteſs, and the marchioneſs de Bouillé, attended him; and the former one day unexpectedly entering an apartment where madame de Bouillé was, ſaw her in cloſe conference with the midwife.

Madame de Bouillé, who could neither conceal her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, or evade the queſtion, anſwered, that dame Louiſa was praiſing her brother, the count; and ſaying how good he was, not to bear her any ill-will.

            <p>The reports that continually were repeated to the counteſs, and the circumſtance of the conference held between madame de Bouillé and the midwife, at length determined her to

apply to juſtice for an order to arreſt the midwife, and oblige her to ſpeak. After ſeveral conſultations between the count, the counteſs, and the marſhaleſs, they agreed firſt to examine the woman themſelves, with as little noiſe as poſſible; they therefore ſent for her to St. Geran, where they queſtioned her cloſely. They found that ſhe prevaricated, and contradicted herſelf; and in her looks and anſwers there appeared ſo much of guilt and confuſion, that they no longer doubted of her having com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Immediately afterwards, they laid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint before the vice ſenechal of Moulins; upon which the midwife was taken into cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody, and examined before that magiſtrate.</p>

               </gap>motely, but found no trace of the removal of earth, or the leaſt probability of the interment pretended to have been made. An interment for which no reaſon could be aſſigned; for if the counteſs had indeed been delivered of a ſtill-born child, no motive whatever could have induced the midwife or the aſſiſtants to have concealed it.</p>
            <p>The marſhaleſs, enraged at the midwife's prevarication, and convinced beyond a doubt of her guilt, declared that ſhe deſerved death, and determined to leave no effort untried to bring her to juſtice.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of this determination, proper officers of the law proceeded againſt the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, Louiſa Goillard. On her ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, ſhe ſaid that the counteſs de St. Geran had not been delivered; in the third examination, that ſhe had brought forth a mole—and in a fourth, that ſhe had borne a ſon, which had been ſecreted by Beaulieu, and carried away in a baſket: And in the fifth, when ſhe was put to the bar, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain cloſely interrogated, ſhe ſaid, that it was through fear only ſhe had been driven to ſay that the counteſs had borne a child; for there was no child. In the courſe of theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inations ſhe never accuſed, or even mentioned
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:036316_0149_1008D979E9792448"/>
the names of, the marchioneſs de Bouillé or St. Maixant.</p>
            <p>But as ſoon as ſhe found herſelf arreſted, ſhe ſent her ſon to madame de Bouillé, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her of what had happened. Terror and conſternation immediately overwhelmed her ſhe the moment at hand, which ſhe had ſo long dreaded; yet ſtill hoping to evade its conſequences, ſhe ſent a man, named La Forreſterie, who ſerved her as an upper do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, to the lieutenant general of the police, whom ſhe had formerly employed, and who had, ſhe knew a particular enmity to her brother, the count de St. Geran. She deſired he would adviſe her how to aſſiſt Goillard the midwife, without appearing in it. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended it to her, to ſtop the proceedings by obtaining an arret. The marchioneſs ſent therefore to her attorney, ordering him to do this in the name of William Goillard, the ſon of the woman; and that he might obey this order with alacrity, ſhe ſent him a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The attorney obtained the arret, and by that means a ſhort ſuſpenſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures. The reſpite however was of little uſe, for the arret was, on application from the other party, almoſt immediately annulled, and the cauſe wept on.</p>
            <p>La Forreſterie was afterwards ſent by his lady to the two Quine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, to whom he carried money. Theſe women, grown more rapacious as the danger encreaſed, deſired La Forreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:036316_0150_1008D9C651A14670"/>
to tell madame de Bouille that they had already had conſiderable offers of reward, if they would tell what they knew—that the counteſs de St. Geran had offered to take them back, and to place them in a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſituation than before—that a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin friar had been tampering with them, in hopes of getting their ſecret from them, in confeſſion, and by dint of very large offers which the counteſs had commiſſioned him to make; but they artfully added, that while madame de Bouillé continued their friend, they could not reſolve to diſcover what might be ſo prejudicial to her. They put into the hands of La Forreſterie a paper, in which was written twenty-five queſtions which the capuchin had deſired them to anſwer; and they begged that madame de Bouillé would dictate their anſwers againſt his return.—Some time after, La Forreſterie quitting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Bouillé in diſguſt, ſhe threatened that if ever he dared reveal all this, ſhe would have him aſſaſſinated. But dreading the evidence of the Quinets, and finding how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their ſecrecy could be depended upon, ſhe determined to engage them again, to be near her, and to purchaſe their ſilence at any price. For this purpoſe ſhe gave the eldeſt a portion of twelve thouſand livres, and married her to De Liſle, her maître d'hotel; and the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhe took as her femme de chambre. It is probable that continual anxiety and remorſe,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:036316_0151_1008D97BABEDF4D8"/>
together with the failure of her project of marriage (for St. Maixant was now again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, either for his former crimes, or ſome more recent one), threw her into a ſtate of deſpondency, and haſtened her death, for ſhe lived not long after. But the ſuit was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by perſons, who, though not equally guilty, were equally intereſted in the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the heir to the family of De la Guiche. After her death, La Forreſterie appeared, and made oath of the agency in which ſhe had employed him.—The marquis de St. Maixant, the original contriver of this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous plan, had now again involved himſelf in affairs, for which he was confined in the Conciergerie at Paris; ſo little to be depended on is the ſucceſs of the abandoned and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, whatever abilities they poſſeſs. Madame de Bouillé, though her huſband had been ſome time dead, had relinquiſhed all thoughts of marrying her paramour—and, by ſeveral circumſtances which appeared in the evidence, he ſeems to have connected himſelf with others, and to have given himſelf up to a courſe of debauchery; which probably ſhewed the marchioneſs, that the point ſhe had ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded ſo much to obtain, was likely to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter her life with all the miſeries of guilt, without even its tranſitory pleaſures, St. Maix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant being now a cloſe priſoner, was attended by a page, named Prudent Berger, in whom he had confidence. In the many hours of melancholy and
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:036316_0152_1008D9CAA9209C38"/>
deſpondency, which he paſſed in his confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he related to this young man many of the tranſaction? of his paſt life, and at length told him of the ſuppreſſion of the child born to the count and counteſs de St. Geran, who was, he ſaid, ſtill alive. The page very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſaid to him—<q>I wonder, ſir, ſince you have ſo many things on your mind, which diſtrub you, that you do not diſcharge your conſcience of all uneaſineſs, relative to this child, by reſtoring him to his parents.</q>—To which St. Maixant anſwered—<q>That I intend to do—A capuchin friar, to whom I owned in confeſſion that I had taken away the heir of a great houſe, the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a marſhal of France, from the midſt of his family, has told me, that he cannot give me abſolution till. I reſtore him.</q>—St. Maixant ſoon afterwards obtained, by the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the goaler, a greater degree of liberty, and was permitted to go out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ttended by one of the keepers. He took this page with him to the lodgings of La Pigoreau, where the little Henry, then about ſeven years old, was ſometimes ſuffered to go on a viſit to his pretended mother. There St. Maixant ſhewed him to the page, and ſaid to him, <q>Obſerve well this child, that if you ſhould be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after called upon, you may identify him:</q> and he owned afterwards to the page, that the child he had ſeen, remarkable for his beauty, and particularly ſo for his fine light hair and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:036316_0153_1008D97FB72FE248"/>
blue eyes, was the little boy whom he had taken from his parents, the count and counteſs de St. Geran. Very ſoon after this, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de St. Maixant was ſeized with his laſt illneſs; when his ſituation became deſperate, a prieſt attended him to adminiſter the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To this prieſt he ſaid with difficulty, that he could not receive them till he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed a ſecret relative to the count and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs de St. Geran; but hardly had he proceeded ſo far in his confeſſion before the agonies of death ſeized him; and he left the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making the only reparation now in his power for atrocious crime—ſo dangerous is it to defer till to-morrow, what conſcience requires us do to-day.</p>
            <p>By the death of St. Maixant and madame de Bouillé, the two principal actors were withdrawn from the ſcene. But the ducheſs de Ventadour and the counteſe de Lude now became the adverſe parties, whoſe rank and affluence made them infinitely more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable. The firſt of theſe ladies was the ſurviving daughter of the marſhal de St. Geran, by madame de Longuenay, his ſecond wife and was conſequently ſiſter to the count by the father, and to the counteſt by the mother—and thus heireſs to them both. The counteſs de Lude was the daughter to the marchioneſs de Bouill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and claimed her ſhare of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the marſhal de St. Geran, in right of her mother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:036316_0154_1008D9CC2E673620"/>
Enabled, by their fortune and thir power, to contract whatever meaſures were taken by the count and counteſs de St. Geran, to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the proof of the birth of their ſon, they undertook to ſupport La Pigoreau, who was now to ſubſtantiate her right to the little Henry, whom ſhe undertook to prove was actually her ſon. She had not, however, voluntarily become a party, but was firſt comprehended in the accuſation by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of juſtice. Alarmed at the attack, which threatened the worſt conſequences, and flattering herſelf that through the protection of the ducheſs de Ventadour, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs de Lude, ſhe might not only eſcape pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but obtain a proviſion, as a reward for the good offices ſhe could do them, ſhe readily enliſted herſelf in their ſervice, and, inſtead of ſhrinking from the enquiry, as a criminal, who ſhared the guilt of the original perpetrators, ſhe prepared boldly to appear as the injured perſon, and to inſiſt on her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal rights being reſtored to her.</p>
            <p>The adverſe party thus ſtrengthened, the cauſe went on with new vigour. The count de St. Geran had obtained a ſentence of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment againſt Louiſa Goillard, the midwife. The infliction of it was ſtopped by an arret obtained by the ducheſs de Ventadour and madame de Lude; though the name of La Pigoreau only appeared, and theſe ladies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to have no connection with her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:036316_0155_1008D982800A5488"/>
While preparations were making for a new trial, the midwife died, without having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed her guilt, Her ſon, however, being now no longer apprehenſive of ſeeing his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought to the ſcaffold, voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he would reveal the truths her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had before obliged him to ſmother. He ſaid that his mother had repeatedly told him, that ſhe had delivered the counteſs de St. Geran of a ſon, who had been carried away by Beaulieu, through the contrivance of St. Maxiant and madame de Bouillé; and the little boy who now lived at the hotel de St. Geran, under the name of Henry Beaulieu, was the child ſo ſecreted. He added, that ſince the death of the marchioneſs de Bouillé, his mother had been ſupported by money with which the ducheſs de Ventadour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Lude had ſupplied her, and that they had paid the lawyers who undertook her defence.</p>

               </gap>e a woman ſituated like La Pigoreau, who had not where withal to ſupply herſelf and her eldeſt ſon with the neceſſaries of life, ſhould thus claim another child, to ſhare her poverty and diſtreſs, if ſhe did not feel her maternal affection more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible than even her indigence, and deſire to
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:036316_0156_1008D9CEE170C2B0"/>
have her ſon reſtored to her, though ſhe had no proſpect for him and herſelf but poverty and obſcurity. They pleaded, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs de St. Geran, attracted by the beauty of the boy, and extremely deſirous of having an heir, had dreſſed up a detail, for which there was no foundation originally, but her chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ideas, and at length raiſed an idol, to whom ſhe wiſhed to ſacrifice the intereſts of the true heirs of the family. They inſiſted on the doubtful proof of her having borne a child. The equivocation of the midwife made her evidence of no avail; and it was remarkable, that when the counteſs de St. Geran was in labour of an infant, whoſe birth was of ſuch conſequence to an illuſtrious and ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that nobody ſhould be preſent, who would ſwear to the fact of the birth; and above all, that the marſhaleſs, who was ſo particularly intereſted in the event, and who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom her age and experience, as well as her affection, ought to have attended, was not only out of the room at the time, but after all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of pregnancy had ceaſed, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to let the enquiry drop, and to allow that the whole was a viſionary hope originating in the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent wiſhes of the counteſs. A cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that could hardly have happened, had the marſhaleſs been thoroughly perſuaded that the counteſs was really pregnant; for in that caſe ſhe would have undoubtedly inſiſted on a cloſe enquiry than ever appears to have
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:036316_0157_1008D9855F6070B0"/>
been made.—This is the moſt forcible part of the pleadings of one of the counſel—Another ſaid, that it might perhaps be thought unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, that a mother, in circumſtances ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as thoſe of La Pigoreau, ſhould wiſh to deprive her ſon of the brilliant fortune offered him, as ſuppoſed heir to a great and powerful nobleman, and compel him to return to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of that miſery and indigence to which he was born; but that her maternal love was ſo ſtrong that ſhe could not reſolve to loſe her ſon, even to ſee him count de St. Geran; and were it weaker, her conſcience would prevent her ſuffering him to uſurp honours and riches to which he had no right. As to the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance which the boy was allowed to bear to the count de St. Geran, this he ſaid was no proof, ſince two perſons frequently are very like each other, who yet are not related.</p>
            <p>Thus went the pleadings on behalf of the maternity of La Pigoreau; but the ladies de Ventadour and de Lude, whether they were aſhamed of appearing publicly as the ſupporters of a woman of ſuch a character as la Pigoreau, or whether they thought that by varying the plea, they ſhould diſtract the attention of the judges, and throw yet deeper obſcurity on the truth, determined to make their advances in a new ground; and, while they with one hand privately ſupported la Pigoreau, with the other they held up a falſe light to miſlead and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the enquiries of that juſtice they affected
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:036316_0158_1008D9D359898960"/>
to demand.—When firſt La Pigoreau took the young count, ſhe was afraid of having him baptized, left it ſhould occaſion enquiries into his birth; but after ſome time, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to have him privately chriſtened at St. John's en Greue; and the regiſter was in theſe words:—<q>On the 7th of March, 1642, was baptized Bernard —, the ſon of — and of — the godfather being Maur Marmion, ſweeper and ſervant in the church; and the godmother, Jane Chevalier, the widow of Peter Thibou.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the counſel for the count and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs de St. Geran had proved that this regiſter was made of the baptiſm of the infant brought to the church by La Pigoreau, it appeared that it could not relate to her youngeſt ſon, Henry, who was born three years before. It muſt therefore belong to ſome other child.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the counſel for the ladies de Ventadour and de Lude endeavoured to prove, that it was the baptiſmal regiſter of one Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, the illegitimate ſon of a dancing-maſter at Paris, whoſe ſubſequent life they pretended to trace.</p>
            <p>The death of Henry Beaulieu, the youngeſt ſon of La Pigoreau, which they apprehended would be proved, and the certainty that proof could be brought of his being born three years before the child in queſtion, were probably the reaſons, that induced them to have recourſe to a new ſubterfuge. And in the courſe of
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:036316_0159_1008D989AC5BBA68"/>
the evidence it appeared, that though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the interment of Henry Beaulieu could not be found, yet that Pigoreau had ſaid to many people (previous to her producing the little count as her own) that her youngeſt ſon was dead. But afterwards, when ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to call this child hers, ſhe deſtroyed every memorial of the age as well as the death of the ſon, whoſe place ſhe aſſigned to the ſtolen child.</p>
            <p>After various appeals, and all the chicane of the French law had been exerted to create delays, which carried on the ſuit till the year 1657, a hearing was again had, which laſted ſeven days. An arret was given by the judge, monſieur de Meſmes, which ordered that the ladies de Ventadour and de Lude ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from being parties in the cauſe, becauſe, during the lives of the count and counteſs de St. Geran, their claim was dormant, and they had no right to diſpute a ſucceſſion which was not yet open—and La Pigoreau was ordered not to leave Paris, on pain of being declared guilty. This arret ſtill left the matter as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided as before. And the ladies de Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadour and de Lude, now acting only through La Pigoreau, directed her to renew the ſuit, by a requiſition to the court, that all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were preſent at the pretended deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the counteſs ſhould be examined. This the court granted; but at the ſame time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that in three days La Pigoreau ſhould
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:036316_0160_1008D9D52A242D70"/>
ſurrender herſelf a priſoner at the Concier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie. This order appeared ſo alarming to La Pigoreau, that after conſidering ſome time, whether it were better to wait the event of the ſuit, which if ſhe gained would make her fortue, but which, if ſhe loſt it, would hazard her life, ſhe determined on the ſafeſt method, and, leaving her patroneſſes to carry it on as well as they could, ſhe fled into Holland, and was no more heard of.</p>
            <p>Her flight was a cruel blow to the intereſts of the ducheſs de Ventadour and the counteſs de Lude; but irritated rather than diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, they continued to ſuſtain the ſuit and the count went into the Bourbonnois, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and bring to Paris all the witneſſes who were thought likely to throw new light on the affair. La Pigoreau was declared contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and there was now every probability of an immediate termination in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>vour of the legitimacy of the young count. While the count de St. Geran was occupied in procuring ſuch teſtimonies as might contribute to this deſirable end, the king, and the queen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in their progreſs from Lyons to Paris, ſtopped at his caſtle. The care of paying properly his duty to them, wholly poſſeſſed him during their ſtay, in which interval he had the ſatisfaction of preſenting his ſon to his ſovereign, under the title of the count de la Palice, and of ſeeing him received as heir to his titles and eſtate. But this was the laſt
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:036316_0161_1008D98B44A1BAE0"/>
pleaſure this unfortunate father enjoyed. The fatigue of the entertainments made for the king, and probably anxiety about his cauſe, which was unavoidably delayed by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the ſeat of juſtice, affected the count's health. A fever ſeized him, which, after an illneſs of eight days, put an end to his life. He carried with him to the grave, the unhappy reflection of not having been able to eſtabliſh his ſon in his inheritance: but in a will made during his illneſs, he ſolemnly adjured the counteſs to perſevere in the proceſs; and named monſieur de la Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere, intendant of the Bourbonnois, and the ſieur Vialet, treaſurer of France, his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to whom he gave the like charge. He died on the 31ſt of January, 1659, giving with his laſt breath his bleſſing to his ſon, and begging of Heaven to reſtore him to the right of his anceſtors.</p>
            <p>The counteſs had no ſooner paid the laſt duties to his remains, and dried the tears of unavailing regret, than ſhe prepared to fulfil his injunctions, with all the anxious zeal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by her tenderneſs for her ſon, added to her ardent deſire of obeying the dying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of her huſband.</p>
            <p>The ducheſs de Ventadour and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs de Lude, were now, by the death of the count de St. Geran, put in ſituations to claim their inheritence, and again to become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the proceedings therefore recommenced,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:036316_0162_1008D9D832E0E318"/>
on both ſides, with infinitely more ardour than before.</p>
            <p>The two ladies left nothing untried, to prove that the ſuppoſed birth of a child to the counteſs de St. Geran, was a fallacy; their counſel particularly inſiſted on the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of her having been delivered without knowing it, and the little likelihood there was that a child of ſuch conſequence could be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the houſe of his parents in the inſtant of his birth. But the counteſs de St. Geran had ſo ſucceſsfully exerted herſelf, and had collected ſuch a body of preſumptive evidence, the ſubſtance of whoſe depoſitions has been already related, that the ducheſs de Ventadour and madame de Lude found, that neither their addreſs or their riches could ſupport them, againſt the force of truth; and though they contrived to lengthen the ſuit for three years longer, final judgment was at laſt given againſt them, to this effect:</p>
            <p>"That, notwithſtanding the letters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which had been granted to Mary de la Guiche, ducheſs dowager of Ventadour, ſiſter by the half blood of Claude de la Guiche, count de St. Geran; and to Eleonore da Bouillé, niece of the ſaid count de St. Geran—they ſhould now deſiſt from any farther claim to his eſtate and effects; and they were forbidden to moleſt or diſturb in his poſſeſſions Bernard de la Guiche, the ſon of the ſaid count, by Suſanna de Longuenay, his wife;
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:036316_0163_1008D98E5F835A30"/>
who was declared his ſole heir, and ordered to aſſume the arms and honours of count de St. Geran.—Mary la Pigoreau, as accomplice in the concealment of the heir, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be hanged, if ſhe could be found; if not, to be hung in effigy, and all her goods confiſcated."</p>
            <p>Thus, after a proceſs of many years, and an immenſe expenſe, the young count ſaw himſelf reſcued from obſcurity, and reſtored to his mother, as well as to his fortune and his rank.</p>
            <p>He married Claudia Frances Magdalane de Varignies, the only daughter of Francis de Montevilla; but had no male heir; this branch therefore of the houſe of De la Guiche became extinct at his death, which happened in his fifty-fifth year.</p>

            <head>MADAME TIQUET.</head>
            <p>MADEMOISEILLE AN GELLICA NICOLA CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIER was the daughter of a bookſeller of Metz; who left her, at the age of fifteen, to the care of an aunt. The fortune he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed amounted to more than a million of livres, which were to be equally divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his daughter and a ſon, who was a few years younger. With this ſum, which in that country, and at that period, ſecured affluence to its poſſeſſor, mademoiſelle Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier would probably have had many lovers; but as, added to this advantage, her perſon was uncommonly beautiful, her admirers were innumerable. To the charms of a very lovely face were joined a figure above the middling height, extremely well formed, and receiving peculiar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſtre from that air of dignity, which commands reſpect, while it inſpires admiration. Nor had nature been laviſh only in adorning her perſon; her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was extremely quick, and of maſculine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

to conſtitute a perfect character; but her's was, unhappily ſo much otherwiſe, that it converted her other qualifications into misfortunes, and was the cauſe of her wretched cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who obſerved her nearly, even during her earlieſt years, ſaw evident ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of that malignant and violent ſpirit, that unbounded appetite for pleaſure, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful and undaunted diſpoſition, which being never checked in her infancy, ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a fatal aſcendancy, and at length ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled all ſentiments of reaſon and humanity. Young, rich, and beautiful as mademoiſelle Carlier was, offers of marriage multiplied around her: among the moſt aſſiduous of her lovers, was monſieur Tiquet, a counſellor of parliament; but as he had nothing in his perſon or addreſs likely to prejudices young woman, in his favour, he was for ſome time coldly received. Deſpairing of being able to make an impreſſion on the niece by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal merit, he determined to ſecure the good offic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

had no claim. She dwelt on the riches and generoſity of this perſevering lover: whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual preſents ſeemed to confirm all ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in his praiſe. But mademoiſelle Carlier ſtill heſitated between him and others of her lovers, whoſe perſons and ages were preferable in her eyes, till a diamond bouquet, preſented by Tiquet, determined the event in his favour: from the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the preſent judging of his riches; and from her aunt's report, of his good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, ſhe, without farther attention either to his real character or fortune, became his wife.</p>
            <p>The two firſt years of this marriage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ſon and a daughter; and madame Tiquet, if not extremely attached to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, lived at leaſt without ſhewing any marked diſlike to him: but ſhe was immerſed in diſſipation; and her expenſes were at length ſo exceſſive, that Tiquet found it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to open to her the real ſtate of his fortune; when, to her inexpreſſible mortification, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a captain in the guards, whoſe perſon and manners were ſuch as formed the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided contraſt to thoſe of the ſieur Tiquet. The uncommon attractions of madame Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet made an immediate and deep impreſſion on this young officer; and when the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the lover were added to his fine figure and ſeducing manners, he became an object before whom the unſubſtantial virtue of madame Tiquet gave way. She was not only ſenſible of a violent paſſion for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>george, but hated her huſband for reſembling him ſo little. And when the barrier was once broken down, ſhe ſcrupled not to give a looſe to the moſt debaſing and ſhameful intrigues. Mongeorge, however, was the object of her real attachment; and ſhe contrived to ſave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in regard to others, with ſo much art, that ſhe continued to be admitted into the beſt companies. As a connexion, ſuch as ſubſiſted between madame Tiquet and Mongeorge, has long found too much indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the diſſolute manners of the French, nobody ſeemed to be much offended at their mutual partiality, but the huſband. The jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of monſieur Tiquet, which did not much ſweeten a temper originally very bad, proved ſo troubleſome to his wife, that ſhe could no longer keep terms of decency with him; her hatred was imbittered ſtill farther on a cloſer inſight into the condition of his fortune, which he was now reluctantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:036316_0168_1008D9E315A590A0"/>
to give her; for his creditors, whoſe number had greatly increaſed by the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive preſents he had made during his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, grew ſo clamorous, that he could not continue to conceal the urgency or extent of their demands. As ſhe was very much alarmed by this derangement, ſo contrary to the expectations with which ſhe had married, ſhe applied to the proper court for a ſeparation of their effects which was granted her, but though ſhe had thus ſecured her fortune from farther depredation, her hatred to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band augmented every day.</p>
            <p>Since ſhe had known Mongeorge, with whom ſhe fancied ſhe ought to have been united, ſhe deteſted her huſband, for having on falſe pretences betrayed her into a marriage, for which ſhe had no inclination, and which had put an eternal barrier between her and the man ſhe loved. Embittered by this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying idea, the jealouſy and ill-humour of her huſband grew inſupportable; and, by continually irritating a temper naturally vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, proud, and malignant, at length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the dreadful reſolution of relieving her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by procuring his death. When ſhe had once formed this, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſign, it appeared every hour more eaſy to execute; and ſhe thought it better to hazard the guilt, and the infamy that muſt attend detection, than to continue to live with a man who made her exiſtence miſerable. It was not long before ſhe found
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:036316_0169_1008D9981111EF20"/>
wretches willing to undertake the execution of her deſign. A man, named Cattelain, one of the loweſt of the people; and another, who was her porter, agreed to aſſaſſinate Tiquet, on his return home through the ſtreets. To theſe ruffians ſhe gave a large ſum of money; and they engaged in the plot others, who laid in wait for the unfortunate Tiquet, as he paſſed near his own door; but though ſeveral ſhots were fired at him he eſcaped unhurt. This diſappointment, and perhaps ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of remorſe, put by the intended aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for that time. Madame Tiquet gave each of her horrid agents other ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as the price of their ſecrecy, telling them that ſhe would now think no more of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her vengeance; and aſſuring them, that the leaſt breach of her confidence would coſt them their lives. Tiquet had probably ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of his wife's evil intentions, and ſaw with miſtruſt and indignation her familiarity with the porter; whom he alſo ſuſpected of letting in Mongeorge of a night: he therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged this favoured ſervant, and took the keys himſelf. Of an evening nobody could enter or quit the houſe, but by applying to him; and when he went out, as he uſually did at night, to ſup with his friends, where he often continued very late, he took the key with him; and on his return to go to bed, he placed it under his bolſter. As madame Tiquet had a ſeparate apartment they never met but

               </gap>ſſed, after the firſt attempt, before madame Tiquet determined on another; but at length ſhe reſolved to try poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for this purpoſe ſhe contrived to mingle ſome very noxious ingredient in a baſon of broth, which was prepared for her huſband; but this being given to his valet-de-chambre to carry to his maſter, the man, either from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he had ſeen, or from the ſmell of the broth, was convinced it was poiſoned; he therefore affected to make a falſe ſtep, and threw down the baſon. Being afraid of remaining in a houſe where ſuch ſcenes were paſſing, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be diſmiſſed, and when he was ſo, repeated every where what had happened.</p>
            <p>Having again failed of her purpoſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Tiquet was obliged to continue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal in her own breaſt the rage and hatred which conſumed her; and it was near three years after her firſt attempt before ſhe reſolved on, or at leaſt found means to execute, the third. But, no longer able to command her inveterate inclination to evil, ſhe had recourſe once more to the diſcarded porter, whom ſhe exhorted to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

company were aſſembled; ſomething ſingular appeared in her behaviour, and one of the party aſked her whence ſhe came, and what was the cauſe of the emotion which was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in her manner?—"I have been," ſaid ſhe, "for two hours in company with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil." "How!" exclaimed madame d'Aunoy, "with the devil! you have been engaged then in a very diſcreditable converſation." "When I ſay with the devil," replied madame Tiquet, "I mean only with a female aſtrologer, who I believe deals with him, for ſhe knows every thing, and can predict future events." "And what has ſhe told you?" enquired madame d'Aunoy. "Nothing but what is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant," returned madame Tiquet; "ſhe has aſſured me, that in two months I ſhall be out of the power of my enemies, and perfectly happy; but you may judge from thence, madam, that her ſcience is not in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome, where madame de Senonville, one
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:036316_0172_1008D9E790E39BC0"/>
of her moſt intimate friends, waited her return. Though the hour now approached which was to conſummate her guilt, and deprive her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of life, ſhe had ſo far conquered her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as to appear to madame de Senonville quite unembarraſſed and chearful. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in converſation till it was very late; for madame de Senonville, willing to pique and incommode Tiquet, intended to ſtay till he ſhould be come home, and gone to bed, that ſhe might oblige him to get up again to let her out at the ſtreet-door, which he would ſuffer nobody but himſelf to unlock. Tiquet ſupped that night with madame de Villemur, whoſe houſe was near his own: he ſtaid there, as was his cuſtom, very late, when about the uſual hour of his return home, his ſervants, who were waiting for him, to come in and go to bed, heard ſeveral reports of fire-arms in the ſtreet; they ran out, and found their maſter wounded and bleeding on the ground; they took him up with an intention of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into his houſe, but he had ſtrength enough to refuſe going thither, and directed them to take him to the houſe of madame de Villemur, which he had juſt left. As ſoon as madame Tiquet knew where he was, ſhe went thither; but he ordered the people about him to prevent her entering the room he was in, and to oblige her to return home. Surgeons were ſent for to examine his wounds; they found he had received three; but none
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:036316_0173_1008D99D43E9B198"/>
of them were mortal, though one was very near the heart, ſo near, that the ſurgeons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it muſt inevitably have been ſtruck, if the fear which had ſeized him on the firſt fire had not cauſed his heart to contract itſelf;—how far this is founded on poſſibility, the ſkilful in the formation of the human body only can judge.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the news of this aſſaſſination reached the police, the commiſſary of that quarter of the town attended monſieur Tiquet, to collect information: he enquired of him whom he thought likely to have thus attempted his life?—who were his enemies? "I have no enemies," anſwered Tiquet, "but my wife." Though madame Tiquet was apprized of this anſwer, and of the ſuſpicions that were univerſally entertained of her guilt, ſhe had by this time acquired ſo perfect a command over herſelf, that ſhe appeared with all the ſerenity that conſcious innocence could have given her. As Tiquet was in no danger, ſhe did not affect to confine herſelf to her houſe on his account, but went out as uſual; and the very next evening waited again on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs d'Aunoy. The converſation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who were there turned naturally on the event of the preceding evening.—Madame d'Aunoy aſked, "if mr. Tiquet could not poſſibly gueſs at thoſe who had attempted his life?"—"Ah! madame," anſwered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Tiquet, "if he <hi>could,</hi> he would not
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:036316_0174_1008D9EC0C1F7848"/>
name them. You cannot be ignorant that he throws the odium on me, and wiſhes it to be believed!—It is <hi>I,</hi> who am in my turn aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated" This ſhe uttered with the utmoſt compoſure, though ſhe could not but read in the look of the company, that they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her huſband was right; and madame d'Aunoy ſaid to her, that the porter ought to he ſecured. The opinion of her guilt now ſo univerſally prevailed, that it was determined to arreſt her; on her return home, notice was given her that ſhe would be committed to priſon, and, ſhe was adviſed to ſave herſelf by ſlight; but, relying on the ſteadineſs of her agents, whom yet ſhe thought, were not known, and believing her reſolute and calm behaviour would convince the world of her innocence, ſhe refuſed to liſten to this advice. The ſame notice and the ſame remonſtrance was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by ſeveral perſons who were attached to her, for ſeven or eight days, but ſhe continued ſtill to believe herſelf in no danger. On the eighth day a theatin monk came haſtily into her room, and proteſted to her, that ſhe would be loſt irrecoverably, if ſhe did not inſtantly diſguiſe herſelf, and fly: He brought her a woollen robe like his own, and beſought her to put it on, and go down into the court, where the ſedan chair which had conveyed him waited, and the men had orders to carry the chair to a particular place, where ſhe would find a chaiſe and paſt-horſes, with perſons who might be depended upon, to conduct her
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:036316_0175_1008D9A031038410"/>
to Calais; from whence ſhe might get an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate paſſage to England. The infatuated woman ſtill refuſed: ſhe told the theatin, that, it was for the guilty to fly, and not for her, Who was conſcious of her own innocence; that ſhe knew her huſband was the author of the infamous calumny which accuſed her of the attempt againſt him; and that he was even pleaſed with an, event, by which he hoped to frighten her away, in order to ſeize on her fortune; but ſhe was determined, to diſappoint him, by not leaving her houſe, be the conſequence as it might. She thanked and diſmiſſed the theatin, and reſolutely awaited the arrival of the officers of juſtice, truſting to the meaſures ſhe had taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the diſcovery of the ſecond attempt; and having long ſince loſt all apprehenſions of the conſequences of the firſt.</p>
            <p>The next day after her refuſal of the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's aſſiſtance, madame de Senonville, her friend, came to ſee her, and when ſhe was about to take her leave, madams Tiquet ſaid to her, "I beg you will ſtay a little longer with me; I expect to be arreſted and carried to priſon every moment, and I wiſh not be alone when it happens."

The king appeared inexorable; and Tiquet, finding his application for her life not likely to avail, then aſked his majeſty to grant to him the fortune which was confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;

            <p>The brother of madame Tiquet, who was an officer in the guards, and the chevalier Mongeorge, made every poſſible attempt to ſave her: the brother applied to perſons of high rank, and engaged them to intercede for his ſiſter; Mongeorge was equally earneſt with his friends, and they ſolicited his majeſty ſo warmly, that his reſolution ſeemed to give way; and he would perhaps have granted the life of madame Tiquet, under certain condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had not the archbiſhop of Paris inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: he repreſented to the king, that the ears of the grand penitentiary of Paris were continually ſhocked with the confeſſions, of women, who acknowledged their having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the lives of their huſbands; and that, to put a ſtop to ſuch enormities, which had lately encreaſed to an aſtoniſhing degree, it was abſolutely neceſſary to make an example of madame Tiquet. In conſequence of this remonſtrance, ſhe was ordered for execution. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

On the day fixed for her execution, the lieutenant criminal ſent guards to fetch her to the chamber, where ſhe was to undergo the queſtion; ſhe was even then ignorant of what was decided, and as ſhe went, aſked if her buſineſs was never to be concluded? Being brought, however, into the preſence of the lieutenant criminal, he read the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No ſymptoms of fear or concern ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, not even the ſlighted change of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. The lieutenant criminal then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to awaken her ſenſibility, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, in the darkeſt colours, the horrors of that abyſs of infamy and diſgrace into which ſhe was fallen.

As the cart went on, ſhe addreſſed herſelf to the porter, and deſired his forgiveneſs, for having been the means of bringing him to an ignominious death: the man, in his turn, beſought her to pardon him, for having by his confeſſion contributed to her condemnation: they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed forgiveneſs, and mutually beſought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Mongeorge thanked his majeſty for his goodneſs, and took that opportunity of ſoliciting leave of abſence for eight months, which he obtained; and employed the time in travelling to other countries, in hopes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipating that uneaſineſs and regret, which he found he ſhould be unable to conquer, while he remained in thoſe ſcenes which had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed his long attachment to madame Tiquet.</p>

            <p>THE count of Montgomery rented part of an hotel in the Rüe Royale, at Paris. The ground floor and firſt floor were occupied by him; the ſecond and third by the ſieur d'Anglade. The count and counteſs de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery had an eſtabliſhment ſuitable to their rank; they kept an almoner, and ſeveral male and female ſervants, and their horſes and equipage were numerous in proportion." Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurd' Anglade (who was a gentleman, though of inferior rank to the count) and his wife lived with leſs ſplendor, but yet with elegance and decency ſuitable to their ſituation in life. They had a carriage, and were admitted into the beſt companies, where probably d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glade increaſed his income by play; but, on the ſtricteſt enquiry, it did not appear that any diſhonourable actions could be imputed to him. The count and counteſs de Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery lived on a footing of neighbourly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility with monſieur and madame d'Anglade; and, without being very intimate, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:036316_0185_1008D9AF76DA4838"/>
ways on friendly terms. Some time in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1687, the count and counteſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed paſſing a few days at Villebouſin, one of their country houſes: they informed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur and madame d'Anglade of their deſign, and invited them to be of the party. They accepted it; but the evening before they were to go, they for ſome reaſon or other (probably becauſe madame d'Anglade was not very well begged leave to decline the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the count and counteſs ſet out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; leaving in their lodgings one of the counteſs's women, four girls whom ſhe employed to work for her in embroidery, and a boy who was kept to help the footman. They took with them the prieſt, Francis Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, who was their almoner, and all their other ſervants.</p>
            <p>The count pretended that a ſtrange preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Certain it is, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſtaying till Thurſday, as they propoſed, they came back on Wedneſday evening. On their coming to their hotel a few moments before their ſervants (who followed them on horſeback), they obſerved that the door of a room on the ground floor, where their men-ſervants ſlep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to his lodging about eleven o'clock; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him two friends, with whom he had ſupped at the preſident Roberts's.

In purſuance, however, of their deſire to have their rooms ſearched, he followed them thither, and looked nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into their drawers, cloſets, and boxes; unmade the beds, and ſearched the matraſſes and the paillaſſes.<note n="*" place="bottom">Straw, cloſely ſtuffed into a coarſe cloth, in form of a bed, which is placed under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In looking into an old trunk, filled with clothes, remnants and parchments, he found a rouleau of ſeventy louis d'ors au cordon, wrapt in a printed paper, which printed paper was a genealogical table, which the count ſaid was his.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to have been the circumſtance which ſo far confirmed the before groundleſs and ſlight ſuſpicions of the lieutenant of the

He declared, however, that he had no doubt but that monſieur and madame d'Anglade had robbed him; and ſaid that he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the honeſty of all his own people; and that on this occaſion he could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that the ſieur Grimaudet, who had before occupied this hotel, which monſieur d'Anglade had inhabited at the ſame time, had loſt a valuable, piece of plate. It was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the count ſaid, very probable that d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glade had been guilty of both the robberies, which had happened in the ſame place while he inhabited it.</p>
            <p>On this rouſeau of ſeventy louis d'ors, the lieutenant of the police ſeized.

Madame d'Anglade deſired the officer of the police to remark, that the door of this apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been left open, and that the valet de chambre, probably knew why; of whom therefore enquiry ſhould be made. Nothing was more natural than this obſervation, yet to minds already prepoſſeſſed with an opinion of the guilt of Anglade and his wife, this remark ſeemed to confirm it; when in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this room, where the wall formed a little receſs, five of the ſacke were diſcovered, which the count had loſt; in each of which was a thouſand livres; and a ſixth, from which upwards of two hundred had been taken. After this, no farther enquiry was made, nor any of the ſervants examined, The guilt of monſieur and madame d'Anglade was aſcertained, in the opinion of the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the police and the court, do Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery: and on no ſtronger grounds than the circumſtance of finding the ſeventy louis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſhould be admitted to ſpeak to them. The proſecution now commenced, and the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the police, who had committed the unhappy man, was to be his judge. D'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glade appealed, and attempted to inſtitute a ſuit againſt him, and make him a party, in order to prevent his being competent to give judgment; but this attempt failed, and ſerved only to add perſonal animoſity to the prejudice this officer had before taken up againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glade. Witneſſes were examined; but, far from their being heard with impartiality, their evidence was twiſted to the purpoſes of thoſe, who deſired to prove guilty the man they were determined to believe ſo. The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, Francis Gagnard, who was the really guilty perſon, was among thoſe whoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was now, admitted againſt Anglade; and this wretch had effrontery enough to conceal the emotions of his ſoul, and to perform a maſs, which the count ordered to be ſaid at St. Eſprit, for the diſcovery of the culprits.</p>
            <p>The lieutenant of the police, elate with his triumph over the miſerable priſoner, puſhed on the proſecution with all the avidity which malice and revenge could inſpire, in a vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpirit. In ſpite, however, of all he could do, the proofs againſt d'Anglade were ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, therefore he determined to have him put to the torture, in hopes of bringing him to confeſs the crime. Anglade appealed, but
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:036316_0191_1008D9B805A0CFA8"/>
the parliament confirmed the order, and the poor man underwent the queſtion ordinary and extraordinary; when notwithſtanding his acute ſufferings, he continued firmly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt his innocence; till covered with wounds, his limbs diſlocated, and his mind enduring yet more than his body, he was carried back to his dungeon. Diſgrace and ruin overwhelmed him; his fortune and effects were ſold for leſs than a tenth of their value, as is always the caſe where law preſſes with its iron hand; his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was blaſted, his health was ruined. Not naturally robuſt, and always accuſtomed not only to the comforts, but the elegancies of life, a long confinement in a noiſome and unwholeſome dungeon had reduced him to the loweſt ſtate of weakneſs. In ſuch a ſituation he was dragged forth to torture, and then plunged again into the damp and dark cavern from whence he came—without food, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, or aſſiſtance of any kind; though it is uſual for thoſe who ſuffer the torture to have medicinal help and refreſhment after it. This exceſs of ſeverity could be imputed only to the malignant influence of the officer of juſtice, in whoſe power he now was.</p>
            <p>From the ſame influence it happened, that though the ſieur Anglade, amidſt the moſt dreadful pains, had ſteadily proteſted his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence—and though the evidence againſt him was extremely defective—ſentence was given to this effect:—That Anglade ſhould be
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:036316_0192_1008DA099B0C4930"/>
condemned to ſerve in the gallies for nine years; that his wife ſhould, for the like term, be baniſhed from Paris, and its juriſdiction; that they ſhould pay three thouſand livres, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the count d'Montgomery as da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and make reſtitution of twenty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and ſeventy-three livres, and either return the pearl necklace or pay four thouſand livres more. From this ſum the five thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty livres, found in the ſacks in the ſervants' room, were to be deducted, together with the ſeventy louis d'ors found in the box, of which the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of juſtice had taken poſſeſſion, and alſo a double Spaniſh piſtole, and ſeventeen louis d'ors, found on the perſon of Anglade, which was his own money.</p>
            <p>Severe as this ſentence was, and founded on ſuch ſlight preſumption, it was put imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into execution. Anglade whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was already ſinking under the heavy preſſure of his misfortunes, whoſe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mbs were contracted by the dampneſs of his priſon, and who had undergone the moſt excruciating tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, was ſent to the tower of Montgomery, there to remain, without aſſiſtance or conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till the convicts condemned to the gallies were ready to go. He was then chained with them; a ſituation how dreadful! for a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe ſenſibility of mind was extreme, and who had never ſuffered the leaſt hardſhip or difficulty till then; when her was plunged
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:036316_0193_1008D9BB1AEFEB78"/>
at once into the loweſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſs of miſery, chained among felons, and condemned to the moſt hopeleſs confinement and the ſevereſt labour, without any ſupport, but what he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the pity of thoſe who ſaw him; for of his own he had now nothing! Yet, dreadful as theſe evils were, he ſupported them with that patient firmneſs which nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious innocence could have produced. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the extreme of human wretchedneſs, he felt not for himſelf; but when he reflected on the ſituation of his wife, and his infant daughter, his fortitude forſook him. A fever had, from his firſt confinement, preyed on his frame; its progreſs grew more rapid, and he felt his death inevitable; when the galley-ſlaves were collected to depart, he beſought leave to ſee his wife, and to give his laſt bleſſing to his child—but it was denied him!—He ſubmitted, and prepared to go; but being too weak to ſtand, he was put into a waggon, whence he was lifted of a night, when they ſtopped, and laid on ſtraw, in a barn or out-houſe, and the next morning car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried again between two men to the waggon to continue his journey. In this manner, and believing every hour would be his laſt, the unhappy man arrived at Marſeiles. It was aſſerted, but for the honour of human nature ſhould not be believed, that the count de Montgomery preſſed his departure, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the deplorable condition he was in,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:036316_0194_1008DA0F5F76D328"/>
and even waited on the road to ſee him paſs, and enjoy the horrid ſpectacle of his ſufferings. The unhappy wife of this injured man had not been treated with more humanity. She had been dragged to priſon, ſeparate from that of her huſband, and confined in a dungeon. She was with child, and the terror ſhe had undergone occaſioned her to miſcarry. Long fainting fits ſucceeded; and ſhe had no help but that of her little girl, who, young as ſhe was, endeavoured to recal her dying mother by bathing her temples; and by making her ſmell to bread dipt in wine. But as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved every fainting fit would be her laſt, ſhe implored the jailor to allow her a confeſſor: after much delay he ſent one; and by his means the poor woman received ſuccour and ſuſtenance: but while ſhe ſlowly gathered ſtrength, her little girl grew ill. The noiſome damps, the want of proper food, and of freſh air, overcame, the tender name of the poor child; and then it was that the diſtraction and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of the mother was at its height. In the middle of a rigorous winter they were in a cavern, where no air could enter, and where the damps only lined the wall; a little char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal in an earthen pot, was all the fire they had; and the ſmoke was ſo offenſive and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that it increaſed rather than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their ſufferings. In this diſmal place the mother ſaw her child ſinking under a diſeaſe, for which ſhe had no remedies.
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:036316_0195_1008D9BEE3351B78"/>
Cold ſweats accompanied it, and ſhe had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clean linen for her, or fire to warm her; and, as even their food depended on charity, and they were not allowed to ſee any body, they had no relief but what the prieſt from time to time procured them. At length; and as a great favour, they were removed to a place leſs damp, to which there was a little window; but the window was ſtopped, and the fumes in the charcoal were as noxious here as in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern they had left. Here they remained, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (providence having prolonged their lives) for four or five months.—Monſieur d'Anglade, not being in a condition to be chained to the oar, was ſent to the hoſpital of the convicts of Marſeilles; his diſeaſe ſtill preyed on the poor remains of a ruined conſtitution, but his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were lengthened out beyond what his weakneſs ſeemed to promiſe.

to God, who had, he ſaid, lent him fortitude to endure the ſufferings he had not deſerved: and then, after having received the euchariſt with piety and compoſure, he expired; a martyr to unjuſt ſuſpicion, and haſty or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious judgment.</p>
            <p>He had been dead only a few weeks, when ſeveral perſons, who had known him, received anonymous letters: the letters ſignified, that the perſon who wrote them, was on the point of hiding himſelf in a convent for the reſt of his life; but before he did ſo, his conſcience obliged him to inform whom it might concern, that the ſieur Anglade was innocent of the robbery committed in the apartments of the count de Montgomery; that the perpetrators were one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

It was found that Beleſtre was a conſummate villain, who had in the early part of his life been engaged in an aſſaſſination, for which he was obliged to fly from his native place; that he had been a ſoldier, had killed his ſerjeant in a quarrel, and deſerted; then returning to his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, had been a wandering vagabond, going by different names, and practiſing every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of roguery; that he had ſometimes been a beggar, and ſometimes a bully, about the ſtreets of Paris, but always much acquainted and connected with Gagnard, his countryman: and that ſuddenly, from the loweſt indigence, he had appeared to be in affluence; had bought himſelf rich clothes, had ſhewn various ſums of money, and had purchaſed an eſtate near Mans, for which he had paid between nine and ten thouſand livres.</p>
            <p>Gagnard, who was the ſon of the goaler of Mans, had come to Paris without either clothes or money, and had ſubſiſted on charity, or by ſaying maſſes at St. Eſprit, by which he hardly gained enough to keep him alive; when the count de Montgomery took him.

Late as it was, juſtice was now ready to overtake them, and the hand of Providence itſelf ſeemed to aſiſſt. Gagnard being in a tavern, in the ſtreet St. André des Ares, was preſent at a quarrel wherein a man was killed; he was ſent to priſon, with the reſt of the people in the houſe; and about the ſame time, a man who had been robbed and cheated by Beleſtre near three years before, met him, watched him to his lodgings, and put him into the hands of the marechauſſee. Theſe two wretches being thus in the hands of juſtice, for other crimes, underwent an examination relative to the robbery of the count de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery: they betrayed themſelves by incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent anſwers.

Much other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the ſame kind he repeated.—And de la Comble depoſed, that Beleſtre had ſhewn her great ſums of money, and a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful pearl necklace; and when ſhe aſked him where he got all this? he anſwered, that he won it at play. Theſe and many other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances related by this woman, confirmed his guilt beyond a doubt.

            <head>THE PRETENDED MARTIN GUERRE.</head>
            <p>NOTHING is more aſtoniſhing than the infinite variety of the human face, in which there is ſuch a prodigious difference of complexion and features; and where a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of expreſſion is almoſt always obſerved, even in thoſe whoſe features and complexion are very much alike. Lopez de Vega ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſays, that nature, ſometimes weary of varying her works, copies herſelf and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces two perſons perfectly reſembling each other. Such muſt have been the ſimilitude between the two men who are the ſubjects of the following detail. Hiſtory mentions ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral celebrated impoſtors, who, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a likeneſs to ſome other perſon, have uſurped their ſtations or their fortunes: but there is perhaps no inſtance of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture ſo long and ſo ſucceſsfully carried on, as that which is here related.</p>
            <p>Martin Guerre was born in Biſcaye, of parents who were ſomewhat above the rank of peaſants, and who appear to have
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:036316_0203_1008DA5E753EEF88"/>
ſupported themſelves by the cultivation of their own land. It is probable, that in that part of Europe very early marriages are uſual among all ranks of people; ſince this man, then only eleven years old, was (in 1539) married to Bertrande de Rols, nearly of the ſame age as himſelf. For nine or ten years they were without children; at length about the end of that period, they had a ſon born, who was called Sunſei; and ſoon after, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Guerre having given ſome offence to his father, abſented himſelf from home to avoid his diſpleaſure. And whether he found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected pleaſure in the variety afforded by the wandering life he embraced, or whether he had conceived any diſguſt at ſome part of his wife's conduct, or was ſatiated with her ſociety; from whatever cauſe it was, he continued the travel from place to place, and for ſome years his family knew not what was become of him.</p>
            <p>Though is has often happened that a wife (eſpecially if young and handſome, as was Bertrande de Rols at that time) has thought that ſuch neglect and deſertion on the part of her huſband, has juſtified her forming other attachments; it does not appear that any charge of that nature was made againſt Bertrande de Rols: nor, for ſome years after her huſband left her, did the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion of infidelity, or even indiſcretion, ariſe againſt her. At length a man appeared perſonating
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:036316_0204_1008DA189186B990"/>
her abſent huſband, and in face, and figure ſo nearly reſembling him, that the four ſiſters of Martin Guerre immediately acknowledged him to be their brother; Pierre Guerre, the uncle of Martin, as his nephew; and, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the relations on both ſides believed that it was himſelf. Beſides the very ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, he made himſelf known to Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trande de Rols by the relation of particulars known only to her and Martin Guerre her huſband; and even enquired for certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of clothes, which he ſaid he had on his departure depoſited in places where they were found: circumſtances thaf probably diſſipated any doubt which might have ariſen in the mind of Bertrande de Rols. Be that however as it might, ſhe received him as her huſbands, and as ſuch he continued to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>id her near three years, during which time ſhe had two children by him, one of which died ſoon after its birth. He alſo in this period ſold, as Martim Guerre, ſeveral parcels of land belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. No mention being made of the parents of Martin Guerre, after he leſs his home, it is probable they died while he was abſent. Though the impoſtor had thoroughly ſtudied his part it ſeems almoſt incredible that Bertrande de Rols ſhould have been deceived.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who thought ill of her, affirmed, that ſhe was too much attached to the impoſtor to wiſh the deception detected; and that ſhe willingly ſhut her eyes againſt conviction.
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:036316_0205_1008DA615EBD7220"/>
But as ſhe ſeems to have been of a timid tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and perhaps of a weak underſtanding it is, not impoſſible that ſhe might at firſt have been impoſed upon by the ſtrong reſemblance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he impoſtor bore to her huſband, and by the knowledge he had of the moſt ſecret tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the life of Martin Guerre, and that afterwards, when doubts aroſe in her mind, ſhe might fear to enquire into the truth, till forced to do ſo by the relations of her real huſband. Theſe relations, particularly his uncle Pierre Guerre, pretended, after above two years, to diſcover, that the man who had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them as Martin Guerre, was an impoſtor, and they inſiſted on Bertrande de Rols joining in a proſecution of him with whom ſhe now lived as her huſband. That timidity of ſpirit, which had probably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her own ſuſpicions of his identity from appearing, made her now give way, with equal facility, to the impetuous reſentment of the family. She therefore agreed to appoint Pierre Guerre to act in her behalf, and to lay before the ſeat of juſtice her complaint againſt the man who had uſurped the name, rights, and effects of Martin Guerre, her huſband.</p>
            <p>This man, brought before the judges of Rieux, lamented the unequalled hardſhip of his deſtiny. He ſaid, that the ſuit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced againſt him, by which it was intended to rob him of his property and his life, was
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:036316_0206_1008DA1B2D56A4C8"/>
ſet on foot at the inſtigation and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of Pierre Guerre his uncle, and two of his ſons-in-law, who, in hopes of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to manage his patrimony, which amounted to ſeven or eight thouſand livres, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on his wife to engage in the wicked ſcheme of making him believed to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor. He then entered into a detail of what had happened to him ſince he abſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He ſaid he had carried arms ſome years for the king of France, his ſovereign; after which he went into the Spaniſh army; till eagerly wiſhing to ſee his wife, his child, and his friends, he had determined to come home; where, on his arrival, he was immediately acknowledged by the very man, Pierre Guerre, who was now ſo forward in proſecuting him, through he muſt neceſſarily have been much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſince he went away, an almoſt beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs youth; having been expoſed to much hardſhip and change of climate, which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the effect of time, muſt have made a conſiderable difference in his face and perſon. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> alleged that Pierre Guerre had for ſome time purſued him with the crueleſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, for no other reaſon but becauſe he had inſiſted on his (Pierre Guerre) delivering a fair account of the adminiſtration of his farm and effect during his abſence, which he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unable or unwilling to do. That, as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of his malignity, he could bring wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who ſaw him (Piere Guerre) not
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:036316_0207_1008DA66098410D0"/>
long before, ſtrike his nephew, Martin Guerre, to the ground with an iron bar; with which he would have repeated his blow, and probably have killed him, if his wife, by throwing herſelf between them, had not ſhielded him from his fury.—He demanded to be confronted with his wife, who would, he ſaid, be found incapable of ſtifling the truth, in the abſence of thoſe who had influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced her weak mind to join in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. He deſired that his uncle, Pierre Guerre, and his other accuſers, ſhould be prevented from having acceſs to her, that ſhe might not have her underſtanding perverted, by the arts of thoſe, who had ſo evident an intereſt in his deſtruction.</p>
            <p>He then underwent an examination, in which, to all the queſtions put to him, on the life and connections of Martin Guerre, he anſwered moſt exactly. The time and place of his birth; the moſt particular events, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to his father, mother, brothers, ſiſter and all others of his family; the year and day on which he was married to Bertrande de Rols, whoſe relations he deſcribed with equal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. He named the perſons who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at his marriage, and the clothes they wore, the prieſt who married them, and an infinite number of trifling circumſtances, all of which were found to be true. He ſpoke alſo of the birth and baptiſm of Sanxi Guerre, the ſon of Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Guerre; why he quitted
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:036316_0208_1008DA1CF2D11438"/>
his habitation, who he met on the way, and the diſcourſe he held with ſeveral perſons whom he named. He gave an account of the cities through which he had paſſed, in France and Spain, and the perſons with whom he had reſided and converſed in both kingdoms. And, to remove every doubt of his veracity, he named perſons, to whom reference might be had, who would confirm all he had aſſerted; and, when theſe people were applied to, they actually did confirm all he had advanced.</p>
            <p>Bertrande de Rols was next examined. Her anſwers agreed perfectly with thoſe of her ſuppoſed huſband, in all the circumſtances wherein they were mutually concerned; and of an hundred and fifty witneneſſes, who were afterwards queſtioned, near ſorty ſwore, that the man now impriſoned on ſuppoſition of having uſurped the name and ſtation of Martin Guerre, was actually Martin Guerre himſelf, and that they knew him to be the ſame with whom they had been acquainted from their infancy, not only by the general ſimilitude of his perſon now, to what it was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, but alſo by certain ſcars and marks which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired when a child, and which time had not effaced.</p>
            <p>Other witneſſes being called, on behalf of the proſecutors, ſwore as poſitively, that the man whom they now ſaw, and who had ſo long paſſed for Martin Guerre, was one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud du Tilk, commonly called Panſette, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:036316_0209_1008DA68C947F618"/>
of Sagias, whom they had known from his cradle.</p>
            <p>Sixty other witneſſes, on being ſhewn the priſoner, declared that they dated not decide, whether he was Martin Guerre or no, ſo very ſtrong was the reſemblance.</p>
            <p>The accuſed obtained an order from the court, that Bertrande de Rols ſhould be kept a part from Pierre Guerre and his aſſociates. But at the ſame time the judges named a commiſſion to go to Artiques, the place of Martin Guerre's reſidence, and to Sagias, the place from whence Arnaud du Tilk was ſaid to come; that all particulars might be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected relative to them both, which might throw light on ſo myſterious an affair.</p>
            <p>They directed alſo, that the accuſed ſhould be compared with Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xi Guerre, the ſon; and with the four ſiſters of Martin Guerre. The reſult was, that Sanxi did not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him; but the likeneſs between him and the four women was ſtriking and indſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. This appeared a ſtrong circumſtance in his favour;—a child as often reſembles his mother as his father; and at that early period of life, the features are ſometimes ſo little formed, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o give no decided likeneſs to any part of a family: whereas the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between the priſoner and the four ſiſters of Martin Guerre, who were women nearly of the ſame age, and ſuppoſed to be
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:036316_0210_1008DA201CD4EBA0"/>
born of the ſame parents, ſeemed a convincing proof of his identity.</p>
            <p>But after examining many other witneſſes, and inveſtigating numberleſs proofs, the judges decided, that the priſoner was not Martin Guerre, but Arnaud du Tilk of Sagias; and he was accordingly condemned.</p>
            <p>He appealed againſt this ſentence to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Toulouſe; and that court thought it neceſſary more fully to inveſtigate an affair ſo full of difficulty and obſcurity. The party calling himſelf Martin Guerre was ſummoned to appear, with Bertrande de Rols, and his other accuſers. The man maintained ſo ſteady a countenance, and anſwered in a manner ſo unembarraſſed and ingenuous, that the judges began to believe he was the real Martin Guerre; and the more ſo, as they ſaw in the deportment of Pierre Guerre the uncle, and Bertrande de Rols, a confuſion and heſitation, which they imputed to the conſciouſneſs of their guilt.</p>
            <p>Directions were given for a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to renew all the enquiries, and to hear the witneſſes again.</p>
            <p>But this renewed inveſtigation, inſtead of unveiling the myſtery, ſerved only to wrap it in ten-fold obſcurity. Of thirty witneſſes who were now heard for the ſecond time, nine or ten declared that the priſoner was Martin Guerre, whom they had long known; eight as poſitively declared he was Arnaud
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:036316_0211_1008DA6A6B0C2FF8"/>
du Tilk; and the reſt, after having long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated, proteſted, that they could not charge their conſciences with an oath, in a matter wherein, from the extreme reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between Martin Guerre and Arnaud du Tilk, they were unable to pronounce po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively to their ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>On collecting the whole evidence brought by the accuſers, againſt the priſoner, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that, in the whole, the depoſition of forty-five witneſſes went to prove that he was Arnaud du Tilk, and among them ſome had deſervedly great weight. The firſt was Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reau, uncle by the mother's ſide to Arnaud du Tilk, who acknowledged him to be his nephew, and ſeeing him a priſoner, wept bitterly, and deplored the unhappy deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of a perſon ſo nearly allied to him.—The ſhoemaker who made ſhoes for Martin Guerre, ſwore that the meaſure of his foot was of twelve inches, and that of the priſoner was only nine. Another perſon depoſed that Martin Guerre underſtood the ſcience of defence, of which the priſoner was ignorant,—Almoſt all the witneſſes who affirmed that the priſoner was an impoſtor, agreed in deſcribing the true Martin Guerre to be taller, and of a darker complexion; his body and legs thinner; that be ſtooped, carried his head low, and had a round back; that his noſe was large and ſomewhat flat, his chin ſharp and turned up in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ddle, and that
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:036316_0212_1008DA2498594E90"/>
his under lip <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ung down. Arnaud du Tilk, which they ſaid was the true name of the man before them, was ſhorter and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>outer; not ſo flat-noſed, or round-backed: but they owned, that the ſcars and marks he had upon him, were exactly the ſame as thoſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered on Martin Guerre.—Jean Eſpagnol, who kept a public-houſe at—, depoſed poſitively, that the priſoner diſcovered himſelf to him, and deſired he would not mention the ſecret he truſted him with, which was, that Martin Guerre had given him all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.—Valentine—depoſed, that he met Arnaud du Tilk, the priſoner, who finding himſelf known, deſired the deponent not to betray him; and gave him, at the ſame time, two handkerchiefs to be delivered to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther John du Tilk.—Two other witneſſes ſaid, that a ſoldier of Rochefort paſſing through Artiques, was ſurprized to find the priſoner then living there as Martin Guerre, and loudly aſſerted, that he knew Martin Guerre well, who was actually in Flanders, where he had been obliged to replace with a wooden leg, the leg he had loſt at the battle of St. Laurent, before St. Quintin. It was alſo remarked, that Martin Guerre, being a native of Biſcaye, ſpoke the Baſque, which differs very materially from the French and Gaſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> languages; whereas the priſoner knew only a few words of it, which he often unnceeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily introduced into his diſcourſe to conceal
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:036316_0213_1008DA6D50029648"/>
his general ignorance of what he would be thought to underſtand.—Several witneſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that Arnaud du Tilk, had, from his earlieſt years, been abandoned to every kind of vice; that he was an atheiſt, a blaſphemer, and guilty of fraud and theft; whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that he was capable of committing the crime he was now charged with.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength, however, of this body of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeemed very much diminiſhed by what followed, in favour of his being the perſon whoſe name he aſſumed.</p>
            <p>Upwards of thirty perſons, who had known Martin Guerre from his infancy, declared that the priſoner was the man. Among theſe witneſſes, thoſe whoſe depoſitions ſeemed the moſt convincing, were the four ſiſters of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Guerre; and the huſbands of the two who were married corroborated their evidence. Other perſons, who had been preſent at the marriage ceremony between Martin Guerre and Bertrande de Rols, depoſed, that this was the ſame perſon who was then married. As proofs of his identity, they ſwore to ſeveral marks about his perſon, which on examination, were all found on the perſon of the priſoner.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed to be generally acknowledged, that when the priſoner arrived at Artiques, he ſpoke to every one he met, who knew Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Guerre, calling them by their names. That ſome of theſe, not immediately recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting him, he told them he was their old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:036316_0214_1008DA2740902A40"/>
Martin Guerre, and reminded them of converſations and events that had formerly happened, and of places where they had been, and parties made in his company, twelve, fourteen, or twenry years back. And to Bertrande de Rols he mentioned ſeveral circumſtances, which could be known only to her and Martin Guerre her huſband.</p>
            <p>Other depoſitions went to prove, that Pierre Guerre, the uncle, had declared hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> reſolution to ruin the priſoner at all events; and had endeavoured to make his whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily enter into a combination to gratify his revenge. To procure money to carry on the ſuit, he had applied to one Jean Loze of Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>os, who had refuſed to advance it, ſaying, he would not contribute to the ruin of his relation. They added, that it was generally believed at Artiques, that Bertrande de Rols was terrified into joining in this proſecution, by the threats of Pierre Guerre, and of her mother, who was now the wife of Pierre Guerre; and that ſhe did not willingly carry it on; believing that the priſoner was really her huſband. The depoſitions of the four ſiſters of Martin Guerre, and their great reſemblance to the priſoner, was a ſtrong circumſtance in his favour. Thoſe who ſaw them together affirmed, that a more ſtriking likeneſs was impoſſible; they had the ſame features, complexion, and caſt of countenance.</p>
            <p>When, in the courſe of the examinations,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:036316_0215_1008DA7015B7FB78"/>
the priſoner was confronted with Bertrande de Rols, he conjured her, by all that was ſacred, to a knowledge the truth; he told her that his fate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>epended upon her, and that he was content it ſhould do ſo; ſince if ſhe with a ſafe conſcienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> could ſwear, that he was not Martin Guerre her huſband, he would conſent to undergo the moſt cruel puniſhment. To this ſhe anſwered, that ſhe neither would ſwear or believe that he was not Martin Guerre. It was acknowledged, that before ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluced, by the threats of Pierre Guerre, and her mother, to inſtitute a ſuit againſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, ſhe had lived with him above three years without ever appearing to doubt of his being really Martin Guerre, her huſband; and, when doubts aroſe with others, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed herſelf with great aſperity againſt thoſe who mentioned thoſe doubts before her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſurely ſhe muſt know her huſband, better than any one elſe could; that ſhe would puniſh thoſe who dared to propagate ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous a falſehood.</p>
            <p>It alſo appeared, that ſhe had often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the tyranny of Pierre Guerre and her mother, who had, ſhe ſaid, forced her, againſt her inclinations, to enter into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt the priſoner, and had threatened, if ſhe did not, to turn her out of the houſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="216" facs="unknown:036316_0216_1008DA28CA951B40"/>
accuſed the priſoner of a crime, for which he had been impriſoned; and, while he was ſo, that Pierre Guerre and his wife (the mother of Bertrande de Rols) inceſſantly beſieged her to conſent to proſecute him for pretending to be Martin Guerre, which ſhe then refuſed; and when, after ſome time, he was releaſed from priſon, on the charge, which Jean d'Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornebeuf had brought againſt him, being found falſe, Bertrande de Rols received him with every demonſtration of affection; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, immediately afterwards, Pierre Guerre obliged her to become a party in the ſuit againſt him.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtood the evidence on both ſides of this remarkable queſtion, and it ſeems that the judges were on the point of deciding in favour of the priſoner; when the real Martin Guerre ſuddenly appeared. He came from Spain, and had a wooden leg, as the ſoldier had aſſerted. Immediately on his arrival, he preſented a memorial to the court, deſiring leave to plead his cauſe, and to bring proofs of his identity.</p>
            <p>An order was accordingly made for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and that he ſhould be confronted with Bertrande de Rols, and with the four ſiſters, whoſe evidence had been the ſtrongeſt in favour of the priſoner. He was then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, in the ſame manner as the priſoner had been before, and on the ſame particulars; and his anſwers were not found ſo clear and exact as thoſe of his repreſentative.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="unknown:036316_0217_1008DA7432CE3DA8"/>
They were then confronted. The man accuſed of being an impoſtor treated Martin Guerre as a rogue and a cheat, dreſſed up by the artifices of Pierre Guerre, the uncle; and declared that he would content to be hanged, if he did not prove, to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the court, that the man, who now pretended to be Martin Guerre, was a more machine, taught to act his part by his enemies. He then queſtioned his adverſary on ſeveral circumſtances, which, if he was Martin Guerre, he ought to have known. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers were confuſed and unſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>The commiſſioners then taking the laſt man apart interrogated him on ſeveral new points, to which neither of them had before anſwered; his anſwers were found to correſpond with the truth. Then taking apart the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, they put the ſame queſtions to him; and, to ten or twelve of thoſe queſtions, he anſwered as exactly as his opponent.</p>
            <p>The four ſiſters, and the huſbands of the two who were married, were then ordered to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, together with Pierre Guerre, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Arnaud du Tilk, and as many as could be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhewn he two perſons, who both aſſerted that they were her brother. After a moment's conſideration, ſhe burſt into tears, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the real Martin Guerre; and, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing herſelf to the commiſſioners, ſaid, <q>This is indeed my brother; I acknowledge that that wicked impoſtor has deceived me.</q> Martin Guerre embraced her, and wept alſo. The three other ſiſters, in their turns, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him with tears, and beſought his forgiveneſs of their error.</p>
            <p>The huſbands of the married ſiſters did the ſame; and thoſe witneſſes, who had ſworn moſt poſitively that the firſt of theſe men was Martin Guerre, now, on ſeeing him with the real Martin Guerre, owned they had been in an error.</p>
            <p>Bertrande de Rols, the wife, was then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to approach; who no ſooner beheld her huſband, than, wild with confuſion and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, trembling, and in tears, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

had for ſome time completed the deception; but that, when at length ſuſpicions aroſe in her mind, ſhe made every effort to aſſure herſelf of the truth; and, as ſoon as ſhe was fully aware of the deceit, had appealed to juſtice, to deliver her from the impoſtor, who had ſo cruelly betrayed her into a crime ſhe muſt forever lament—a crime, which had inſpired her with ſo much horror, that ſhe had inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Her beauty (for ſhe is deſcribed as being very handſome) and her tears affected every body, except her huſband; who, though he appeared ſo moved with the tenderneſs and affection of his ſiſters, was inſenſible of the penitence and humility of his wife, whom he repulſed with rage and indignation, puſhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

reconciled her to the treaſon. The court inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to perſuade Martin Guerre to pardon his wife; but it was a length of time only that abated his ſeverity towards her.</p>
            <p>The impoſture being now clearly proved, ſentence was given againſt Arnaud du Tilk; that he ſhould be hanged, and his body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to aſhes. The daughter, however, that he had by Bertrande de Rols, was not to be declared illegitimate, but was, on account of the good faith of the mother, who was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the impoſture, to poſſeſs whatever had really belonged to Arnaud du Tilk.</p>
            <p>The court deliberated, whether Martin Guerre and Bertrande de Rols were not liable to ſome puniſhment; the latter for adultery, and the former, for having, by his deſertion and neglect of his wife, occaſioned it, and for having ſerved in the Spaniſh army. But, as the crime committed by the woman was through ignorance, and as the man did not deſignedly betray her into it, they were not deemed objects of public juſtice. In regard to the charge againſt Martin Guerre, that he had ſerved againſt his king, it appeared that he had not voluntarily done ſo; but that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been reduced to ſervitude, he had been hired by the cardinal de—, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the cardinal's brother, whom he had followed into Flanders, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Arnaud du Tilk, being now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, made a full confeſſion of his crimes.

            <head>THE MARRIED NUN.</head>
            <p>THE ſieur d'Antail had by his firſt wife two daughters, Louiſa, and Henrietta. As he was poſſeſſed of an affluent fortune, and fond of his children, he ſpared no expenſe in their education. The youngeſt had nothing remarkable in her perſon; but Louiſa, the eldeſt, was extremely beautiful; and the charms of her figure were equalled by the elegant acquirements, which the care of her father, and an underſtanding naturally quick, had given her the means of obtaining. Beauty, which has too often been fatal to its poſſeſſor, proved the ſource of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable misfortunes to Louiſa. She loſt her mother when ſhe was about thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; and her father ſoon after married again. His wife, madame de Valmor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> had a ſon about eighteen, of whom ſhe was extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly fond. The young man could not live under the ſame roof with Louiſa, without feeling the effect of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, he became madly in love with her; but the formidable
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:036316_0223_1008DA7B95EAFA28"/>
rivals, who ſurrounded his miſtreſs, made him deſpair of availing himſelf of the opportunities which his near connections gave him; he particularly apprehended the ſucceſs of the ſieur Pradelle, a lieutenant in the guards, who he fancied was more favoured by Louiſa than any of her lovers. The ſieur Pradelle ſaw, with equal uneaſineſs, the conſtant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that young de Valmorin enjoyed, by liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the houſe of monſieur d'Antail, and he dreaded that the facility of converſing, and even the authority of her father and her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, might throw Louiſa into his arms. She did not expreſs any partiality to de Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morin; but ſhe was not without coquetry, and could not reſiſt the pleaſure of hearing herſelf flattered by ſeveral admirers at the ſame time; yet Pradelle ſeemed to have the preference. Pradelle, however, thought he had ſo much to fear from the advantages of conſtant intercourſe which his rival poſſeſſed, that he determined to carry her off, before de Valmorin ſhould have made too deep an impreſſion on her heart. He took his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures accordingly; but not ſo ſecretly as to eſcape the obſervation of de Valmorin, who found means to render his project abortive. Rage and reſentment took poſſeſſion of the heart of Pradelle, when he found that his rival had counteracted him: he affronted him publicly, and gave a challenge, which de Valmorin accepted. The father of Louiſa
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:036316_0224_1008DA334FD89848"/>
and his wife, the mother of de Valmorin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of what had paſſed, and of the impending duel between the rivals, took the neceſſary precautions to prevent their encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the mother continued under the crueleſt alarms for the ſafety of her ſon: ſhe foreſaw, that though ſhe had for that time ſaved him from the hazard into which he would have thrown himſelf, ſhe could not always ſecure him from the vengeance of a rival, who declared that nothing ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his attacking any man, who pretended to Louiſa. She had already repreſented to her ſon, that even if his affairs permitted him to marry the object of his affection, he could not hope for happineſs with a woman, whoſe ſingular beauty would be a perpetual ſource of jealouſy and uneaſineſs, and whoſe gaiety of temper ſeemed too likely to encourage thoſe whom her charms might attract. De Valmorin, who was of a warm and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined temper, would hear nothing his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could ſay to diſſuade him from his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Louiſa. His paſſion grew daily more violent, and his mother more unhappy.

that ſhe ſaw all her influence with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band muſt be exerted to conquer the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his daughter: ſhe therefore repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, that the repoſe and honour of his family required the ſecluſion of Louiſa, whoſe beauty, though by no means in its meridian had already occaſioned him ſo much trouble and uneaſineſs; uneaſineſs, from which he could never be exempt, even if his daughter was married, ſince there was but too much reaſon to believe, that jealouſy, on the part of the huſband of a perſon ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lovely, would make her life uneaſy to herſelf and fatal to others; and that if any ſiniſter event was the conſequence, he could never forgive himſelf, for not having placed her where the influence of her charms could no longer effect the tranquility of his days, or the reputation of his family. It is probable that mademoiſelle Louiſa, whoſe temper ſeems to have been warm, and who was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, conſcious of the power of beauty, had given ſome offence to her mother-in-law, which, added to her fear for her ſon, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined her to carry her point, however cruel and unjuſt. Her huſband, whom ſhe entirely governed, had forgotten, in this ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the attachment he once had to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the firſt; and he had no longer any will but that of his wife; or any eyes to ſee, but as ſhe directed.

This menace was terrible; and Louiſa ſaw but too evidently, that her fate was determined; and that ſhe muſt reſolve on taking the veil, if ſhe would eſcape a more deplorable deſtiny; ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſented to enter into the convent of St. Claire, in the Fauxbourg Marceau. A woman, named madame du Freſne, was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to negociate this matter between her and her parents, Father Cauſſin, a prieſt, who was witneſs to the averſion Louiſa had to the lot ſhe was driven to accept, ſaid to this madame du Freſne, "You will be the occaſion of eternal perdition to that poor girl, by forcing her to embrace the life of a nun, to which you ſee ſhe has a decided antipathy." To this remonſtrance du Freſne replied, "It is better that ſhe ſhould hazard perdition in a convent, than, by remaining in the world, become the cauſe of the perdition of many others, whom her beauty would involve in the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:036316_0227_1008DA814E8DC0F8"/>
moſt fatal crimes." It was evident that the unfortunate Louiſa was to be the victim of her ſtep-mother's apprehenſions, and of her hatred, occaſioned by thoſe extraordinary perfections of form, which are too apt to excite envy and ill-humour in women, even after they have ceaſed to value themſelves on outward advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Not content with the ſucceſs of her project hitherto, madame d'Antail did not even ſeek to ſoften the horrors of perpetual confinement, by allowing her daughter-in-law the alleviations of affluence: they would give her no more than ſix hundred livres on her entrance; the nuns refuſed to receive her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe had more. On this occaſion the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate victim wrote thus to madame du Freſne, who was again employed between her and her parents: "I know, madam, that ſix hundred livres are enough for thoſe who can execute the duties of the life into which they enter; but as it is impoſſible for me ever to do ſo, and as the community are already ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I never can perform what is expected of the generality, and muſt have many exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they refuſe to receive me, unleſs I bring a greater ſum: I beſeech you therefore, madam, intercede with my father to have ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for his child; and to pay for me what is required." After long ſolicitation this was granted: the father paid the ſum which the community inſiſted on; and Louiſa, who ſaw no remedy, took the veil, and after
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:036316_0228_1008DA3B1C2ED030"/>
her noviciate was paſſed, as the diſpoſition of her perſecutors remained unchanged at the end of that time, ſhe took the vow, with a courage inſpired by her high ſpirit, but with an heart ſtill attached to a world, of which ſhe was deſigned to be one of the brighteſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But whatever outward reſolution ſhe had ſhewn, and whatever pains were taken by the mother-in-law and her party to make this ſtep appear voluntary, Louiſa had found means to declare her averſion in a legal form. Before ſhe took the vows, ſhe had a proteſt drawn up againſt it, which ſhe delivered to father Favier, a cordelier, confeſſor and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior of the community; and immediately after the ceremony ſhe repeated the proteſt in form a ſecond time, and gave it to the ſame perſon. For three or four years Louiſa dragged on a melan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oly and reluctant life in the monaſtery, without attempting to free herſelf from the engagements into which ſhe had been forced. In the mean time her ſiſter, Henrietta d'Antail, was married to the ſieur Nicholas le Vacher; and in the marriage contract her father had named her his ſole heireſs. Avarice was the moſt predominant feature in the ſieur le Vacher's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; and he ſaw with jealouſy and miſtruſt the increaſing power that his father-in-law ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his wife to have over him. She had a ſon of her own, for whom le Vacher believed ſhe was robbing her huſband of his property, and ſending away and ſecreting his effects among
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:036316_0229_1008DA83DC357F20"/>
her friends, to ſecure them for her own and her ſon's uſe, to the prejudice of his daughter Henrietta. On examining more narrowly into the truth of his conjectures, he diſcovered that three articles of plate, amounting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſum of twenty-eight thouſand livres, had certainly diſappeared. He thought it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time to put an end to proceedings ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to his intereſt; and for that purpoſe he preſented to the proper law-office, a requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, in which he ſat forth, that his wife's father had loſt his ſight, and that his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding war, ſo much impaired, that he was no longer in a condition to manage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

her ſituation; ſhe could not command herſelf enough to feel any relief in the ſociety of the nuns; and the duties of religion ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to perform: the only conſolation ſhe found, was in the company of the ſieur Couſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turier, a counſellor, who, viſiting a relation in the convent, had ſeen Louiſa, and, ſtruck with the wonderful beauty which the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious habit could not conceal, had cultivated an acquaintance with her. He frequently viſited her at the grate, where ſhe told him the cruel perſecutions ſhe had undergone from the hatred of her ſtep-mother; the reluctance with which ſhe continued in the monaſtery, and the precaution ſhe had taken to proteſt againſt the vows ſhe had been conſtrained to make. Couſturier conſoled her, by affording her hopes that the proteſt would give her the means of recovering her liberty: he adviſed her to continue to expreſs the ſame coldneſs for the duties of her profeſſion, and the ſame averſion to the company of the nuns; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no act that might ſerve as a ratification of her extorted engagement; and he told her, that, if ſhe waited patiently, under theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, he flattered himſelf the time might come when her chains would be broken.</p>
            <p>Some months after the commencement of her acquaintance with Couſturier, the hoſpital at Lagny was to be put under the government of the cordeliers: "Louiſa d'Antail obtained the appointment of ſuperior to this branch of
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:036316_0231_1008DA87B4C44918"/>
the community, and removed thither with great ſatsfaction, not only becauſe her high ſpirit made the rigorous ſubordination to which ſhe was ſubject in the convent very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to her, but becauſe ſhe could enjoy, together with more power, more liberty in her new abode. The nuns, in whom her diſincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the ſervice of the cloiſter, and the coldneſs of her manner towards them, had occaſioned a great diſlike, ſaw her departure with pleaſure. Before ſhe took poſſeſſion of her new eſtabliſhment, ſhe had the precaution to renew the proteſt againſt her original vows, by an act, wherein ſhe declared that ſhe not only conſidered them as extorted and nugatory but that ſhe did not mean to confirm them by her preſent removal, or by any ſubſequent act, and that ſhe always reſerved a right to avail herſelf of her firſt proteſt whenever ſhe ſhould ſee occaſion.</p>
            <p>The new community at Lagny were deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of being conſidered as ſubject only to the authority of the cordeliers, who are the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior branch of the claires; and to be wholly exempt from the juriſdiction of the archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Paris: the prelate defended his right, and a law-ſuit was likely to be the conſequence. The ſieur le Vachor, whoſe avarice made him attentive to the moſt minute circumſtances, knew enough of his ſiſter-in-law's diſpoſition, to apprehend, that ſhe would avail herſelf of the proteſt ſhe had made, to renounce
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:036316_0232_1008DA3F26877EB0"/>
her vows, if ever it ſhould be in her power. Her converſations with Couſturier gave him ſenſible uneaſineſs. A young man could hardly ſee her without being ſenſible of her attractions, and Couſturier was amiable, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and poſſeſſed a fortune equal to what Louiſa might have a claim to, if ſhe was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from her cloiſter.—To add to his apprehenſions in regard to this acquaintance, he was aware that Couſturier had ſtudied, and was verſed in the laws which relate to monaſtic vows, and knew in what caſes they could be diſſolved. To compleat his unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, he learned that Louiſa was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Lagny; where, being no longer under the direction of the abbeſs, nor reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained by the obſervations of the numerous members of the community, ſhe would no longer be obliged to give an account of her actions; but might entertain Couſturier as long and as often as ſhe pleaſed, in the parlour of the hoſpital, having no other interruption than the duties of her office.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this degree of liberty, Louiſa knew that great care was neceſſary, to prevent the imputation of an improper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between her and Couſturier; on the leaſt ſurmiſe of which, ſhe foreſaw that ſhe ſhould no longer be ſuffered to ſee him at all, but ſhould be forced back to the monaſtery, and ſo cloſely confined, that ſhe ſhould have no chance of ever ſeeing thoſe who
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:036316_0233_1008DA8939B767E8"/>
might contribute to the recovery of her liberty.—For this reaſon ſhe failed not to be cautious; and, as Couſturier was now obliged to travel ſix leagues for the pleaſure of ſeeing her, their interviews were leſs frequent, and were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with the utmoſt attention to propriety; but Le Vacher, whoſe intereſt it was to put an end to them entirely, employed emiſſaries to propagate reports injurious to the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the order; and he ſo effectually diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated his ſcandalous ſtories, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals of the order at length heard them; and in addition to theſe falſities, he alleged that the diſpute between the archbiſhop and the cordeliers, relative to the juriſdiction of the hoſpital of Lagny, originated in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

All this paſſed immediately after La Vacher had ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The fair nun, who found that monſieur d'Antail, her father, was enraged at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Le Vacher, thought it a proper op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to attempt ſhaking off the yoke, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nder which ſhe had now ſuffered ſeven years. She hoped that monſieur d'Antail and his wife, irritated againſt Henrietta's huſband, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ould again reſtore her to that ſhare of their affection, which ſhe had never deſerved to loſe; and that, in order to put her in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to recover her part of that fortune, which they now ſaw would be unworthily beſtowed on the avaricious Le Vacher, they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, before a court of juſtice, the means they had taken to force her into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements ſo contrary to her inclinations. In this hope ſhe was not diſappointed. On her applying to them, and declaring that ſhe ſhould make an attempt to break through thoſe engagements, which ſhe never could ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil, they promiſed to give her all the aſſiſtance they could towards diſſolving her vows, and enabling her to marry the ſieur Couſturier; who was in every reſpect a ſuitable match for her; and to whom ſhe was now tenderly attached. The pity he had ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wn for her miſfortunes had firſt engaged her gratitude; his merit and perſeverance had now created a warmer ſentiment. He had long been her only conſolation, and to paſs the reſt of her life with him would, ſhe thought, give new value to the emancipation ſhe hoped to procure.</p>

Monſieur d'Antail and his wife, Adriana de Valmorin, joined in the repreſentation ſhe made to the court of Rome, of the force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which ſhe was obliged to take the vows. While they waited an anſwer, ſhe left the convent, and they received her into their houſe. The pope's anſwer was to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect:—<q>That the petitioner ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the convent, to wait the event of a ſummons, made to all the parties who were intereſted in the abolition of her vows; and, if no cauſe was ſhewn by thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſufficient to make the proper court at Paris confirm her religious engagements, they were to be diſſolved, and ſhe would be permitted to marry.</q>—The perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted were, her relations and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of nuns to which ſhe had belonged.

But at his age he could no longer think of perſiſting in the cruel reſtraint that had been put upon her inclinations, and he deſired ſhe might be releaſed. His wife joined in this act. And, after a full hearing, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that all the parties intereſted hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed in deſiring the diſſolution of the vows made by Louiſa dAntail, againſt which ſhe had entered a proteſt, both before and after ſhe was conſtrained to take them, that they ſhould now be diſſolved, and that ſhe be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to marry. Le Vacher however demanded an hearing and to become a party; but monſieur d'Antail proteſted againſt it; and Le Vacher's motives ſeemed ſo ungenerous, that his efforts were over-ruled. The decree which permitted Louiſa d'Antail to marry was affirmed by a new ſentence, which, notwithſtanding the appeal of Le Vacher, reſtored her to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and her freedom.

the duke of Guiſe ſtill held ſome places of truſt under his ſon Louis the thirteenth; but the houſe of Guiſe was ſo much the object of envy and ſuſpicion, on account of its former power, and the illuſtrious men it had produced, that great care was taken not to raiſe it again too high by honours and emoluments: and at length, cardinal Richelieu grew ſo diſſatisfied with the duke of Guiſe, that he oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He retired to Florence, and died in the Sienois in 1640, leaving ſeveral children by his wife Henrietta Catharine de Joyeuſe, only daughter of Henry de Joyeuſe, marechal of France, and widow of Henry de Bourbon, duke de Montpenſier. His ſon, Henry de Lorraine, born in 1514, became (by the death of his eldeſt brother) duke of Guiſe. He ſeemed to inherit the ſpirit, as well as the perſonal perfections of his grandfather, the celebrated duke of Guiſe.

But the duke, either really apprehenſive for her ſafety, or perhaps cured of his love by the raſh fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his miſtreſs, refuſed to let her continue with him, and inſiſted on her returning to Paris; under pretence that his te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The duke now entered with his uſual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity into the conſpiracy, which took, a very alarming form, and was ſanctioned by the ſpecious name of "The league formed to preſerve the peace of Chriſtendom."

            <p>The duke went to Bruſſels, where he took upon him the command of the troops, which were ſent thither by the emperor and the king of Spain. There he found his aunt, the ducheſs of Chevreuſe, who had been obliged to quit France for her intrigues againſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> Richelieu; and at her houſe he became acquainted with the counteſs de Boſſu, a young and beautiful widow, whoſe vivacity and perſonal attractions were more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to inflame a heart ſo ſuſceptible of the power of beauty as was that of the duke of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The anecdotes of that time give an account of their acquaintance and its conſequence; which is perhaps ſomewhat heightened by the lively imagination of the writers, who, to bring truth nearer to romance, have embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it with their own colouring. However, as there are no other accounts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this connection, it muſt be related in their manner.</p>
            <p>The duke of Guiſe having often ſeen the counteſs of Boſſu at the houſe of the ducheſs of Chevreuſe, was equally charmed by her beauty, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with her vivacity. The
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:036316_0243_1008DA96E7841AA8"/>
lady, on her part, thought ſuch a conqueſt as that of the handſomeſt and moſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man in Europe, deſerved all her attention, and that ſhe might forgive herſelf even ſome unuſual advances to ſecure it. Theſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe conducted with ſo much art, that the duke grew every day more in love; and when madame de Boſſu thought he was enough ſo to refuſe her nothing, ſhe ſpoke to him of marriage; to which the duke anſwered that he deſired nothing ſo much as to unite his deſtiny with hers: but if madame de Boſſu had known more of his real character, ſhe might have perceived, that he would not thus readily have entered into engagements, had he thought them binding; and that he only wiſhed to amuſe himſelf during his exile. She knew enough to doubt the performance of his promiſe; but, flattered by the hope of ſeeing in her fetters him for whom ſo many vainly ſighed, ſhe pretended to be the dupe of his ready profeſſion, while ſhe in fact meditated how to make him hers. With this view, as it was now the fineſt part of the year, ſhe made a party to go to a beautiful ſeat ſhe had, a league from Bruſſels, where ſhe contrived to amuſe the duke for ſome days, with every thing ſhe thought agreeable to him. The duke, flattered by her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſpoke to her more paſſionately than he had yet done; to which the counteſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that if he was ſincere in his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:036316_0244_1008DA51A64BE0F8"/>
if his love was as great as he pretended, he would haſten the completion of their marriage. The duke proteſted there was nothing he ſo ardently deſired as to be united for ever with ſo amiable a perſon. Madame de Boſſu, who was in hopes ſhe ſhould bring him to that declaration, then told him, he might immediately convince her of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, and ſecure the happineſs he ſeemed ſo much to deſire, for that ſhe had a prieſt and a notary ready, who would inſtantly perform the ceremonies. The duke, who certainly did not believe the marriage under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would be binding to him, conſented with as much apparent ſatisfaction as if he had been ſincere. Manſelle, the almoner of the army, was called in, who gave them a diſpenſation, for want of the proper banns, and then the nuptial benediction. The next day the duke re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urned to Bruſſels, leaving the counteſs de Boſſu extremely happy, at being, as ſhe imagined, ducheſs of Guiſe, and wife to the moſt charming man of the age.</p>
            <p>Whatever care had been taken to keep this tranſaction ſecret, it became in a few weeks the converſation of Bruſſels; the duke d'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>euf, and the ducheſs de Chevreuſe, both ſpoke to the duke upon it in a ſtile of ſeverity he was by no means diſpoſed to bear. His reſpect for his aunt, madame d'Chevreuſe, made him liſten to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches with ſome appearance of patience;
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:036316_0245_1008DA99A489A340"/>
but his firey temper could ill brook the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of the duke d'Elbeuf, whom he anſwered in terms ſo full of rage and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that a challenge paſſed between them; and they were prevented fighting, only by the interpoſition of the archduke.</p>
            <p>Extremely irritated to think that any one ſhould dare to pry into and blame his actions, he determined to ſhew how little he conſidered their diſapprobation, by bringing madame de Boſſu home to his houſe, and owning her as his wife; which at firſt he meant not to do, and had even prevailed on her to conceal their marriage, by repreſenting to her that it would be neceſſary for him to try to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile his family to the match before he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it.

He received her with kindneſs; but his mother was no ſooner apprized of her arrival, than ſhe went to the queen, from whom ſhe obtained an order for madame de Boſſu to quit the dominions of France inſtantly. This order was ſignified to her, and enforced by the remonſtrance of the duke of Guiſe; who told her, that all his endeavours and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the unfortunate counteſs was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſubmit, and returned broken-hearted to her mother. The duke, giving himſelf up to
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:036316_0249_1008DA9C91B003E0"/>
intrigue, and to the warmth of his ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able temper, ſoon after got into a quarrel with the count de Coligni: they fought in the midſt of the court, and the duke of Guiſe dangerouſly wounded and diſarmed his antagoniſt. His mother was perpetually apprehenſive for his ſafety, which he continually hazarded; ſhe dreaded leſt the old animoſity ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed between him and the houſe of Condé, with whom the houſe of Guiſe had long been at variance; a renewal of which, ſhe foreſaw, would be attended with the moſt fatal events: ſhe was, therefore, very deſirous that the duke ſhould marry mademoiſelle de Longueville, niece to the great Condé. But the duke had fallen in love with mademoiſelle de Pons; and as this new attachment was, if poſſible, more violent than any he had yet felt, he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively refuſed to liſten to any overtures in regard to mademoiſelle de Longueville. As he determined to marry mademoiſelle de Pons, it became neceſſary for him to enquire how far his marriage with the counteſs de Boſſu might prevent the completion of his wiſhes; and he found that it would raiſe ſuch impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his deſigns, as he ſhould find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to obviate; this conſideration, and the trouble he received from the attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-general (who proſecuted him for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt law and order, by fighting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly with the count de Coligni), determined him to go himſelf to Rome; where he hoped
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:036316_0250_1008DAED1424D470"/>
to obtain the diſſolution of his engagements with madame de Boſſu. At this time the civil war of Naples, occaſioned by the heavy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts laid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the people, broke out; Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zienello, who was the leader of the tumult, being deſtroyed, the rebels had recourſe to the duke of Guiſe, who, by his deſcent, had a ſort of claim to the kingdom of Naples. The duke no ſooner received the propoſal of becoming their general, than with his uſual impetuoſity he accepted it; and, making his way through the fleet commanded by Don John of Auſtria, he arrived at Naples, and became generaliſſmo of the rebel army. It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unneceſſary here to relate the various events that occured while he continued in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The charms of mademoiſelle de Pons, which had induced him to go to Rome, in hopes of being allowed to marry her, were now forgotten, amid the attractions of the Neapolitan beauties: but his general gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries among the loweſt of the people, and his attachment to the daughter of a tailor in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, diſguſted thoſe who at firſt had beheld him with admiration and reſpect; and at length his uſual raſhneſs made him commit an indiſcretion, which put the town into the hands of the Spaniards. He had then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to flight; but was purſued, taken, and ſent priſoner to Spain.</p>
            <p>While this was paſſing, the unfortunate counteſs of Boſſu was ſued by the duke's cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors;
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:036316_0251_1008DAA0A41CEF20"/>
and her effects, as well as the dower ſhe poſſeſſed from her firſt huſband, ſeized to ſatisfy their demands. Notwithſtanding which, and all his neglect and cruelty, ſhe no ſooner heard of his impriſonment, than ſhe quitted the houſe of her mother, with whom ſhe was obliged to reſide, and went into France, meaning to paſs from thence into Spain, to ſolicit his releaſe, or ſhare his confinement. Her friends, however, repreſented to her, that her journey would be abſolutely fruitleſs; and prevailed upon her to return into Flanders. By the interpoſition of the great Condé, who then ſerved the king of Spain againſt his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, the duke was ſoon after releaſed: the Spaniſh court, indeed, gave him his liberty the more willingly, as they hoped that his turbulent and reſtleſs ſpiait would create new troubles in France. He was no ſooner at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than he diſclaimed all obligations to the prince of Conde, and complained loudly of the treatment he received at Madrid. The raſhneſs of his character ſeemed to have gained ſtrength by his confinement; his politics and his love aſſumed a more violent caſt; the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had felt for mademoiſelle de Pons, ſeemed to return with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ardour than ever; and he determined to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake her his, at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever price. But when he learned, too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that during his abſence ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as a favourite lover monſieur de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licorne, a private gentleman, rage and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:036316_0252_1008DAEE996B2808"/>
ſtifled all the emotions of tenderneſs he had felt for her; he treated her with rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſult, and inſiſted on her returning a pair of ear-rings, valued at a thouſand crowns, which he had given her: he even ſued her to oblige her to reſtore them; but had the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of loſing his ſuit; which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance depriving him of all patience and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he threatened perſonal vengeance againſt the object of his former attachment; who, to avoid it, was driven to quit the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Being then without any purſuit, and his capricious and violent temper making it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to remain long quiet, he failed on another expedition to Naples, which did not anſwer his expectation; and, on his return, a new paſſion, more violent than any he had yet felt, attached him to mademoiſelle de Gorce.</p>
            <p>In 1664 he died, leaving no poſterity. All his brothers died before him; as did his ſiſters afterwards, unmarried. Thus ended the illuſtrious houſe of Guiſe; the enterpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ambition of which had ſo long diſturbed the tranquility of France.</p>
            <p>Madame de Boſſu, ruined by the vey means which ſhe hoped would have made her the happieſt woman in Europe, endeavoured to recover from the heirs of the duke of Guiſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the court of Rome, the department called the rote,<note n="*" place="bottom">Chief juriſdiction of the court of Rome.</note> allowed the validity of her marrige; but the courts of law in France, through all which the cauſe was carried, decided, that, as the marriage was celebrated without the uſual forms, it was abſolutely null and of no effect.</p>

            <head>THE CHEVALIER DE MORSAN.</head>
            <p>THIS is perhaps one of the moſt romantic hiſtories that the various occurrences of human life ever produced. Though ſeveral fictions have been founded on events ſimilar to what is here related, fiction itſelf has hardly been able to produce a more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary collection of circumſtances, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the truth never having been perfectly known, adds to the intereſt of the ſtory. A notary at Paris, whoſe name was Charles Henry Donc, who was in a reputable ſituation, left, at his deceaſe, his three children, a ſon and two daughters, to the care of his wife, Mary Clement. He had not been long dead, when his relations found the conduct of this woman ſo improper, and her profuſion ſo great, that they apprehended ſhe would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the money left as a proviſion for the children; and that even the goods and effects in the houſe would be ſeized by her creditors, and the children be defrauded of every thing: ſince it is well known, in every country, that

               </gap>t the importunity of her diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable lover, aided by the authority of a parent ſhe had always obeyed, might force her into a marriage ſhe deteſted. Her fears on this head were but too well founded. Robert, finding ſhe did not as uſual viſit at home, determined to force her from her aſylum in the convent; and her mother conſented to the expedient. He took his meaſures ſo well, that ſeizing her as ſhe came from maſs with ſome other penſioners, he carried her no one knew whither. The guardian complained to the police, but without effect; and nine or ten days afterwards Robert married her, in preſence of her mother, and four other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>As there was now no remedy, the relations of the unfortunate girl thought it moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to drop the ſuit they had commenced againſt Robert, and ſhe was obliged to ſubmit to her deſtiny. But before the expiration of a month, ſhe found that deſtiny ſo inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that, after ſeveral alarming ſcenes of contention, which aroſe from the brutal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Robert, ſhe determined to bear no longer the dreadful yoke which had been forced upon her; ſhe therefore quitted the houſe of Robert, and took refuge among her

relations. Her father's kindred conſulted together on the means of reſcuing the unhappy young creature from the hands of a wretch ſo unworthy of her; and they determined, that her guardian ſhould appeal againſt the validity of a marriage, which was a mere abuſe of the ceremony, and a violation both of law and religion. This meaſure was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put into execution; and a ſentence was obtained, which directed, that Charlotte Donc ſhould retire to the convent of La Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette, till the cauſe could be heard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.

After ſome days of fruitleſs ſearch, he ſummoned the ſieur Mars de Joigny to produce his wife, or to inform him where ſhe was. The ſieur Joigny, in his defence, declared, that he knew not the place of her retreat; and alleged, that as no ſentence had put her into his care, he was not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for her appearance. With this anſwer Robert was obliged to withdraw his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; and to apply all his induſtry to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his fugitive wife. But every effort he made was fruitleſs: he could neither find her, or hear whether ſhe was yet among ſhe living. After ſome years, in which he inceſſantly ſought her, had elapſed, the paſſion falſely called love, and the thirſt of vengeance, both of which had probably concurred in produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ardent deſire to find her, began to
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:036316_0259_1008DAACE9BC5B50"/>
abate, and his enquiries were relaxed; and at length, after fifteen years, he co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cluded ſhe was dead, and thought only of marrying again. Being, however, deſirous of aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his ſituation, he again laid his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint before the police, on the eſcape of his wife. But this laſt effort was as fruitleſs as the former; and now, being almoſt certain that, if ſhe was not dead, ſhe would never appear to claim him as her huſband, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to remove to another quarter of the town, diſengage himſelf from the acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all who remembered his marriage with Charlotte, and paſs for a bachelor. In this character, after he had quitted all his former connections, he introduced himſelf to Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Ponſignard, the widow of the ſieur Maſſon d'Angluſe, a lawyer, who conſented to marry him. She was near ſixty years old; but ſhe had money, which attracted Robert; though ſhe had the precaution to have the marriage contract ſo drawn up, that each party were to remain poſſeſſed of their ſeparate property. This ſecond alliance formed by Robert, was not happier than the firſt. Madame d An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gluſe complained, very ſoon afterwards, that the moſt affronting outrages were exerciſed upon her: that he perpetually reproached her with her age; and, not contented with ill-language only, that he even proceeded to the moſt cruel perſonal inſults: and as ſhe was not of atemper to ſuffer ſuch treatment pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:036316_0260_1008DAFA23D04A08"/>
they ſoon came to extremities, and agreed only in one thing, which was to part, and that each ſhould remain in unmoleſted poſſeſſion of their own eftects. In purſuance of this convention, the wife retired to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; where ſhe had not been long reſident, before Robert, who ſeems to have been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of one of thoſe unhappy tempers which want ſomebody to torment, purſued her, and inſiſted on her returning to live with him. But ſhe had found the life ſhe had led with him ſo entirely inſupportable, that neither threats nor intreaties could prevail upon her to encounter it again. She peremptorily and ſteadily refuſed; and having, in the courſe of the conteſt, learned more of her huſband's former life, than had till then come to her knowledge, and diſcovered his marriage with Charlotte Donc; ſhe reſolved to try, whether ſhe could not annul her own unhappy connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by pleading, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The information collected by the counſel whom his ſecond wife employed, completely proved the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Robert with Margaret Charlotte Donc.

His ſuit was commenced againſt the ſieur Mars de Joigny; againſt madame Royer, who was his friend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident; and againſt the ſieur d'Imonville and his wife, at whoſe houſe madame Royal lived, the ſieur d'Imonville being her uncle: and to theſe perſons he joined mademoiſelle du Clos, the celebrated actreſs; who, he pretended, had been the principal agent in concealing his wife, Charlotte Donc; who, he alleged, had been dead ſeven years: and he produced as evidence of the fact, the following regiſter, from the pariſh of St. Sulpice:—<q>This 10th of November, 1723, was interred, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian de Morſan, aged twenty-two years, or thereabouts; the ſon of Maximilian de Morſan, gentleman, and of Emily de Conſtance, his wife, who died yeſterday in the ſtreet Mazarine, at the houſe of monſieur Poiſſan; ſieur d'Imonville, Jean de Lajarh, &amp;c. &amp;c. friends of the deceaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent.</q>Though this regiſter appears to have no relation whatever to the unfortunate fugitive, Charlotte Donc, Robert affected that it was ſhe only who was interred; and
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:036316_0262_1008DAFD089860E0"/>
that ſhe died of the ſmall-pox: to ſubſtantiate an aſſertion ſo extraordinary, he related the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars. He ſaid, that when his wife, after hearing the deciſion againſt her, had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from him through the crowd that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the hall of the court of juſtice, ſhe found refuge in the houſe of the ſieur d'Imon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville; where, as ſoon as ſhe arrived, madame Royer had dreſſed her in the habit of an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, with a ſcarlet coat, a laced hat, a ſword, and other accoutrements; and ſhe aſſumed the title of the chevalier du Coudray; but the habit ſhe had taken could not cure or conceal the terrors of a woman, who, in perpetual fear of being known, and carried back to her huſband, was for ſome months never ſeen to look at a ſtranger, or even to hear an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known voice without the greatest agony; and who, when any one ſhe did not know came into the houſe, would frequently hide herſelf under the beds, or in the cloſets, from the purſuit of thoſe emiſſaries of her huſband, who ſhe fancied were perpetually following her. D'Imonville, his wife and niece, left nothing untried to re-aſſure her: they carried her from their own houſe to one in the rüe de Mazarine, fauxbóurgh St. Germain, which was inhabited by mademoiſelle du Clos, where the name of the chevalier du Coudrey was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for that of the chevalier des Marets, Robert farther aſſerted, that his wife, now a pupil of the ſchool of La du Clos, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:036316_0263_1008DAB114850570"/>
forgot her terrors, and became initiated In the gallantries which paſſed at the houſe of the actreſs, with whom ſhe was a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. D'Imonville had a villa at Combe-de-la-Ville, where frequent parties of pleaſure were made, at which mademoiſelle du Clos preſided, and which were enlivened by the talents and ſpirit of the chevalier des Marets. Hunting, balls, and pleaſures of the table, where liberty and gaity only were conſulted, failed not to attract to this villa the young and licentious among the rich and great. To thoſe who were not in the ſecret, the chevalier ſeemed the moſt amiable of men: but to thoſe who were admitted to greater intimacy, he appeared more captivating, as a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of beauty and ſpirit, whoſe adventures and diguiſe gave greater eclat to the charms of which nature had been ſo laviſh. She now appeared under the name of the chevalier de Morſan; and the ſieur Mars de Joigny often went to this houſe, at Combe-de-la-Ville. It happened that he arrived there one day, when a large company was aſſembled, and entering haſtily the room where they were, he ſo far forgot himſelf, as to ſay to the chevalier de Morſan, "Well, Charlotte, how are you to-day?" This occaſioned a loud laugh among thoſe who were acquainted with the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis, and excited the wonder of thoſe who were not: theſe la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

haſtily put an end to the converſation.—This circumſtance, the frequent change of name, and the myſterious ſtories that were told of the birth of the chevalier de Morſan, raiſed great curioſity in the minds of many, who had ſeen him with La du Clos or the ſieur d'Imon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville. Sometimes he was ſaid to be a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, travelling for improvement; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſon of a prince, who was for reaſons of ſtate obliged to be concealed. The curate of Combe-de-la-Ville, who once ſaw him in the bed uſually occupied by madame d'Imon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, expreſſed his ſuſpicions of his ſex; the chevalier turned him into ridicule, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to anſwer his enquiries. But the ſervants of the houſe, and ſeveral other perſons, had no doubt but that the pretended young man was a woman. After Charlotte Donc had for ſome time worn the maſculine habit, ſhe ſeemed to have acquired maſculine courage: ſhe had a quarrel with ſome young man in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Combe-de-la-Ville, accepted his challenge and was actually wounded. The ſurgeon, however, who dreſſed the wound, was never called upon in the trial. It was not long afterwards that ſhe came to Paris, to a houſe La du Clos had taken in the rüe Mazarine; there ſhe was ſeized with the ſmall pox, attended with the worſt ſymptoms: and, in the danger of loſing her life, all the tranſactions of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the attendants to ſave her from her huſband; and fancied ſhe ſaw herſelf ſurrounded by ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who were come to drag her to him. As the diſeaſe approached the criſis, it wore the moſt threatening aſpect: ſpiritual conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was thought neceſſary; and father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, a monk of the Auguſtines, was ſent for to adminiſter the ſacraments, and hear the dying confeſſion of the chevalier de Morſan. The monk addreſſed him as ſuch; but the hour was now come in which diſſimulation was impoſſible. The pretended chevalier ſaid to the monk, in a melancholy tone, <q>Alas! I am not what you ſuppoſe: I am a woman.</q> The monk, aſtoniſhed at what he heard, exclaimed—"How! are you a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?" On which the patient repeated a ſecond time, "Yes; I am a woman." The monk then aſked her if ſhe would have him reveal this ſecret to mademoiſelle du Clos? To which ſhe anſwered, <q>Yes, tell her if you wlll.</q>—Either the prieſt was not aware of the immediate danger, or for ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he delayed the laſt ſacrament and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion till the next morning: in the interim the chevalier expired.—The deception, however, did not terminate with life: Michelle de la Neau, and her daughter, the former who had attended as a nurſe during the illneſs, the latter who was ſervant to mademoiſelle du Clos, were employed to put the corpſe into the coffin. They ſaw that it was the corpſe of
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:036316_0266_1008DB047B95C0F0"/>
a woman: they expreſſed to La du Clos their ſurprize; who coldly anſwered, that ſince it was ſo, the world, who had accuſed her of entertaining the chevalier as a lover, had wronged her, and had been deceived. The coffin, ſet on a bier, was placed at the door of La du Clos; and, to perpetuate the deceit, the ſword of the deceaſed, and its ſcabbard, were laid on the coffin, as is uſual when a military man is buried. The ſpectators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was the funeral of an officer; and Charlotte Donc was buried as a chevalier, after having paſſed as ſuch for ſeven years. The ſieur d'Imonville, who Robert pretended was the principal contriver of the concealment, attended the funeral.—When the entry was made in the regiſter of this funeral, a note was added, thus, "You are not to ſuffer an extract of this to be taken."</p>
            <p>If this relation, given by Robert, was true, his wife was among the dead ſeven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was appriſed of it; and ſhe had been loſt near fifteen, when by ſome means or other (but by what does not appear) he gained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the diſguiſe in which ſhe had lived. Seizing eagerly on a clue which promiſed to lead him to the diſcovery he had ſo long attempted in vain, he purſued his enquiries at Combe-de-la-Ville, and at Paris, among every rank of people with whom D'Imonville and du Clos were connected, till he had collected the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances from which he formed this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative:
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:036316_0267_1008DAB8EE44AA60"/>
and in this reſearch he had been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by Anthony Donc, the brother of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte; who being, in caſe of her death, heir to whatever his father had left, was equally intereſted in penetrating the myſtery. Their united enquiries produced fact, which, they affirmed, made a poſitive diſcovery of the death and interment of Charlotte Donc,—Having a collection of proofs, which they thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to eſtabliſh the facts, they no longer heſitated to lay it before a court of juſtice. Thirteen witneſſes were examined, whoſe evidence amounted to what has been before related—That an individual, who was believed to be a woman, had lived with La du Clos for ſome years; who was at firſt called the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier du Coudray, afterwards des Marets; but latterly had been known by the name of the chevalier de Morſan; and who was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Charlotte Donc, the fugitive wife of Robert. The nurſe, who had attended her in her laſt illneſs, ſwore to the circumſtance of her apprehending that ſoldiers ſurrounded her bed to force her to her huſband; and that, on laying her out, ſhe was found to be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The ſervants who had lived with La du Clos, the Auguſtine monk, and ſome other witneſſes, gave teſtimony of thoſe facts which have been before recapitulated: but none ſwore poſitively, that the perſon paſſing under the name of the chevalier de Morſan, was Charlotte Donc. But Robert pretended, that
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:036316_0268_1008DB068CCA2798"/>
the time when his wife diſappeared, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered exactly to that when the ſtranger firſt was ſeen in the ſociety of de Joigny, the guardian, du Clos, D'Imonville, and others with whom de Joigny was connected; which, added to the teſtimonies of ſo many witneſſes, and to circumſtances ſo unuſual, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the court, that the chevalier de Morſan was no other than the wife of Robert.—The counſel for Robert, in pleading on this ground, againſt thoſe who had concealed his wife, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the enormity of the offence they had committed, againſt all law and order, as well as againſt religion and juſtice. They ſaid, that not content with having ſtolen the wife from her huſband, to whom ſhe was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to return, and having led her into an irregular and ſcandalous courſe of life; with having impoſed on the world, and violated the laws of ſociety, by the diſguiſe under which ſhe had lived, and under which ſhe had been buried; they dared to enter a falſity into a book kept for the ſecurity of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: in which if frauds were thus allowed, no man's property could be ſafe from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of pretenders; no man could venture to beſtow his daughter or his ſiſter in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or to marry himſelf: and, in ſhort, it was a fraud that ſtruck at the very root of ſocial compact and good order. But ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious were they of the probability of detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this quarter, that they tried to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:036316_0269_1008DABA7415D108"/>
an extract from being taken from a book, which, in fact, belonged to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, by inſerting in the margin a note, more likely however to excite curioſity, than to prevent its being gratified; ſince, if it was really the body of the chevalier de Morſan which was interred, why ſhould it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed? In falſifying the name and ſex of the perſon buried, they were guilty of a capital crime; the puniſhment for which is a confiſcation of all the effects of the contending parties.</p>
            <p>Monſieur Briſſon, counſel for D'Joigny, D'Imonville, and du Clos, undertook, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to theſe aſſertions, to prove, that the perſon who had lived ſo long with La du Clos, was not Charlotte Donc, but the chevalier de Morſan, a foreigner; whoſe exiſtence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of no doubt, and whoſe hiſtory he could without difficulty trace. He ſaid, that the abbé Chamillard, a Jeſuit, had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this young man in Bavaria, of which country he was a native; that, in 1715, he came to Paris, and told the abbé Chamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, to whom he immediately addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that affairs of the utmoſt conſequence had obliged him to quit his country, and come into France. The abbé, affected by his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, undertook to find for him a proper ſituation, and to do him all the ſervice in his power. In conſequence he introduced him to madame Royer, with whom he was much
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:036316_0270_1008DB0A74CD8C30"/>
acquainted, and deſired her to look out for an aſylum for this young ſtranger; who, thereupon, engaged her uncle D'Imonville to receive him into his houſe, aſſuring him that the abbé Chamillard knew the time would come, when it would be in his power to repay his kindneſs with intereſt. The ſieur D'Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onville, who from this underſtood he was a ſtranger of illuſtrious birth, willingly offered him his houſe and his purſe; and he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with him for ſome time. At firſt, he told his protector, that he was the ſon of Maximilian de Morſan and Emily de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and that an affair, which he could not reveal without great prejudice to himſelf, had obliged him to leave Munich. By this means he evaded for ſome time the queſtions which were put to him: but at length, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the kindneſs with which he was treated in the houſe of D'Imonville, and the repeated acts of friendſhip he had experienced from him and his family, he told them he would no longer conceal his real hiſtory from them, eſpecially as he had hopes of being very ſoon in a ſituation to ſhew his gratitude for their attention to him. "You have," continued he, "proved your attachment to me beyond a doubt, and are worthy of all my confidence; I will not therefore conceal from you, that I am the natural ſon of the elector of Bavaria; who my mother was, I have never been ſo happy as to learn." The ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="271" facs="unknown:036316_0271_1008DABD6FF71550"/>
charmed with this confidence, and to find that he had been of uſe to the ſon of a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign prince, redoubled his attentions: he thought it no breach of confidence to reveal to the abbé Chamillard what he had heard; who anſwered, "What you now tell me, I have long known: I aſſured you, when I firſt introduced this young man to your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that he was of high birth, and I did not deceive you. I am happy in having been the means of your forming a connection, which cannot fail to enrich you. His affairs at preſent are in a train, that affords him a proſpect of very ſoon acquitting himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you." D'Imonville, his wife, and niece, concluded that the affair which was in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a deſign of the elector of Bavaria to legitimate his ſon. Some months paſſed away, during which the family removed to another houſe, the firſt floor of which was inhabited by mademoiſelle du Clos, the celebrated co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median, with whom they became acquainted. In 1719, the chevalier de Morſan told monſieur D'Imonville, that his affairs were now nearly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; that they were likely to ſucceed beyond his hope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

could not himſelf raiſe the ſum required; but he borrowed of a notary two thouſand three hundred livres. He purchaſed for the chevalier proper clothes to appears in at Munich, and a poſt-chaiſe; and, after having made theſe preparations, expected that he ſhould depart: but the young man, when he ſaw every thing ready, could not reſolve to go; he had a love engagement, which he had not reſolution to break through; and he contrived every day ſome new excuſe to delay his journey. D'Imonville, who had formed ſanguine expectations of the future power and wealth of the chevalier, was extremely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined at this negligence, after all the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had made for him; and he reſolved to remonſtrate ſeriouſly with him on the folly of his conduct. The chevalier, on being preſſed by D'Imonville to name an early day for his journey, had no longer any pretence to delay it; but he flew into a paſſion, and words grew high between them. La du Clos who was in the apartment beneath, herd the noiſe, and came up to enquire what was the matter. The ſieur d'Imonville explained the ſubject of their conteſt; and ſaid, he had now made his laſt effort on the chevalier whereupon La du Clos, addreſſing the young man, ſaid to him, "My dear child, ſince monſieur d'Imonville can do no more for you, you ſhall come and live with me, and I will take care of you." The chevalier, tranſported
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:036316_0273_1008DAC0CA076DB8"/>
at having found ſo charming a protectreſs, accepted the offer La du Clos made him; who gave him an apartment on the floor ſhe inhabited, and from that time ſupported him entirely, and even lent him money to repay the advance made by D'Imonville; whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance he ſoon ceaſed to reſent, and they continued to live in friendſhip, as before this little diſagreement. In 1722 he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of entering into the army, and ſerved for ſome time as a cadet, in the company of the chevalier de Malherbe. But his friends repreſenting to him, that the duty of a ſoldier was incompatible with the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his private affairs required, he ſoon afterwards, reſigned. Till 1723, he lived very much in company, and was well received in the moſt brilliant parties in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of St. Germain. Ile frequently ſaw the abbé Chamillard; and was on an equal ſoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of intimacy with father Richard, an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine. But in the month of November of that year he was ſeized with the ſmall-pox, which ſoon appeared to be of the worſt ſort. The fever attending it deprived him of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, many days before his death; and in that ſituation he was viſited by father Conſtant, who found it too late to adminiſter the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the tenth of November the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such was the hiſtory related by monſieur Briſſon, for his clients; whoſe purpoſe it was to prove, that the individual paſſing under the name of the chevalier de Morſan, was not a woman; and certainly not Charlotte Donc, the wife of Robert.</p>
            <p>The ſecond wife of Robert, whoſe hope was, that, if the death of Charlotte Donc could not be proved, Robert would be deemed guilty of bigamy, and that ſhe ſhould by that means be releaſed from her engagement with him, had collected every circumſtance that could ſtrengthen the belief of the chevalier de Morſan being really the perſon he repreſented. In oppoſition to the witneſſes brought by the other party, ſhe produced perſons who gave their teſtimony to many particulars of the life of the chevalier de Morſan. He was fond of violent exerciſe; underſtood fencing, the back-ſword, hunting, and ſhooting; and was a judge of horſes. He was known to have paſſed whole days in field ſports; a degree of fatigue which no woman could have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone: and he frequently played matches at tennis, which kept him in extreme exerciſe for many hours.

Charlotte Donc, who was of middling ſize; for he was very tall and muſcular: but it is certain, that a woman of middling height, if ſhe dreſſes in men's clothes, appears ſhort. Many other particulars were brought, to prove that there was no analogy between Charlotte Donc and the chevalier de Morſan.</p>
            <p>The court, after hearing many arguments on both ſides, could not find any poſitive proof that the ſieurs de Joigny and D'Imon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, with madame Royer and du Clos, had ſecreted Charlotte Donc, and buried her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a falſe name.—On the other hand, as the ſecond wife of Robert could produce no proof of her being alive, either when Robert mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a ſecond time, or at the time ſhe ſued him, they would not condemn Robert for bigamy; whoſe ſecond marriage, therefore, remained good in law: and the truth of this extraordinary affair continued unknown. The fate of the unfortunate Charlotte Donc was at all events deplorable. Whatever errors the peculiarity of her ſituation might have driven her into, were ſolely imputable to the cruelty and miſconduct of her mother.—Dreadful is the lot of a woman, driven into an indiſſoluble union with a wicked or worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less man, at an age when keen ſenſibilities make her fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IN a former part of this volume is related the ſtory of the unfortunate D'Anglade, who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in miſery and ignominy, through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of an unjuſt judge, and the malice of an inveterate proſecutor. The following narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is another inſtance of the fallibility of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man judgment; and, though the unfortunate ſufferer was in an inferior rank of life, his fate was, if poſſible, more to be deplored than that of D'Anglade.</p>
            <p>Madame Mazel was a woman who had paſſed the meridian of life: ſhe was a widow, poſſeſſed of an affluent fortune; and had three ſons, all well eſtabliſhed. René, the eldeſt, was a counſellor of parliament; George, the ſecond, treaſurer of France, for the diſtrict of Paris; and Michael, the youngeſt, major of the regiment of Piedmont.</p>
            <p>But though her family were proſperous, they were not happy. Madame Mazel had taken an averſion to the wife of her eldeſt ſon; and had cauſed her to be confined in a convent, by an order from the king: and this ſhe had intereſt enough to affect, though her
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:036316_0278_1008DB18203F0CF8"/>
ſon himſelf by no means lent her any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The lady had contrived often to eſcape from her confinement, and had as often been forced back by the machinations of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law; whom, of courſe, ſhe hated moſt inveterately. The conduct of madame Mazel herſelf, was ſuch as ſeemed but little to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe the power ſhe aſſumed to puniſh that of another: ſhe had gaming-tables conſtantly in her houſe, and a man called the abbé Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard lived with her on a footing, of intimacy, which did no honour to her reputation.</p>
            <p>This lady's ſervants, in her hotel at Paris, were, two footmen, both lads between ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen and eighteen years old; an old female cook; a coachman; two young women who waited on her perſon; and James le Brun, who had lived with her twenty-nine years, and who was now her butler, intendant, and maître d'hôtel: he poſſeſſed all her confidence, and deſerved it by his attachment to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and his general integrity, which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to the eſteem of all who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the houſe. His miſtreſs left to him all her receipts and payments; and never, in all the ſums that paſſed through his hands, was there the leaſt deficiency or miſtake. The tradeſmen, whom he paid regularly, and every other perſon connected with the affairs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Mazel, ſpoke highly of his honeſty and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

related of him, that one evening, after very deep play had been held it his miſtreſs's houſe, he, on clearing the apartments, found a ſum of money, the owner of which (who did not know the ſum ſhe had loſt, or what ſhe had done with it) he took pains to diſcover, and returned her the whole. Le Brun had a wife and five children, and was the beſt of huſbands and of fathers. His two eldeſt daughters were of that buſineſs which is in France termed co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffeuſes; which rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to our idea of the tire-women of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> laſt century, than to any attendant we have at preſent. In this employment they acquired reputation, not only for their ſkill, but their decent and regular manners: and their father, who had brought them up ſoberly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, was ſo deſirous of their morals being preſerved, that though his miſtreſs, whoſe hotel was much larger than ſhe had occaſion for, offered him an apartment in it for his whole family, he rather choſe to hire an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for them, than to have his daughters in a houſe where gameſters, and other diſſolute and idle people, were perpetually viſiting.—Such was the character of this unfortunate man, James le Brun.</p>
            <p>That of the abbé Poulard, the intimate of madame Mazel, was far from being equally reſpectable. This man, who had taken his vows in the order of jacobins, had lived among them for ſome years; and then, by a bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the pope ſurreptitiouſly obtained, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſociety, to enter into the order of Cluny: but, inſtead of doing ſo, he became the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and confidential friend of madame Mazel.</p>
            <p>Admitted to a table where luxury and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion reigned, the abbé forgot the rules of his profeſſion, and was ſo far from keeping any maigre days, that he criticiſed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the aſperity of a gluttonous maſter of the houſe, on ſuch diſhes as were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to his taſte. His bed-chamber was on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> third floor, ſumptuouſly furniſhed with a bed of blue velvet, lined with crimſon ſilk, and every other article proportionably rich. In ſuch a ſituation, it is not ſurprizing that the abbé Poulard choſe rather to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated than to quit it: and he ſuffered, with great indifference, the excommunication to paſs againſt him by the grand prior of the order of Cluny. Nor was he much more affected by an order given by the advocate-general to the jacobins, to ſeize and confine him. However, after an abode of ſix years in the houſe of madame Mazel, he thought it convenient, for ſome reaſon or other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to avoid farther ſcandal, to take a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the neighbourhood, though he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his apartment in her hotel, and frequently ſlept there: and, that he migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By means of this man, George, the ſecond ſon of madame Mazel, who was known by the name of the ſieigneur de Lignieres, became acquainted with his ſiſter, the widow of a counſellor of Mans, whoſe beauty had made a deep impreſſion on the heart of the ſieur de Lignie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, inſomuch that he had promiſed to marry her: a match the moſt fortunate for her, and therefore greatly wiſhed for by her, and her brother the abbé, but oppoſed by madame Mazel. All theſe circumſtances are related with the moſt minute and tedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Her manner of life, however, was ſuch as made her liable to the deſigns of many others. Every Monday and Friday ſhe kept an open table, where gameſters by pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſſion, of both ſexes, as well as perſons who were unhappily addicted to that ruinous amuſement, aſſembled to dine. After which the houſe, which was very large, was filled with parties of hazard and other games of chance, at which they continued the next day, and often till the next night. Madame Mazel herſelf always retired about eleven o'clock, having firſt gone round to the various tables, to accommodate the loſers
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:036316_0282_1008DB1B2BFF1790"/>
with money, who happened to be without, which ſhe often did to a large amount—a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which, of courſe, gave reaſon to ſuppoſe ſhe had always conſiderable ſums by her. Many of thoſe who frequented her houſe, heard her, on various occaſions, repeat, that ſhe never had a leſs ſum by her than two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand piſtoles.</p>
            <p>She was known to have made a will, in which ſhe had charged her eldeſt ſon, who was her principal legatee, with the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce and lodging of the abbé Poulard, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>g his life. She had given ſix thouſand livres to Le Brun; and divided, between him and her own woman, her linen and clothes. This will was known to many, and was depoſited in the hands of a notary; but ſhe had repeatedly ſaid it was her intention to make another.</p>
            <p>The houſe ſhe inhabited was in rüe Maçon, near the Sorbonne; and as a minute deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſeemed neceſſary to the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, it muſt be repeated here.—The houſe had four floors: to the firſt, the acceſs; was by the great ſtaircaſe; and the firſt apartment was a kind of hall, which ſerved as place for the ſervants<note n="*" place="bottom">The French word is OFFICE; which means, either what we call a larder or pantry, or a butler's pantry.—It is or was uſual to have the latter, which is here to be underſtood in the entrance hall.</note>; in which was a cupboard<note n="†" place="bottom">ARMOIRE; a preſs, as we ſhould call it here.</note>, where the ſilver plate was kept, of which one

of the female ſervants had the key: on the other ſide, a little room had been added, where Le Brun lay, when he did not paſs the night with his family: the other room of this floor was that in which madame Mazel was accuſtomed to receive company. A continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame ſtaircaſe led to the ſecond floor; the firſt apartment of which was an antichamber, opening into another room, looking into the court of the houſe; next to which was the room where madame Mazel ſlept. The firſt of theſe rooms was open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Thus, in this large ſuite of rooms (for they were very ſpacious) madame Mazel was left entirely alone.</p>
            <p>But in her bed-chamber were two other doors, one of which opened immediately from the alcove, <note n="*" place="bottom">In France it is called the ruelle; it is a kind of receſs juſt big enough to hold a bed lengthways, and in it are frequently private doors, which go into other apartments.</note> in which the bed ſtood, to a little priva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> ſtaircaſe; the other to a cloſet, which opened alſo to the ſtaircaſe. In the cloſet
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:036316_0284_1008DB1D16AA0468"/>
was a preſs, the key of which was always put under the bolſter of the bed; and in the preſs was depoſited the key of the ſtrong box.</p>
            <p>The third floor was empty, ſave only that the abbé Poulard ſometimes occupied the apartment fitted up for him in it, which, by the narrow ſtair-caſe before mentioned, had a ſecret communication with the bed-chamber of madame Mazel.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſtory had only two rooms oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied; one by the two footmen, who were brothers, and the other by the two waiting-women, who were ſiſters. The attic ſtory conſiſted of a garret running the whole length of the houſe; where wood, coal, ſtraw, and oats were ſometimes depoſited. A window in the roof opened to the ridge of the houſe, between which ran a gutter, that continued for four or five houſes adjoining, moſt of which were lodging houſes. On the ground floor was the kitchen and a little wood room. The cook was accuſtomed to ſleep in the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen; but, about eight days before the fatal cataſtrophe, ſhe took it into her head to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move her bed into the wood room, which looked towards the ſtreet with a low window. The coachman lay in the ſtable, and the care of the court-yard was left to him; the key of which always hung on a nail in the kitchen, whence the ſervants took it as they wanted it.</p>
            <p>Some time before the death of madame Mazel, ſhe had taken a maſter-key from Le
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:036316_0285_1008DAD4197355C8"/>
Brun, which opened all the doors, ill order to accommodate with it the abbé Poulard; Le Brun had another, which he continued to uſe. To give an account of the houſe, and its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, ſeems neceſſary to the underſtanding the ſubſequent facts. Such minutiae as appear not material are omitted.</p>
            <p>On the 27th November, 1698, being the firſt Sunday in advent, the two daughters of Le <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>run went in the afternoon to pay their reſpects to madame Mazel. She received them with her uſual good-humour, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired they would come ſome other day, when they could paſs longer time with her, as ſhe was then going to veſpers at the convent of Prémentré, rüe Hautefeuille—for ſhe was ever remarkably punctilio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> in the exerciſes of religion. She left her houſe, attended by Le Brun, on whoſe arm ſhe leant, and the two footman followed her. As ſoon as ſhe was in the chapel Le Brun quitted her, and went to hear veſpers himſelf at the Jacobins, rüe St. Jacques; from thence he went to ſee a game at bowls, where he met a lockſmith, called Laguë, who had married a ſervant of madame Mazel's; and they went together to a cook's ſhop, where they purchaſed ſome proviſions, on which they intended to ſup together; then Le Brun went home to his miſtreſs's hotel, and from thence to his wife's lodging, and, at eight o'clock, he went with the coach, and the other footmen, to fetch
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:036316_0286_1008DB1E9CB6F7A8"/>
his lady from the houſe of madame Duvau, according to the orders ſhe had given them; and after he had attended her home, he went to his appointment with Laguë.</p>
            <p>Madame Mazel ſupped, according to her uſual cuſtom, with the abbé Poulard, tête-à-tête. The ſervants, who waited at table, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that he repeated ſeveral times his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of going that night to his lodging in the neighbourhood, though he never before had mentioned what he intended to do of an evening. At eleven o'clock, madame Mazel went to her chamber; and her two women had not quitted her, when Le Brun tapped at the back door of the room. She aſked who it was? and one of the maids anſwered it is mr. Le Brun. Le Brun, finding the door not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately opened, went down, and came round by the great ſtair-caſe to the other door. When he entered the apartment, madame Mazel ſaid to him, "Truly, this is a fine hour to come for orders!"—meaning that he had ſtaid out later than was his cuſtom; ſhe then told him what ſhe would have provided for ſupper the next evening, which was the night on which ſhe kept open table. The maid, as was her uſual method, put the key on the chair; after which they all quitted the room; and Le Brun, who went laſt, drew the door after him and ſhut it. As they (the three ſervants) were going down together, Le Brun ſtopped the two young women, to tell them
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:036316_0287_1008DAD59FAAD790"/>
how kind his miſtreſs had been to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when they waited on her in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and after keeping them in converſation ſome minutes, he wiſhed them a good night; the whole of his behaviour teſtifying his uſual chearfulneſs and ſerenity.</p>
            <p>He then went into the kitchen to take the key of the outward door to lock it; he took it off the hook, but, finding himſelf cold, he laid it down on the table, while he warmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and being fatigued, poſſibly too, having drank more than he was accuſtomed to, he inſenſibly fell aſleep. When he awoke he heard the clock ſtrike one; but knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was one o'clock, or the laſt ſtroke of twelve, or of any other hour. He ran up to lock the outward door (which he was ſurprized to find wide open), and, when he had done ſo, took the key with him into his room; a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution he had ſeldom before taken. The next morning, being the 28th of November, he got up at the uſual hour to buy proviſions, and went to the butcher's. Going thither, he met a bookſeller, a man of reputable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, who knew him, and with whom he talked ſome time, with the utmoſt eaſe and unconcern. To the butcher he ſaid, that the meat muſt be ſent directly, becauſe it would be wanted for broth for his miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>He then went to make other purchaſes, and met two or three of his acquaintances, who walked with him home, and to whom he
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:036316_0288_1008DB27E455CDB8"/>
appeared remarkably chearful. As ſoon as they left him, he went down to give ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the kitchen, and gave the footmen wood for his miſtreſs's apartment. It was by this time eight o'clock, and madame Mazel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>lly aroſe at ſeven. The ſervants expreſſed to each other their wonder, that ſhe had not rung her bell at her accuſtomed time. Le Brun went out a moment to ſee his wife; to whom he gave ſeven louis and ſome other money, which he bade her lock up. Then returning home, he enquired if madame was yet up? and being told ſhe was not, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſurprize and uneaſineſs. That of the whole family now aroſe to ſuch a height, that they determined to endeavour to awaken her, and for that purpoſe they went to the door, rapped loudly, and called. Put all was ſilent. They were then perſuaded, that if ſhe were living, ſhe muſt have heard them, and their t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uble encreaſed. Some ſaid ſhe had fallen into an apoplexy; others, that a bleeding at the noſe, to which ſhe was ſubject, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed her; but Le Brun remarked, that it muſt be ſomething worſe,—"Something," ſaid he, <q>is wrong; I am very uneaſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found the ſtreet-door open laſt night.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They now determined to ſend for her eldeſt ſon, monſieur de Savonnieres who, as ſoon as he came to the houſe, ſent for a lockſmith to open the door: while this was doing, he
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:036316_0289_1008DADA7A5F8EC8"/>
ſaid to Le Brun,—"What can this mean?"—whereupon ſomebody again obſerved that it muſt be an apoplectic fit, and that it would he neceſſary to have a ſurgeon at hand; on which Le Brun again ſaid,—<q>Oh, no! no!—It is ſomething yet worſe. I am ſure there has been miſchief, when I remember that the door was wide open laſt night.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The room being at length opened, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who were aſſembled entered: Le Brun went haſtily to his miſtreſs's bed;—ſhe was aſſaſſinated, and bathed in blood. He ran to the window of the cloſet, which he unbarred, then lifting up the ſtrong box, he cried—"but there is nothing taken from hence—what can this mean?"—Monſieur de Savon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieres ſent for the lieutenant criminal Deffita, the ſame who formed the haſty judgment againſt the unhappy d'Anglade. He laid a complaint in his own name, and that of his two brothers; and ſurgeons were ſent for to examine the body of the deceaſed.</p>
            <p>Above fifty ſmall wounds, made with a knife, were found on her hands, face, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and throat; and theſe laſt, having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a great effuſion of blood, had been the occaſion of her death; for none of the wounds were of themſelves mortal.</p>
            <p>In the bed was found a piece of a lace neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and a towel twiſted up in form of a night-cap; which towel belonged to the houſe, and was marked with an S.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="unknown:036316_0290_1008DB296A4745D0"/>
The cords of the bells were twiſted up above the reach of the hand, and tied to the curtain rod. In the aſhes was found a knife, ſeven or eight inches long, the handle of which had been of tortoiſe-ſhell, but was nearly burnt. The key of the chamber-door was not found on the ſeat, where the waiting woman affirmed ſhe had put it; no door was broke; and the two doors, which opened to the backſtairs were both ſhut and hooked withinſide. The key of the preſs was found under the bolſter, where it was always placed: on opening this preſs, the purſe, in which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Mazel kept her card money, was found, containing about two hundred, and ſeventy-eight livres, in gold. The key of the ſtrong box was in the ſame place: they tried to open the ſtrong box with it, but could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of a lockſmith, who was near a quarter of an hour before he could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it: in it were founds four ſacks, each containing a thouſand livres; and many other bags, containing different ſums; one of which was labelled, "This is the property of the abbé Poulard." Under one of the ſacks was an orange-coloured and green purſe, lined with crimſon ſatin, which was empty, and turned inſide out; and a red leather writing box, on which lay half a louis, and which<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a ſpecimen, among many others, of the trifling and minute deſcription which pervades every French narrative.</note>
               <pb n="291" facs="unknown:036316_0291_1008DADDB58439D0"/>
contained all the jewels of madame Mazel, to the value of fifteen thouſand livres. In her pocket were eighteen piſtoles, in gold.—From all which circumſtances, it appeared as if thoſe who had committed the cruel deed, had done it from ſome other motive than merely that of robbery.</p>

               </gap> Brun was next called upon; who gave, with equal clearneſs, an account of every thing that had happened to himſelf, from the time of his going out with his miſtreſs to veſpers, to the moment of his examination. He was ſearched; and there was found on him the key of the hall, where his pantry was; and a maſter-key with very large wards, which, on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rial, was found to open the door of madame Mazel's chamber: upon which the lieutenant criminal ordered him into cuſtody. On putting on the napkin, it was found too little for his head: they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his hands, but there were no ſigns of blood upon them, or his clothes; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was there, on any part of his perſon, any marks of that reſiſtance, which it was very evident the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate victim had made againſt the ruſſian who had killed her; ſome of whoſe hair ſhe had torn off, and held in her hand. After a very ſlight ſearch in his pantry, nothing was found that indicated his guilt; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:036316_0292_1008DB2AEFFF0C60"/>
which, he was ſent to priſon, and his wife at the ſame time ordered into cuſtody. The magiſtrate then retired, having put his ſeal on the doors and left his officers in the houſe.</p>
            <p>The next day the lieutenant returned again to the houſe of the deceaſed, to examine the cook, the two footmen, and the coachman; but, though he employed ten hours in theſe interrogations, he omitted to examine an old woman<note n="*" place="bottom">And who is not mentioned before among the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the houſe.</note> who lay in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>There was found at the bottom of the back ſtairs, a new rope, tied to an iron hook, and knotted as if it was deſigned for a ladder. Le Brun was again examined in priſon, and neither on his perſon, or in his anſwers, was there found the leaſt cauſe to believe him the guilty perſon. His pantry was again ſearched: they found only a baſket, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome old iron; among which was a hook, and a file; a towel belonging to the houſe marked S, and ſome cords. They then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the lodging of his wife, where nothing was found that tended to criminate him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they ſeized on his linen, to compare it with a ſhirt, which was found ſtained with blood in the garret, hid under ſome ſtraw (and which evidently belonged to the aſſaſſin) and with the lace neckcloth before mentioned.</p>
            <p>The two women declared, that this neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth never had belonged to Le Brun, but ſaid,
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:036316_0293_1008DADF3944D3E0"/>
they remembered having waſhed it for a ſervant called Berry, who had been diſmiſſed from the ſervice of madame Mazel about four months before, becauſe he was detected in robbing her. No ſimilitude was found between the ſhirt and thoſe belonging to Le Brun; nor in any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry that was made, did the ſlighted circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ariſe, that tended to fix the charge on him. The poor man was, however, in the mean time, cloſely confined, and not ſuffered to ſee his wife, his children, or his friends; while the abbé Poulard, who during his firſt examination had fainted, and appeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inder the utmoſt agitation of ſpirit, went to every place, exclaiming, that Le Brun only could be guilty: and he made the ſame decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before the judges, though he brought no proof of it. In default, however, of proof, he invented a ſtory, which he thought would prejudice the public againſt the unhappy Le Brun:—he ſaid, that "madame Mazel had, in her youth, a connection with a nobleman of high rank, by whom ſhe had a ſon; which ſon was that very Berry, who had been ſome months before diſcharged for theft: that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Mazel had been entruſted, by her para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with a very large ſum of money, for the uſe of this ſon; which ſecret was known only to Le Brun; who, in hopes of engaging him to marry one of his daughters, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the myſtery of his birth, and of this depoſit of money, to Berry; and Berry, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:036316_0294_1008DB305C192550"/>
with the concurrence and aſſiſtance of Le Brun, had gone to his mother, madame Mazel, to beſeech a reſtitution, or a proviſion; but that the inhuman mother, inſtead of granting his requeſt, had ſeized, and attempted to ſtrange him; which obliged him, in his own defence, to give her the blows which occaſioned her death."—Though this account, which the abbé pretended to have had from Le Brun, directly charged Berry with the murder; and though the neckcloth was found, which was known to be his, no enquiry was made after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the proſecution was ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued againſt Le Brun.—The ſtory of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationſhip between the deceaſed and Berry, was clearly falſe, as his parents were known to be both living at Bourges: and, on Le Brun's being interrogated, as to the truth of this ſtory, he was ſo far from throwing on the memory of his deceaſed miſtreſs any part of the infamy imputed to her, that he ſpoke of her with the greateſt reſpect; particularly, when he was queſtioned on the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between her apartment and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the abbé Poulard, he anſwered, that he ſhould not anſwer queſtions which had nothing to do with the ſubject of his examination; and that he would ſay nothing that might give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for ſcandal.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth of January, monſieur de Savonnieres preſented a requeſt to the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant criminal, in his own name, and that of
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:036316_0295_1008DAE0C2A4E140"/>
his two brothers, demanding that Le Brun ſhould be declared duly convicted of having aſſuſſinated madame Mazel, and of having robbed her of a quantity of gold coin that was in her ſtrong box: and that he ſhould, at the ſame time, be deprived of, and declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the legacy left him by the deceaſed.—However ſtrange and incredible it may ſeem, it appears very certain, that this legacy was the real ſource of all the enmity of the meſſrs. de Savonnieres againſt the unfortunate Le Brun: and, to deprive him and his children of it, they proſecuted him even to death; while thoſe, whom there was every reaſon to believe the real perpetrators of the crime, were not even enquired after.</p>

Such knowledge could be acquired only

by long obſervation of the cuſtoms of a family; and could be certainly known to nobody ſo well as to Le Brun. He only could have tied up the bell ropes; becauſe nobody elſe could procure admittance to the room, while ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Mazel was abſent, but Le Brun, by means of his maſter-key. To add to the ſtrength of this remark, it was added, that once before, when madame Mazel complained that her bell-cords were tied up ſo high that ſhe could not reach them; Le Brun anſwered, that he had tied them up, becauſe they were in his way when he made the bed, and that he afterwards forgot them: from whence it was inferred, that what he had done once, he might have repeated. The counſel urged, that it was impoſſible to believe, that, in the ſhort interval during which Le Brun declared he had been aſleep in the kitchen, a ſtranger ſhould be able to find his way into the houſe, open the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pleading on behalf of Le Brun.</note> Monſieur d'Ancour, who was employed in favour of Le Brun, made an excellent, though fruitleſs defence. He began with ſhewing, how improbable it was, that a man of ſo excellent a character as Le Brun univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally bore; a man who had brought up a large family in honeſt and ſober principles; whoſe conduct, as a huſband and a father, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impeached; and who had faithfully ſerved his miſtreſs nine-and-twenty years; ſhould now, without motive, without provocation, become the murderer of her, to whom he had ſo long ſhewn the ſincereſt attachment and reſpect: theſe circumſtances made the fact extremely improbable. The next point was to ſhew, that it was impoſſible Le Brun could be guilty of if. The report of thoſe who inſpected the body of the deceaſed, ſaid, that ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived above fifty wounds, and had evidently made great reſiſtance; in conſequence of which, the aſſaſſin muſt have borne on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of that reſiſtance. Le Brun had none; not even the ſmalleſt ſcratch on his hands, or ſpot of blood on his clothes:—the towel, twiſted up like a cap, was ſo much leſs than his head, that he could not put it on: the knife was not his; had never been ſeen in his poſſeſſion:—the neckcloth was known to
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:036316_0298_1008DB66B4EE8D68"/>
belong to another perſon:—the ſhirt was not like any he poſſeſſed; it was unlike, not only in quality, but in ſize; and was made for a little man, whereas Le Brun was very tall and robuſt. — Theſe facts, ſaid M. d'Aucour, are ſo evident, that the accuſers of my client can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny them; forced, therefore, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he cannot have been the actual perpetrator of the crime, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to another charge; and accuſe him of being an accomplice. But this charge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued M. d'Aucour, is even more abſurd than the other. If any unaccountable frenzy could have inſtigated Le Brun to ſuch a deed, he would not have truſted the execution of it to another hand: if he had been prompted by avarice, he would, as he had time enough, have ſecured the large ſum, in money and jewels, which were left behind, and not have contented himſelf with a ſmall part only of what he had riſqued ſo much to obtain. He would certainly have eſcaped before the next morning, inſtead of going, as he did, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly about his uſual buſineſs. But if any domeſtic let in the ruſſian, why muſt it be Le Brun? Why not one of the other footmen, or maids? Why not the coachman in whoſe care the court-yard was left? Why not the cook, who had alſo a maſter-key to the outward door, and in whoſe room was a low window, communicating with the ſtreet, through which ſhe might give the
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:036316_0299_1008DB35010A3088"/>
maſter-key out? Finally, Why might it not be the abbé Poulard, whoſe character was ſuch as made him be ſuppoſed a much more likely man than Le Brun to commit an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crime.—But why muſt it be concluded, that the aſſaſſin was let in at all? Of a houſe open at all times to gameſters of both ſexes, and to crowds of ſervants who attended them, it is not difficult to know the entrance, and the paſſages. Might not the wretch, who medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated murder and robbery, conceal himſelf in the houſe during the day, when all the doors were open to all comers? Might he not have remained there one night, or even more, hid among the ſtraw, coals, and wood, in the garret, which was rarely frequented? Might he not even have come in by means of the trap-door, which opened in the roof, and which was never ſhut? And was there not ſufficient temptation to villany, in a houſe which was known to have a hoard of gold never leſs than two thouſand piſtoles, beſides other monies; and which was ſo eaſy of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs?—There being, therefore, every reaſon to believe the crime was not committed by the intervention of a ſervant; or, if of a ſervant, not of Le Brun; M. d'Aucour demanded, on behalf of his client, that he might be declared innocent, and ſet at liberty.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding this able defence, and that his adverſaries could bring no one proof againſt him, no one preſumptive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:036316_0300_1008DB36AFCCC930"/>
the fatal key in his poſſeſſion, which opened all the doors, determined the judges to condemn him. A yet more powerful motive, perhaps, was, the wiſh of the meſſieurs de Savonnieres to have him condemned! They therefore proceeded, on the eighteenth of January, to judgment. Eleven judges were aſſembled: of whom two declared, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired farther information before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; two voted that he might be put to the queſtion;<note n="*" place="bottom">By torture</note> ſix condemned him to death, and that in the moſt cruel manner that could be deviſed.</p>
            <p>Poor Le Brun was extremely beloved; and the murmurs and complaints of the people, who all believed him innocent, reached the ears of the judges. They ſaid, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that as they knew their deciſion would not be final, but would be appealed againſt, and carried to another court, they determined to make it as ſevere as poſſible, in hopes of frightening the priſoner into a confeſſion of the actual perpetrator of the crime, and all its circumſtances. Thus, inſtead of juſtice, theſe men had recourſe to ſtratagem. Le Brun appealed;<note n="†" place="bottom">But to what court, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>He again urged all that he had before ſet
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:036316_0301_1008DB3ACDE97660"/>
forth, in behalf of his oppreſſed client; and ſet all the improbabilities, he had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, in a yet ſtronger light. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that no one circumſtance could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged againſt him, but the poſſeſſion of a key which turned half round the lock of the apartment where madame Mazel lay: and on ſuch ſlight preſumption they condemned to die, by the moſt cruel torments, a man, who for five-and-forty years (of which twenty-nine had been paſſed in the ſame ſervice) had never been accuſed of the leaſt offence againſt God or man! The fatal key, which is thus to bring him to the ſcaffold, not only was not ſurreptiouſly obtained, but had undergone no alteration to enable it to turn the lock en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; a precaution Le Brun muſt have taken, had he meant to have uſed it to enter his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs's room, after ſhe was in bed; for then the door was double locked, and this key, which would only turn once, was conſequently unfit for the purpoſe. It was objected, by the accuſers of Le Brun, that he ought not to have kept this key; for that madame Mazel, after being robbed by Berry, had taken away the maſter-keys from all her ſervants who poſſeſſed them. It is true, continues M. d'Aucour, ſhe did in a fit of vexation, very natural, yet not very reaſonable, take away from the cook, and from Le Brun, their maſter keys. But ſhe ſoon after gave back to the cook that which ſhe had taken from her; and
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:036316_0302_1008DB3EB15B0A50"/>
as ſhe had given that which Le Brun uſed to carry to the abbé Poulard, ſhe ſuffered him (Le Brun) to uſe that he had by him, and which had been given him many years before, by a ſervant who married out of the family; and Le Brun always did uſe it, not only with the knowledge of all the other domeſtics, but of his miſtreſs herſelf; indeed it was abſolutely neceſſary for him, as he bought all the proviſions for the family, and was obliged to be at market in a morning long before the reſt of the family were ſtirring.</p>
            <p>Beſides, had Le Brun lent the key to the aſſaſſin, he would not have taken it back. He would have ſuffered him to have kept it, or have thrown it away, under pretence that he had himſelf loſt it. It is inconceivable that he would retain what would be brought in evidence gainſt him.</p>
            <p>But why, purſued M. d'Aucour, is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry made after Berry? Berry, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore robbed madame Mazel, and was diſmiſſed in diſgrace; who was known to be an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wretch, capable of any miſchief — to whom the neckcloth was known to belong; who had often applied to be admitted to his place again, but had been refuſed; who was ſeen at Paris about the time the event hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; and had been ſeen ſince with money, which could not have been honeſtly obtained?</p>
            <p>Why is not notice taken of the abbe Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, an equivocal character at beſt; a prieſt, who, after being in two orders, actually belongs
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:036316_0303_1008DB40369EECE8"/>
to none?—who had acceſs at all hours to the houſe of madame Mazel, and who was ſeen to go in at midnight, the evening the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was committed; and who had an intereſt in the death of his benefactreſs, who was an obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cle to the marriage of his ſiſter with her ſecond ſon? Why does the wife of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſon, whoſe inveterate hatred and frequent denunciations of vengeance againſt her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law were well known; why is ſhe not ſuſpected of having hired an aſſaſſin, to put an end to a life ſo obnoxious to her? Any one of theſe perſons, M. d'Aucour affirmed, were much more likely to be the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the homicide than Le Brun, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it was that his miſtreſs ſhould live, not only becauſe he enjoyed an excellent place, but becauſe if ſhe did alter her will, as ſhe ſometimes ſaid ſhe ſhould, he had no reaſon to believe ſhe would leſſen his legacy, but rather to hope ſhe would increaſe it; as ſhe was continually beſtowing additional favours on him and his family, and, as ſhe advanced in years, felt herſelf more and more attached to an old ſervant, careful of her intereſt, and whoſe ſervices ſhe found every day more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in her domeſtic arrangement.</p>
            <p>When all theſe reaſons were added to the univerſal good character of the accuſed, the concern expreſſed by all ranks of people for him (for all believed him innocent), and the total want of proof againſt him, M. d'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:036316_0304_1008DB42CED5AB20"/>
pleaded, that ſo far from the ſentence being confirmed, it undoubtedly ought to be annulled. He again, before he concluded, pointed out to the court the extraordinary conduct of the abbé Poulard, who, with an officiouſneſs very unjuſtifiable, had labo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by falſities, and injurious allegations, to throw the guilt on the unfortunate priſoner.—But the abbé Poulard was not a ſecond time queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d till it was too late.</p>
            <p>The counſel on the other ſide laid the greateſt ſtreſs on the circumſtance of the key; on what Le Brun ſaid, when queſtioned by M. de Savonnieres, <q>This is not apoplexy, but ſomething worſe;</q> and on the ſeven louis given to his wife to lock up, which they pretended to believe was part of the money taken from madame Mazel.</p>
            <p>On the twenty-ſecond of February, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was again to be paſſed by twenty-two judges. Two only of the number demanded farther enquiry; the other twenty decided for the queſtion ordinary and extraordinary.</p>
            <p>The unhappy man was put to this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trial, and, amid the moſt cruel tortures, perſiſted in declaring his innocence.</p>
            <p>As he continued ſteadfaſtly to deny the fact, a new ſentence became neceſſary. On the 27th, the ſame number of judges being again aſſembled, two voted that he ſhoul'd be ſent to the gallies for life; all the reſt voted for a farther enquiry of twelve months againſt Le

But this alleviation of his miſery came too late. The violence of the torments he had undergone was ſuch, that he was reduced to extremity, though a very ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letic and healthy man of forty-five, and his wretched wife had only time to procure him the adminiſtration of the ſacraments.

The ſhirt and the neckloth were proved to be his, by comparing them with what he had found upon him.</p>

de St. Cyr, from one of the eſtates belonging to madame d'Hautefort.</p>
            <p>In this complaint ſhe ſet forth, that ſhe was the daughter of the ducheſs of Choiſeul, born the 8th October 1697;—that the duke her father knew of the pregnancy and delivery of the ducheſs; and that, at the requeſt of both her parents, madame de Hautefort had received her into her care; to which the ducheſs de Choiſeul had, on her death-bed, again moſt earneſtly recommended her, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, too evidently, that the duke totally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected his children, and fearing for the fate of her youngeſt daughter, then in her earlieſt infancy; — that ſhe had always been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and openly treated as their daughter by both her parents:—ſhe therefore demanded to be reſtored to her rights, as heireſs to the duke of Choiſeul.—On this plea ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to commen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e a ſuit; and witneſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, there appeared ſufficient reaſon to believe that the plaintiff was really born of the ducheſs de Choiſeul. To inſtitute however a regular ſuit two things were neceſſary—an extract of the regiſter of baptiſm, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe was found by means of cauſing herſelf to be baptiſed by the name of Auguſtina-Frances de Choiſeul; and, as the duke her father had been remarkably neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in regard to the baptiſm of his other daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (who were not baptiſed till one was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:036316_0314_1008DB5B3A87F2A0"/>

            <p>After ſome meaſures had been taken, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the French law, mademoiſelle de Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeul (as ſhe was now called) ſummoned the duke de la Valliéere to give her an inventory of the fortune and effects of madame de la Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liére, her maternal grandmother, and to make reſtitution of the effects they poſſeſſed as heirs to her mother, the ducheſs de Choiſeul.</p>
            <p>The duke de la Valliére, in his defence, ſaid, that the perſon calling herſelf Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina-Frances de Choiſeul muſt eſtabliſh by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic proofs her claim to that name, and to her title of heireſs of the duke de Choiſeul.</p>
            <p>As the duke de la Valliére could be ſued only as a peer of France, the cauſe was to be heard before the chamber of peers.</p>
            <p>Before that tribunal then was brought the cauſe; when counſel on behalf of mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Choiſeul pleaded,<note n="*" place="bottom">Pleading on behalf of Auguſtina-Frances, calling her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as Choiſeul.</note> 
               <q>That the duke de la Valliére had been a witneſs to the birth of their client; that he had promiſed his ſiſter, the ducheſs de Choiſeul, to take care of her infant through every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her life: but when he found that, by ſuppreſſing what he knew of her birth, he ſhould divide conſiderable property as heir to that ſiſter, he ſcrupled not to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

every promiſe he had given her, not only on the birth of her child but again when ſhe was dying; and now, when her daughter claimed her own property, deſired to have authentic proof of what he knew better than any one—proofs, which it was the more difficult for her to bring, as all the family papers were in the hands of the very perſon who demanded them, and whoſe intereſt it was to conceal every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the conteſted fact.</q> If, ſaid they, the duke de la Villiére has done this, he is certainly liable to the proſecution of mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Choiſeul; if he has not done it, ſhe is guilty of a falſe and injurious accuſation, and muſt ſubmit to the puniſhment that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſuch an offence.</p>

de Choiſeul.</q> "But," continued the counſel for the duke de la Valliére, <q>who will ſay that the duke ſuppreſſed the claims of a daughter, who was never owned by her father? While <hi>he</hi> lived, the duke de la Valliére had nothing to do with the fortune of the Choiſeul family; and when he died, how is it poſſible that the duke de la Valliére could foreſee that the two daughters he left would both die unmarried, one at the age of twenty-ſeven, and the other at twenty-eight? Unleſs he <hi>had</hi> foreſeen that by theſe improbable events he ſhould poſſeſs his niece's property, it could not be worth his while, by unjuſtifiable and diſhonourable means, to throw into obſcurity the birth of a third daughter of his ſiſter. The marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs de Hautefort pretended, that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs de Choiſeul, when in her laſt ſickneſs, conjured her by their long friendſhip, to take care of her infant daughter, whom her death would leave to the mercy of a father who ſhewed the moſt cruel indifference to all his children. If this was the caſe, why did the marchioneſs de Hautefort give her another name? Why did ſhe ſuffer ſo many acts to be paſſed in which the name of her ward was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely omitted? Why did ſhe not preſent her to her grandmother, her relations, her father?

there appeared any backwardneſs in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to acknowledge her, or if any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attended it which might make her legitimacy liable to be diſputed?</q>—Theſe ſeem to be the ſtrongeſt points urged in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the duke de la Valliére.—The facts aſſerted on behalf of mademoiſelle de Choiſeul, and of which facts ſhe deſired leave to bring proof, were the following,<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs offered to be brought by mademoiſelle de Choiſeul.</note> 
               <q>That the ducheſs de Choiſeul, whoſe pregnancy was known to all her huſband's family and her own, was, on the 8th of October, 1697, delivered of a daughter, in a houſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her and the duke, rüe de Verneuil, fauxbourgh St. Germain, and while ſhe lay-in received the complimentary viſits of all the family;—that as ſoon as the infant was born, the accoucheur, apprehending it was likely to die, had ſprinkled it, in the uſual form appointed in ſuch caſes;—that ſoon afterwards madame de Choiſeul fell into a declining ſtate of health, and feeling her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in danger, recommended her third daughter moſt earneſtly to the care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of her friend, madame d'Hautefort, and to that of her brother, the duke de la Valliére; and that ſhe gave to the former two pictures of herſelf, and ſome other effects, which ſhe beſought her to give to her young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daughter, that ſhe might have ſome
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:036316_0318_1008DB68483A75E8"/>
memorial of her mother; and that when the ducheſs was dead, madame d' Haute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort took the child from the village of Meu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where ſhe was at nurſe, and put her, together with her nurſe, into lodgings, rüe St. Antoine, where the duke de la Valliére often viſited her; from thence ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the houſe of one Laſalle, rüe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that ſhe might be more immediately under the eye of madame d'Hautefort, where the duke continued to ſee her, and whither he ſometimes came, accompanied by madame d'Hautefort and La Comme, a woman who had for many years been a faithful and favoured ſervant of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs de Choiſeul; and the duke de la Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liére frequently made little preſents to the nurſe, to encourage her to take care of the infant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That at the age of two years and a half, madame d'Hautefort brought the little de Choiſeul home to her own houſe, where ſhe lived till the commencement of the ſuit, and where the duke de la Valliére, her uncle, continued to ſee and to acknowledge her as his niece; and though ſhe was uſually known by the name of mademoiſelle St. Cyr, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he was allowed to have a claim to that of de Choiſeul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The counſel related the names and abodes of the various nurſes under whoſe care the infant was at different times placed; and of
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:036316_0319_1008DB6B5D85B958"/>
her governeſs, who was particularly charged with her education, under the direction of madame d'Hautefort; and laſtly offered to prove, that the duke de la Valliére had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged repeatedly, that the little girl, of whom madame d'Hautefort had the care, was the daughter of his ſiſter, the ducheſs de Choiſeul.</p>
            <p>To add ſtrength to this allegation, a letter was produced, written by the marchioneſs de Tournon to the marchioneſs d'Hautefort, which contained theſe words: <q>I am very ſorry, madame, that the ill health of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de St. Cyr prevents my ſeeing you, as I have nothing more at heart than to aſſure you of my gratitude. I wiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ardently than to ſee the affair you know of brought to a concluſion; it is certainly that which affects the health of our amiable ſongſtreſs.—My friend, of whom I have an high opinion (whom you ſaw with me on Sunday, and who left me on your entrance, believing we had buſineſs), told me yeſterday that he wiſhed very much to ſee you here, to give you his opinion of the buſineſs, in which he ſees no difficulty; but in the management of which, able perſons are abſolutely neceſſary, and ſuch he will name to you. Conſider, therefore, whether, to-morrow, Saturday, or Sunday, you cannot give me an hour of your time after dinner, as he will meet you
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:036316_0320_1008DB6F239540C0"/>
here on receiving notice; and, as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the viſits of all my relations, we ſhall not be interrupted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I hope the child will be well; if not, ſhe muſt come ſick. I ſhall be charmed with this opportunity of converſing with you, and of aſſuring you of my tender attachment. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to conclude without either compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſignature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this letter it clearly appears, that the amiable ſongſtreſs, the child, and mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle St. Cyr, ſpoken of in it, are the ſame perſon; and that madame de Tournon then acknowledged her to be her ſiſter's child, and even intended to aſſiſt in reſtoring her to the rank to which ſhe had a right.</p>
            <p>Mademoiſelle de Choiſeul having now col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, by her lawyers, a body of evidence which appeared very ſtrong, was adviſed to proceed againſt the duke de la Valliére, the chevalier, and madame de Tournon, together; otherwiſe ſhe might, after having ſucceeded againſt one, be liable to the ſame difficulties with the other two. They were ſummoned to appear, and to be examined. The duke was firſt queſtioned; his anſwers were evaſive, and it ſeemed that he ſuffered a ſtruggle between the truth he kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w, and the falſehood it was his intereſt to maintain. The counteſs de Tournon abſolutely denied every thing; but when the letter above recited was read to her, ſhe appeared hurt and confuſed; yet perſiſted
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:036316_0321_1008DB70A940AF28"/>
in affirming, that the letter did not relate to mademoiſelle St. Cyr.</p>
            <p>The chevalier de la Valliére, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, honeſtly told all he knew; and from his account, mademoiſelle de Choiſeul gained an advantage, that all the efforts of the duke could not counteract.</p>
            <p>Thus provided, this young perſon, hitherto appearing as a private gentlewoman, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the bounty of madame d'Hautefort, prepared to bring that ſuit to an iſſue, which was to riſe her to an exalted rank, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to her the poſſeſſions of one of the moſt illuſtrious houſes in France.</p>
            <p>But before ſhe had proceeded far, an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected diſcovery threw new light on the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of her birth; ſhe was told that one Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>c had in his poſſeſſion a regiſter, which had for a great length of time been kept by his father (who had been dead ten years); and that as he (the elder) had attended the ducheſs of Choiſeul, it was probable that whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the birth of her youngeſt daughter would be found entered in this book.</p>
            <p>Her lawyers therefore ſummoned Leduc, who the next morning appeared before Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, a notary employed in the affair: he produced the book, in which his father had carefully minuted the times of his various at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, the money he received, and every other circumſtance that occurred in his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. There was found a detail of his firſt
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:036316_0322_1008DB7340A2E338"/>
viſit to madame de Choiſeul, of his having afterwards bled her; and at length, that on the 7th of October, 1697, he was ſent for to her at ſix o'clock in the evening, when he found her in labour, and who, between the hours of two and three the next morning, was delivered of a fine girl; which infant was entruſted to him to be put out to nurſe; and which, on the 11th of October following, he carried to Meudon, having firſt made a ſlight raſure of the ſkin under the right ham, and again a little lower on the leg, which he rubbed with gunpowder: a method which makes a mark that never can be effaced.—Theſe marks, mademoiſelle de Choiſeul bore.—Leduc then mentioned in his book, <q>that he had carried the infant to St. Etienne du Mont to be baptiſed, where ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the name of Julia;</q> but without ſpeaking of her parents, godfather or godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His journal alſo contained an account of money received and expended; among other articles, that he paid four livers ten ſons for the coach that carried him with the child to Meudon;—that he received various ſums, at times, for the maintenance of the child; and, among others, was a memorandum, that he was paid thirty new louis for his attendance, by the <hi>marſhaleſs</hi> de Choiſeul; a name which occaſioned the adverſe party to aſſert, that the whole tranſaction did not allude to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs de Choiſeul, but to ſome other woman of
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:036316_0323_1008DB75DBA5F8F0"/>
faſhion bearing the name of de Choiſeul. (There were then five or ſix marchioneſſes and counteſſes de Choiſeul in France.)</p>
            <p>The marſhaleſs de Choiſeul it certainly could not mean, as ſhe was eighty years old; and it is improbable, as ſhe was not on good terms with the ducheſs, that ſhe ſhould have undertaken, through friendſhip, to ſettle with Leduc on her account.</p>
            <p>All the articles however of Leduc's regiſter, which related to the conteſted point, were extracted, and inſerted in the inſtruments preparing by the lawyers on behalf of made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Choiſeul; who alſo deſired to have this book depoſited in ſafe hands, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe might be had to the original when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. To this Leduc, the ſon, conſented. But, as there were memorandums in it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to an infinite number of perſons, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to have the liberty to ſeal up himſelf every leaf in which there was nothing that related to mademoiſelle de Choiſeul. This was proper and reaſonable; and in that form the book remained to be inſpected by the court.</p>
            <p>The duke de la Valliére uſed every effort to prevent the journal of Leduc being received as evidence. When he found that he could not accompliſh it by other means of oppoſition, he inſiſted upon having the whole book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected; poſſibly ſuppoſing, that the contents of ſuch a journal being publicly known, might
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:036316_0324_1008DB78AA817070"/>
be attended with ſuch inconvenience, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſo much confuſion, that the court it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would interfere to ſtifle the whole. In this alſo he failed. The ſix judges who were to decide upon the cauſe, took the book them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and having examined it, found only fourteen articles which related to the cauſe in queſtion; one of their number took a copy of thoſe articles, and the book was carefully locked up.</p>
            <p>The duke then made another effort to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the evidence of the book entirely, but his attempt again failed. He was now therefore obliged to ſubmit to have the cauſe tried in the very court, againſt the deciſions of which he had, in the courſe of the controverſy, twice appealed. The lawyers employed by made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Choiſeul failed not to urge, with great ability, all the facts herein ſtated, to ſubſtantiate the claim of their client.</p>
            <p>From the anſwers given by the duke de la Valliére himſelf, the celebrated Le Normand, counſel for the plaintiff, drew an inference favourable to her cauſe. The duke never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he did <hi>not</hi> believe mademoiſelle de Choiſeul was born of his ſiſter; but only, that he did not know or believe that ſhe was the daughter of the <hi>duke</hi> and ducheſs of Choiſeul; by which he tacitly allowed ſhe might be the offſpring of the ducheſs; and while he could not deny the maternity, threw indirectly a reflection on the honour of his ſiſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="unknown:036316_0325_1008DB7B4A3C77D8"/>
The letter written by madame de Tournon was a ſtrong preſumptive evidence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all her attempts to explain away its meaning; but the evidence given by the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier de la Valliére was yet more concluſive. He acknowledged, that he knew his ſiſter, the ducheſs de, Choiſeul, had four children, a ſon and three daughters;—that his mother, and all the family, were appriſed of her pregnancy in 1697;—that he knew the daughter of which ſhe had been delivered was brought up by madame d'Hautefort, under the name of St. Cyr;— and that, when his ſiſter was dying, ſhe told him ſhe had recommended her youngeſt daughter to the protection, not only of madame d'Hautefort, but to that of her brother, the duke de la Valliére; and that they had both promiſed to watch over her welfare. To theſe forcible evidences, was added the journal of Leduc; and the whole ſeemed to form a body rather of poſitive facts than preſumptive proof.</p>
            <p>The duke de la Valliére's defence conſiſted chiefly in reprobating the whole conduct of the defenders of mademoiſelle de Choiſeul; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly their availing themſelves of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Leduc, in which circumſtances were mentioned, which threw an odium on the conduct of the ducheſs de Choiſeul, had they been true; though it is obſervable, that the duke de la Vaillére's frequent repetition of his aſſertion, <hi>that he did not believe the plaintiff
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:036316_0326_1008DB7F4EA26620"/>
to be the daughter of the duke and ducheſs</hi> of Choiſeul, threw the ſame kind of reflection on the memory of his ſiſter. —The fact certainly was, that the plaintiff was born eight months and ſome days after the arrival of the duke de Choiſeul from being an hoſtage at the court of the duke of Savoy; and for four years preceding that period he did not reſide in the houſe with the ducheſs, though he ſometimes ſaw her.</p>
            <p>When he was at Paris, he reſided at the temple, while the ducheſs inhabited a houſe in rüe Verneuil; circumſtances that, together with the myſterious manner in which the child was brought up, certainly had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of improper conduct in the ducheſs. On this, however, the duke de la Valliére laid no ſtreſs, but to exclaim againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of mademoiſelle de Choiſeul, who, in order to force herſelf into a family and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to which he proteſted ſhe had no right, ſcrupled not to ſtigmatiſe as an adultreſs, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the moſt unimpeached and reſpectable character; and to diſturb, with an odious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, the aſhes of her from whom ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to derive her being.</p>
            <p>But it was neceſſary, that, inſtead of idle declamation, the duke de la Valliére ſhould bring proof that his ſiſter, the ducheſs de Choiſeul, did not bring forth a child at the time this daughter was ſuppoſed to be born; or that, if ſhe did, this was not the perſon.
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:036316_0327_1008DB8249DB73E8"/>
Totally failing in thoſe proofs, an arret paſſed in the great chamber, by a majority of twenty-two voices againſt nine, permitting made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Choiſeul to prove to the court all the points her counſel had alleged. The whole power and intereſt of the duke de La Valliére and his friends were exerted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this arret from being carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>They tried to prevail on the king to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate the whole proceeding, by an act of arbitrary power; but the affair being laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the council of ſtate, the arret was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.—In conſequence of all the proofs being examined, ſentence was given, in June 1726, whereby Auguſtina-Frances de Choiſeul was fully eſtabliſhed and maintained in her claim; and was declared to be the daughter of Auguſtus de Choiſeul, duke and peer of France, and of his wife, Louiſa Gabriella de la Beaume le Blanc de la Valliére; and all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were forbidden, either by a renewal of the ſuit, or in any way whatever to trouble her.</p>
            <p>Mademoiſelle de Choiſeul, whoſe health had always been extremely delicate, had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch agitation of ſpirits during this long and expenſive conteſt, as greatly to impair it. When the ſuit, at ſome period of its progreſs, took a turn which made her friends tremble for her ſucceſs, ſhe fainted, and was carried out of court totally inſenſible. And to the anxiety of her mind it may be imputed, that
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:036316_0328_1008DB83D071C338"/>
ſhe enjoyed her good fortune only a very ſhort time. She had hardly been poſſeſſed of her rank eighteen months, when ſhe fell into a decline, and died, as both her ſiſters had done, unmarried, and under thirty.</p>
            <p>The influence of avarice appears very ſtrong in this hiſtory. The duke de la Valliére undoubtedly knew that mademoiſelle de Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeul was his niece; yet he could not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to acknowledge her, when a reſtitution of her fortune was in queſtion the ſame cruel ſelf-intereſt prevailed with madame de Tournon. It muſt however be allowed, that the circumſtances of the birth, and myſterious manner in which the marchioneſs d'Haut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rt, the friend of the ducheſs de Choiſeul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated her daughter, had a very unfavourable appearance; yet as ſo little is known of the character of the duke her huſband, and that little does, not place it in a very advantageous light, it was perhaps owing to his capricious or ſuſpicious temper, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to adopt meaſures injurious to the reputation of the ducheſs, and fatal to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of her daughter.</p>
            <p>The cauſe is related at great length by Guyot de Pitaval; but this abridgment is taken from the edition of Les Cauſes Célébres, by Richer, in which it occupies two hundred and twenty pages, containing many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances unneceſſary or improper to be here related.</p>

            <head>RENEE CORBEAU.</head>
            <p>A YOUNG man, native of Séez in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, of noble parents, ſtudied the law at Angers. He there ſaw Renée Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau, the daughter of a tradeſman of the town, and under a promiſe of marriage ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her. Her ſituation was ſoon ſuch as made it neceſſary to acquaint her parents with her engagement; who ſought for means to oblige her lover to perform thoſe promiſes which had induced Renée to liſten to him.</p>
            <p>Doubting that he would, if poſſible, evade them, the parents thought it might be neceſſary to employ artifice. They therefore pretended to take a journey; and, as ſoon as they believed the lovers were together, returned ſuddenly upon them, and, reproaching the young man with having ſeduced their daughter, inſiſted on his inſtantly making the only reparation in his power, by ſigning a contract of marriage, with which a notary was prepared, who was ready in the houſe. The young man ſigned the deed; but, feeling himſelf unworthily treated, in being thus ſurprized into an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement which he had never refuſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:036316_0330_1008DB87DF581BE0"/>
he went immediately to his father, to whom he related all that had happened. The father, yet more enraged than the ſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to take prieſt's orders, as the only way to avoid completing a marriage ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable and ſo contrary to his intereſt; and this advice he haſtily embraced. The unfortunate girl, thus abandoned by her faithleſs lover, commenced, together with her parents, a ſuit againſt him for ſeduction. He was in conſequence arreſted, and the affair was brought before the parliament of Paris.</p>
            <p>The ſentence, after long pleading on both ſides, was, that the young man, ſhould either marry Renée Corbeau, or be beheaded: as his being a prieſt made the former impoſſible, he was to ſuffer death.</p>
            <p>He was delivered to the executioner; the fatal moment was at hand, and the prieſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to perform the laſt duties—when Renée Corbeau flew to the place where his judges were yet ſitting, and, making her way through the crowd, beſought permiſſion to ſpeak; and a moment's ſuſpenſion of the dreadful puniſhment about to be inflicted on her lover.</p>
            <p>The judges, ſtruck with her beauty and diſtreſs, conſented to hear her and with the ſimple and affecting eloquence of nature ſhe plead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for his life. She repreſent that they undoubtedly thought her more unhappy than
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:036316_0331_1008DB8CEF606718"/>
guilty, ſince they puniſhed with death him who was ſuppoſed to have betrayed her; but that ſuch a ſentence, far from repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her misfortune, would render it irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, by taking from her the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who could reſtore her honour; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of doing her juſtice, would condemn her to tears and remorſe for the reſt of her life; and would leave her to endleſs regret, when ſhe reflected, that her fatal love had been the occaſion of his death, for whom only ſhe wiſhed to live.</p>
            <p>She beſought thoſe among her judges, who had ever been ſenſible of the force of love, to put themſelves for a moment in her ſituation, and to reflect what they would themſelves ſuffer, were they to be deprived of the object of their affection, by a cruel death, and to know themſelves the occaſion of it;—<q>for it is</q> ſaid ſhe, <q>I who have armed the iron hand of law againſt him—'tis I who am his executioner—and 'tis I who, infinitely more unhappy then he is, am condemned to exiſt under infamy, and to carry with me to the grave the dreadful reflection of having murdered him by the exceſs of my attachment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though the holy orders, into which he had entered, prevented his marrying her, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented that they had been compulſive, and made only through fear of a violent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious father: but that a diſpenſation might
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:036316_0332_1008DB8E73E06540"/>
be obtained to diſſolve them. She therefore implored the judges to ſuſpend the execution of the ſentence for a time, that her lover might take meaſures to annul his religious vows, and become her huſband.</p>
            <p>The court, affected by her tears and deſpair, were induced to grant a reſpite, for ſix months; and, as a legate from the pope was then expected in France, ſhe flattered herſelf ſhe ſhould obtain from him, permiſſion for her lover to renounce the eccleſiaſtical habit and marry her.</p>
            <p>But the cardinal de Medicis, who was the legate that ſoon after arrived, was ſo irritated againſt the young man, for having ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly embraced holy orders, only to evade an engagement which his honour and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as well as every human law, urged him to fulfil, that he abſolutely refuſed to grant the diſpenſation; and the unhappy Renée Corbeau was again driven to deſpair.—Henry the fourth, that excellent monarch, was then on the throne; his ears were ever open to the complaints of his ſubjects, and when youth and beauty pleaded, there was little doubt of redreſs from his compaſſion, though his juſtice was ſilent. Renée Corbeau threw herſelf at the king's feet, and the king, intereſted by her figure and ſituation, very ſoon ſuffered himſelf to be prevailed upon. He ordered that a diſpenſation might be granted; it was immediately expedited, and
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:036316_0333_1008DB912CA08B98"/>
the lover thus ſnatched from impending deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, was married to his miſtreſs. They lived together many years in the moſt perfect union: the huſband always remembering, with the tendereſt gratitude, that he owed his life, and the honour of his family, to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and attachment of his wife.</p>
