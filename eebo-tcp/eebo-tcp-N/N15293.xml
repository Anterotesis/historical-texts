            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following Sermon, with its Appendix, is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at the requeſt of ſeveral characters of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in this county, with a large number of people who attended the execution. The hazardous and uneaſy ſituation of the preacher; who, for the ſake of accommodating a very numerous aſſembly, ſpoke from a gallery window, did very much maim and retrench the haſty compoſition he had provided for the occaſion. This circumſtance added to a ſcene ſo rare, ſingular and ſolemn, with the eager and attentive multitudes preſent, ſuggeſted the hope of utility from its publication in the preſent enlarged form. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſentiments of a conſiderable number of perſons, the ignorance and licentiouſneſs of others, and the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of government, evidently require a popular diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on burglary. A good intention will therefore juſtify the following attempt; while the manner of its execution can honeſtly plead an excuſe, the novelty of the ſubject; and that it was, a part of the definition excepted, imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely the reſult of the writer's own reflections, unaſſiſted by any page on the ſubject he ever ſaw.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this pitiable object, who ſtands before us, we behold, at once, an inſtance of the folly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of human nature, and a moving <hi>ſpectacle</hi> of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and horror, 'to the world, to angels, and to men.' He is one of our kindred race, who, for a capital crime, has lately received, from an earthly tribunal, a ſentence of death, which is this day to be carried into final, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal execution upon him.</p>
            <p>This is the tragical ſcene, and moſt ſolemn occaſion, which have brought together this numerous aſſembly. O the day, the critical day, is come! the deciſive hour is at hand, which muſt end a mortal life, and fix an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul in heaven or hell! before this ſun goes down, his body, now vigorous and active, will be a lifeleſs ghaſtly corps, coffined and buried, deep down among the ſheeted dead, while his ever-exiſting ſoul, like the dying miſer's in the goſpel, 'this night,' yea, before night, 'will be required of him,' and ſent into the world of ſpirits, to ſmile or mourn forever. To this poor priſoner, therefore, if not to ſome of us, it is beyond all doubt, that this is the laſt opportunity for public worſhip; and the only meſſage from the goſpel of peace, which he will ever hear in this world. And O may he ſo hear that his ſoul ſhall live! for this, 'God forbid that any of us ſhould ceaſe to pray,' until he ceaſes to breath—let every heart in this great audience, be lifted up to heaven, in fervent, united prayer to the 'Father of Mercies,' that the ſame 'exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace,' which was once ſo gloriouſly magnified, and moſt triumphantly diſplayed, in pardoning a penitent
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019407_0005_0FABAAE3E7259370"/>
thief, may this day reach and conquer the heart of this malefactor. Oh that the divine Philanthropiſt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable original of all love and compaſſion to our guilty race, who once ſpoke from his own croſs, the merciful words recorded in the text, to a dying criminal, would again ſpeak, 'as the Lord from Heaven,' to another, and 'ſay unto him, this day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.'</p>
            <p>SUCH obſervations and memoirs, on the life of this penitent malefactor and his unrelenting companion, as can be made practically uſeful, I propoſe to conſider, carefully avoiding all unconcerning ſpeculations, all dry unaffecting truths, leſt I incur upon this occaſion the deſerved cenſure of that cruel father, who, 'when his ſon aſks him for bread will give him a ſtone.' 'This I ſay brethren, the time is ſhort,' every moment is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious beyond compariſon, an immortal ſoul is at ſtake; ſome of the laſt ſands in the glaſs of a mortal life are this inſtant falling upon the very verge of life, juſt ready to plunge into eternity; there he ſtands in jeopardy every hour, yea every paſſing minute. Haſten to the point then, let us immediately, the intereſting practical point, which for the ſake of method, may be divided and diſtinctly conſidered in the manner following:</p>
            <p n="1">I. DESCRIBE the character of this dying thief, as a real penitent.</p>
            <p n="2">II. CONSIDER the promiſe our Lord made to him as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="3">III. APPLY the ſubject to ourſelves, and to this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE perſon whoſe character, as a penitent, we are now to deſcribe is by the ſacred penmen ſtiled a malefactor and a thief, by which it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he had been addicted to many other vices beſides theft, though this alone is mentioned. An aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant vice or ruling paſſion of ſome kinds may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be found ſingle and alone in the ſame perſon; ſuch as avarice, intemperance and the like; but whoever
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019407_0006_0FABAAE4C5533C48"/>
well conſiders the compoſition of human nature, will at once acknowledge that thoſe crimes which are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of deliberation and forethought (as theft uſually is) can but rarely, if ever, exiſt alone and unaccompanied with other vices. Common ſenſe hath ſo far adopted this idea, as to frame a proverbial ſaying upon its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral truth. 'They who ſteal will lie;' which is further ſupported by a paſſage of ſcripture well known by the name of Augur's prayer—'give me not poverty, leſt I ſteal and lie, or take the name of my God in vain.' This being conſidered, it will, perhaps, be natural to conclude that this thief had been a very lewd, prophane, abandoned creature, one of the mere rabble rout of wretched men; and that he had ſpent his days, and now almoſt finiſhed his life, in a licentious courſe of flagrant vice—'as in water face anſwereth to face, ſo the heart of man to man.' But how far the heart or life of the malefactor here deſcribed anſwereth to that who is here preſent, is only known to God and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 'Curſed be that pride, for it is cruel,' and that pleaſure, for it is ſordid, ill-natured and infernal, which too often ſeek indulgence, in upbraiding and 'tormenting' a fellow-ſinner 'before the time.'—I have ſuggeſted a compariſon of characters in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as I may in ſome others, only for the ſake of ſalutary conviction. But however vicious and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the malefactor under conſideration had been, yet we are from the beſt authority aſſured, that through 'the exceeding abundant grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,' he was led to repentance, and received a full pardon; and for this cauſe he, as well as perſecuting Saul and others, obtained mercy, that in them Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long ſuffering, for a pattern to them who ſhould hereafter believe on him. Let every other relenting criminal look at theſe patterns of mercy, and flee, inſtantly flee, for life, flee for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope, the ſame all-glorious hope ſet before them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:019407_0007_0FABAAE6905E6248"/>THE evidence upon which we conſider this thief as a true penitent, ariſes from the ſubſequent induction of particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. HE evidently had a ſenſe and conviction of heart that he deſerved to die—'we indeed (ſays he to his comrade) ſuffer juſtly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds.' This is the language of a penitent, and it implies at leaſt that he approved of his own ſentence, which in caſe of theft was, according to the Roman law, death, by crucifixion; nor does it appear that he once diſputed the juſtice of a law which made his crime, or any other beſides murder, a capital offence. This however has been called in queſtion by too many among us, and even by this priſoner, who yet owns his deſert of death by the divine law. The thought is indeed painful and degrading, that any ſhould openly diſpute the juſtice of that ſentence, founded as it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of our own laws, and which they have this day come to ſee executed upon this unhappy priſoner. Is there not ſufficient cauſe, my friends, for all the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of benevolent pity, and the moſt generous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards his perſon, even while indignation and horror ariſe in our hearts againſt his crime: Certainly there is; indulge them freely then upon this occaſion; our Saviour himſelf pitied and wept over obdurate Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, at the very time he expreſſed his diſlike and abhorrence of her conduct in ſtoning the prophets. Reſentment and benevolence are 'both joined together in this divine example, let no man put them aſunder.' No man can be tempted to do it, who properly conſiders the atrocious nature of burglary (the name of the crime for which this priſoner muſt die.) When the tender paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions riſe, and run before reaſon, or, if through inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an ill-judged pity, we do not conſider the nature, nor trace the conſequences of a crime, we ſhall miſtake and pronounce that rigour and cruelty, which is only a neceſſary guard to life, peace and property.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Appendix</note> It is worthy of particular notice, that when this penitent thief
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019407_0008_0FABAAE6E202A270"/>
was actually nailed to the croſs, he frankly owns, for himſelf and his companion, that the penalty was juſt in death; 'we ſuffer juſtly,' was his honeſt confeſſion; and it looks like true repentance, becauſe it further implies that,</p>
            <p n="2">2. HE had a painful and affecting ſenſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic evil and baſeneſs of his crime, as committed againſt God, and conſidered as a violation and contempt of <hi>his</hi> law and government. The words in which he expreſſes his guilt and deſert of puniſhment, ſtrongly imply a ſenſe and ſorrow of heart, not merely becauſe he had by theft injured his fellow-men and violated a law of his country, which forbid it, but chiefly becauſe he had, tranſgreſſed 'the law of his God,' which ſaith, 'thou ſhalt not ſteal'—'by this law is the knowledge of ſin;' and here, as in a glaſs, the penitent beholds all the deformed features of his depraved ſoul, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs foul ſpots and errors of his unhallowed life: He looks within, and there he finds an heart ſtupid and ſtubborn, and full of the lumber of the world, proud, and prone to rebel, diſaffected to God and his law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things, and above all, deceitful to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Here on his heart lies the burden of his ſorrow and complaint. 'The commandment is exceeding broad,' in his view, reaching every thought of his heart, as well as every action of his life; and even while he finds himſelf condemned by this law, he feels his very heart echoing to it, in all its precepts, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions and penalties, as 'holy, juſt and good.'—This, in a word, paints and places ſin before his eyes, in all its hateful colours and horrid deformity: This renders it 'exceeding ſinful,' and above all, as it is againſt God, a holy God. Oh the relentings and remorſe of David's broken heart, when he thought on his crime as committed againſt ſuch a God. Swallowed up in grief and horror on this account, he ſeems almoſt to have forgotten that ever he had injured Uriah or Bathſheba, or any other being except God:—'Againſt thee, thee only, have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight.'
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019407_0009_0FABAAE79D5B2EB8"/>
Such a view of ſin alſo made Joſeph prefer a dungeon to forbidden pleaſure, and bound him, though in all the heat and vivacity of youth, 'in cords and fetters,' ſtronger than the ſeven cords of Sampſon, or chains of adamant. 'How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God.' This, to add one inſtance more, this pierced deepeſt into the heart of the prodigal ſon, when 'he came to himſelf,' and thought on a return, and on what he had been doing; 'father (ſaid he) I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee.' A view of ſin like this is an eſſential ingredient in the nature of all true repentance; for a perſon may hate ſin, and be very ſorry for it, merely becauſe it has blackened his character, hurt his temporal intereſt, diſgraced his family, brought pain and puniſhment on his body, or becauſe it will ruin his ſoul forever—If ſuch ſorrow as this were true repentance, then Judas and Pharaoh and Simon Magus, and almoſt all malefactors condemned to die, are true penitents. Self-love, and not the love of God, averſion to pain, and not to ſin as ſuch, are the principles from whence flow all ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of this kind; while that which deſerves the name is a very different and much more diſintereſted thing; it ſprings from a real ſenſe and ſight of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of ſin, in its own nature; and hence every true penitent has a kind of inbred antipathy, a deep-rooted hatred to every ſin, to one as well as another; like David 'he hates every falſe way,' without one excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without any indulgence to a favourite iniquity.</p>
            <p>BUT the ſorrows of true repentance, will appear ſtill more kindly and ingenuous, if we conſider</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT a belief of the pardoning mercy of God through Chriſt is implied in it; and this is another proof that this thief was really a penitent; for he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes our Saviour with the title of Lord, 'Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me in thy kingdom;' which implies a belief of the divinity of his perſon, his miſſion and commiſſion from God, his delegated authority in the kingdom of providence and grace, with the compleatneſs of his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019407_0010_0FABAAE85C719DC0"/>
atonement and perfection of his righteouſneſs unto all, and upon all that believe. Were it not for the hope of mercy and forgiveneſs with God, to a penitent, his would ſink under the weight of numberleſs, ſoul crimes, into ſullen deſpair. Adam, without a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of mercy, never would have ſolicited for pardon, but remained incorrigibly wicked, like the apoſtate angels, who being excluded the hope of pardon, are confirmed in eternal rebellion; from which apoſtate man is delivered, only by thoſe reviving beams of hope, which emanating from Jeſus, the glorious ſon of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and paſſing through the goſpel, that bleſſed medium of his grace, enter the dark ill-boding ſoul, and diſpel the incumbent gloom of hopeleſs horror and torpid deſpair; believing that paradiſe is open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Jeſus hath power in heaven, as he once had on earth, to forgive ſins, yea, that he is actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted at God's right-hand, to give remiſſion of ſins as well as repentance. The guilty offender looks to him for both; to him who was pierced he looks, and mourns, being himſelf pierced and melted by the kindly beams of a Saviour's love. On his merits alone he reſts, and not on the merit of his own repentance, prayers, or reformation, to recommend him to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour; and if pardoning mercy is found, with what rapturous joy and filial affection, gratitude and admiration, does the pardoned penitent magnify and extol the divine mercy! Like Niobe, the forgiven fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male penitent, who at once melted into a flood of nitential tears, and 'loved much, becauſe much was forgiven her.' Again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. A TRUE penitent is always willing and ready to confeſs his ſins; and this teſtimony alſo have we, that this malefactor's repentance pleaſed God; for he made a very humble public confeſſion, and it really looks like an honeſt one, becauſe it came from his own mouth freely, Sorrow, upon a real ſight of the turpitude and baſeneſs of ſin, does not more freely flow from the heart, than confeſſion from the mouth will follow:
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019407_0011_0FABAAEC56D93E40"/>
Extorted confeſſions are always ſuſpected, and well they may, for Judas, the traitor, made a confeſſion, yea and reſtitution alſo, but they were both good for nothing, unleſs to prove him a hypocrite, becauſe they were both forced from him by the rack and torture of a guilty conſcience, and the dread of puniſhment. This, and not any real repentance for his crime, wrung them out. This alſo kindled up ſuch an hell within as drove him on, in frantic horror, to make his eſcape, by leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into an hell before him. 'I have ſinned (ſays he) in that I have betrayed innocent blood, and he caſt down the pieces of ſilver, and went and hanged himſelf.' How different this, from the bitter repentance of Peter, the confeſſion and reſtitution of Zacheus and others, who, from a real and inveterate hatred of ſin, have both confeſſed and forſaken it. Let every one therefore who hopes to find mercy of the Lord remember his faults this day, and make confeſſion of them, both to God and man, to thoſe in particular whom we have at any time injured, either in name or intereſt; and 'as much as in us lieth,' make all reaſonable ſatisfaction, relying upon the divine mercy and promiſe for pardon; 'if we confeſs our ſins, God is faithful and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.'</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE fear of God, with which the heart of this malefactor was principled and governed, bears further atteſtation to the ſincerity of his repentance: Addreſſing his companion, he ſaid, 'doſt not thou fear God.' I fear him, and therefore dare not affront him, as thou doeſt, by prophanely mocking and railing on his dying ſon. The fear of God, when ſweetened and animated with love, is that filial reverence and pious paſſion of the ſoul, which, in ſcripture, is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put for the whole circle of chriſtian graces and duties. To fear God and keep his commandments is the whole duty of man; it is one of the moſt active principles in the compoſition of a heaven-born ſoul; it gently touches all its inmoſt ſprings, and ſets the ſoul in motion, rapid inceſſant motion, towards its
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019407_0012_0FABAAEDF719BA68"/>
proper object, reſtraining at once from every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil, and conſtraining to a uniform, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obedience. Under the influence of this ſacred paſſion Nehemiah renounced thoſe oppreſſive meaſures which former governors had purſued; 'ſo did not I, becauſe of the fear of God;' and 'moved with fear' of the ſame kind, 'Noah prepared an ark,' in obedience to the will and warning of his God, Heb. 11. In this, conſidered either as a paſſion or principle, true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is evidently implied, and muſt in both caſes be taken into the account, as a material ingredient; for 'by their fruits ye ſhall know them,' as well as other graces in their true diſtinctive characters, ſo far as they can be known; but the fruits of both fear and repentance are the ſame, and interchangeably produce each other. Agreeably when the apoſtle is enumerating the fruits of godly ſorrow and repentance unto ſalvation, he gives fear a place in the liſt; 'what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea, what indignation, yea, what <hi>fear, &amp;c.</hi>' Upon the other hand, we read, '<hi>fear</hi> the Lord, and depart from evil; ſtand in <hi>awe,</hi> and ſin not.' From all which it is manifeſt, that evangelical obedience and reformation are equally the fruit both of fear and repentance, and therefore, as this thief feared God, he was a penitent. But further,</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE admonition which he gave to his ſuffering companion on the croſs is an additional evidence of the genuineſs of his repentance: When this impious thief railed upon Chriſt, and ſaid, 'if thou be the Chriſt, come down from the croſs and ſave thyſelf and us.' The other looked upon him with anger, being grieved for the hardneſs of his heart, and ſaid, 'thou, even thou thyſelf art in the ſame condemnation,' and yet dareſt thou with thy dying breath thus enhance thy guilt, and add to all thy other crimes ſuch inſolence and outrage, even in the immediate view of death and the judgment ſeat. 'Thus he was reproved.' This faithful reprover having himſelf taſted, yea, was now actually drinking the bitter cup, 'the wormwood and the gall,' of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019407_0013_0FABAAEEE2842E80"/>
life, and knew full well that ſin was the ſting of ſorrow as well as of death; 'when he ſaw this thief, he conſented with him, and was a partaker both of his ſins and of his plagues.' What now can he do more? Nay, what can he do leſs, than give him a parting reproof, and bid others take warning? It is the laſt opportunity, and perhaps the only way left to make any compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for the injury he had done his ſoul, which was now ready to ſink into the bottomleſs pit: He pities him; his heart is full of benevolence, and in his tongue is the law of kindneſs; he openeth his mouth, and a reproof, the <hi>reproof of wiſdom,</hi> is there, with which he makes his laſt, his dying effort, to <hi>ſave</hi> his wretched comrade, 'pulling him out of the fire.' Let others '<hi>learn of him to go and do likewiſe.</hi>' Unblameable and unreprovable in the ſight of all men, and pure as the gold of which the ſnuffers in the Jewiſh ſanctuary were made, ought they, in general, to be, who undertake the office of correcting and reforming others; yet 'the day of death,' the laſt hour of life, gives to the vileſt a kind of licence to ſpeak, and adds weight and energy to their dying words. May they be, in every ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, 'the words of truth and ſoberneſs,' of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and warning to all, eſpecially to thoſe who have been either principals or accomplices in wickedneſs, or who may after all once dare to do as others have done. Experience, fatal indeed to ſome, but 'life from the dead' to others, if the fault be not their own, ſpeaks to our eyes as their words do in our ears; and the plain language of both is, 'the way of tranſgreſſion is hard,' 'a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed;' and that 'ſin, though ſweet in the mouth, is bitter in the belly, and ever will be bitterneſs in the latter end.'</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE tender concern which this malefactor ſhewed for the glory of God, and the honor and reputation of his injured Son, is another ſubſtantial proof of his real penitence. He 'gave glory to God, by making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,' and by vindicating the character of his dear Son. The barbarous treatment which his innocent
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019407_0014_0FABAAEF25922DE8"/>
Lord received from the rude multitude, the inſults offered him, when ſuffering the keen tortures of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion, and actually in the agonies of death, deeply affected him. 'The reproaches of them that reproached him,' fell heavy upon his heart; it was full, and he opened his mouth and ſaid, 'this man hath done nothing amiſs—we indeed ſuffer guilty, but he is harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and holy.' The other thief joined the multitude in mocking and condemning Chriſt, expecting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in that way to get a releaſe—But this man ſtands alone, and dares, in direct oppoſition to the rooted, rancorous prejudices of the people, and in defiance of the ſentence of two courts againſt him, he dares openly <hi>juſtify and acquit</hi> him; 'this man hath done nothing amiſs.' Here is the honeſt intrepidity of virtue! And it ever ought to be expected, that every dying penitent will, in his laſt moments, and in all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings 'juſtify God,' and vindicate, at every riſque, thoſe innocent perſons and characters that may have been wronged by their means: This is a debt of reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which every man owes his God and country; yea, commutative juſtice lays its hands on every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and like the rigorous ſervant in the parable, takes him by the throat, ſaying, 'pay me that thou oweſt.' Once more,</p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſt. EVERY real penitent, as ſuch, is a man of prayer. 'The Lord is good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all that call upon him;' and upon him for mercy the repenting ſinner will call with as much fervency as Daniel prayed in the lion's den, or Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah in the belly of hell, for deliverance. Stung with a ſenſe of his guilt, penitent David prays as if the ghoſt of Uriah, beſpattered with blood was conſtantly in his ſight, and actually reproaching him for his treacherous cruelty; 'deliver me, O God (ſays he) thou God of my ſalvation, deliver me from blood-guiltineſs, have mercy on me, O Lord; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my tranſgreſſion, waſh me from mine iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſin.'
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019407_0015_0FABAAEFE009D7E0"/>
This is prayer, and a proof of genuine penitence. Such proof as this had this condemned thief, that he was himſelf a penitent in heart, 'for behold he prayeth,' 'Lord remember me in thy kingdom:' This was his prayer, the prayer of a dying thief to a dying Saviour; it was ſhort, but a very comprehenſive prayer; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, yea, it really is, the prayer of faith, of humility, and of great importunity; he addreſſes Chriſt as Lord, the Lord of a kingdom which was not of this world: and this, as already obſerved, implies faith; he ſhews great humility in his prayer to this all-ſufficient Saviour, 'Lord remember me.' He ſeeks for no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; he aſks not to ſit on his right-hand or his left in his kingdom, as others had done; neither does he preſcribe any particular way in which he would be remembered; he only begs a remembrance with Chriſt, that is all; and for this he is exceedingly earneſt and importunate. He ſeems to breathe out his <hi>whole</hi> ſoul in the requeſt, 'Lord remember me,' and I have enough, 'remember me,' and I have infinitely more than I deſerve! remember me, O Lord, and I aſk no more. 'For mercy Lord, is my requeſt; this is the total ſum; mercy, good Lord, is all my ſuit; O let thy mercy come!' Come, come it did; for 'Jeſus ſaid unto him, verily I ſay unto you, to day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.' This was the promiſe which our Lord made to this praying penitent—and the import of it was,</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE ſecond conſideration in the propoſed method of this diſcourſe; to which I ſhall now attend in a few words.</p>
            <p>THIS promiſe was indeed made by our divine Lord in perſon, and addreſſed to this thief in particular, while they were both upon the croſs; but as Jeſus is now in paradiſe above, at his Father's right-hand, and hath ſtill in his own hand the mediatorial kingdom of grace, and ever liveth to make interceſſion for us: We may, every perſon who deſerves the character of a true penitent, may properly and perſonally apply the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019407_0016_0FABAAF0D17D9D88"/>
ſame promiſe to himſelf, and ſay in his dying hour, 'to day ſhall I be with Chriſt in paradiſe.'—Paradiſe, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to that delightful place on earth where our firſt parents lived in their innocent, primeval ſtate, is here put for heaven. The river of pleaſure, the tree of life, and other ſcenes of earthly joy and felicity, that once were in it, rendered the place, beyond all others, the fitteſt reſemblance of that paradiſe above, into which the holy Jeſus promiſed this dying thief an immediate 'and abundant entrance.' This promiſe, if connected and compared with other paſſages of ſcripture, implies,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT there is another life after this, or that the ſoul will exiſt, after the death of the body, in a ſeparate ſtate. 'To day <hi>thou</hi>' i. e. thy ſoul '<hi>ſhall be with me, &amp;c.</hi>' And as the ſoul is ſaid to be not merely with angels and glorified ſpirits, but with Jeſus <hi>himſelf,</hi> who is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and forever; it further implies,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE immortality of the ſoul, or that its exiſtence ſhall never end. And alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT the ſouls of juſt men are <hi>immediately</hi> after death made perfect; being abſent from the body, are preſent with the Lord in a paradiſe of everlaſting joy. '<hi>To day</hi> ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.' But a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſideration of theſe truths muſt, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, give place to another, very evidently implied in the promiſe, and which is indeed the wonder, weight and glory of it: It is the aſtoniſhing grace and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt toward periſhing men. How willing and ready is the all-loving and all-lovely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to hear the prayer of the humble and contrite ſoul, and to receive it to his everlaſting mercy? How ſoon did the prayer of this penitent reach the ear of the all-compaſſionate Redeemer? '<hi>While he was yet ſpeaking,</hi>' Jeſus anſwered 'Amen.' Thy petition is given thee; to the half, yea, to the whole of my kingdom; in which you ſhall have not only the remembrance of an abſent friend in my mind, but a ſeat in my kingdom, yea, a place in my very boſom; 'that where I am,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019407_0017_0FABAAF16DB6E180"/>
there you may be alſo, and behold my glory.' O what a marvellous mixture of unrivalled mercy and dignity are here diſplayed in triumph! Mercy to the dying thief, but dignity and regal majeſty, in ſpeaking to him, from the croſs, as from a throne; not only 'to diſpenſe pardons, but diſpoſe of ſeats in paradiſe.' The Saviour was now agonizing on the croſs, with every appendage of infamy and diſtreſs, deſerted by his friends and by his God, while his mercileſs enemies were inſulting and triumphing over him; yet he endured all with patience; and with the thunder-bolts of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant deſtruction in his hand, this meek, inoffenſive Lamb opened not his mouth; he was deaf and dumb to all the bitter reproaches, both of the multitude and of this abandoned thief, then expiring at his ſide; but as ſoon as the other addreſſed him in prayer, he heard, he ſpoke, and heaven was given him at his petition! Oh the riches of almighty, unmerited grace! A par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, a paradiſe of eternal happineſs given to a thief, offered as freely to the other, and to a third, yea, to all who will humbly and freely accept what he freely gives. Can this be poſſible? He who made the promiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that it 'would be thought a thing incredible with us,' and therefore he hath confirmed it with an oath; '<hi>verily,</hi> I ſay unto you, to day, &amp;c.' This is indeed an inſtance of the power of ſovereign, ſurprizing grace, at which men and angels will never ceaſe to admire and wonder; but it ſtands not alone; other trophies have been erected beneath the banners of the ſame croſs: Saul, of Tarſus, a bloody perſecutor, the oppreſſing Zacheus, a publican, murderous Manaſſeh, the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, yea, the betrayers and murderers of the Son of God at Jeruſalem, with that long black roll of noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious criminals at Corinth. Theſe, 'ſuch were theſe,' and ſuch have been numbers more, 'but they are waſhed,' in the very blood, which ſome of their own wicked hands had ſhed, 'but they are ſanctified, but they are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.' And through the power of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019407_0018_0FABAAF243C2B138"/>
the ſame meritorious blood, peace and pardon await the guilty ſtill. Grace is yet on the throne, and 'reigns through righteouſneſs unto eternal life.' Its ſphere of benign influence hath extended back to the beginning of the creation of God, and will reach forward to the general conflagration, 'and nothing is hid from the heat thereof; it is unto all, and upon all that believe,' without difference either of time, place or character. Gracious encouragement! joyful truth! and written too, as with a ſun-beam, in the repeated and indefinite invitations of the glorious goſpel: 'Whoever will let him come, and him that cometh I will in no wiſe caſt out,' is his language, who came to bring peace on earth and good-will to men: For this he breathed forth that moſt pathetical wiſh, 'O that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace!' For this he poured out that ardent prayer, even for his murderers, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' For this his tears flowed out with his prayers; 'Jeſus wept,' when he beheld the city of Jeruſalem, where his murderers lived; he melted into tears of compaſſion over thoſe inhuman wretches who crucified and ſlew the Lord of glory: Yea, let higher wonder riſe, for he, after all this, made the firſt offer of himſelf as a Saviour to thoſe who nailed him to the croſs as a malefactor—and that none might ſuſpect the ſincerity of his heart in all he has ſaid and done, he hath even ſworn, that he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn and live. Now, if the moſt winning invitations, ſolemn oaths, pathetic wiſhes, affectionate tears, and ardent prayers cannot ſufficiently prove his love and willingneſs to ſave, then reject them all, refuſe his oath, and take his blood in proof of the darling point; for this he ſhed as well as his tears, this he poured forth as well as his prayers, for thoſe whoſe wicked hands ſpilt and reeked with his vital gore! Is this the manner of man, O Lord? Are not the chief offenders made examples of juſtice? With men they are, but with Jeſus they are ſometimes
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019407_0019_0FABAAF646C640C0"/>
the choſen veſſels and examples of his mercy! Be not faithleſs then, nor ſuſpicious of Chriſt's willingneſs to ſave; for it is infinitely greater than your own to be ſaved by him. That a king on earth ſhould be more ready to pardon than the rebel to receive it, is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible indeed; but let Jeſus be king, and it is true as the everlaſting goſpel which declares it. 'O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem (ſaid Chriſt, with tears in his eyes) how often would I have gathered thee, but you would not.' Hear this, with a dull inſenſibility, or ſtupid indifference who can? Believe this, guilty man, and leap for joy, look to Jeſus, and immediately lay hold on eternal life! But this leads me</p>
            <p n="3">III. To apply the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHAT a marvellous illuſtration does the ſubject give us, both of the efficacy and inefficacy of the means of grace, upon different perſons under the ſame circumſtances. Here are two men who had committed the ſame crime, both thieves, condemned to the ſame death, and at the ſame time nailed to the ſame croſs, at equal diſtance perhaps from the ſame Saviour, who hung between them both; and both, for aught ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, enjoyed equal advantages from the inſtructions and example of Chriſt; and yet 'Chriſt crucified was to the one as a Saviour of life unto life, and to the other of death unto death.' One ſaw the Saviour in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, and became a penitent, the other refuſed, and hardened his heart. One of them went out of the world praying to the Saviour of it, the other expired reviling and curſing him.—If he who died a penitent was unacquainted with Chriſt before he came to the croſs, which is the common opinion, then his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion muſt, and will be acknowledged a rare, but glorious inſtance, both of the power and ſovereignty of divine grace; as the other evidently was of the power of ſin, and of the ſottiſhneſs and depravity of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart! The heart of the ſons of men is full of evil, and madneſs is in their heart while they live.' This thief was now in the moſt acute pain, the moſt pungent
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019407_0020_0FABAAF80C248158"/>
diſtreſs, having but a few minutes to live, upon the very point to plunge into eternity; a fellow-ſufferer in the agonies of death before his eyes, whoſe dying groans doubtleſs pierced his ears while upon the croſs, to which he was nailed, naked, and expoſed to ſhame and ignominy from the ſcoffing, ſurrounding mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, a Saviour praying for his murderers on his ſide, with blood ſtreaming from his mangled body, full in view; and yet, 'be aſtoniſhed O heavens,' he was hardened ſtill! 'Bray a fool in a mortar, yet will not his folly depart from him.' 'So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe;' to him let every eye look, in the diligent uſe of the means of his own appointment, and not vainly imagine, as ſome have done, that if they could but enjoy ſuch as others have enjoyed, or as might be afforded, ſucceſs would enſue; 'to the law and the teſtimony,' theſe are <hi>perfect</hi>; but if theſe 'convert not the ſoul, nor make wiſe the ſimple,' if Moſes and the prophets are not heard; 'neither will you be perſuaded though one roſe from the dead;' nay, it would not avail, if you could this day ſtand under the very croſs of Chriſt, and have '<hi>all your raiment ſtained,</hi>' with his blood diſtilling and ſtreaming freſh upon it; or were ye even lifted up on the croſs, like this thief, with a Saviour praying and dying by your ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How great and affecting is that change, which is made by death in the ſame perſon. This we have often ſeen with our own eyes; we ſhall ſee it again in a few hours, in the unhappy priſoner before us; and ere long we ourſelves muſt all feel and undergo it in our own perſons: Yes, the faireſt forms and fineſt features, all the ſtrength and agility of body, the lilly and roſe in the cheek, the ſparkling eye and charming glee, muſt all fade, ſhortly fade away, and become lifeleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and loathſome putrefaction. Be fond and proud of dreſs no more, but 'be ye cloathed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; put on righteouſneſs; put ye on the Lord Jeſus

Chriſt, as a robe, and for a diadem of beauty.' But great as is the change, which death makes in the body, it is ſmall and trifling, compared to the alteration it produces in the ſtate of the ſoul, in the compaſs of one flying moment; it paſſes from time to eternity, from eaſe to unceaſing pain, or from pain to eternal bliſs; from its exiſtence in a body to a world of ſeparate ſpirits; and from earth to heaven or hell. What a tranſition is this! How ſudden and unknown, how ſurprizing and important is the change! Are we all ready for it? 'Except a man be born again he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.' This is the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory change for heaven; if we have experienced this, we are prepared for the other, and may, in our dying moments, leave this body, and 'launch into the great deep' of eternity, with as much ſafety as Peter left the ſhip in a ſtorm, and 'ventured to walk upon the ſea to go to Jeſus,' not doubting but the ſame helping hand which 'caught him will be ſtretched out to ſave us alſo from ſinking' into the lake which burns below, and receive us into his everlaſting kingdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From this one inſtance only of a late repentance, let no one preſume to defer his own to ſome future day, and yet dream of ſucceſs. To the glory of divine grace it muſt be acknowledged, that a true repentance is never too late; but equally to the glory of divine juſtice, it muſt alſo be owned, that a late repentance is ſeldom true: True indeed it was in this thief, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common interpretation; but to riſk the immortal happineſs of a ſoul, in pawn of its being the only true one, is jeopardy and folly that want a name! After all that has been ſaid in its ſupport, there are yet good reaſons to believe, as ſome expoſitors do, that this convert had been acquainted with Chriſt and the nature of his kingdom while in priſon, and that he actually was converted ſome time before he was executed; this they urge ought to be admitted as a fact, rather than an inſtantaneous converſion. But to wave all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, I will at preſent grant what never can be fully
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019407_0022_0FABAAF8E9DD6458"/>
proved, viz. That all the divine virtues which could be crouded into ſo narrow a ſpace were, by a ſudden and aſtoniſhing growth, produced in him, while he was upon the croſs, and that he did in reality obtain mercy with his dying gaſp. What then? Is this a pattern for us? A pattern it may be, but it is without a promiſe, and is rather a proof of what Chriſt can do, than of what he will do in common caſes. The caſe of this thief, it is certain, was peculiar and extraordinary: He never had, upon the preſent ſuppoſition, one call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor one offer of mercy from Chriſt before in all his life; whereas, under the goſpel, dying ſinners have been long and often called, and as long deſpiſed the means and overtures of grace: 'Becauſe I have called (ſays God) and ye refuſed, therefore I will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh.' Beſides it was now an extraordinary time; Chriſt was on the croſs, juſt coming to the throne, on the point of being crowned, and inſtalled in his kingdom; his dying, royal groans, penetrated the regions of the dead, and produced univerſal darkneſs and convulſions through the heavens and earth; all nature was in mourning, and echoed groan for groan reſponſive to her dying God. At ſuch a time, and under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, this thief on the croſs became a convert of the grace of Chriſt. But for any of us, at this day, to indulge in wickedneſs, in expectation of a ſimilar event, would, in the true eſtimate of things, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted preſumption, and hazard infinitely greater than that of a malefactor, who ſhould voluntarily commit felony, in expectation of a pardon from his ſovereign, merely becauſe on the joyful day of his coronation he had once pardoned a criminal; or, if in the neglect of the ordinary means of grace, and 'the ſtill ſmall voice' of reaſon and conſcience, any ſhould depend upon an earthquake, or the darkneſs of a preternatural eclipſe of the ſun, to convert him, becauſe a certain thief, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 1800 years ago, was perhaps, firſt awakened in ſuch a miraculous way. The folly of ſuch conduct is
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019407_0023_0FABAAF9AE61A458"/>
too rank and barefaced to need a ſerious reprobation! Add to this, that a deep and thorough repentance is a gracious habit, which, like all others, uſually requires time, and a train of gradual operations, both within and from without, to fix it deep and durable in the ſoul. Thoſe haſty reſolutions, tranſient pangs of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and intermitting fits of joy, ſo often miſtaken for '<hi>pure religion,</hi>' are frequently no more than certain mechanical operations upon the body, ariſing from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal impreſſions, or from the latent ſeeds of ſome melancholy diſtemper, which, like the ſeeds in the parable, 'ſoon ſprung up, and ſoon withered away, becauſe they had no root or deepneſs of earth.' Sudden growths and changes in religion, like thoſe in vegetable nature, are ſeldom ſolid and durable; and if one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in them ſhould appear at firſt very happy and joyful, as 'Jonah was exceeding glad of his gourd;' yet it is a thing '<hi>for which he hath not laboured, neither made it grow,</hi>' he may ſuſpect a devouring '<hi>worm is at the root,</hi>' if it ever had any, and as it came up in the night, it will periſh in a night, i. e. it may ſoon be gone; while the empty pretender, who has miſtook a religious mood for a religious temper, will be left in the very 'gall of bitterneſs' and cenſure, under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of luſts, far more criminal than that 'peeviſh temper,' which the prophet diſcovered at the loſs of his pleaſant ſhade. Changes like theſe, however, are not more ſuſpicious than it is impious to put off the great work of religion to the laſt moments of life. To waſte and wanton away upon your luſts, and the ſervice of this world, the flower and vigor of life, and then offer the wretched relicks of it to the great author and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of life, is a moſt daring affront. Ungrateful man! fooliſh and unwiſe, do you thus requite the Lord? Is this all the return you make him for all his kindneſs to you? Is this thy kindneſs to thy friend? Is he ſo cheap, low, and worthleſs in your eſteem? O! with what angry juſt reſentment might he not ſay to you, as once he did to the ungrateful Jews, who bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019407_0024_0FABAAFA611B9218"/>
away their Lord for thirty pieces of ſilver, 'a goodly price that I was prized at of them.' A goodly price indeed, to offer the ſick, the blind and lame, for a Saviour in a deſperate caſe. Offer it now to thy Governor; will he be pleaſed with ſuch a ſacrifice? No more will thy God, the Governor of the world, be pleaſed with the dregs of diſeaſed or decripid age, preſſed out by the weight of conſcious guilt, and the torturing fire of a ſtinging conſcience. Fair promiſes we know are often made in pain and diſtreſs, and as often almoſt are they recanted in eaſe and proſperity; yea, ſo commonly have the vows and reſolutions of a ſick bed died in embrio, where the patient has lived, that if the experience of ages had the weight of a grain, it would be granted upon every hand, that next to leaping headlong into hell without any repentance, is the folly of defering it to age, ſickneſs, or a dying day. But if folly of ſuch colour and magnitude ſhould ever once be found, let not the guilty wretch utterly deſpond; for in the hiſtory of four thouſand years, let him know, that there is <hi>one</hi> inſtance left on the ſacred page, that none might deſpair, and only <hi>one,</hi> that none might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. Every delinquent therefore, whoſe boſom tells him, even when dying. '<hi>thou art the man,</hi>' let him, I ſay, look up to the croſs, think of a dying penitent there, and look away all deſpair; he may cheriſh to the laſt a kind of 'forlorn hope;' for 'the Ethiopian can change his ſkin, and the leopard his ſpots: a man can be born when he is old, and the ſinner an hundred years old may not be accurſed;' becauſe 'with God all things are poſſible.'—Seize the preſent moment then, and give thy heart to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The abſolute neceſſity of repentance unto life appears from this ſubject with the moſt convincing evidence—This made that vaſt difference between the two thieves on the croſs; the paradiſe of God was opened to one, but for ever ſhut againſt the other; not indeed as a thief merely, but as an impenitent one: And this, O! this will be to all others the turning point for eternity. Let every one therefore, now look
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019407_0025_0FABAAFB2FE86780"/>
at his own heart, and with the eyes of an honeſt critic, aſk himſelf this one plain queſtion, am I real penitent, or not? Is my repentance a part of holineſs; a part of that holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord? and with which every man's 'ſins ſhall be blotted out, and times of refreſhment come from the preſence of the Lord.' Is it a clear caſe, that 'fruits meet for repentance,' are the genuine produce of our hearts and lives every day. Puſh home this enquiry, and act agreeably.—But it is time to ſpeak plainly, and in particular to this poor priſoner, who muſt very ſoon appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt; and may every heart be touched with tender concern for him.</p>
            <p>UNHAPPY young man, how diſappointed in your expectations, how wretched and forlorn is your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition! 'Have pity, have pity upon you, O my God, and look down from thy ſanctuary to hear the groaning of the priſoner.' Time! your appointed time on earth is come, and die you muſt, in all the bloom and vigor of youth, with breaſts full of milk and your bones moiſtened with marrow. This day, which to you is the laſt of days, will form the important criſis that muſt determine your happineſs or miſery for ever.

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019407_0026_0FABAAFEB20849E0"/>
the laws of which your mortal life is forfeited, and now demanded as the ſacrifice; condemned alſo you are by the law of God, which extends to the thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the heart. The wages of ſin is death; 'the ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die, and curſed is every one who continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them; this is the law, with its tremendous ſanctions and curſes; and theſe all await you, as a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of it—offending in one point, you are guilty of all, and all heaven and earth will ſooner paſs away than one jot or tittle of it fail. The tenor of this law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, none can alter, the tone of vengeance you cannot ſoften, a God all mercy, and too indulgent to puniſh the wicked, can never be found; 'whoſe heart can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, or whoſe hands be ſtrong,' when the ſentence of this righteous law ſhall be executed—was the ſentence of an earthly judge lately pronounced, with the meltings of compaſſion, and the flowing of tears, ordering you to be hanged by the neck till you are dead;—was this terrible to you, how much more ſo muſt it be to hear your almighty Judge in righteous anger pronounce that unalterable ſentence, 'depart ye curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire.' Is this then your doom and juſt deſert? Is your day and means of grace juſt expiring? Have you but a few minutes more to make your peace with an injured neglected God, and to be made 'worthy to eſcape all theſe things, and to ſtand before the Son of Man?' Is this your caſe? In the name of God! what can be done? What ſhall I do to be ſaved? Is this your heart? Are you in earneſt? In earneſt then, and in the language of inſpiration, I moſt gladly ſay, 'believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; if thou believeſt with all thine heart thou ſhalt be ſaved,' though in point of juſtice you deſerve 'to be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction;' Jeſus is the end of the law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he died to redeem us from the curſe of the law; 'he was numbered with the tranſgreſſors,' with thieves in his death, that penitent thieves and tranſgreſſors might be pardoned; he died for the ungodly, ſays an inſpired apoſtle; he died for the unjuſt, ſays another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:019407_0027_0FABAAFF89F83730"/>
he came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt, ſays our Lord; and it is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even the chief of them, ſays the apoſtle. Now are you ungodly, are you unjuſt, are you a loſt ſinner, or even the chief of ſinners; then for you he died, ſuch as theſe he will ſave, ſave even to the uttermoſt, if they will come unto God by him; his blood cleanſeth from all ſin; even though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool, ſaith the Lord. Here is the door of hope, this is the door of mercy, and this the fountain to which the ſoft voice of invitation calls you, ſaying, come waſh and be clean, turn and live, repent and be happy; whoever will, let him come, and him that cometh I will in no wiſe caſt out, I beſeech you therefore, O Dixſon, by all that your ſoul is worth through eternity, and by 'the price of blood, the blood of God,' ſhed for its redemption, that you immediately hear the joyful ſound, and inſtantly give your whole heart's conſent to the bleſſed covenant of goſpel grace. Now compoſe your mind, and make a pauſe, one ſolemn, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative pauſe, and look back, once more upon your wretched life (before it tranſpires) and think, with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſorrow, and remorſe of heart, O think how you have lived, what you have done, how you have treated the great God, his holy Spirit and bleſſed Son; think how you have injured your fellow-men, ſinned againſt the light of reaſon, of revelation, and conſcience, and thus wronged your own ſoul. Then look within, and you will find, you will feel, if not paſt feeling, a moſt vile heart, 'out of which have proceeded evil thoughts, blaſphemies, thefts, &amp;c.' Take one more ſurvey of this heart, and then 'repent and pray to God, if perhaps the thoughts of thy heart, and the ſins of thy whole life may be both forgiven thee.' I ſay unto you, 'what thou doeſt, do quickly;' your feet ſtand on ſlippery places, now is your time, now or never, 'now is the accepted time, now is the day, and to you the laſt, the only day of ſalvation; to day therefore, while it is called to day,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019407_0028_0FABAAFFA95C3DD8"/>
harden not your heart. Dixſon, you ſtill breathe, your heart and your pulſe yet beat, and the vital current moves, and bleſſed be God the curſe delays, the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice is heard, 'you are a priſoner of hope;' turn, turn to the ſtrong holds, for why will you die, O young man. In fine, juſtify God, condemn yourſelf, proſtrate your guilty ſoul at the foot of the croſs; look up there, and plead the merit and the application of that all-virtuous blood which once pardoned a penitent thief, who died upon it, and is infinitely ſufficient to pardon and ſave even you; and having aſcended the place of your execution, then rouſe, collect and fix all your thoughts, and breathe out all your ſoul, in faith, repentance and prayer, 'ſaying, 'Lord Jeſus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me in thy kingdom,' God be merciful to me a dying ſinner. Farewell, poor John Dixſon, and the Lord have mercy on you; to day may you be with Chriſt in paradiſe; amen, and 'let all the people ſay <hi>amen.</hi>'</p>
            <p>To this very numerous aſſembly I will now turn the addreſs, and cloſe my ſubject. Who can look around upon the numbers of all ranks, ages, ſexes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions here preſent, and think of the tranſactions of this day, and not be reminded of that infinitely more ſolemn 'day in which God will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by Jeſus Chriſt.' Then, my friends, and perhaps never before, ſhall we meet again, not merely as ſpectators, but as perſonally and deeply intereſted in all the momentous ſcenes and deciſions that will then take place. The apoſtle's wiſh for his friend, is mine for you and myſelf; 'the Lord grant we may all find mercy of him in that day.' To this deſirable end, may the public inſtructions and warnings of this day be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, in particular that exemplary inſtance of juſtice upon the priſoner before us, which is this day under providence ſet up at the head of this county as a <hi>warning piece,</hi> let off (as I may ſay) from a <hi>cannon</hi> of our own making, a ſalutary law of this Commonwealth, and which ſpeaks aloud in the ears as well as to the eyes of all that can ſee or hear, crying from the earth, like the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019407_0029_0FABAB006508E560"/>
blood of murdered Abel, for the life of this and for other malefactors. Let all take warning, and while they ſee and hear, may they fear and do no more ſo wickedly; 'let him that ſtole, ſteal no more, but rather let him labour with his hands the thing which is good.' Then may this ſtand alone, and for the laſt, as it is at preſent the ſecond inſtance of a capital execution, and the firſt for burglary, ſince this was a ſhire town—youth, as well as parents, are particularly concerned in the admonitions of this day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. HERE is a moſt affecting inſtance, my young friends, before your eyes of a vicious youth, under the age of twenty-four years, brought to a diſgraceful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, by the vindictive hand of public juſtice; and it is at once a warning to you, and a proof that God's own words are words of truth. Look on this criminal, and believe that 'he who purſueth evil, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth it to his own death,' and that wicked men ſhall not live out half their days; believe alſo that he who being often reproved hardeneth his neck, ſhall himſelf ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy; hearken then to the voice of a reproof from your parents and friends, from the word and providence of God; take heed to your ways, ſhun the vices and paths of the deſtroyer; 'flee youthful luſts which war againſt the ſoul,' and wound to death your own reputation and the bleeding hearts of your tender parents; beware, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially beware of gaming, and that intemperate uſe of ſpirituous liquors to which this ill-fated youth was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famouſly addicted, and which, by the confeſſion of his own mouth, had the principal hand in bringing him to this miſerable end. This is indeed a ſore evil under the ſun, and it is now common among men; like a peſtilence, 'it walketh in darkneſs and waſteth at noon day!' A moſt pernicious evil, full of deadly poiſon to the manners and morals of youth; a deteſtable Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora's box, whence iſſue whole ſwarms of plagues, more numerous and fatal than thoſe of Egypt, to ſting and diſturb mankind in all their peace of ſociety, both in towns and families; yea, it now threatens with one mingled maſs of ruin, the health and happineſs, the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019407_0030_0FABAB015C0BBBB8"/>
lives, fortunes and ſouls of the moſt promiſing part of God's creation: 'Who hath woe? Who hath ſorrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath babling? Who hath wounds, with and without a cauſe? Who hath redneſs of eyes?' Who are poor, and ſteal, and take the name of the Lord in vain? Who break up houſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit murder, are confined to priſons, loaded with irons, and die upon the gallows? 'They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeek mixt wine, and are mighty to drink ſtrong drink.' This execution alas! will make the third in this county, occaſioned by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous liquors; two men in a fit of intoxication com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted murder, and ſuffered the pains of death, at Briſtol, upwards of 75 years ago; theſe were Indians, and would to God that human nature might never again be ſo brutalized and rankly diſgraced by any but Indians alone. Could I ſpeak in thunder, and my voice be heard from pole to pole, it ſhould be the friendly voice of warning to young men, entreating them, by every thing that is dear and valuable, to ſhun the company and the haunts of tipplers and gamblers; 'come not nigh the door of the houſe, avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it and paſs away.'</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS example of condign puniſhment ſpeaks aloud and home to parents and all who are entruſted with the care and education of children. Next to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, as a cauſe, this malefactor aſcribes his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious life and ignominious death to the want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſtraint in youth; left to the care of a mother when young, he had, like too many others, his own way and will without controul. His parent we are told is yet alive, if a parent can live who has 'travailed in birth and drawn out the breaſts' to ſuch a ſon! Can words expreſs the feelings of a parent's heart on ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; put your ſoul in her ſoul's ſtead this day, and imagine for once, you who are parents, if the thought is not inſupportable, that this was your own ſon! a ſon who had 'made himſelf vile, and you reſtrained him not,' a ſon, whoſe education, whoſe morals and immortal ſoul you had neglected, and now is trembling
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019407_0031_0FABAB031E253D48"/>
in chains, with the ſtrangling nooſe about his neck, and 'made a gazing ſtock' to thouſands around him—at length you follow him to the place of execution; there ſtand the father who begat him, and the mother who bore him, beholding their ſon writhing in the agonies of death, and they for him, in agonies as great of living diſtreſs; O how they wring their hands, and almoſt gnaw their tongues, while they cry, 'my ſon, my ſon, would to God I might die for thee, O my ſon, my ſon,' I am the criminal, and I the guilty thief; 'his blood be upon us, and not upon our child;' we are the faulty cauſe; our cruel neglect of timely inſtructions, a good example, and the rod of correction, have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered our ſon! The Bible and experience both told us to train him up in the way he ſhould go, and that when he was old he would not depart; we were commanded to beat him with a rod, and not ſpare for his crying, with a promiſe that he ſhould not die an untimely death, and that we ſhould deliver his ſoul from hell; but Oh! 'we are guilty, verily guilty, concerning our ſon, and therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us,' as a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our folly as well as his own; go now and write him a monſter! pronounce that heart 'an heart of ſtone, which is not melted and moved out of its place;' even in ſympathy with ſuch pungent parental diſtreſs; and may both the ſleeping and waking hours of that parent, be perpetually haunted with all the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical operations of this day, who can after all go home, and neglect the education of his own children; yea, let him take his rank in future with 'the cruel oſtrich in the wilderneſs,' becauſe he is hardened againſt his young, as though they were not his own.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS public example of juſtice adds to the proof, already large, of the exiſtence and wiſdom of a ſpecial providence: 'Verily there is a God that judgeth in the heavens and in the earth.' To deter men from vice, the Deity has mercifully mingled pain and puniſhment with the very nature and perpetration of it; if we look within we ſhall find, we ſhall feel a demonſtration of this. Envy and malice, rancor and revenge, &amp;c. are 'a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019407_0032_0FABAB03AF739540"/>
of vipers' in the ſoul, perpetually ſtinging and gnawing upon it; yea, they create in that boſom, which is their neſt, a little domeſtic hell, '<hi>where the worm</hi>' of envy '<hi>dieth not, and the fire</hi>' of malice '<hi>is not quenched.</hi>' Vices torment the ſoul, however, not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their nature, and when ſeparately indulged, but from their number and combination. So numerous, and ſo contrary, in their deſires and ſeparate intereſts, that they raiſe a kind of civil war within; for while one luſt is gratified, another is diſpleaſed; while the man humours and feeds his covetouſneſs, he is obliged to ſtarve luxury and affront his pride; and even ſhould 'Belzebub caſt out devils,' or one predominant maſter luſt conquer a number of its inferiors, there would be even in this infernal conqueſt an oppoſition, which muſt create pain and vexation. But if to the miſery which is entailed on vice, in its nature and in their jaring num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, we add that which both attends and follows vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious actions, we ſhall ſtill have a greater proof of the wiſdom and goodneſs of divine providence, by which it is evidently decreed, that bold tranſgreſſors ſhall not only be puniſhed in this world, but in numberleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhall in fact be puniſhed according to the laws of a ſtrict retaliation. I have ſeen (ſays Eliphaz) that they who plow iniquity and ſow wickedneſs reap the ſame; his miſchief (ſays the Pſalmiſt) ſhall return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own head, and his violent dealings ſhall come down upon his own pate; and even after conſcience hath long ſlept, and no human juſtice could purſue the criminal, his own iniquity has at laſt found him out, and by ſome remarkable incident in providence brought him to deſerved puniſhment. In this view it is worthy of obſervation, that ſoon after the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this priſoner to the goal in this town, he was providentially diſcovered late in the night upon the point of an eſcape from this, as he had before done from every other priſon he had been confined to; this alarmed the ſheriff, who knowing and lamenting the enfeebled ſtate of the gaol, thought it unſafe to riſque a
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019407_0033_0FABAB044DF8C840"/>
ſecond attempt, and therefore appointed him a guard; and to this ſingle circumſtance, however trifling or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental it may appear, muſt be aſcribed, under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the memorable event of this day. Rather than wicked men ſhould go unpuniſhed, by any neglect of government, all wiſe providence will take occaſion from that neglect, and make a ſuperanuated gaol the very means of their execution. 'The weakneſs of God is ſtronger than men,' and ever will be too ſtrong for the guilty to eſcape. Let us, eſpecially of this county, notice a providence ſo friendly to government, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this in full cannot by done until the new propoſed gaol ſhall be compleated, with every needful precaution of ſtrength and ſecurity. Finally,</p>
            <p>WHEN we look at this unhappy criminal, and think what would the poor wretch give that he were in our condition: Let none of us indulge, or nouriſh in our hearts the pride of the Phariſee, or even ſo much as think, in a way of boaſting, what he ſpoke with his mouth, 'God I thank thee, that I am not as other men, or even as this malefactor;' when perhaps the principal diſtinction between him and numbers here preſent may be nothing more than the gilding of a coffin or the paint of a ſepulchre; and even of ſome others, the difference may conſiſt only in this, that he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and condemned, but they as yet are concealed from human eye, while in the eye of God omniſcient, both they and we and 'all have ſinned, and come ſhort of his glory.' Condemned therefore by the ſame law, guilty before the ſame God, we are all the priſoners of divine juſtice, and equally need repentance and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy, through the blood of the ſame atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;' repent therefore, let us all, and 'be converted, that we may have redemption through the blood of Chriſt, even the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his grace; and receive in the end the riches of the glory of the inheritance, in his everlaſting kingdom.' Amen.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX. ON BURGLARY.</head>
            <p>BEFORE the execution of the criminal, which gave occaſion to the preceding diſcourſe, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number, chiefly of the populace, manifeſted their doubts and diſſatisfaction concerning the lawfulneſs of the intended execution; others '<hi>raged and were confident,</hi>' that it would be a murderous bloody deed, and wiſhed he might eſcape. This ſuggeſted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of offering in public a ſhort vindication of his puniſhment. It was done, and the conſequence proved to ſome a preſent relief, but to others a more violent attack upon thoſe who were more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. The judges and jury, the ſheriff and ſtate's-attorney, the proſecutor and the preacher, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in turn, each one <hi>his bitter portion in due ſeaſon</hi>; and as the impetus of zeal and clamour ſo furious did evidently ſtrike againſt government, it was thought neceſſary in all reaſon to give it a check; and could reaſon do it, the taſk were eaſy and ſoon finiſhed; if the wiſdom and experience of ages, and the wiſeſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and legiſlators on earth; if all the ſtatutes, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and codes of uninſpired law, could obtain faith, or had weight, '<hi>as a grain of muſtard ſeed,</hi>' the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain would be removed, and all clamour ceaſe: But ſince very little advantage in this diſpute can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from this quarter, no apology to the gentlemen of law or letters can be needed from one of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, for an attempt to juſtify the penalty of one of our own laws, by '<hi>reaſoning out of the ſcriptures,</hi>' and with arguments plainly adapted to the ſenſe and feelings of this claſs of people.</p>
            <p>THE crime we call burglary, is the breaking open and entering a dwelling-houſe in the night, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:019407_0035_0FABAB059D6B5B58"/>
to ſteal, rob, commit murder, a rape, or ſome other felony: This is done by opening a window, coming down a chimney, picking a lock, removing a bolt, turning a button, or unloſing any other faſtening, yea, by lifting up a latch, and ruſhing in upon knocking, or even entering at a door ſet open by a ſervant or one of the family, joined in a conſpiracy with the thief. Breaking up and entering either of theſe ways, into a dwelling-houſe, or any adjoining part or parcel thereof, though not under the ſame roof, with an intention to commit either of the above felonies, whether that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be carried into execution or not, is burglary: And that this is indeed an offence of ſo henious a nature, even where theft or robbery only is committed, as will juſtify a community in puniſhing it with death, will appear with evidence from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD himſelf has ſet a peculiar brand of infamy and enormity upon theft. In various paſſages of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it is ranked and coupled with robbery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, both which are allowed to be worthy of death. (See John x<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. Job xxiv.14. Jer. vii.9, &amp;c.) Now if common theft be a crime of ſuch magnitude, what muſt it be when accompanied with thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of aggravation which denominate it burglary; it is done in the night, and is one of thoſe works of darkneſs ſo often ſtigmatized by the apoſtle; in the dead of the night, when all the creation, except beaſts of prey, are at reſt, and when man is diſarmed by ſleep, and utterly unable to defend himſelf, his family or property, from the violence of the midnight thief, who is '<hi>a ſtrong man armed,</hi>' and hid from every human eye and helping hand, under the cover of darkneſs, and like his father, the prince of darkneſs, '<hi>he goeth about ſeeking whom</hi>' and whoſe '<hi>he may devour.</hi>' What miſchief in ſuch a caſe cannot be done? Whoſe life or property can ever be ſafe? Beſides my houſe is invaded by force; and why is a man's own houſe called his caſtle? Why is an abuſe offered to a man under his own roof deemed in law a diſtinguiſhed offence? Cannot a door
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:019407_0036_0FABAB065DB03458"/>
be broken open, even by an officer, under the light of day, to execute a civil proceſs? Why not? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the right of domeſtic peace and protection are ſo dear and ſacred to every man; and therefore the laws of nature and of the land,' have made an hedge about him, and about all that he hath, on every ſide,' and who but a madman can wiſh to ſee it broken down?— Again, conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT other crimes, apparently leſs than bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary, have been, by the expreſs command of God, puniſhed with death. Under the Jewiſh law we find a large number, which, according to their different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, were puniſhed with different kinds of death; ſome criminals were ſtrangled, others burnt alive, ſome killed by the ſword, and others ſtoned to death; their capital crimes amounted to more than thirty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which probably ſounds large to thoſe who have had the ignorance and effrontery to affirm, that no crime mentioned in ſcripture was ever made capital except murder. In this large number, however, we may particularly notice the following ones, viz. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, inceſt, gluttony, with drunkenneſs, falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, ſeducing, ſabbath-breaking, curſing and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parents, &amp;c. Who will now aſſert that not one of all theſe is a leſs crime than burglary? Was the ſtriking of a parent, perhaps in a ſudden fit of paſſion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reaſon had arrived to its full maturity and ſtrength, a greater offence in a child, whoſe natural temper and ill-treatment might be a principal cauſe, than it is at this day for a man with deliberation and deſign, to go and commit ſuch a complicated crime as this? And did the all-wiſe God, '<hi>whoſe compaſſions fail not,</hi>' once enact a law that ſhould take away the life of a child in the above caſe, and yet may not '<hi>the powers that be' of God,</hi> do the ſame in another, when it appears neceſſary to a State, and far more criminal? Certainly they may do it. Indeed it is already done, in the inſtances of robbery and a rape, both which are death, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out objection or complaint that we hear: But neither of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019407_0037_0FABAB0A8D00FEA8"/>
theſe, in point of guilt and enormity, can equal that of houſe-breaking. In caſe of a rape the woman has power to cry for help, and may obtain it. In highway robbery, when the piſtol is preſented to a man's breaſt, and his money is demanded, it may, perhaps, be in his houſe, and not in his pocket, or if it is, delivering it up may ſave his life; yea, both may be ſaved by a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attack upon the robber, or by a ſudden flight from him; this is poſſible, becauſe the man aſſaulted is on his horſe, or upon his feet, but in the preſent caſe he is in his bed and aſleep, with his family around him, all off their guard, abſolutely unable to make the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or even ſo much as to ſound an alarm; the thief enters the houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every life in it lies wholly at his mercy; ſhould one of the family be rouſed, that one perhaps a father, may in the terrors and darkneſs of night, kill the wife of his boſom, or one of his own children; or the child, a father or brother, inſtead of the thief, who is after all in perfect ſecurity, and with the richeſt plunder in his hands—the hard earnings of a whole life, he is left to make his eſcape, under the cover of darkneſs, beyond the probability of ever being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. Is this the crime which is thought leſs than robbery or a rape? If it is, let one probable ſuppoſition more be added to the above, and that is this, that the father of the family is awaked from ſleep, by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night cry of daughters raviſhed in his own houſe, a wife in a fright, and fainting by his ſide, ſons murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and weltering in their own gore, and his houſe, his own caſtle of defence, in flames about him, and the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains who have done it all fled with impunity, and gone, irrecoverably gone, from the avenging arm of human juſtice.—Raviſhed daughters! women muſt feel the bluſh riſe in their faces, and reſentment in their hearts, when they think of thoſe thoughtleſs creatures of their own ſex, who have been extenuating burglary, and raiſing an outcry againſt a law that guards at once the chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of daughters, and the doors of their houſes, with death. A guard, not too ſtrong for female virtue,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019407_0038_0FABAB0C539A0548"/>
againſt the brutal luſts of midnight ruffians, nor too great for the ſecurity of life and property at a time when the very dregs of a large diſbanded army are emptied out upon us. Once more, we add</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſtealing itſelf was, under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, made a capital offence, when God himſelf was the legiſlator of his people. 'If a thief be found breaking up, and be ſmitten that he die, there ſhall be no blood ſhed for him.' Exod. 22.2. This paſſage was cited, on the occaſion, both of the ſentence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the criminal. The judge on the firſt, and on the other, I referred to it, in vindication of both. It was however pronounced impertinent, and by ſome an impoſition on the people. In anſwer, for myſelf, I ſhall only ſay, that if quoting a text, is an impoſition, unleſs it anſwers in every circumſtance, to the occaſion on which it is adduced, then there is not in all the Bible, perhaps, a ſingle text, that can ever be uſed on any occaſion whatever. This paſſage was not brought to prove that common theft, or even houſe-breaking, was puniſhed with death by the judges of the Jewiſh State; but only that it was ſo under certain circumſtances.— That is, if a thief was found in the night breaking up an houſe, he might be killed upon the ſpot, without loſs of blood in him who ſhould deal the deadly blow: and if this were only an act of ſelf-defence, it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhew, not only the greatneſs of the crime, as this appears the only one in which voluntary manſlaughter was tolerated among the Jews, but it ſhews alſo, the weakneſs and futility of underſtanding the phraſe of breaking up, as ſome do, to mean the breaking up of a barn or ſtall; was any one ever allowed by the Jewiſh law, or by any other, to kill a thief in his barn at night, in defence of his cattle? no, it muſt, according to the text be in his own houſe, and in defence of himſelf and family; and therefore we may fairly reaſon thus, and ſay, if a wiſe God, in character of a law-maker, once ſaw fit, to put the fatal ſword into the hands of a maſter, or member of a family for a common defence of that ſmall
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019407_0039_0FABAB0C5E994C38"/>
circle (in caſe of burglary) why may not the ſame ſword be committed to the hands of a civil magiſtrate for the common ſecurity of a larger community? but children need a protector, as they are weak and helpleſs; it is granted; and equally unable may the ſtrongeſt be, in a caſe like this, to make a defence againſt the ſuperior power of the aggreſſor. What good reaſon then can be given, why the law of a State ſhould not come in to the aſſiſtance of the weaker party? and while it leaves him his natural right of killing the thief, if he can, ought it not at the ſame time, to protect and avenge him and his family, when he is wholly unable to do it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Add to this, that if theft by houſebreaking in the night, was not a capital offence in the eye of the Jewiſh law, let any who can, make it appear, that it was in fact any crime, or had any puniſhment at all. In all the various kinds of theft, the puniſhment we ſee is very minutely ſpecified, and even in this under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provided the ſun was riſen, full reſtitution was by law required; but what was the puniſhment if in the night or before ſun-riſe? Death it was, or none at all that we can find in the law of Moſes. Should this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning upon the text in queſtion be thought inſufficient to prove that ſtealing was in any caſe puniſhed with death, I would mention another, againſt which there can be no objections: It is Exod. 21, 16, 'He that ſtealeth a man, ſhall ſurely be put to death.' This is ſtealing, and it was death by this ſtatute, here made by God himſelf. Men and not goods were indeed, the ſpoils taken: This however is only a circumſtance, and leſs too, all things conſidered, than are ſome which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that atrocious kind of theft, we call burglary, as might (were there room for it) eaſily be ſhown. The confeſſion of the penitent thief on the croſs, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Achan, who for ſtealing a wedge of gold and a Babyloniſh garment was ſtoned to death, with others to the like purpoſe, I omit; and, upon the whole, ſay, that if ſtealing is a crime of ſuch enormity in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as above deſcribed; if under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019407_0040_0FABAB0D55AFECF8"/>
it has been, by his expreſs command, actually puniſhed with death; and laſtly, if other crimes, which in the true eſtimation of things, are leſs criminal than burglary, have been treated in the ſame manner, then it muſt follow, that a community has, and ought to have, an indiſputable right to puniſh it with the pains of death.</p>
            <p>IT now remains, that we further confirm the point, by anſwering the objections which may be brought againſt it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF houſe-breaking is in fact ſo heinous a crime, why was its puniſhment left to the ſword of the injured party, and not like others of a capital nature, made 'an iniquity to be puniſhed by the judges?' The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is obvious: The body of the people in Moſes's day, were ſhepherds dwelling in tents. Their wealth conſiſted chiefly in cattle, and not in ſtores of goods, and coſtly furniture. Their habitations in common, were only a ſingle apartment, or lodging place on the ground, made of canvas, often moved from place to place, and into which, it was next to impoſſible for one to enter in the night, without being diſcovered. On which, and other accounts, neither the lives, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, nor property of that people, could be, like ours, expoſed to plunderers in the night, And after theſe tents were exchanged for houſes, in the land of Canaan, even theſe were ſo formed and furniſhed, in thoſe early times of plainneſs and ſimplicity, as did very much fruſtrate the deſigns of houſe-breakers. When Britain was invaded by Ceſar, the houſes, we are told, even in capital towns, were without chimneys, wattled and plaiſtered over with clay, and all the furniture and utenſils were of wood. The people ſlept on ſtraw pallets, with a log of wood for a pillow. And in the infancy, or firſt ſettlement of this, or any new country, when houſes are made of logs, without windows, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partitions, and with but a ſingle door to enter, and no tempting treaſure within; houſe-breaking, in theſe circumſtances, required not ſuch a penalty as it really
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019407_0041_0FABAB0DF82BF588"/>
demands in the progreſs, or advanced age of the ſame country; where population and wealth, luxury and idleneſs, poverty and vice, have created innumerable temptations to the inhabitants. Agreeably to this, it ought to be known and remembered, that burglary was not, by law, even in the ſecond inſtance of it, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by death in this State, for a ſpace of more than ninety years together: Branding and whipping anſwered the purpoſe until the year 1715, when the legiſlature, for good reaſons, given in the preamble of the act, made it felony, in the firſt inſtance. This at once ſtruck terror into hardy, determined offenders; and the conſequences was, from that day to the preſent time, our gallows have been rarely occupied, except by natives of foreign countries, or neighbouring States. And might I here hazard a conjecture, it ſhould be this, that ſome even of thoſe, who are now the moſt virulent in the oppoſition, would, upon the adoption of their own plan, ſoon clamour as loud in favour of more effectual puniſhments, as ever they have done againſt them; unleſs it ſhould be a fact, which I hope it is not, that they are already in the number of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, or elſe, by their preſent oppoſition, they intend for themſelves a future licence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT may be further objected, perhaps, that inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as death is the greateſt puniſhment that ever can be inflicted on any offender, burglary and murder will loſe their proper diſtinctions, and be treated as equals in criminality.</p>
            <p>THIS objection is beſt anſwered by an appeal to the feelings of every man, upon once knowing that his houſe is broken up in the night, and that a thief is within the walls of it, Who will venture unarmed to enter where he is? Who will riſque his life upon this, that ſuch an audacious felon has not entered the houſe with a murderous, as well as thieviſh intention? Will the wretch, who is hardy enough to commit a crime, which he knows is death, ever heſitate to murder a man, under his own roof, to make an eſcape? I know
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019407_0042_0FABAB0EB02CA828"/>
it is called cruel, and wide from all reaſon and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to take away the life of one, who has taken away from another, only a few articles of his property. But is this all? Did a thief ever yet enter an houſe without a deſign of being concealed, at all adventures? And if ſo then, he never entered without murder in his heart. This is, and ever ought to be the preſumption. Upon this it evidently was, that an houſe-breaker, under the Jewiſh law, might be killed in the night; for the ſun being riſen, the preſumption was, that he came not to kill, but to ſteal only, and therefore blood was upon <hi>his</hi> head who ſhould ſmite him. Call not then an houſe-breaker, any more by the name of a thief, for it is by interpretation, a murderer. And though he may often have plundered in the night, without actual mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; yet this, for aught we know, was owing wholly to his being undiſcovered and unmoleſted in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Reaſon therefore, and ſcripture, will both ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me when I affirm, in ſacred ſtyle, that '<hi>the thief cometh not but for to ſteal, to kill, and to deſtroy.</hi>' Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. MAKING burglary a capital offence, or any other except murder, does without neceſſity, and at once, defeat the main deſign of puniſhment, and deprive the community of a life that might be uſeful to it. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this it ſhould be obſerved, that all the propoſed ends of puniſhment, are reformation, reſtitution, and terror to evil doers. The two firſt of theſe, it is ſaid, will be taken away and loſt, with the life of the criminal; but this wants proof. And whoever well conſiders the nature and progreſs of thoſe vices, which uſually end in the halter, with the catalogue of crimes which fill up confeſſions from the gallows, will perhaps, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain as high expectations of reformation in criminals, from the firſt hour of their ſentence, to the day of their execution, as in a number of ſurviving years. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they are a number of incurables, except by an exploit of omnipotence; and therefore, life to them may be a curſe, even greater if poſſible than it is to ſociety; while the taking of it from them as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019407_0043_0FABAB0F60301CC0"/>
will in reality, tend to diſcourage and deter daring offenders more than any other.—This I know is denied by ſome; but the opinion of him, who once ſaid, '<hi>ſkin for ſkin; yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life,</hi>' is perhaps, in this particular, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theirs, who can believe, any puniſhment ever yet practiſed in a chriſtian country, can in general, terrify and deter men equal to the pains of death. By all winch, however, I mean not to oppoſe, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it is moſt ardently wiſhed, that we had mines, to enſlave for life, or galleys, to chain up the miſchievous hands of ſuch neſarious banditti; or, if poſſible, that ſome other effectual puniſhments were provided by the State, at leaſt by way of experiment, inſtead of death, for ſome of our capital crimes. But until theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and actually take its place, we ſhall inſiſt upon it, though it is at the expence of hard names and bitter cenſures, that '<hi>whoſoever will ſave his life</hi>' in ſuch caſes, '<hi>ſhall loſe it</hi>' in the whole community; '<hi>and whoſoever ſhall deſtroy life,</hi>' when forfeited, and full of deadly poiſon to ſociety, '<hi>ſhall find it an hundred fold in this world.</hi>'—Yet may heaven forbid that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after all, ſhould ever depend upon ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alone to prevent the commiſſion of crimes. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs '<hi>the ax be laid at the root</hi>' of the evil, by proper methods of reſtraining idleneſs and luxury, and a due care to educate the members of a community, to the love of virtue and induſtry, and an abhorrence of every thing baſe and diſhoneſt, in vain are even capital pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. The wages of ſin may be death, but alone it will not avail to ſtem the torrent, and ſecure the peace and happineſs of ſociety.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT objection, of all others, which by ſome is thought to have the greateſt weight, but in reality has the leaſt of all, is taken from our Saviour's words to the woman, taken in adultery (John 8.) This woman was, by the Scribes and Phariſees brought to Jeſus, and indicted before him, for a crime that was death by the law of Moſes. In this caſe they aſked his opinion,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019407_0044_0FABAB10435CE6A0"/>
with a deſign, if poſſible, to enſnare him; i. e. if he ſaid ſhe ought to die, they intended to have accuſed him to the Roman governor, for tolerating the Jews, in the exerciſe of a judicial power. But if he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted her, they would repreſent him an enemy to the law of Moſes, Knowing their deſign, he at firſt waves an anſwer: But when they inſiſted upon it, he replies, 'let him that is without ſin caſt the firſt ſtone.' This at once, fixed upon their conſciences ſuch painful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, that they immediately left him and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alone; to whom he ſaid, 'hath no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned thee?' ſhe ſaid no man, Lord: Jeſus replies, 'neither do I condemn thee; go and ſin no more.' Thus their ſnare was broken; and not the penalty of Moſes's law, in the caſe of adultery, taken away, as ſome have ſtrangely inferred from this paſſage. 'Chriſt came not to deſtroy the law, but to fulfil all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.' He never once ſet himſelf up 'as a judge or divider,' in civil affairs; on the contrary he was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent pattern of obedience and ſubjection to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'rendering unto Ceſar the things that were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars;' and finally he left it with his Apoſtles, to enjoin on all chriſtian princes and rulers, that ſufficient laws be made, 'for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, lyars, whoremongers, for them that defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with mankind, and for—<hi>men-ſtealers,</hi>' &amp;c. from which it is evident, that the ancient Jewiſh law againſt theft is here expreſly ratified by the Apoſtle, ſee 1 Tim. 1, 10. Exod. 21, 16. Once more, and</p>
            <p n="5">5. IN oppoſition to the above reaſoning, it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be ſaid, and well it may, by men of ſenſe and reflection, 'to what purpoſe is all this waſte' of time and pains in proof of that, which needs none at all. This is the objection, and I honeſtly confeſs I am not able to anſwer it. Let him do it who can; for is it poſſible to ſuppoſe, that a body of judicial laws, though made in heaven, for a people who exiſted ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago, and ſo different from us in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, connexions, purſuits, ſituation, ſoil, climate,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019407_0045_0FABAB10E1C9F6A0"/>
and an endleſs variety of other circumſtances, can, or ever ought, in equity, and in particular, to bind us, or any other nation on earth, at this day. Such laws muſt exceed even the power of omnipotence itſelf, as much as any contradiction, or act of injuſtice, that can be named. Many uſeful inſtructions indeed, to all legiſlators, of every country on the globe, may and ought to be borrowed from thence, as they came from a God infinitely wiſe: Yet, conſidered merely as <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> they are, perhaps, no more to us, than thoſe of any other wiſe nation. Should it therefore ſtill be urged, that becauſe neither burglary, arſon, robbery, nor rape, were death by the Jewiſh law, they in fact, ought not to be ſo by ours, I have equal right in my turn, to inſiſt upon it, that the loſs of virginity before marriage, the ſtriking of parents, and ſabbath-breaking, ſhall by our laws, alſo be puniſhed with death.—The exact truth after all is this; the wiſdom of God, has left the power of legiſlation, in the particular circumſtances of it, to the wiſdom of moral agents, in every region un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven; and therefore, upon the virtue and good ſenſe of this county, we muſt and ſhall rely, in future; ſo far at leaſt, as to preſume, that not one among all, will ever again open his mouth, to curſe or revile the rulers of his own choice, while in the honeſt, but pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful execution of a law, a righteous law of our own enacting; and in the open, hazardous defence of our own lives, peace, and property.</p>

            <head>A SKETCH of JOHN DIXSON's Life.</head>
            <p>THE principal account, we can at preſent give of this unfortunate young man, is that which was taken from his own mouth, while in priſon: And as he was utterly averſe from ſuch confeſſions as have been uſually made under ſuch circumſtances, his hiſtory will be ſhort.—He was born, as he conſtantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, at Eaſt-Haddam, in Connecticut: His father

died when he was young, and under the care of his mother, he was early in life ſent to ſchool, where he ſoon diſtinguiſhed himſelf for miſchievous behaviour. When grown up, he entered contrary to the inclination of his parent, on board a veſſel bound to France: His villainous conduct in this voyage, procured for him a ſevere chaſtiſement from his captain; which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon his own head, the firſt opportunity he found on ſhore. After this, he enliſted into the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army, and took a bounty, but ſoon deſerted, and again enliſted, and thus went on until the number of his enliſtments, with bounties, amounted to eighteen times: For which he received proper puniſhments as often as detected; but to no effect. He made ſeveral rambles through different parts of the country, in which he improved every opportunity 'to fill up the meaſure of his iniquity.' He frequently broke open houſes and ſtores, and ſtole goods, proviſions, money, cloathing, and even cattle, to a very conſiderable amount: All which, in a very ſhort time, he conſumed upon his luſts, at taverns, in grog-ſhops, and over the gameing-table. From a ſhoe-maker's ſhop he once ſtole a pair of ſhoes; and being immediately diſcovered, he, to ſave his back from ſtripes, begged, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to labour faithfully, until he had made full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: The owner finally conſented; and employed him to drive his team: But he ungratefully ſeized the very firſt opportunity, and drove the oxen to a river, ſwam them over, then ſold them, took the money, and went off. For theft he was once committed to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter gaol, and there loaded with irons, ſtrongly faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened about his neck, which he ſoon broke, as well as the priſon, and fled. He alſo broke from Windham gaol, in Connecticut, to which he had been confined for ſtealing again. 'His mouth was full of curſing' and ſwearing, of oaths and blaſphemies of the moſt horrible ſound, that his imagination could invent. He ſhewed no regard to the holy ſabbath; rarely ever read the ſcriptures, or attended public worſhip, and never

gave any attention to the word preached when preſent. He was once accuſed of committing a rape; and it is perhaps now beyond a doubt, that while in the army, and for repeated deſertions, enliſtments, taking boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and changing his name, this very man was there ſentenced to death, and actually brought under the gallows for execution; but for reaſons unknown, he was pardoned, and returned to his regiment, where he ſtole an horſe, in a few hours after, from an officer, and rode off. But the fatal crime, which ended at once his life and licentious career, was burglary, committed at the houſe of Capt. James Dagget, of Rehoboth. The evidence upon which he was apprehended, tried, and condemned, was ſo full and convincing, as left in the mind ſcarcely a remaining doubt. The bare-faced impudence 'of his own iniquity found him out,' '<hi>ſin taking occaſion from</hi>' thence, '<hi>deceived him and ſlew him.</hi>' Before he received the ſentence of death, he was in priſon jovial, diſſolute, and prophane; but afterwards he appeared, at times, full of anxiety and remorſe.— His attention and behaviour, the laſt times he attended public worſhip, were very ſerious. In a ſhort ſpeech made at the gallows, he warned others, by himſelf, againſt drinking, gameing, and evil company: He then expreſſed his thanks to the ſheriff, and to all of whom he had received kindneſſes, while in priſon; and as ſoon as the appointed moment of his execution ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, he leaped into the cart, aſſiſted in adjuſting the rope about his own neck, and even in turning himſelf off, with an appearance of fortitude, which ſurprized every ſpectator; but this, whether from principles of infidelity, ſtupefaction, or chriſtianity, we dare not pronounce.</p>
