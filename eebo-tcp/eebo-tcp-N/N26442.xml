            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN the latter part of April laſt, I called on the Mayor of this city, and communicated to him a circumſtance which I believed to be a very intereſting one to the future health of the inhabitants of White-Hall and its environs, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That in filling up the wharf at the eaſt ſide of the ſlip, they had already buried two dead horſes, and at that period they were covering a third. Beſides this, there were ſeveral hundred loads of ſtreet-dung, ſpread on the unfiniſhed wharf: and that the place was in ſuch a ſtate of nuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that it eminently threatened the ſafety of the inhabitants. The Mayor replied, That he would have the neceſſary enquiries made. On the ſame day, I made a ſimilar communication to Alderman Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and expreſſed a wiſh, that the Act for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nuiſances ſhould be attended to.</p>
               <p>THE fact is, Sir, that part of White-Hall to the eaſt of the ſlip, is in a moſt offenſive condition.</p>
               <p>THE crew of the ſhip Antoniette, from Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, which lies adjoining the nuiſance above alluded to, and who cannot come on ſhore, or return on board, without croſſing over the above ground, has ſickened ſucceſſively almoſt to a man. They have been ſent to Bellevue, recovered, and on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, have ſickened again. The day before yeſterday a man was ſent to the Hoſpital—yeſterday another—and this day two more have ſickened; and I have no doubt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035161_0004_1000B015DE2698F0"/>
but their complaints are in conſequence of exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ariſing from the wharf.</p>
               <p>THERE are a number of people ſickening in the neighbourhood of White-Hall, and the alarm it has created, is too well founded. Nothing ſhort of the removal of a quantity of ſtreet manure, and other offenſive matter, which now lies on the wharf, and the wharf being covered over with clean graver, earth or ſand, intermixed with a quantity of lime, can poſſibly prevent the calamity which has already taken place, from extending its influence.</p>

               <p>A REPORT prevails in the country, that the ſame Fever which proved fatal to ſo many of the inhabitants of New-York the laſt fall, has again made its appearance, and that the city, in conſequence of it, has become very ſickly. The diſagreeable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion excited in the minds of the people by ſuch a rumour, is, perhaps, increaſed by ſeveral para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs to the ſame purpoſe, which I am informed have appeared in the Philadelphia papers. In order, therefore, that I may be, in ſome meaſure, enabled to ſilence the fears of my friends, and to afford them the moſt ſatisfactory information upon a ſubject ſo important, I ſhall eſteem it a favor if you will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

to me a candid ſtatement of the buſineſs; for I have no doubt, that unleſs the moſt concluſive means are ſoon adopted by ſome medical character of influence among you, the alarm, however unfounded, will obtain ſuch credit, as to prevent the people in the Country from reſorting in their uſual numbers to the City.</p>

               <p>IT is true that a Fever reſembling the one which proved ſo great a ſcourge to our city laſt year, made its appearance again about White-Hall, and in the vicinity of the Exchange, about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of July; but I have ſolid reaſons for believing that this complaint will not be extended beyond cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limits.

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035161_0006_1000C2D1453BDFD0"/>
and that their effects muſt neceſſarily be felt by thoſe who were more immediately expoſed to their influence.</p>
               <p>THE proprietors of the lots on the Eaſt ſide of White Hall ſlip, carried out a bulk head the laſt ſpring, with a view to extend the dock further into the river. The dimenſions of the dock are very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and a maxim invariably adopted by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of docks, is, that <hi>the cheapeſt mode of filling is the beſt.</hi> Accordingly, carts were employed to collect ſuch dirt and filth as all large, populous cities furniſh in abundance, and with thoſe materials was the dock filled up; and to add to the <hi>ſalubrity</hi> of the maſs, there was occaſionally added, dead horſes, dogs, cats, hogs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THE expoſure of White Hall, and indeed the whole of the Weſt end of the city of New-York, muſt be conſidered as extremely healthy. The winds during the warm ſeaſon, are generally from the Sea, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to this part of the town uncontaminated, by paſſing over unwholeſome grounds. Yet ſuch is the fact, that the poiſonous exhalations which have abounded in that quarter during the warm weather, have ſo changed the air, that the inhabitants on the South ſide of Pearl-ſtreet, between Old-ſlip and White-Hall, almoſt all concur in their teſtimony, that the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effluvia has frequently compelled them to cloſe their windows, eſpecially in the evening, on the South ſide of their houſes; and, in ſeveral inſtances, have aſſured me, that the offenſive ſmells have been ſuch, as to occaſion vomiting.</p>
               <p>THE dock on which Mr. Delafield's ſtores are erected, is in a ſtate truly execrable, and the ſlip on the right and on the left is little better. Theſe, and ſuch places, are viſited by the Dock-Fever—the Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Fever, if you pleaſe, that murderer of our own creating.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:035161_0007_1000B05555F2D1F8"/>
WERE the proprietors of theſe and ſuch like docks, compelled to live on them, the evil would ſoon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied; but people of this deſcription are generally ſecure from the ravages of diſeaſe, enjoying the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their rents in the cooler retirements of the country.</p>
               <p>BUT, fortunately for us, from a concurrence of happy events, the dock-fever has entirely diſappeared. It has continued for a ſhort time only, when a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Providence ſent us hard winds, repeated thunder and lightning, inundations of rain, and cool weather. To cauſes of this kind are we to aſcribe the ſuſpenſion of a formidable diſeaſe, which had begun to ſhew it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among us.</p>
               <p>THE preſent exertions of our Common Council, in giving a new ſurface of wholeſome earth to the dock of White Hall, will, without doubt, contribute to the ſame ſalutary effects; and, if the ſame meaſures were extended to other parts of the town, there would be much leſs reaſon to apprehend a return of the Dock-Fever.</p>

New-York, as I have ſaid before, may be rendered as healthy a city as any under the ſun; and when its baneful police is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the nuiſances with which the city abounds are corrected, you will hear no more of the ravages of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſeaſes.</p>

               <p>I RECEIVED a letter from you, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted November 26, expreſſing a wiſh that I would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Commiſſioners of health, with ſuch obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as had occurred to me during the laſt ſummer and autumn, relative to the cauſes or origin of the diſeaſe, which occaſioned ſo much alarm in this city, and which proved fatal to ſo many of its inhabitants; and that theſe obſervations might be accompanied with ſuch reflections as I might deem proper relative to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035161_0009_1000B0B6D331E120"/>
nuiſances, for the removal of which a law was paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the legiſlature of the ſtate, on the firſt of April, 1796.</p>
               <p>As it regards the firſt requeſt, I had fortunately made ſome progreſs in ſtating the principal facts, at the period of receiving your letter, which I have ſince completed, and which marked No. 1, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the peruſal of the Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>I SHALL endeavour to perform the taſk aſſigned me, by making ſuch reflections on the ſubject of nuiſances, as circumſtances may have given riſe to.</p>
               <p>IN the ſummer and autumn of 1795, a diſeaſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in this city, denominated from its nature and violence, the Yellow-Fever. The terror and diſmay which it produced in all claſſes of Citizens, may be eaſily remembered; and the influence it had on the commerce of the city, and the number of lives it deſtroyed, are circumſtances of too recent a date to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>IN this diſtreſſing ſituation, application was made to the Medical Society of the ſtate of New-York, to favour the Public with its opinion of the nature of that diſeaſe. The Society accordingly addreſſed a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Magiſtracy upon the ſubject, (a copy of which is encloſed) containing remarks, among others, upon ſuch nuiſances, as appeared at leaſt, to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the then prevailing fever, and to render it more malignant and fatal; and to the influence of this letter, I preſume we are to aſcribe, principally, the act of the Legiſlature above alluded to, for the removal of theſe nuiſances. Why a law of ſuch magnitude has not been carried into complete effect, is a matter of ſurprize and regret among the citizens in general. A law was conceived to be neceſſary—every hand was raiſed for its enaction—and if, by the general expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035161_0010_1000B0BA97D3F5D8"/>
it was thought proper, it is much to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we have not experienced its ſalutary operation. How far otherwiſe, indeed, has it been? The vaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of periſhable matter at White-Hall, after the paſſing of the law, affording effluvia of the moſt noxious kind, and which from the cleareſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, was the principal cauſe of the late ſickneſs in that quarter, is a lamentable inſtance of inattention to what was ſo much the general wiſh!</p>
               <p>THE law for the removal of nuiſances, paſſed the 1ſt of April laſt, among many other things, reſpects, particularly, the manufactories of ſoap, candles, vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum and ſtarch. But, unfortunately, theſe very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive repoſitories remain exactly where they were; and the annoyance which the neigbouring inhabitants have experienced from them, has been a ſubject of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated complaint. They have not only rendered the ſituations of many, extremely uncomfortable, but there is reaſon for apprehending worſe conſequences, which the letter of Mr. Coles, accompanying theſe remarks, pretty clearly evinces.</p>
               <p>IT has been urged that the removal of the above nuiſances, would be expenſive to the citizens; but a conſideration of this kind, is ſurely not to be put in competition with our lives. I truſt there are few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who would not cheerfully contribute to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the law, both in letter and ſpirit; and thus free a populous city of thoſe cauſes of mortality, which are of a nature extremely active, and certain in their effect; and which, if ſuffered to remain, may bring thouſands to their grave.</p>
               <p>PERMIT me further to add, that the calamitous ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to which we have lately been twice reduced, ought to ſtimulate our endeavours, and excite us to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance and care. Timely precaution may prevent a return of Yellow Fever in this city, or perhaps one of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035161_0011_1000B03179F4A3B0"/>
a more peſtilential kind: or, failing in that, it may alleviate their violence, and reſtrain their devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>IT is true that diſeaſes ſeldom become <hi>Epidemic,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of a certain ſtate of the air. We have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced that ſtate of the air and its effects, and we have no ſecurity againſt its returning even the enſuing ſeaſon—And I cannot but believe that every good citizen will conſider the inconveniencies to which he may be expoſed, by the operation of the law upon the ſubject, as inſeparable from the obligation and duty he owes to ſociety; and he who willingly ſubmits, may have this conſolatory reflexion, that his acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence may have been the means of ſaving the lives of thouſands, in guarding a populous city from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miſeries and fatality attending peſtilential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p>I SHALL conclude with obſerving, that if my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks have extended beyond what was intended to be underſtood by your requeſt; or, if I have ventured further than I ought to have done, I hope that my anxiety to preſerve the reputation of the city, and to promote the welfare and comfort of my fellow-citizens, will plead my apology.</p>

            <div type="letter">
               <p>BEFORE I undertake to account for the origin of the Fever, which made its appearance in this city in June laſt, I muſt be permitted to revert to certain facts and opinions contained in a work which I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to the public on the ſubject of a ſimilar Fever, which prevailed more generally in this city, during part of the Summer and Autumn of 1795.</p>
               <p>IN that publication it was ſtated, that the Fever was firſt obſerved in the neighbourhood of Fitch's wharf, in Water-ſtreet, and that it gradually extended from thence, in different ways, but more particularly in the direction of the prevailing winds.</p>
               <p>NEAR where the Fever firſt began, there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral unfiniſhed docks, which had been receptacles, for ſeveral years, of every kind of filth and dirt.—There was alſo, a conſiderable ſurface of new made ground in the neighbourhood, in a very unfiniſhed ſtate, upon which, dirt collected from the ſtreets, was frequently thrown: likewiſe, ſeveral ſtorehouſes, erected on piles: and, added to theſe, a neglected and filthy ſtate of the wharves. This repreſentation, as it regards the then condition of the docks in that part of the town, is confirmed by the letter of Mr. Fitch, an extract of which is given in the publication above alluded to, and which, as it is much to our purpoſe, I ſhall again introduce. His words are, "Although the docks in the vicinity of the ſtore which I occupy, may be leſs offenſive than in many other parts of the city, yet, many of them are in a very exceptionable ſituation. The ponding of water, by running a bulk head acroſs an unfiniſhed dock, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035161_0013_1000B0BEB87C3868"/>
leaving the vacancy for ſeveral years to be filled up with every ſpecies of filth and periſhable matter, is an object worthy the attention of the Police. The ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the grounds between Water-ſtreet and Cherry ſtreet, is rendered very noxious, by Water-ſtreet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed above a certain level, and thus preventing thoſe grounds from being drained. The effect of ſuch nuiſances on the health of the inhabitants, in a crouded part of the city, cannot be imaginary."</p>
               <p>THOSE who have peruſed that publication, will find a number of reaſons aſſigned, why the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſouth eaſt part of the city, would be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly liable to Fever during the hot months. This opinion was warranted, in the firſt place, from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, as the Bilious Fever had appeared in that quarter for ſeveral years ſucceſſively; and, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, as a matter of reaſoning, from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſituation and expoſure of that part of the city.—But fortunately the ſouth eaſt part of the city has been more healthy this year, than for ſeveral years paſt; and the cauſes of Fever ſeem to have been transferred to a part of the town, hitherto reputed little liable to any particular ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>IN inveſtigating the cauſes of this change, a recourſe to facts only, will afford a ſufficient explanation.—</p>
               <p>FIRST. THE docks ſpoken of, in the ſouth-eaſtern part of the city, which were in ſo loathſome a ſtate, have been completed and generally covered with a ſufficient quantity of good earth, gravel or ſand. The grounds have been drained, or, where that was not practicable, the ſurface has been rendered uniform with clean earth. The vacancies under the ſtores which were built on piles, have been filled up in a proper manner, and the wharves have been kept free from rubbiſh and filth. In ſhort, ſo much care and induſtry have been beſtowed here, to remove the nuiſances that ſo generally abounded, that, where a perſon was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035161_0014_1000B0360BCB0EE8"/>
before almoſt ſuffocated with intolerable ſtenches, one may now paſs without experiencing the leaſt offenſive ſmell.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY. LET us ſee what has happened at the ſouth-weſt part of the town. Between the Whitehall and Exchange-ſlip, a new dock has been made, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on an average 60 feet into the river, extending 458 feet in front, and 9 feet in depth. If 9 ſquare feet are calculated to be equal to a cart load, it will be found that 24,000 cart loads were neceſſary to fill up the dock, which were accumulating from July 1795 to July 1796. And what has been the nature of the materials em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for this purpoſe? It is difficult to anſwer the queſtion, except in very general terms, namely, every thing ſubject to decay and corruption. One third of the ſubſtance of this dock may be computed to be lodged above the ordinary height of the tides—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 8000 loads of theſe periſhable materials were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the action of the hot ſummer ſun. In the month of April of this year, I had frequent occaſion to viſit White-hall:—The ſtench which already iſſued from the dock, was highly offenſive; and on enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I found that the matter which had been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make the new ground, conſiſted chiefly of the dirt which had been accumulating in the ſtreets during the winter ſeaſon; and that, beſides dogs, cats, hogs, &amp;c. there had been actually two horſes buried in the rubbiſh, which had died in the ſpring, in a ſmall hovel, erected on the margin of this nuiſance.</p>
               <p>REFLECTING on this ſtate of things at White-hall, and recollecting what had happened in another part of the city under ſimilar circumſtances, I found my mind ſtrongly impreſſed with the probable conſequences;—and was led from thence to converſe with ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of the corporation on the ſubject. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing material could be done to guard againſt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035161_0015_1000C2C2950C6998"/>
probable miſchiefs. There was a contract<note n="*" place="bottom">The above declaration will be found explanatory of moſt of the evils which this city <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

About the middle of June, the offenſive ſmells ariſing from the new dock and other nuiſances in the neigbourhood, were very generally obſerved in that quarter of the city, and their effects were manifeſt in many who complained of head-achs, ſick ſtomachs, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THE ſituation of the Exchange ſlip, as a ſource of noxious exhalations I feel myſelf obliged to notice alſo particularly. This ſlip from its length and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—from its being the receptacle of an extenſive common ſewer;—and, eſpecially from having a great proportion of its muddy bottom expoſed at low water, ſends forth effluvia, which, in a very ſenſible manner, contaminates the air to a conſiderable diſtance around.</p>
               <p>IN a letter publiſhed in July laſt, I had occaſion to mention the frequent diſagreeable ſtate of the air in the ſouth-weſt part of the city. It was there ſtated, "that the poiſonous exhalations which had abounded in that quarter during the warm weather, had rendered the air ſo noxious, that the inhabitants on the ſouth-ſide of Pearl-ſtreet, between the Old-ſlip and White-hall, almoſt all concur in their teſtimony that the diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effluvia have frequently obliged them, eſpecially in the evening, to cloſe their windows on the ſouth-ſide of their houſes; and in ſeveral inſtances gentlemen have aſſured us, that the offenſive ſmell has been ſuch, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to occaſion vomiting." Theſe are circumſtances of great moment and are entitled to ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035161_0016_1000C2C4193D0F40"/>
if they are regarded only as cauſes which increaſe the malignity of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>IN the latter part of June, the fever began to ſhew itſelf about White-hall, and in the vicinity of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; but it continued for a ſhort time only, when the concurrence of high winds, heavy rains, much thunder and lightening, and cool weather, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the middle of July, were probably the cauſes to which we may attribute the ſuſpenſion of the diſeaſe. This, at leaſt, was rendered probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as ſoon as the weather became warm and dry again, it was accompanied by thoſe noxious exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which again produce the fever. Thus the diſeaſe appeared, went off, and came on again, according as the weather favored or impeded the generation of thoſe vapors, which, in their operation on the human body, are the exciting cauſe of fever.</p>
               <p>I MUST take notice of ſome other circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to many of the houſes about White-hall, which, if they were not of themſelves, in any inſtance a cauſe of Fever, muſt certainly be conſidered of a nature to aggravate the diſeaſe, when brought on by other cauſes—namely, the ſtate of the ground in the rear of the houſes, which, in conſequence of the ſtreets being raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, in many places conſiderably below the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry level, and therefore liable to accumulate matters which render the air impure, and which, in confined ſituations, are often the cauſe of Fevers.—Alſo, the old and decayed ſtate of many of the houſes, and the inattention to cleanlineſs, which is always neglected, where people of the poorer ſort are much crouded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The bedding and clothes of the ſick under theſe circumſtances, muſt be ſuppoſed to become more and more impregnated with the exhalations ariſing from their bodies; and hence the dreadful havock made by infectious diſeaſes in the ſmall houſes of the poor, and on ſuch as are deſtitute of the means of cleanlineſs,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035161_0017_1000B03AE40B2088"/>
and who, of neceſſity, are obliged to remain a length of time without changing their clothes.</p>
               <p>THE further we enquire into the ſources of the Fever, the greater is the analogy diſcovered to be, between the ſtate of things at White Hall, and in that part of the city where the Fever firſt appeared laſt year. Accumulations of decaying animal and vegetable matters—a part of the ground below the general level—poor people crouded together in ſmall uncleanly apartments, were circumſtances ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly coincident, that were particular effects to take place in one ſituation, we ſhould naturally expect ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar effects to take place in the other. If the Fever of laſt year, and that of the preſent year, were brought on by the ſame cauſes, it may poſſibly be aſked, how it happened, that in the one inſtance, it was ſo widely extended, and in the other confined to ſuch narrow limits? This queſtion admits of an eaſy ſolution. It is generally acknowledged, that Epidemic diſeaſes are either produced or widely diffuſed, by ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular qualities of the atmoſphere; and the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary prevalence of heat and moiſture in the air, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Summer and Autumn of laſt year, muſt ſtill be recent in the memory of the inhabitants of this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while the ſtate of the air, during the warm ſeaſon of the preſent year, has been much cooler and drier than uſual.</p>
               <p>THUS, the Fever of the laſt year was more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally felt, becauſe a peculiarity of the weather prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the body, or rendered it more ſuſceptible of thoſe cauſes which produced the diſeaſe: whereas, the weather of this year, occaſioning no prediſpoſition, the Fever was generally confined to a ſituation, where it required the exciting cauſe to be itſelf ſufficiently concentrated to produce its effects.</p>
               <p>MANY of the men who belonged to the market veſſels which came to the white-Hall dock, ſickened
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035161_0018_1000C2C6D71B3110"/>
from being expoſed to the exhalations ariſing in this ſituation. The boatmen of the Staten-Iſland and Elizabeth-town Ferry-boats, ſuffered very generally, although many of them were ſo cautious as not to ſleep on ſhore, and to avoid all communication with the ſick. Several of them died of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>MANY tranſient perſons from Staten-Iſland, who frequently viſited at Mr. Cortelyou's, reſiding at White-Hall, during their ſtay in New-York, ſicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome died. It was ſaid that Mr. Cortelyou's family were ſick with the Yellow-Fever, but this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was not well founded. The family were not well during any part of the warm weather, but none of them had the Bilious Fever. Their complaints were ſuch as are commonly the conſequence of living in foul air, <abbr>viz.</abbr>—ſick ſtomachs and head-ach<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, attended with conſiderable laſſitude.</p>
               <p>THE above facts reſpecting tranſient perſons taking the Fever, are confirmed by Dr. Clarke, of Elizabeth-town, New-Jerſey, who, in a letter with which he has favoured me, obſerves, "There were many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this diſeaſe among the ferrymen, who reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

               <p>IT is worthy of remark alſo, that the diſeaſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr. Clarke, occurred in thoſe only, who had been in New-York.</p>
               <p>HE writes that, "Amongſt the caſes which came within my practice, and from the beſt information of others, there was no inſtance of the diſeaſe taking place in any except <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> who had been at New-York, and particularly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> White-Hall."</p>
               <p>DR. CLARKE ſtates further, "That there was no
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035161_0019_1000B04291685C20"/>
inſtance of the Fever amongſt the nurſes, or attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants upon the ſick." This fact is confirmative of the opinion which we have always endeavoured to ſupport that the Fever in queſtion, is not a contagious diſeaſe. The operation of local cauſes in producing diſeaſes, is well exemplified in the account of the Remitting and Intermitting Fevers of the Weſt-Indies, given us by Dr. Hume:—"And while," ſays he, "The Hoſpital remained there (at Port Royal) the ſick were ſeldom ſeized with complaints of this kind."</p>
               <p>"WHEN another Hoſpital was built on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide, though only at the diſtance of four miles, not one man in a hundred, eſcaped theſe Fevers, who were ſent to the Hoſpital and remained in it three or four weeks;—and even the marine guard, who were relieved once a fortnight or three weeks, fared no better."</p>
               <p>Dr. HUME deſcribes the ſituation of this Hoſpital, to be in the neighbourhood of ſtagnant water marſhes. He then adds, "It was the damp winds filled with the putrid exhalations, which occaſioned the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of remitting or Yellow-Fever, and intermitting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of this place. At my requeſt this hoſpital was deſerted, although in all other reſpects it was good, and had coſt near fifty thouſand pounds ſterling.—Several plantations near this hoſpital, were unhealthy from the ſame cauſes."</p>
               <p>IT would be endleſs to quote authorities upon this ſubject, nor is it neceſſary to look to a diſtance for them. What has happened within our own ſtate, abundantly confirms the fact, as may be ſeen from Dr. William's letter, inſerted in my publication upon the Fever of laſt year. I do not think it neceſſary to be more particular in reciting facts, or in detailing thoſe circumſtances which, in my mind, are fully compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to explain the origin of the Fever which has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited ſo much alarm, and proved ſo great a ſcourge
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035161_0020_1000C2C951947D00"/>
to the citizens of New-York. It is the leſs neceſſary, becauſe I mean to ſhew, by the following documents, that the diſeaſe was not, as many have inſinuated, nay poſitively declared, brought here from abroad: and if we can advance ſufficient teſtimony to invalidate that opinion, the concluſion neceſſarily follows, that the Fever was occaſioned by cauſes of a domeſtic na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore, the fact we are ſolicitous to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh, receives that degree of probability, which, in matters of this kind, give an aſſurance, equal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
               <p>I SHALL, then, in the next plaae, bring forward what appertains to the veſſels ſuppoſed to have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Yellow-Fever into New-York.</p>
               <p>THE firſt ſuſpected veſſel was the ſhip Antoniette.</p>
               <p>ON the 25th of May, the ſhip Antoniette arrived in this harbor from Breſt, in ballaſt, and anchored in the North-River. Two days after her arrival, I was requeſted to viſit ſick on board. The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the veſſel aſſured me that the men had not been confined, nor did he think their indiſpoſition ſuch as to render it neceſſary they ſhould be ſent to the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. One of the men was then at work on deck, and the other came from below immediately on being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As, however, the ſhip was to be brought to a dock, it was thought expedient that theſe men ſhould be ſent to the Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>THAT they had not complaints of an infectious nature, ſhall not reſt on my aſſertion alone. The opinion and declaration of Dr. M'Farlin, under whoſe care they were placed, will carry with them much ſtronger evidence.</p>

The one complained of a pain in his breaſt, attended with cough and difficulty of breathing. His ſtrength was conſiderably impaired—the complaint, which he attributed to cold, having been of ſome duration. By the application of a bliſter to the ſternum, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued uſe of expectorants, he was diſcharged as cured from the Hoſpital.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of May, the Antoniette hauled to the dock at White Hall. In this ſituation, the crew could not come on ſhore, nor return on board, without paſſing over the new made grounds; and thus were the men expoſed to the exhalations which aroſe from it whilſt in the ſhip, and occaſionally, in a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by their viſits on ſhore. During the month of June, moſt of the men of the Antoniette, complained of an unuſual weakneſs, and in the beginning of July, ſeveral of them were attacked with the Fever.</p>
               <p>Two of theſe caſes terminated in black vomit and death. The cauſes of the ſickneſs on board the Antoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035161_0022_1000C2CEC7588DE0"/>
being no longer a ſubject of conjecture, the remedy became obvious—namely, the removal of the veſſel to a more healthy ſituation; and as the ſhip had lain more than a month at White Hall dock, it muſt be ſuppoſed that the air beneath her decks had become completely ſaturated with the noxious vapours ariſing from that maſs of decaying materials, of which the dock was compoſed.</p>
               <p>IT was deemed neceſſary, therefore, to have recourſe to the meaſures commonly employed to purify veſſels. For this purpoſe, the Antoinette was hauled out into the ſtream; and after the proceſs of purification was over, ſhe was directed into the North river to take in her cargo. After this period, the men on board her remained in good health, except Captain Hendricks, who had the ague and fever.</p>
               <p>Now, as the men who were complaining at the time of the arrival of the Antoniette, were not ſick with fever (of which Dr. M'Farlin's letter is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evidene) and as the Fever did not appear among the crew, until five weeks after ſhe had been at the White Hall dock, and more than ten days after it had appeared on ſhore, it muſt require a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſhare of pre-poſſeſſion in any one, to believe that the Antoinette had any agency in the origin of the Fever at White Hall.</p>
               <p>ON the 29th of July, the brig Patty arrived in this port. After her departure, a report was circulated, and by many credited, that ſhe had introduced a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fever into this city. Although on this ſubject I had no doubt, as I had taken a manifeſt of the healthful ſituation of the brig Patty, and the crew had undergone my perſonal examination, yet I was anxious that every ſuſpicion ſhould, as far as poſſible, be removed from the minds of the citizens. I was therefore induced to write to the commander of the brig, who was then at Boſton, to requeſt he would
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035161_0023_1000B047266F9598"/>
give me an atteſted ſtatement of facts reſpecting ſuch ſickneſs as might have exiſted on board the brig dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voyage, and the condition of the health of her crew at her arrival in this port—whether ſhe had any Fever on board after that period, or whether any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had ſickened in Boſton after her arrival there, who had had communication with her. To theſe enquiries I ſhortly after received the following atteſted certificate:—</p>

                     <p>THIS is to certify, that during my voyage in the Brig Patty, from Boſton to the Weſt-Indies, and back to New-York, none of my crew were ſick of a malignant Fever; and that at my arival in New-York, all my crew were in good health, except my Mate, who was ſick with the Ague and Fever, and who was taken out of my veſſel and put on board a Packet to be ſent home to Trenton; and ſince my arrival in Boſton, my crew has remained in perfect health as before;—nor has any perſon who has been on board the brig Patty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or been apprehenſive of any diſorder whatever.</p>

               <p>THE above ſtatement of Captain Snow, is ſo clear and concluſive, that ſtill to entertain any doubt, would imply a mind diſpoſed to contemn truth, even under the ſerious garb of a ſacred oath!</p>
               <p>THUS, then, I have taken a curſory view of the circumſtances relative to the origin of the Yellow-Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. In reviewing the ſituation of that part of the city, we have found abundant reaſon for believing the Fever was produced by cauſes of a local nature, and originating there. The importance of this fact ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me extremely ſolicitous that the truth of it ſhould be generally eſtabliſhed, and ſtrongly impreſſed on every mind: for, if meaſures are to be purſued, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035161_0024_1000B0252E25DBA8"/>
to prevent the calamity in future, the extent and adequacy of thoſe meaſures, muſt depend on this conviction.</p>
               <p>IT is to be hoped, that we may not deceive our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by a mode of reaſoning adopted by ſome, which, however plauſible it may appear at firſt view, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prove fallacious on examination.</p>
               <p>IT is urged, that the city of New-York has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, for many years, exempt from any particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fatal diſeaſes; and we have no greater reaſon <hi>now,</hi> to ſuppoſe ourſelves more liable to ſickneſs, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and, that if diſeaſes of a malignant kind, ſhould, at any time, prevail among us, we ought to look to ſome foreign ſource for their origin. The anſwer to this argument is, that the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of things is every day changing. This city is extending its dimenſions—the houſes are becoming more compact and crouded together—the inhabitants are encreaſing in number—and, more eſpecially, the mode of making <hi>new ground,</hi> which renders a conſiderable part of the city a <hi>low level</hi>—are changes which place us in a ſituation different from that of any former period.</p>
               <p>THIS kind of calculation, it is to be feared, is not by many entered into; but it is one which is entitled to ſerious conſideration, inaſmuch as it takes in thoſe circumſtances which have a particular influence upon the health of the inhabitants of the city of New-York.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I conclude, I muſt take the liberty of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning to your Excellency, what has hitherto been the condition of the Hoſpital lately erected on Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's Iſland. I am induced to do this, in order that the inconveniencies under which it has labored, may be rendered apparent; and from a hope that meaſures will, in conſequence, be taken to provide for the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035161_0025_1000C2D3CE7435E8"/>
Hoſpital in ſuch a manner as may be neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the eſtabliſhment, and give it extenſive utility.</p>
               <p>THE neceſſary alterations and repairs which the buildings on Bedlow's Iſland required to render them ſit to receive the ſick, were not completed till the middle of Auguſt. As ſoon as theſe were done, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was made to the Commiſſioners of Health, for a ſupply of neceſſaries to accommodate the ſick—who, at this period, were ſent to the Hoſpital from White-hall, and from ſeveral veſſels juſt arrived from ſea. The Commiſſioners directed the beds and bedding which had been uſed the year before at Bellevue, to be ſent to the new Hoſpital on Bedlow's Iſland. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, theſe articles were in a very filthy ſtate; but as the ſick were already at the Hoſpital, we had no alternative, but to ſelect the cleaneſt of thoſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and uſe them in that ſtate. The Hoſpital was alſo unprovided with wearing apparel, than which, nothing is more neceſſary, as well for the comfort of the ſick, as to prevent the introduction of infection into the Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>UNDER theſe circumſtances, the conſequences were ſuch as might naturally be expected; for, within eight days of the time in which theſe articles were brought to the Hoſpital, thoſe people who had been employed in tranſporting the bedding from Bellevue, the nurſes who attended the ſick, and the ſteward of the houſe, were attacked with fever. The attending Phyſician, Monſieur Bouvier, was alſo indiſpoſed for ſeveral days.</p>
               <p>FROM this diſtreſſing ſituation, however, the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital was ſoon happily relieved, by a ſupply of beds, bedding, and ſuch clothes as were neceſſary for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent changes, and placing the ſick in a ſtate of the greateſt cleanlineſs. From this period, neither nurſe,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035161_0026_1000B04BB83C7818"/>
viſitor, nor any kind of attendant, were known to be attacked with fever.</p>

                  <salute>To the MAGISTRACY of NEW-YORK.
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
                  </salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT would be improper, at leaſt foreign to the deſign of this addreſs, to enter on the enquiry whether the late Epidemic which raged in this city, was imported, or generated among us. Our motive for addreſſing you at this time, ariſes from a deſire to engage, and at the ſame time to aſſiſt, as far as we are able, your reſpectable Board, in applying a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective to ſome of thoſe cauſes, which, we conceive, ſerved at once to extend its influence, and increaſe its malignity.</p>
               <p>ON this head then, we venture to point out the following objects, as particularly demanding the notice of the Magiſtrates, and the interpoſition of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the accumulation of filth in the ſtreets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS, being compoſed chiefly of dead animal and vegetable matter, is, when expoſed to a hot ſun, a ſource of noxious effluvia, which have a tendency to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035161_0027_1000C2D6A731A548"/>
produce the moſt fatal effects; and, that ſuch efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via have been the cauſe of Fever, has been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by repeated obſervation and experience in all parts of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Obſtructed water-drains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE, by occaſioning ſtagnant waters, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting matter of various kinds, which, undergoing de-compoſition, emit air of qualities extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to health.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. <hi>The ground of certain parts of the city, where the lots of houſes are conſiderably below the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary level of the ſtreets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN ſuch places, the neceſſary conſequences muſt be an accumulation of various ſubſtances, which, under the influence of heat and moiſture, putrify, and thus contaminate the atmoſphere, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate properries to it, of a nature extremely delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. <hi>The ſituation of many of the Docks and Stores along the Eaſt-River.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is to be obſerved that in many places, large ſurfaces of mud are expoſed at low water, which throw up during the heat of the ſummer, an intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtench; and this evil is greatly increaſed by a practice of filling in docks with every ſpecies of filth collected from the ſtreets, which proves an unfailing ſource of unwholeſome air. We remark, further, that a practice has been permitted in this city, which we conceive very reprehenſible, and what, we have no doubt, has produced many inſtances of individual diſeaſe, if it has done nothing worſe;—that is, the pernicious cuſtom of collecting and throwing into one heap, great quantities of manure (gathered from the ſtreet) on vacant lots. This was the caſe (during the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035161_0028_1000C2D82FD96B90"/>
prevalence of the Fever) at the head of George-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>To the cauſes above enumerated, ſome others might, with propriety, be added, as endangering, by their permiſſion, the health of the citizens.—Among theſe laſt, are, Slaughter-Houſes, Manufactories of Scap and Candles, Vellum, heather, Starch, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IN laying this detail before you, we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude without declaring, that in our opinions, the malignity and fatality of the late Epidemic Fever, were greatly influenced by the before mention cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and were it neceſſary, we could ſuperadd the authorities of the firſt Phyſicians and Philoſophers, as corroborative of our own.</p>
               <p>WE, therefore, with confidence and reſpect, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the above to your ſerious conſideration; and hope that their importance, as affecting the health and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the city, will receive, as undoubtedly they claim, your early and due attention.</p>

               <p>THE Commiſſioners of the Health-Office, having hitherto, as far as circumſtances would admit, fulfilled the deſign of their appointment, conceive it proper, in the further diſcharge of their duty, now at the cloſe of the year, to lay before the governor, an account of the manner in which they have executed their truſt, of their expenditures therein, and, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, of the ſituation of the public eſtabliſhment under their care; together with ſuch obſervations as have occurred to them on the ſubject of preſerving and promoting the health of the city, and rendering
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035161_0029_1000C2DBDF488B80"/>
more efficacious the public proviſion for that purpoſe, and for the reception and accommodation of the ſick.</p>
               <p>THE Hoſpital at Bellevue, eſtabliſhed by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of the city, had remained, ſince the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding year, furniſhed for the reception of the ſick, and offered, in the beginning of the ſeaſon, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aſylum to thoſe who might arrive from ſea, until the eſtabliſhment under the authority of the ſtate could be got ready. It was accordingly begun to be occupied for this purpoſe, in the month of June, from which time, to the 18th of Auguſt, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſick ſent thither, was chiefly from veſſels arrived from ſea. In the mean time, the buildings on Bedlow's Iſland, purchaſed of the French, being given up by them, were cleanſed and made <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to anſwer the purpoſes of a Lazaretto, and were furniſhed with beds, bedding, clothing, medicines, &amp;c. and provided with a Phyſician, nurſes, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary attendants, and to which the ſick at Bellevue, were removed about the 18th of Auguſt: And altho' from unforeſeen or unavoidable circumſtances, the accommodations there, were not ſo perfect as could have been deſired, they were, by care and attention, rendered as comfortable and commodious as poſſible, and the place was viſited by ſome of the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as often as occaſion required. The number of ſick thus received at the Lazaretto, from the 18th of Auguſt to the 1ſt of September, (the lateſt period at which any have been ſent there) including thoſe from Bellevue, was eighty-ſeven, of which ſeventeen have died: The greater part of this number had arrived from ſea, and the remainder were inhabitants of the city, who could not find ſuitable accommodations at home.</p>
               <p>THE Commiſſioners, at the recommendation of the Health-Officer, appointed to attend the ſick as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, Doctor Bouvier, a gentleman who had acquired
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035161_0030_1000B051B0BBFF78"/>
much reputation in a long reſidence and practice of Phyſic, in the French Weſt-Indies, and who hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his duty with ſingular ability and attention, and with great ſucceſs; and although the allowance made him of four dollars a day, during his attendance, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more than their ſcanty funds would afford, it was, in their opinion, not adequate to his time and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable ſervices; and they therefore think it juſt that he ſhould receive ſuch additional pay, as may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to amount to a reaſonable compenſation, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly recommend him for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>THE Malignant Fever of the laſt ſummer and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, though for a time very alarming, yet was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, in a great meaſure, confined to a diſtrict of ſmall extent, and greatly limited in its effects, compared with that of the preceding year. It prevailed in the White-Hall and Moore ſtreets, and in Water and Front-ſtreets and the South ſide of Pearl-ſtreet, from the Exchange downwards, and in the lower part of Broad-ſtreet.—The reſt of the city was principally free from it, and in a healthy ſtate; and the few perſons who, in the other parts, were attacked with the Fever, could ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally trace the origin of it to that infected quarter, or to <hi>local circumſtances,</hi> in their particular neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. It appeared in two or three inſtances in the month of June, but did not cauſe alarm till about the middle of July, from which time to 1ſt of November, the number attacked with it was about 247, of which there died 67; of this laſt number 7 or 8 died at Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vue, or Bedlow's Iſland, and are included in the return of deaths from thence.</p>
               <p>ON this occaſion, attention was paid to the timely removal of ſuch patients whoſe circumſtances render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it neceſſary for their better accommodation, and to every other point in which, in the opinion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, they could contribute to the comfort and ſafety of individuals; and as far as their powers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035161_0031_1000C2DE6CC2E0A8"/>
to the reſtoring and preſerving the health of the city.</p>
               <p>THE Commiſſioners have found, that the facts ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the repreſentation of the <hi>Health-Officer,</hi> on the ſubject of this ſickneſs, are juſt; and it appears to them with ſatisfactory clearneſs, that the filthy and corrupt ſtate of ſome of the <hi>Docks and Slips</hi> in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Exchange and White-hall, was the cauſe of the ſickneſs; and there is little reaſon to doubt, but that, if the ſtate of the air in general, throughout the ſummer, had been favourable to the propagation of <hi>infection,</hi> it would have found, in various parts of the city, from <hi>filthy and noiſome manufactories,</hi> neglected vacant lots covered with offenſive matter, and dirty ſtreets and lanes, an abundant ſupply of <hi>noxious efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> to increaſe and ſpread its baneful influence; and that the city would, in all probability, have ſuffered perhaps a more general and deſtructive calamity, than in the preceding year.</p>
               <p>THIS impure ſtate of things was obvious to all; and it was hoped that our late ſevere experience would have ſtimulated to a complete reformation; and that aided by the law "to prevent the bringing in and ſpreading of infectious diſeaſes," an effectual exertion would have been made to <hi>remove all nuiſances,</hi> and place the city, in all reſpects, in a reſpectable and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtate. But the warm ſeaſon arrived, and no meaſures of this kind were taken. The Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers preſented to the Corporation, a repreſentation of the ſtate of the city, recommending a mode of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and keeping the ſtreets, &amp;c. in good order, a copy of which was delivered to the Governor.</p>
               <p>AFTER ſome time, ſeveral of the moſt offenſive ſlips and docks were cleanſed and filled up in a proper manner, and ſome new mode was adopted for clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſtreets, which, however, proved but <hi>partially</hi> efficacious, being, in the opinion of the Commiſſioners,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035161_0032_1000C2E001D5BA00"/>
far ſhort of that recommended by them. But none of the <hi>offenſive manufactories</hi> were removed—they all ſtill remain—ſeveral of them in the moſt populous parts of the city, and are moſt <hi>dangerous and diſgraceful</hi> nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances; one of which appears from an affidavit of <hi>John Collis,</hi> referred to in a letter from the Health Officer to the Commiſſioners, to have occaſioned the <hi>ſickneſs</hi> of a whole <hi>family,</hi> and the death of one of its members. The continuance of this unhappy ſtate of things, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aid of the law, and the repreſentations on the ſubject, afford a <hi>gloomy proſpect</hi> with regard to the future welfare of the city, eſpecially as there is no hope of engaging the Corporation in vigorous and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient meaſures for a complete reformation. The Commiſſioners are convinced that the principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that body, think juſtly and independently on this ſubject, and have been zealous in their endeavours to effect a change, and that ſeveral others are diſpoſed to co-operate with them in the ſalutary work; but a majority have not been found willing to engage in thoſe meaſures, at the riſk of offending many of their conſtituents, and the conſequent loſs of their places; for, however obvious to all intelligent and liberal minds, is the neceſſity of placing and preſerving the city in the moſt cleanly and wholeſome ſtate, yet a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of the inhabitants are oppoſed to any new and extraordinary meaſures being taken for that purpoſe, from the contracted and erroneous conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of encreaſed expence, partial inconvenience, or innovation.</p>
               <p>THE meaſures neceſſary to place and preſerve this city in a cleanly and wholeſome ſtate, are not difficult to aſcertain. They are—to fill up all the docks and ſlips with clean earth, gravel, or ſand, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that the <hi>muddy bottoms ſhall not be left bare at low water;</hi> and alſo to complete the filling up with the ſame materials, all the remaining vacancies under the ſtores and about the wharves, and to prohibit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dirt of the ſtreet, or any filthy or corruptive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035161_0033_1000B0538D0E0E68"/>
from being uſed for this purpoſe, or thrown into them; to remove all ſuch matters from the vacant lots or yards, in and about the town; and where ſuch are ſo ſituated as to receive the waſh of the ſtreets, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent grounds, or retain <hi>ſtagnant water,</hi> that they be filled up with good earth, &amp;c. that the water may run from them into the ſtreets; to provide effectually for cleanſing all the ſtreets, lanes, wharves, &amp;c. at leaſt twice a week, and carrying the dirt and rubbiſh imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to a ſpot from whence it will be taken away in boats, without any delay, and to prohibit its being thrown elſewhere, and alſo to prohibit any filthy or corruptive matter or rubbiſh, from being brought out of houſes, cellars, or yards, into the ſtreets &amp;c. except at the time the perſons appear who are employed to take them away; to complete the paving of all the ſtreets, lanes, &amp;c. and the entrances of the docks, wharves, and ſlips; to provide that all the <hi>water drains</hi> be kept clean and free from obſtructions, that no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may remain and <hi>ſtagnate</hi> in them; and, to remove out of <hi>town,</hi> all manufactories which have a tendency to <hi>infect the air with noxious effluvia.</hi> Theſe meaſures, carried into full effect, with the neceſſary regulations to prevent the introduction of diſeaſe from abroad, would, undoubtedly, preſerve the city in as great a degree of healthineſs, as it enjoyed in former years.</p>
               <p>AND for the attainment of this moſt deſirable end, the Corporation appear to be veſted with ſufficient powers; but, unhappily, the capacity for accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch important good, is rendered abortive by the prevalence of an improper influence over the majority, as ſtated above.</p>
               <p>THE Commiſſioners are aware that this repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made in <hi>plain and ſtrong terms;</hi> but as they are not only convinced of the truth of it, from their own obſervations, but alſo find themſelves juſtified in it, from reſpectable authority, which cannot be doubted, they conceive that the importance of the ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035161_0034_1000C2E379979B48"/>
that the evil ſhould be fully underſtood, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the remedy, if any can be found, ſhould be applied with the greater readineſs and effect.</p>

               <p>AS correct an account as could be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the number of people who ſickened and died in the neighbourhood of White-Hall, in 1796, is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for two particular reaſons:—1ſt. To ſhew that the devaſtations committed by that formidable diſeaſe, were limited to a few acres of ground:—2dly. and what is of equal importance, is, to ſhew that its fatality was in a ratio to the vicinity of the nuiſance. From theſe facts, I would ſuggeſt the following queſtion, <abbr>viz.</abbr>—If the Yellow Fever is to be conſidered as a contagious diſeaſe, is it not remarkable that it ſhould have raged with a violence almoſt unequalled in ſo healthy an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure as the ſouth-weſt part of our city, and that the other parts of the city enjoyed, at leaſt, a uſual degree of health? This queſtion cannot poſſibly, in my apprehenſion, admit of but one ſolution, and I would alledge that the temperature and diſpoſition of the air during the warm ſeaſon of 1796, was not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the propagation of the diſeaſe generally.—As far as the poiſonous exhalations ariſing from 24000 cart loads ſtreet manure, expoſed to the influence of a hot ſun, were diſtinguiſhed by their offenſive ſmell, ſo far their effects were manifeſted by the appearance of the diſeaſe and no farther.</p>

               <p>THE deputation of the Common Council, conſiſting of Gabriel Furman, Jacob de la Montagnie, and Thomas Storm, Eſqrs. have, with the Health-Officer, and Commiſſioners, inſpected the ſituation of the ſtreets, docks, wharves and ſlips, from White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall to New-market, on the eaſt river. The various objects which, in their opinion, require the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and authority of the Common Council, will be the ſubject of a ſubſequent repreſentation. At preſent the Commiſſioners (whoſe immediate duty it appears to be) beg leave to ſolicit your attention to ſuch meaſures as may be beſt calculated to remedy the following exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evils, <abbr>viz:</abbr>—</p>
               <p>NUISANCES of conſiderable magnitude are found on ſeveral vacant and open lots—particularly one next to the Circus in Broad-Way, and another at the corner of Broad-Way and Beaver-ſtreet. Theſe we think ought to be incloſed to prevent a greater collecton of filth and dirt.</p>
               <p>THE ſurface of the ſtreets at the head of the Old-ſlip
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035161_0040_1000C2EA4B636F90"/>
and Beckman-ſlip, want conſiderable raiſing with wholeſome earth or gravel.</p>
               <p>EXCHANGE-SLIP ought to be filled up ſo far as the Common Council have already determined:—Alſo Burling-ſlip on a range with the ſouth ſide of Front-ſtreet, and the lot granted Meſſrs. Van Zandt and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on the weſt ſide of it. This, in its preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is likewiſe a receptacle for all kinds of offenſive filth.</p>
               <p>THE Commiſſioners obſerve with regret, that ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate exertions are wanted to dig out White-hall, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enties, Coffee-houſe, Fly-market, and Peck ſlips.—They beg leave, therefore, to name Mr. Thomas Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, as a ſuitable perſon to aſſiſt in the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to preſs the execution of theſe important objects.</p>
               <p>THE ſolicitude of the Commiſſioners to obviate the effects apprehended from delaying this buſineſs, will, they truſt, be a ſufficient apology for the preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>

Commiſſioners, tho' deſirous of brevity in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, do not find themſelves at liberty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the preſent lengthy details; as, in their opinion, every object is of more or leſs importance to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral health of the city.</p>

               <head>RESIDUE of the obſervations on the ſituation of the Streets, Slips, Docks, &amp;c. made by Gabriel Furman, Jacob de la Montagnie, and Thomas Storm, Eſqrs. the Health Officer and Commiſſioners, on the 10th of April, 1797.</head>
               <p>WHITE-HALL is very much incumbered with tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, brick and other lumber, and generally very filthy. The dock, eaſt-ſide of the ſlip, wants paving, the new-made part of which to Exchange-ſlip, is, at leaſt, one foot lower than the outer end and ſides. The yards back of the new-built houſes on it, are ſtill lower, exceedingly filthy, and muſt become very offenſive in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hot weather, unleſs filled up with wholeſome earth or gravel, which the Commiſſioners beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the attention of the Common Council.</p>
               <p>THE lower end of Moore-ſtreet wants paving, as alſo the dock on both ſides of Exchange ſlip, being almoſt impoſſible in their preſent ſtate, particularly on Mr. Delafield's ſide.</p>
               <p>THE pavement eaſt-ſide of Coenties ſlip, is in great diſorder, and much broken up, which makes it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly dangerous for foot paſſengers, particularly women and children paſſing by the loaded wood-carts.

The Commiſſioners, therefore, ſuggeſt the propriety of widening that dock four or five feet from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end to the ſouth range of Front-ſtreet, by build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new tier of wood againſt the old dock, well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored together, which will be a very moderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to the proprietor. Unleſs this be done, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made ſafe, nor ſuitably commodious for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating the buſineſs conſtantly tranſacted there.</p>
               <p>MR. ASTOR's, and the adjoining vacant water jots, eaſt-ſide of Peter Schenk's ſtore, Cruger's wharf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire filling up, or digging out, as, in their preſent ſtate they are receptacles of filth, and of courſe, great nuiſances. The walks of Front-ſtreet, between Coen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the Old-ſlip, are generally out of repair, and ſome lots totally unpaved. Caſes of this nature are ſo numerous in Front as well as Water ſtreet, from the Old to the New ſlip, that it is almoſt impoſſible to mention each in detail. On this head, therefore, the Commiſſioners beg leave to ſuggeſt the propriety of an ordinance, embracing the walks and ſtreets of the whole city, unleſs ſuch does already exiſt; for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they are repaired, it will be almoſt impoſſible to keep them decent.</p>
               <p>THE ſame general remark muſt ſuffice with regard to filling up all the lanes and alleys leading to the wharves on the eaſt river, from Coenties ſlip to Kip and Laurence's alley, above the foot of Dover ſtreet.</p>

The yards, rear of Blaze Moore's and Nevin Wilſon's ſtores, Front ſtreet, are ſunken, filthy nuiſances, and the buildings on them fronting the river, tho' ſmall, are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on the ſtreet.</p>

Alſo under the ſtore lately occupied by Knox and Briggs, corner of Burling-ſlip, Front ſtreet, in which the yellow fever originated laſt ſprnig. Under the ſtore, weſt ſide of Peck ſlip, corporation property.—Alſo under the corner ſtore, on the eaſt ſide, and the rear of Thomas Burling's and John Thurman's lots.—Likewiſe, Saml. Ackerly's lot, and under John Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenſon's houſe. The two laſt mentioned are already very offenſive, and will ſoon become dangerous.</p>
               <p>THE remaining ſunken lots and yards throughout the town, particularly on the eaſt ſide from White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall to Catharine ſlip, are ſo numerous, and thought ſuch great ſources of unhealthineſs in the hot ſeaſon, that the Commiſſioners are much at a loſs what to ſay on the ſubject of filling them up, as ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking muſt prove very inconvenient to numbers of houſes, and be attended with immenſe expence, which many of the occupants are at preſent but illy prepared to bear.</p>
               <p>THE docks on both ſides of the Coffee-houſe and Fly market ſlips, want paving. Front-ſtreet, from the eaſt ſide of Burling ſlip to Peck ſlip, requires re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating, filling up and paving: Almoſt the whole, in its preſent ſtate, being a perfect nuiſance. If this great object be effected, it will compel a number of proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of lots and buildings in that quarter, to fill up; by which means many filthy and ſunken places, will be ſo far covered, as not to produce evils in hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which otherwiſe, in the opinion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, may reſult.</p>

THE dock on the weſt and eaſt ſide of Peck ſlip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires paving; and the wharves in front, on the eaſt ſide regulating and filling up. Both ſides of James' ſlip, want paving; alſo the lower end of Oliver ſtreet from Cherry ſtreet. Catharine ſlip wants ſome dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out; and the dock on the weſt ſide of it, as well as Catharine market, require paving.</p>
               <p>MAGAZINE, Auguſtus, Little Ann and Barley ſtreets require a regulation and great improvements. In the diſtrict of theſe ſtreets, there are two large ponds of ſtagnant water, which, with the noxious factories may render them a ſource of diſeaſe in hot weather, and are therefore, objects that require timely attention.</p>
               <p>THE lower ends of Rector and Carliſle ſtreets lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Greenwich ſtreet to the North river, want conſiderable raiſing, being at preſent ſunken miry places, and impaſſible.</p>
               <p>THE large ſquare in front of the new Albany baſon, and the dock on each ſide, require paving. Some pavement alſo is wanted at the foot of Cortland ſtreet; and the ſlip at the foot of Dey ſtreet, ſhould be filled up.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035161_0047_1000C2F424DBE5D8"/>
5th inſt. requeſted, that as ſoon as Mr. Hazard had completed the objects he was then engaged in, of cleanſing ſlips with the machine, he might be employed in the ſuperintendance and care of cleanſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the dirt and filth from the piers, docks, &amp;c. of the city, from White Hall to New-ſlip, on the Eaſt river. This is meant to be done agreeably to ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement in contemplation, whereby the proprietors ſhall bear a proportion of the expence, with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, if poſſible. The Commiſſioners think it moſt adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to diſcontinue taking any more dirt out of the docks for the preſent. If their opinion concurs with that of the Common Council, they beg that Mr. Hazard may be directed to take charge of the other object un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the immediate direction of the Commiſſioners, during the time this ſervice may be judged neceſſary, and to receive his daily pay from them, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be twelve ſhillings.</p>
               <p>IN addition to the places already repreſented in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, the following require the interpoſition of the board.</p>
               <p>Peter Goelett's and John Delafield's ſide walks, each ſide of Exchange Slip, ought to be made without delay.</p>
               <p>THE L. from the Old to the new Albany pier, at Coenties Slip, wants filling up with gravel or other ſolid materials.</p>
               <p>THE front of Robert Watts's lots facing the River, Eaſt ſide of Fly-market Stairs, where the Ferry Houſe ſtands, is in a ſtate highly exceptionable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires conſiderable raiſing to caſt off the water.</p>
               <p>THE Alley leading from Peck Slip, between Water and Pearl Streets, is in a ſtate of great nuiſance, and requires filling up, ſo as to caſt the water into Peck Slip. The proprietors are Thomas Elliſon, Samuel
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035161_0048_1000B06C836DAB98"/>
Farmer, Benjamin Mott, William Minturn, and others.</p>
               <p>James and Catherine ſlips are alſo in a ſtate of great nuiſance. The Commiſſioners, though averſe to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up ſlips: if even it were optional with them) from a knowledge of their public utility, are at a loſs what elſe to adviſe in the preſent caſe, to remedy the evils that may ariſe from the condition of theſe two. They conceive, however, that James's ſlip, as far as it runs bare, and Catherine-ſlip, as far as the North ſide of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſtreet, ought to be filled up.</p>
               <p>THE lower ends of Chamber and Murray-ſtreets, on the North river, are in great diſorder, and require re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating and filling. The rear of Mr. Strachan's lot, and Mr. Rhinelander's adjoining it, on Waſhington-ſtreet; and the lower end of Robinſon-ſtreet, from Greenwich-ſtreet to Waſhington-ſtreet, want filling.</p>
               <p>THE pavement in Front-ſtreet, and the ſide walks from the Old ſlip to Gouverneur's alley, particularly, are in ſuch diſorder, that it is impoſſible to get them kept decent and wholeſome without repairs.

               <p>THEY further remark, that the mode of filling this ſlip, is ſimilar to that obſerved laſt ſummer at the White-Hall, which, in its conſequences, was ſo fatal to the neighbourhood; and their ſolicitude with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the object of their preſent application is height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by reflecting that the Yellow-Fever firſt made its appearance the paſt year, in this neighbourhood.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035161_0051_1000C2FC2352C920"/>
for anſwer, that all was well. Determined, however, for certain reaſons, to obtain more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar information, he boarded her, and made enquiries of the pilot, William Berwick, and of the mate, with reſpect to the health of the people, and was told there was no ſick on board.</p>
               <p>AT eleven o'clock this morning, I received a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten notification, that a man, ſuppoſed to be ſick of the yellow fever, was lodged back of No. 30, Pope's alley, Rutgers' ſtreet. I repaired to the place, and found a Mr. William Moſes, who had, the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evening, been landed from the ſhip Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs from Savannah. On examination I found him in the laſt ſtage of the yellow fever.</p>
               <p>IN purſuance of the truſt repoſed in me, I went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and lodged the neceſſary information with the Alderman of the ward, Mr. Jotham Poſt, after which I proceeded to the ſhip, and requeſted the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Mr. Iſaac Hand, to place colors in her ſhrouds, remove her from the dock immediately, and bring her to anchor on the ground aſſigned for quarantine.</p>
               <p>ON enquiry, it appeared that William Berwick, a pilot, conducted the Shepherdeſs into port, and to the wharf. On being deſired by the Captain to remove her into the ſtream, and to the quarantine ground, he equivocated, heſitated, and behaved otherwiſe impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035161_0053_1000C2FEB4E9D660"/>
there are no public meetings or places appointed to receive information concerning them, has been the cauſe of ſome hours delay in reporting the caſe of Mr. Burchill, which I am of opinion, is yellow bilious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever, as deſcribed by authors, ſimilar to what has prevailed in this and other cities, for this ſome years paſt, and is conſidered to be contagious.

               <p>ON receiving the letter directed to the Health Commiſſioners from Dr. Anderſon, I viſited Mr. Burchill agreeably to the ſentiments you expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>I FOUND him laboring under ſymptoms characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing a high grade of bilious fever. The late hour of the night was very unfriendly to a particular exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the color of his ſkin. On repeating my viſit this morning, his face, neck and cheſt, had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a deep yellow tinge. This circumſtance renders his complaint unequivocally that ſpecies of fever ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally denominated Yellow Fever.</p>
               <p>Mr. BURCHILL lives about mid-way on the left hand ſide of Front-ſtreet, between Beekman and Burling ſlip, nearly oppoſite where <hi>Mr. Briggs</hi> of the houſe of Knox and Briggs, died early in the ſpring of 1796, of yellow fever, before that diſeaſe made its appearance at White-hall.</p>

THE part of Front-ſtreet alluded to, has been in an unfiniſhed ſtate for ſeveral years paſt, and is perhaps as dirty and filthy a ſpot as any in the city. It has been repeatedly repreſented to the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>

               <p>THIS young man paſſed through Philadelphia on Sunday laſt, was taken unwell yeſterday, but was able to walk out this morning. I found him under pretty high Fever, accompanied by thoſe ſymptoms, which, at this ſeaſon of the year, give ſuſpicion that it may aſſume a more formidable complexion. Finding him in ſuch circumſtances, I have attempted the moſt deciſive practice with him; and though I conſider him a good deal relieved, I cannot take upon me to ſay that the advantage gained will eventually enſure his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor is it my province to determine how far it will be proper to allow him to remain where he is.

               <p>WHEN the Commiſſioners of the Health Office entered on the diſcharge of the important truſt repoſed in them, they felt ſolicitous that nothing ſhould be wanted on their part, to accompliſh the objects of their appointment.</p>
               <p>WITH this view, they have frequently been led to addreſs you, on the ſubject of the numerous nuiſances,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035161_0058_1000C306AF529BD8"/>
which exiſted in various parts of the city; and they acknowledge the readineſs with which the Common Council have interpoſed their authority for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of them. But, tho' much has been done, much more remains to be done. The object of the preſent addreſs is, to call the attention of the board, to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which, in the opinion of the Commiſſioners, is of great moment to the future welfare of the citizens.</p>
               <p>THE experience of the part ſummer and preſent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn as it regards the operation and effect of the <hi>ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of cleanlineſs</hi> introduced laſt ſpring, has convinced the Commiſſioners that it is practicable to a ſtill greater extent. That it meets the general approbation of their fellow-citizens, is a pleaſing fact: and, that our exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from diſeaſes incident to the ſeaſon, ought, in ſome meaſure, to be attributed to it, is acknowledged. The few caſes of yellow fever which have occured dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paſt ſummer, were moſtly on the borders of the eaſt river, and originated in ſituations where <hi>nuiſances continue to exiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WITH theſe impreſſions, the Commiſſioners beg leave to repreſent to the Common Council, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of directing by an ordinance, all the proprietors of water-lots, eſpecially on the Eaſt river, to fill them up with ſolid materials, ſo that the whole extent of ground already granted, may be completely finiſhed by the firſt of May next, at fartheſt.</p>
               <p>OF whatever magnitude this propoſal may at firſt ſight appear, in its effects on the convenience or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of individuals, the benefits contemplated are incalculably great to the city in general: that is, the removal of thoſe cauſes which may contribute to aid the return of peſtilential diſeaſes in the city.</p>
               <p>DESIROUS as the Commiſſioners are, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment thus far ſucceſsfully attempted, of obviating diſeaſe by cleanlineſs, may be more fully tried, and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035161_0059_1000C308725C5198"/>
convinced that the Common Council is diſpoſed to concur, in the ſame important object they have only further to ſolicit their ſerious attention to this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is made at ſo early a period, with a view to afford ample time for carrying the proproſed regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into complete effect.</p>

               <p>THE incloſed report contains a particular account of the number of ſick which have been ſent to the Hoſpital on Bedlow's Iſland, from Auguſt the 25th, the period when I took charge of that inſtitution, to the firſt of November, 1797.</p>
               <p>AFTER having thus far acquitted myſelf on the ſcore of obligation, my inclination prompts me to lay before your Board, ſome remarks on the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inconveniencies which I have had to contend with during my reſidence on the iſland—inconveniencies which have not only rendered the ſituation of the ſick, in many inſtances, very uncomfortable, but have alſo, greatly contributed to render the medical treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them leſs certain.</p>
               <p>IT was early in the ſpring diſcovered, that the buildings on the iſland, were very illy calculated for the accommodation of the ſick. The few alterations and improvements which were made during the ſeaſon, ſerved the purpoſe of immediate exigency only, and were by no means calculated to defend the ſick againſt the inclemencies of the weather, which neceſſarily
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035161_0060_1000B07EC3A39C30"/>
take place at this ſeaſon of the year—inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with which they are at this moment contending.</p>
               <p>ONE building only was intended for the reception of the ſick, which in the courſe of the ſeaſon, was found incapable of lodging the whole: and altho' another was fitted for the purpoſe, the want of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate apartments, made it neceſſary to mix together, perſons of all claſſes and deſcriptions, of different ſex, and laboring under different diſeaſes, and in all the various ſtages of their diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>NOTHING is more neceſſary in the treatment of the ſick, than that the orders of the Phyſician ſhould be faithfully performed, the better to enable him to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der practicable the execution of his object. Yet ſuch has been the ſtate of things, from the mixed and various employments of the nurſes, as to render it impoſſible in ſome inſtances, to carry into effect thoſe meaſures which ſuggeſted themſelves to me as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to promote the recovery of the ſick.</p>
               <p>As a counterbalance of the foregoing ſhort unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant narrative, I ſhall proceed to make a few remarks of a more ſatisfactory nature.</p>
               <p>THE liberal ſupply of linen, bedding, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which has been furniſhed for the uſe of this inſtitution, has enabled the attendants to keep the ſick in a ſtate of compleat cleanlineſs. The reſult has been, that notwithſtanding the many inſtances of Yellow-Fever, which have come under my care ſince my reſidence on this iſland, ſome of which poſſeſſing a degree of malignancy ſcarcely to be exceeded, there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which the diſeaſe has been communicated to nurſes, attendants or viſitors, nor to the boatmen who have conducted the ſick to the iſland.</p>
               <p>IF from the want of opportunity hitherto, I had not made up my mind on the real character of the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035161_0061_1000C30C4ED56CA0"/>
Yellow-Fever, I ſhould now have no more heſitation in attending the ſick laboring under this diſeaſe, than in other entrances of Fever, without fear of receiving infection, provided due cleanlineſs and ventilation were obſerved.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE correſpondence which I had the honor of holding with your Excellency, has been on a ſubject which yields to none on the ſcore of public utility.</p>
               <p>THE patient attention and ready aſſiſtance, which you have always beſtowed upon it, emboldens me to trouble you on the preſent occaſion, and inclines me to believe, that the vouchers which have been lately ſubmitted to your inſpection, have, as well as others, extremely intereſting to the citizens, received a ſhare of your attention. Feeling myſelf in a ſituation of great reſponſibility as it relates to the health of the city, it appears to me that I cannot be too particular in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails which fix the PUBLIC ATTENTION, by adducing facts calculated, at once, to detect error and eſtabliſh truth.</p>
               <p>THE firſt repreſentation that was made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Health Office, to the Common Council of this city on the ſubject of nuiſances, was in the latter part of March, 1797. It is to be obſerved, that theſe nuiſances were found too numerous to be all removed in one ſeaſon. The Common Council,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035161_0062_1000C30E30FE3C80"/>
therefore, iſſued their ordinances for the removal of thoſe only which were conceived to be of the greateſt magnitude. And while individuals were employed in fulfilling the orders of the Magiſtrates, the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners divided the city into diſtricts, to each of which a ſuperintendant, and a ſuitable number of ſcavengers were appointed, who engaged to ſee that their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſtricts were ſwept and properly cleanſed twice in each week. By means of theſe arrangements, the moſt ſalutary effects were produced, inſomuch that it has ſince been a common remark, that the city, during the laſt ſummer, has generally been free from thoſe diſagreeable effluvia, which before, eſpecially in particular ſituations, rendered the air almoſt unfit for reſpiration. To theſe regulations may fairly be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in a great degree the univerſal health of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants during the ſickly ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>THE firſt communication that was made to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners on the appearance of malignant fever in this city, was by letter from Dr. Anderſon, dated Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember the 6th. This letter was followed by others of a ſimilar nature from different gentlemen of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The meaſures which were in conſequence purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were ſuch as were judged beſt calculated for the recovery of the ſick, and the ſafety of their attendants.</p>
               <p>IF, on examination, the ſick were found accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated in ſuch a manner, as to allow of due clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and good air, they were ſuffered to remain with their friends;—on the contrary, if they were in croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confined habitations, where ventilation was impracticable, it was thought expedient to remove them from the city. Here it is worthy of remark, that the inſtances of malignant fever which occurred in different parts of the city, had their origin in the neighbourhood of a nuiſance, which had been report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Corporation early in the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>ON the 23d of September, a letter was addreſſed
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035161_0063_1000B0848FCD7C88"/>
to the Commiſſioners from Dr. Faugeres, repreſenting that the people in George ſtreet were ſickening. The Commiſſioners, in conſequence, were led to inquire what were the probable cauſes of diſeaſe in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. On examination it was found that the houſes in that part of the ſtreet where the fever prevailed, were compoſed of ſmall apartments, with cellars eight and ten feet under ground. In theſe were crouded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people of a deſcription truly unfortunate, whoſe circumſtances and manners expoſed them to all the diſeaſes incident to poverty and intemperance. To this unfailing ſource of the cauſe of malignant fever, was added the manufactory of a Skinner in the ſame ſtreet, the emptying of whoſe vats threw ſuch a quantity of noxious vapours into the atmoſphere, as proved a great annoyance to the whole neighbourhood. On the 20th of September there were eleven perſons ſick within ſixty yards of each other, in George ſtreet, five of whom died in twenty-four hours after I had made my firſt viſit, at the requeſt of the Commiſſioners.—The meaſures which were adopted in this inſtance, were to bury the dead without any unneceſſary delay—to cauſe the rooms of the ſick to be thoroughly cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ventilated and white-waſhed, and the attention of cleanſing and ventilating was alſo paid to the bedding and clothes of the deceaſed. Lime was alſo furniſhed for the uſe of the indigent in the neighbourhood, whoſe families had not ſuffered from diſeaſe. By theſe means your Excellency may be aſſured, that the reſult was gratifying to the fineſt feelings of humanity. In the courſe of a few days, the people of George ſtreet were delivered from a calamity which threatened ſoon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extenſive, and were reſtored to as healthy a ſtate as uſual.</p>
               <p>IN the courſe of the ſeaſon it happened that ſeveral perſons were ſeized with fever, who had but a ſhort time previous, arrived from Philadelphia. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Commiſſioners was on theſe occaſions ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to that which they obſerved with reſpect to our
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035161_0064_1000C3111B64E0E0"/>
own citizens. If they found the ſick ſo ſituated as to enjoy all the advantages of cleanlineſs and good air, they were left under the management of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive friends and Phyſicians: if otherwiſe, they were removed from the city. Hence, in all human proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it happened, that there was no inſtance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated infection. This was particularly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the caſes of Meſſrs. Suydam, Havens, Burch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ill and others, with whom the intercourſe of friends was never reſtrained; and though their diſeaſes were diſtinctly marked, and of the moſt violent type, yet they were not communicated.</p>
               <p>AFTER engaging your Excellency's attention to the occurrences which took place in the city, it will not, I hope, be deemed a treſpaſs on your time, to requeſt it for a moment to thoſe which occurred on Bedlow's Iſland.</p>
               <p>THE Commiſſioners having uſed every means with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their power, to guard the city againſt the ſpreading of malignant fever, turned their attention to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaretto, in order to aſcertain to what degree of hazard thoſe were expoſed, who were employed in removing the ſick from the city, and from the different veſſels, to the Iſland. To this end, the number of men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed (during the ſeaſon) was limited to 8. Theſe men, though often obliged neceſſarily to and lift carry the ſick, ſuffered not, in the ſmalleſt degree, from their occupation.</p>
               <p>IN the Hoſpital, there were eleven perſons employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as nurſes, attendants, &amp;c. among all theſe, there was not one inſtance <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Fever. Mr. Oſborne, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to the garriſon on Governor's Iſland, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to attend the ſick on Bedlow's iſland, for a certain period; and in a letter which he addreſſed to the Commiſſioners on his reſigning his employment there, (which is tranſmitted for your Excellency's peruſal) he gives a particular account of the ſtate of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035161_0065_1000C31440352190"/>
the Hoſpital, and expreſſes much ſatisfaction at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good effects which cleanlineſs and ventilation had afforded it.</p>
               <p>IF there needed any other confirmation than what has occurred through the ſeaſon, and happened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the knowledge of the Commiſſioners, it may be found in the following facts:</p>
               <p>MR. CASE, of Newburgh in this ſtate, and his comrade, were ſent to the Hoſpital from the ſhip Margaret, captain Bebee, both ſick of the Yellow-Fever. As ſoon as the ſituation of Mr. Caſe was made known to his friends, his mother and brother haſtened to ſee him. Mrs. Caſe and her ſon were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited in their intercourſe with their ſick relation; and Mrs. Caſe remained with him, and performed all the duties of an affectionate mother and tender nurſe, to the moment of his death, which happened on the ſixth day of his illneſs. His comrade recovered.—Mr. Caſe, before his death, was as yellow as an orange; but neither the mother nor brother experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the leaſt indiſpoſition in conſequence of their viſit to the Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>Two men were, from certain circumſtances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Hoſpital, with fractured legs—they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſame apartment with thoſe ill of Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Fever, and neither of them took the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>THESE facts are from my own knowledge; and impreſſed as I truly am with their importance, and particularly with the inferences which may be drawn from them, I cannot be too earneſt in my attempts to impreſs them upon your Excellency.</p>
               <p>IT is at all times an arduous undertaking to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer prejudices; and it is commonly an unthankful office to rectify abuſes which compel men to draw money from their pockets. The city of New-York,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035161_0066_1000C315E8799280"/>
which offers to its merchants the fineſt proſpects of wealth, and to all its inhabitants the more pleaſing one of health, if properly attended to, ſhould be put in a ſituation which would render it capable of real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing both. The expence of doing this, is unworthy of notice, compared to the end when attained;—nay, the very expence is but another means of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancing the value of property, as well as of ſecuring the comforts of life. The legiſlature then, in ninety ſeven, have been commendably employed in ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſyſtem, <hi>which if completed,</hi> muſt be attended with effects incalculably beneficial.</p>
               <p>PERMIT me to repeat, that as I have perſonally known all the facts previouſly ſtated, as well with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the city as Lazaretto, and as I have perſonally conducted the operations of the Health-Office, I can vouch for their truth, and conſider myſelf accountable for them.</p>
               <p>BEING extremely deſirous, as far as it is in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to render the eſtabliſhment of the Health-Office, a real good to the people, I moſt heartily join the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in entreating your Excellency to make ſuch a repreſentation to the Legiſlature, as you may judge proper on this important ſubject.</p>

               <p>THE Commiſſioners incloſe for the conſideration of the Common Council, a memorial from the inhabitants in the vicinity of the Common Sewer, at the lower end of Broad-ſtreet, complaining of it as a nuiſance ſcarcely to be borne in hot weather.</p>

               <p>A REPRESENTATION has been made to the Commiſſioners, that the preſent ſtate of the Jail yard is exceptionable—in conſequence of which, they, together with the Health Officer, viſited it this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are of opinion, that removing the rubbiſh daily, and keeping it as clean as poſſible hereafter, will not only conduce very greatly to the health and convenience of the family as well as the priſoners, but tend to prevent any bad effects upon the inhabitants in its vicinity, from an accumulation of offenſive objects in the approaching warm ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>THEY are alſo of opinion, that if the walls of the different apartments, were repeatedly white waſhed, it would purify the air of the priſon, and render it more wholeſome.</p>
               <p>THE Commiſſioners, therefore, beg leave to call your attention to this intereſting object; and truſt, that immediate meaſures will be taken to preclude the danger apprehended.</p>

               <p>IN the ſpring of laſt year, the Commiſſioners, in one of their reports to the Common Council, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the whole eaſt ſide of Front-ſtreet, from Coen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Old ſlip, was in an unfiniſhed and otherwiſe exceptionable ſtate; and that their interpoſition was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prevent the evils which, in hot weather, might reſult from it. Some difficulty aroſe at the time, which ſuſpended the reforms contemplated. A few ſolitary caſes of violent fever and death occurred in the vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that ground, in the courſe of laſt ſummer, which the Health-Officer and Commiſſioners have no doubt originated from the cauſes repreſented.</p>
               <p>THEY expreſſed the ſame apprehenſions in ſome of their ſubſequent reports to the Common Council; but fortunately nothing like a fever of a particular kind, has manifeſted itſelf in the whole city till within a few

days. Several inhabitants in the neighbourhood of theſe docks and open lots (which are yet receptacles of filth, dirt and carrion) have been attacked, all with ſimilar complaints, and, we have no doubt, from the cauſes before enumerated. The greater part, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are recovered or convaleſcent. The reſt of the city is healthy. The Common Council have now tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſuch meaſures as, we hope, will remedy the evils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from thoſe ſources, for the preſent.</p>

               <p>THE Commiſſioners, in diſcharge of their duty, inform the Common Council, that the great maſs of filth at the head of Cuyler's and Aſtor's lots, between Coenties and the Old ſlip, in Front ſtreet, is covered—that the operation is progreſſing—and that the ſickneſs in that neighbourhood, has nearly ſubſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>THEY are ſorry to inform the board, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which occurred at the New ſlip and in its vicinity, has not ſo fortunately terminated. Nine perſons are reported to have died there—five to be ſtill ſick—and nine or ten recovered, or removed into the country. Every thing which prudence ſuggeſted, or exertion could perform for the indigent, has been done in the courſe of the laſt week, and at as moderate an expence as poſſible to the public.</p>
               <p>THE uncommon large body of water on Liſpenard's meadow, north of his houſe, has ſubſided only about ten inches ſince the rains on Tueſday laſt, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary drain. It is the opinion of the Health Officer, that as ſoon as the ſurface of the meadow gets expoſed to the influence of the ſun, the exhalations ariſing from it, will generate diſeaſe in that neighbourhood. He therefore recommends a more ſudden draining of it. The Commiſſioners have no doubt but the board will take ſuch order on this ſubject, as the exigency may require.</p>
               <p>A NUMBER of the inhabitants have frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a wiſh, that carts might be employed to take up the garbage and other offals, which, by ſtanding in
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035161_0078_1000B096E4FAD7B8"/>
confined places, from one ſweeping day to another, become exceedingly offenſive. The Commiſſioners have reflected more ſeriouſly on this ſubject, ſince the great heats ſet in, and believe it would be adviſeable to remove them every Monday, Thurſday and Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. They find that ſome of the Scavengers will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this ſervice by the day. If the board approve of an experiment, the Commiſſioners will agree with five men for the days above-mentioned till the laſt of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, as cheap as poſſible. They do not expect to exceed 12s. per day for each.</p>

               <p>YOUR favor of the 26th inſt. has been received, and that incloſed, handed Mr. Honſon.</p>
               <p>HE aſſures us, that agreeably to your inſtructions, every caſk in Roſs's cellar, No. 63, John-ſtreet, was firſt bored, and that he found a number good, which
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035161_0085_1000C334DE2DF7A8"/>
remain in the cellar; but the ſpoiled he has taken on board a veſſel to examine, and when finiſhed, he will replace them in the cellar. This is going on as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditiouſly, and, we believe, as well as poſſible.</p>
               <p>WE have invariably attended to your intereſt in this buſineſs, and have no reaſon to think Mr. Honſon is influenced by any other motive. If, however, there is any other packer whom you prefer, we can have no objection to his being employed; as Mr. Honſon was propoſed merely becauſe he was in town, and had been in the conſtant practice of examining proviſions for different Merchants.</p>
               <p>WE are told that proviſions have been improperly condemned and deſtroyed by barely boring—it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is certainly moſt for your intereſt, and beſt, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it in the manner practiſed by Mr. Honſon.</p>
               <p>IN conſequence, however, of your orders, we have adviſed him to call on you, and explain all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. We have only to add, that the whole <hi>muſt</hi> be forth with examined, and the bad removed from town. We ſhould be extremely ſorry to be compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have it taken out and ſent you.</p>

houſe No. 61, John-ſtreet, containing proviſions.—We are told it has been opened for the purpoſe of air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, as the effects of it are ſaid to already have been ſerious, its remaining there longer is now dreaded. The Commiſſioners think it ſhould be examined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay. The bearer, Mr. JOHN A. HONSON, has lately been much engaged in ſuch buſineſs. He is at preſent, we believe, the only inſpector in town. We mention him to you, and think he will do ample juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The ſpoiled muſt be ſent out of town at all events.</p>

               <p>AS it is the requeſt of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of the Health Office, that I ſhould inform them of the ſtate of Bellevue Hoſpital during my reſidence there; as alſo, point out particularly the ſource from whence I ſuppoſed the fever with which I was ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently attacked, aroſe, I think it my duty to ſtate to them a few circumſtances, and explain the manner in which I conceive my diſeaſe to have originated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:035161_0088_1000C33A48B09048"/>
MY attendance commenced on the 12th of June laſt. From that period, to the 14th of November, there were admitted into the Hoſpital, 389 patients, of which number perhaps three fourths were ſick with peſtilential fevers. The nurſes employed during the ſame period, were 16 in number. The Health Office boatmen, who were in the habit of bringing the ſick to the Hoſpital, as well from the city as ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, were accuſtomed to enter the Hoſpital at all times, and aſſiſt in placing as well as removing the ſick from room to room. The number of Waſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women during the ſeaſon, was 7. Several perſons were alſo conſtantly employed in cooking, preſerving cleanlineſs, and burying the dead. There were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, tranſient people, near relations of the ſick, who were permitted by the Commiſſioners to viſit occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Several perſons accompanied their friends to Bellevue, ſtaid with them, and nurſed them during their illneſs. Under all theſe circumſtances, to my knowledge, there happened no inſtance of infection, altho' an opinion has been adopted by many, that my ſickneſs, whilſt reſiding at Bellevue Hoſpital, aroſe from infection, imbibed at that place.</p>
               <p>To what cauſe, then, is to be attributed the Fever with which I was ſeized at Bellevue on the 5th of October?</p>
               <p>HAVING occaſion to viſit my friends in New-York, three days previous to my illneſs, and having unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately ſlept in an highly infected part of the city, no doubt can exiſt with me, but it aroſe from that cauſe. In making this declaration, I muſt remark to you, that the ſituation of the medical attendants at Bellevue, was by no means a propitious one. Before the new buildings were erected for the acommodation of the ſick, the Phyſician's room, (the only one they had) was literally ſurrounded by them. The room adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,—the front and back piazas—the hall—the rooms and hall in the ſecond ſtory—a room in the cellar
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035161_0089_1000C33C1A7C9BF0"/>
that had been uſed for a kitchen, all contained ſick,—THEY were, likewiſe, placed in ſeveral Chineſe ſummer houſes, in the ſmall ſpace between the main-houſe and the eaſt river; and in the building erected for the purpoſe of a bathing-houſe. A large canvaſs was alſo erected (for want of a more convenient place) under the windows of the ſouth-weſt part of the houſe, for the reception of the dying and the dead. I add, Sir, that under all the diſadvantages enumerated, I know of no inſtance where infection reſulted.</p>
               <p>PERMIT me to conclude, by expreſſing the thanks due to the polite and humane attention of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to myſelf, and to the ſick in general; and I feel a pride in acknowledging, that to them—the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and perſevering exertions of my preceptor, Dr. RICHARD BAYLEY, and the interpoſition of a kind Providence, I am indebted for my <hi>life.</hi>

               <p>IN addition to the facts which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the correſpondence between the Health Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners and the Common Council for the year 1798, I ſhall offer to your conſideration a few remarks upon the origin and progreſs of the peſtilential diſeaſe which has lately prevailed in this city; and in order to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035161_0090_1000B0A7F7FDA610"/>
what I may advance, I ſhall, in the firſt place take a retroſpect of events which have annually taken place in this city during the warm months ſince the year 1795.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to the records of the Health Office, the Yellow Fever appeared in 1796 at White-hall, at the foot of Pine-ſtreet, at Burling-ſlip, and in the neighbourhood of Roſevelt-ſtreet, ſewer.</p>
               <p>IN 1797 between Coenties and the Old-ſlip, in Front-ſtreet, at the Fly-market in ſeveral inſtances, in Flet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-ſtreet, at Burling-ſlip, in Water-ſtret, adjoining Rooſevelt-ſtreet, ſewer, in George-ſtreet, and at the foot of Pine-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>IN 1798 the diſeaſe firſt appeared about midway be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Coenties and the Old-ſlip, in Front-ſtreet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 1ſt and 7th of Auguſt. On the 7th Auguſt about twenty-three were reported ſick to the Health-Office. From that period ſeveral others ſickened, and of the whole number one died. By the 26th of Auguſt, the complaint had diſappeared in that quarter in conſequence of the meaſures taken to remove the cauſe, by covering the offenſive lots with clean, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome earth.</p>
               <p>ON the 12th of Auguſt, it appeared at No. 283, Water-ſtreet, in the caſe of Mr. Taylor, in an old broken building, on an unfiniſhed lot at the foot of Dover-ſtreet, in which 11 perſons died early in 1795, and which has ſince been repeatedly repreſented as a nuiſance.</p>
               <p>AUGUST 12, alſo, the diſeaſe appeared in the caſe of John Henderſon, corner of James-ſtreet and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia lane. On all ſides of his reſidence, which was a ſmall crouded building, there were ſunken lots in an unfiniſhed ſtate.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, on Auguſt 12, the diſeaſe appeared in
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035161_0091_1000C33E9ECCB848"/>
William Whitlock, Cardmaker, No. 51, Cherry-ſtreet. In the rear and to the ſouth of his reſidence, the lots are very generally below the level of the ſtreets, and without drains.</p>
               <p>Auguſt 13. Murdock M'Lean, Bruce's wharf, was ſeized, where the diſeaſe has regularly made its appearance every warm ſeaſon ſince the year 1795.</p>
               <p>THE firſt arrival of ſick in this harbour (to the knowledge of the Health-Office) from Philadelphia, was on the 13th of Auguſt, in the New-York and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia Packet. The Captain died on the paſſage—the Mate was ſick and was ſent to Bellevue.</p>

ON the morning of the 14th, the heavieſt rain fell of any time during the year. It began at 5 A. M. and continued without intermiſſion till nine. Numerous cellars, particularly thoſe in the low parts of the city, were filled with water. Liſpenard's meadow, which may be conſidered as within the limits of the city, was entirely overflowed. In ſix days it had not ſubſided above ten inches; and the water did not paſs off, till a large drain was opened for that purpoſe, by order of the Common Council.</p>

               <p>THE ſudden and great increaſe of heat immediately after the violent rain, appeared to have a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate influence in producing fever. Between that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod and the 22d Auguſt, upwards of twenty perſons in Cliff-ſtreet, were ſeized with ſlight indiſpoſitions, which they attributed to ſleeping with open windows during the preceding hot and moiſt weather, but which appeared rather as the forerunner of yellow fever, for, not only the perſons thus indiſpoſed, but a number of others <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ſame ſtreet, had that diſeaſe in the courſe of a few days.</p>
               <p>FROM this period the diſeaſe became more general; but its fatality was principally felt in Cliff-ſtreet and its neighbourhood, at Catharine ſlip, in Water-ſtreet, and on the unfiniſhed grounds in the ſouthern part of the city.</p>
               <p>NOW, having ſeen that the yellow fever has made its appearance in New-York every year, for ſeveral years paſt, but has prevailed in very different degrees, it becomes a matter of great importance to determine,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035161_0093_1000C34140EE3478"/>
why the diſeaſe was ſo generally prevalent on the low new-made grounds in this city in 1795, whilſt it was ſcarcely felt in the more elevated ſituations; why, in 1796 and 1797, its appearance was limited to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpots; and why, in 1798 it not only prevailed on all the new-made grounds, but alſo in parts of the city which had before been exempted from the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>To anſwer theſe queſtions in ſuch manner, as to prove ſatisfactory to every one, might be a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult taſk. I ſhall, however, offer ſome reaſons which may tend to ſhew why the fever was more prevalent this year, than in the preceding years.</p>
               <p>IT is well aſcertained that in the year 1795, there was an unuſual degree of heat and moiſture in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere during the warmer months—that the Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer was conſiderably higher than in 1796 and 1797, but that in 1798, the heat greatly exceeded that of 1795.</p>
               <p>Now, as heat and moiſture are powerful agents in <hi>producing</hi> peſtilential diſeaſes, ſo muſt the ſame cauſes neceſſarily promote the <hi>extenſion</hi> of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p>IN the year '98, there were beſides, local cauſes of fever in this city, which did not exiſt in the other ſeaſons, and which, co-operating with the weather, ſerved to extend the diſeaſe beyond the limits, to which it would probably have been otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. I have reference to the immenſe quantities of ſpoiled beef, fiſh, and other articles of a periſhable nature which were ſtored in different parts of this city. The noxious exhalations ariſing from theſe ſources, in my apprehenſion was a great cauſe why, the diſeaſe aroſe and raged with great violence in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſituations: And when we conſider the ſudden appearance of the fever on Golden-Hill and in Cliff-ſtreet, and the great number which ſickened

nearly at the ſame time, there is great reaſon to believe this opinion well founded.</p>
               <p>ABOUT the 20th of Auguſt, a report was made to the Health Office, that great quantities of ſpoiled beef were ſtored in Pearl-ſteet, between Burling and Beekman-ſlips. The ſtench which iſſued from ſome of the cellars in this ſituation, was ſo conſiderable, as to prove very offenſive to thoſe who paſſed by, and became a ſubject of general obſervation. Letters, in conſequence, from the Health Office, were addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the owners of proviſions in that quarter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining them to have the beef examined, and to have ſuch as was ſpoiled, ſent out of the city. Inſtead, however, of adopting this plan, the beef was brought from the cellars into the ſtreet, the barrels opened, and the putrid pickle thrown into the gutters. In ſome inſtances the examination was made in the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and the pickle diſpoſed of in the ſame manner. The gutters which conveyed away this putrid pickle, led to Burling-ſlip ſewer.</p>
               <p>THE relative ſituation of this ſewer, and Cliff-ſtreet is ſuch that the ſoutherly and ſouth-eaſterly winds, force a current of air through the ſewer, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with it the exhalations ariſing from the noxious matters collected together in that place, and having a direction to paſs more immediately up Golden-Hill, and into Cliff-ſtreet; and every perſon in that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood with whom I have converſed, agrees as to the offenſive ſmell of the air, previous to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the fever.</p>
               <p>ON the 20th of Auguſt, the wind, which had been blowing from the north and weſt ſome days previous, ſhifted to the ſouth-eaſt, and continued to blow from that quarter ſome time. In 48 hours after this, there was ſcarcely a houſe in Pearl-ſtreet, near where the ſpoiled proviſions were ſtored, in the lower end of
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035161_0095_1000C345C30EBAE8"/>
John-ſtreet, and in Cliff-ſtreet, which did not contain ſick.</p>
               <p>THE ſudden appearance of fever in this part of the city, and the great number which were affected in ſo ſhort a time, proves the local nature of the cauſe; and to the one which I have juſt mentioned, I have no heſitation, in aſcribing all the effects which were experienced.</p>
               <p>IF what we have alledged, be admitted ſufficient to explain the appearance of Fever which took place in Cliff-ſtreet, &amp;c. we have made ſome advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards accounting for the general prevalence of the diſeaſe in 1798.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide the H. Office correſpondence on the ſubject of ſpoiled proviſions.</note>
               </p>
               <p>BUT, Gentlemen, we have further to remark, a particular difference in the warm ſeaſons, of 1798 and 1795.</p>
               <p>IN 1795 the weather was warm and moiſt, but there was but very little rain.</p>
               <p>IN 1798, the weather was not only much warmer, but was accompanied with ſudden and heavy rains.</p>
               <p>IMMEDIATELY after the rains, the Public papers teemed with addreſſes to the citizens, entreating them to empty their cellars of the water which had collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, or the moſt fatal effects would be felt from neglect, or inattention to this circumſtance.—It is not my intention to diſpute the opinion advanced by theſe writers. But, if the production of diſeaſe, was to be apprehended from the lodgment of water in places where the ſun's rays never enter, what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects were to be expected from the ponding of water in thoſe numerous lots and yards within this city,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035161_0096_1000B0B230C3DF18"/>
which are ſeveral feet below the level of the ſtreets, containing dead animal and vegetable matters, and to which the rays of the ſun have full acceſs? I wiſh, you, Gentlemen, to reflect ſeriouſly upon this compariſon, and believe, that whilſt thoſe ſunken, undrained lots are ſuffered to remain in their preſent ſtate, unleſs cauſes ceaſe to produce their effects, diſeaſes muſt inevitably reſult.</p>
               <p>ON examining the records of the Legiſlature of this ſtate, it will be found, that petitions have been preferr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that body, for permiſſion to erect mill-dams on certain ſtreams of water in ſome of the northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the prayer of the petitioners has been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The conſequence was, that conſiderable tracts of low grounds in the neighbourhood of the mill-dams, were overflowed in the ſpring, and after the water had paſſed off, and the ſurface of thoſe grounds were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the influence of the ſun, exhalations of ſo baneful a nature aroſe, as to produce a fever of the bilious type, which attacked almoſt every body within a certain diſtance from their ſource, and proved very mortal in its effects. The cauſe of this ſickneſs being ſo obvious, petitions were preſented to the Legiſlature, praying for a redreſs of the grievances. To correct the evil, it of courſe was neceſſary to deſtroy the mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, and as ſoon as the waters were unobſtructed and allowed to flow in their uſual channel, the conutry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as healthy as before.</p>
               <p>PERMIT me, Gentlemen, to aſk the following queſtions:—If the reſult of exhalations ariſing from grounds which have been covered with water in an open country, has been the production of bilious remitting fevers, attended with conſiderable mortality, what reſult ought we to expect from thoſe exhalations which ariſe from the ponding of water on 150 acres of low grounds and ſunken yards and lots in a crouded city, and of a ſouthern aſpect?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:035161_0097_1000C34851221FA8"/>
BEFORE I conclude, I ſhall take the liberty of noticing ſome of the public meaſures that have been adopted for the removal of cauſes of diſeaſe in this city. I ſhall confine myſelf to two principal objects:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> THE want of a ſufficient deſcent on the low grounds along the eaſt river, to carry off the waters from the ſtreets, is generally admitted. A conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of water muſt neceſſarily ſtagnate in the gutters of theſe ſtreets, and alſo in the ſunken pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In dry weather, this lodgement conſiſts princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of water which has been uſed for culinary and other family purpoſes, and muſt therefore, be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to abound with matters to afford noxious exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>BY an ordinance of the Corporation for cleaning the ſtreets, the inhabitants are directed to ſcrape out the dirt and filth collected in the gutters and heap them up in the ſtreets, to be removed by the ſcavengers <hi>in the courſe of the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, does this regulation in any degree ſubſerve the purpoſes for which it was ordained? Does not the ſpreading of this dirt and filth, and expoſing new and greater ſurfaces, increaſe the miſchief which the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was intended to correct? I believe, gentlemen, there will be found no other means to rid the low grounds of this city, from the baneful effects of ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant waters, and an accumulation of noxious matters, than their being freely waſhed by currents of water flowing over them.</p>
               <p>2d. IN the ſame ordinance, the citizens are prohibited from throwing into the ſtreets, from their reſpective houſes, cellars, or yards any dirt, filth, or offals whatever, except on certain days. How will this be found, to operate in <hi>removing</hi> the cauſes of diſeaſe? Should we not rather aſk, how this will be found to operate in <hi>increaſing</hi> the cauſes of diſeaſe? One mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035161_0098_1000C34B113C6A20"/>
reflection, I preſume, will convince us that ſome means ought to be adopted to remedy a ſyſtem ſo fraught with miſchief, and for theſe means I take the liberty of referring you to letter 70, addreſſed by the Commiſſioners of the Health-Office to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council.</p>
