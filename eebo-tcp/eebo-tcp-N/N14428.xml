            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Narrative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE ſavages who occaſioned the following ſcenes, were ſent from the Britiſh garriſon at Niagara, ſome time in the fore part of March, A. D. 1780, through a deep ſnow, on a wretched ſkulking indian expedition, againſt a few ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people which they hoped to find about Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehannah; eſpecially thoſe who were making ſugar in the woods at that time of the year.</p>
            <p>The number of indians which ſkulked about Weſtmorland at this time, was ſixteen: whether they all come from Niagara in company and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the vicinity, or were ſeparate parties from Niagara, I could never learn: but they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared about Weſtmorland in two parties of ſix and ten indians in different parts of the country; the party of ten appeared the next day after the party of ſix.</p>
            <p>I will give a narrative of each in their turns.</p>
            <p>The party of ten indians, after lurking about the ſettlement for ſome time, firſt made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance on Tueſday the 28th of March, at break of day, five miles below Plymouth ſettlement, where ſundry people were ſcattered about making maple ſugar, which is known to be a profitable branch of buſineſs here as in many parts of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: the manufacturers frequently build a litle
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018273_0005_0FA5C977B25550A0"/>
hut near a maple grove, and continue boiling all night. In one of theſe huts was Mr. Upſon and Jonah Rogers, a lad thirteen years of age, they watched with the ſugar boiling-by turns; and at daybreaking Upſon having finiſhed his watch, was reclined on the floor a-ſleep, and John was up, and at this time amuſing himſelf in ſome trifles; when to his ſurprize, a ſavage ſuddenly entered the hut, and immediately fired his piece through the bowels of Upſon, and with his toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk ſplit out his brains; a ſecond of theſe frightful ſemi-painted daemons immediately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeized Jonah by the arm, when the whole gang preſently ruſhed into the hut, with their ſhocking painted viſages and ſavage ſhoutings, upon the devoted John, to whoſe affrighted mind they preſented the utmoſt horrors of inſtant death, heightned by a glaring repreſentation of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pit: they gave him to underſtand by their jargon dialect, which he partly underſtood, that he muſt go with them; which in his preſent view was the more wretched alternative of inſtant death. He had no way to vent his horror but by immoderate crying, which the ſavages ſuppreſs'd by menaces of death; he then fell to ſupplicating them with all his might, for liberty to go home; but theſe intreaties alſo the ſavages ſuppreſs'd by the ſame threats as before: thus the lad, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far enough in life to anticipate the horrors of ſavage cruelty and captivity, yet too young to ſhare the full fortitude of manhood, not ſuffered to vent his horror by crying, or daring to beg for
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018273_0006_0FA5C97874554B08"/>
relief from his inexorable maſters, and not a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal with whom to confer or condole, he was fix'd in a plethory of grief and diſpair, while the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges perfomed their deteſtable cuſtom, by taking off the ſcalp of Mr. Upſon.</p>
            <p>The ſavages next proceeded down the river, to a place called Fiſhing-Creek; where on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day they ſurpriſed and took Meſſi. Peter Pence, Moſes Van Campen and a lad named Moſes Van Campen, nephew to the former. They continued lurking about until Friday, when they diſcovered ſome ſugar works where the kettles were boiling; they concluded that the people had hid themſelves near by, whom they catch'd by the following ſtratagem: they obliged the priſoners to halloo, and call them out as if they were friends; this had the effect propoſed, and brought out a Mr. Pike, with his wife and child; the man they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as a priſoner, but the woman and child they ſpared, for the ſake of gratifying a humour of painting them in the indian manner, which they performed, and then ſent them home.</p>
            <p>I may here obſerve, that I don't remember to have heard an inſtance of theſe ſavages offering to violate the chaſtity of any of the fair ſex who have fallen into their hands; this is principally owing to a natural inappetancy in their conſtitutions; which circumſtance, were it otherwiſe, and were they equally nefarious in this, as in their other violations of the laws of nature and humanity, it would render their depredations, if poſſible, much more demoniack than they are. This is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018273_0007_0FA5C97926B8C3F8"/>
among numberleſs, which an obſerving mind may perceive, where the wiſe Creator of all, in his aſſignments of paſſions powers and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, has ballanced and ſorted thoſe matters in a manner worthy of himſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſavages being now in poſſeſſion of five priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, viz. Meſſrs. Pence, Van Campen, Pike, young Van Campen, ſeventeen years of age, and Jonah Rogers, thirteen years old, together with a number of blankets, and a quantity of ſugar and indian meal which they had plundered in the ſugar-huts, which was all the proviſion they had, they, without delay, ſhaped their courſe for Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara. They uſually marched about 15 miles in a day. The lad Jonah, after being joined by the other priſoners, recovered his ſpirits, and being ſomewhat humorous, rendered himſelf a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite of the ſavages. The priſoners were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably ſcanted in their allowance of proviſions, but Jonah grew bold and familiar, and had the addreſs to get as much as he pleaſed of any thing that the ſavages had; ſome of which he uſually imparted ſecretly to his fellow priſoners, who were half ſtarved, and obliged to ſtagger along with all the baggage of the whole party, which was very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; and what rendered their duty doubly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome the ſnow was up to their knees every ſtep they trod, and all the chance any of them had for their lives, was from continuing this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable rout, 300 miles, to Niagara, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny relief or refreſhment, excepting the hope of the ſavages taking venſion, or other game by the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018273_0008_0FA5C97AA836C108"/>
way; and to render their condition completely deſperate, the indians, whoſe ſavage tempers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſufficiently gorged, ſimply by the blood of their victims, but are greatly delighted in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reminding them of their approaching tortures, impoliticly informed the priſoners that they were to be kept alive for the purpoſe of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the baggage, until they had marched well toward Niagara, and then they ſhould feel the tamahawk, and their ſcalps, not themſelves, be carried into Niagara; which ſentence, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, would be put into execution, at leaſt on ſome of them, eſpecially on Mr. Pike, of whom they were apprehenſive, on account of his having been a continental ſoldier.</p>
            <p>In theſe deſperate circumſtances, it is eaſy to conceive, that people would be led to meditate, if poſſible, ſome way of eſcape; to ſave themſelves by flight, was impracticable, as the ſavages were fleeter than themſelves, and would purſue with fire arms, with fatal effect on the fugitives; the only chance was to riſe by night, diſarm and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the ſavages: but if we conſider that the priſoners had their hands carefully ſecured behind them both night and day, and carefully deprived of any utenſil that might be uſed to ſeperate their ligatures; and that the enemy were active and watchful, and more than double in number to thoſe who were able to aſſiſt in ſuch an enterprize; and that the crueleſt death that ſavages could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, would be practiſed on them, in caſe their plot ſhould be diſcovered, or miſcarry; I ſay, if we
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018273_0009_0FA5C97AD45667D8"/>
conſider theſe things, we may form ſome idea of the bravery, or rather deſperation which inſpired ſuch an attempt. Some one of them firſt project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enterprize, and when they had opportunity of conference on the march, the propoſal was made to the reſt, who all concurred on the firſt motion, without the leaſt reluctance or heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in any one of them; and on the next Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day after they began their march, they reſolved to put the plan into execution the enſuing night. They faithfully promiſe each other by all the ties of honor and common calamity, to ſtand by each other, and abide the combat, if fate ſo required, even to the ſpending their laſt drops of blood. Their plan expreſsly agreed on, was as follows: each one was to watch his opportunity, if poſſible, to poſſeſs himſelf of ſome inſtrument, wherewith to ſeparate the cords which tied his hands behind him, and if any one ſhould be ſo fortunate as to ſecure an inſtrument, he was at night, when the indians were well aſleep, to cut himſelf looſe; and then liberate the others himſelf, or reach the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his neareſt fellow, as he ſhould judge ſafeſt, and to be handed if poſſible, until all were looſe; this done, each one was, with the utmoſt addreſs, dexterity and ſtilneſs, to ſecure ſuch arms and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, as were moſt contiguous, to him, and nimbly repair therewith to a certain ſpot of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, about two rods diſtant from where they couched by the ſide of a fire; when, if leiſure would permit, they were farther to conſult on the particular mode of attack, and to aſſign to each
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018273_0010_0FA5C97B6E5B14A8"/>
man his duty, or in whatever ſtage of the plot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were looſe, the ſavagegs might take the alarm, each man was to catch ſome weapon, and without giving the ſavages a moment's time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from their conſternation, were to attack them with all fury, and at once put the matter to a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal iſſue. But when night came on, no one had been able to ſecure any kind of tool, wherewith to cut himſelf looſe; they however, when the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages were aſleep, ſtruggled and ſtrove to get their hands at liberty; but all in vain. The night paſſed without effecting any thing, and happily, without exciting the leaſt ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>On Saturday it was agreed at all events to bring matters to a criſis the enſuing night; they all as one declared they would march no farther toward Niagara. By Saturday night they had marched 75 miles; their lodging was as follows: after erecting a fire, they ſpread down their blankets, of which they now had ſuch a plenty as to afford them a comfortable bed and covering. One circumſtance worthy of notice in this place is, that the ſavages were ſo infeſted with lice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they could not ſleep quietly with their claoths on, and this being a cold night, they ſtript off even their ſhirts, and expoſed them on ſome buſhes to freeze, in order to thin the lice; whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that when they turned out in the alarm at midnight, they were ſtark naked. Pike had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the indian whom he was taught to call his maſter, when he went to ſleep, laid his knife under his body, which he poſſeſſed himſelf of by
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018273_0011_0FA5C97C56628B88"/>
the following art: pretending a great fondneſs for his ſaid maſter, he begged the favour of ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at night by his ſide, and had the dexterity when the indians were aſleep, to extract the knife unperceived, wherewith he cut himſelf looſe. Mr. Pence likewiſe being allowed a knife at ſupper time, inſtead of returning it, droped and covered it in a certain place by the couch; and when the indians demanded his knife, he pretended that it had been ſurrendered up, and ſo it paſſed over; and when the ſavages were aſleep, he reſumed his knife, and cut himſelf looſe; and by means of theſe two knives, all the priſoners were ſoon at liberty, excepting Jonah, whom it was thought beſt not to awake; every one, as ſoon as poſſible, got hold of ſome kind of weapon, expecting every moment the ſavages would be upon their legs, give the yell of war, and commence a violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, with the inequality of ten to four; but ſtill they ſlept. One grand object was ſecureing the fire arms; thoſe were all ſet againſt a tree at the head of the couch, and were preſently removed to a place appointed, about two rods diſtant, by the ſide of a tree. Some ammunition they likewiſe ſecured; with which they even had leiſure to prime their pieces, which the indians, previous to their lying down, had cautiouſly unprimed. Thus in the ſpace of a few lucky moments, theſe four men, with the moſt cautious dexerity, deprived ten ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, not only of their fire arms, but nearly of all their tomakawks, removed them to the ſpot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and after a haſty, but very wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

conſultation, it was reſolved that two men ſhould ſtand by the guns, and fire upon the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as they roſe up, and during the conflict; the other two men took each a tomahawk, and with undaunted bravery, advanced to the couch where the ten indians lay, in order to commence the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, one on each ſide of the couch; they uncov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the indians heads, and with an unerring blow, each ſtruck his tomahawk into the brains of an indian, killing both in an inſtant; the other eight indians ſprang up the ſame moment, and at once perceived that their arms were not only taken from them, but fatally turned againſt themſelves, and moved by that cowardly qualm which naturally riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in boſoms that delight in cruelty, they ſcamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered off as quick as they aroſe, without giving the two men time to give a ſecond blow. The two men who ſtood by the guns, ſaluted the indians as they aroſe, and purſued them as they fled with the ſame ſalutation, as far as their naked precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would permit; they ſorely wounded ſome, which appeared from a profuſion of blood which they ſprinkled on the ſnow as they fled: the ſnow at this time had a hard cruſt, yet not ſo ſtrong but what they broke through almoſt every ſtep; this had a ſad opperation on their naked ſhins, which their preſent trouble and haſte would not permit them to take any care of: ſome ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for their legs in this race would have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them no ſmall comfort, as they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to abandon them to the cruſt, which mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them moſt pitifully, which appeared the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018273_0013_0FA5C98008A95C88"/>
next morning by the numberleſs fragments of fleſh and ſkin, which they left by their tracks, many of which were as big as dollars. Jonah being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep with the indians, ſtarted in ſurpriſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and run off with them a few rods, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting the plan to which he had been privy, he leaped back to the company; Pike humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly gave him a cuff on the ear, ſaying, what you raſcal, was you going to run off with the indians? They were now all enraptured with their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and victory, which was every way compleat, equal, or even ſuperior to the utmoſt ſtretch of their fancy and fond wiſhes. Their joy was mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with aſtoniſhment at ſo rare and ſurpriſing an event; which ſo dazzled their imaginations, that they could ſcarcely believe and realize facts, ſupported by the inſtant teſtimony of all their ſenſes. How great and ſudden was their change of circumſtances! From the ſevereſt ſufferings, and the moſt ill-boding apprehenſions of extreme woe, under ſavage captivity, by a bold and manly execution of a wiſe concerted plan, they, in the ſpace of a few minutes, vanquiſhed the whole party of ſavages, ſo ſuperior in number, that they deemed it needleſs to keep a guard; poſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their effects, and completely regained their liberty.</p>
            <p>It was practiced in antient times, even by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then writers, in caſes of ſign<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> deliverance to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the efficiency thereof to the power of Deity; and it would be unpardonable in an American, at a day of ſuch ſtriking manifeſtations of divine

patronage, not to aſcribe to the auſpicious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Deity, not only the more general and important ſpeciments of aid, but every ſubordinate inſtance, and in ſpecial the preſent. Who can conceive, that men without ſpecial aſſiſtance, could ariſe in the night, in ſuch an attempt againſt ſuch ſuperior number of indians, who are alert and vigilent, and ever jealous in the extreme, cut themſelves looſe, ſecure the arms, and perform all the neceſſary tranſactions, moving about on the ſnow, crumping around their ears, without arouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe infernal dogs; and then, that they ſhould inſtantly vanquiſh them, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, when they could but know, that naked and deſtitute, they muſt inevitably and miſerably freeze and ſtarve, ſhort of reaching any relief, which proved in fact to be their awful fate, their guilty conſciences ſufficiently remonſtrating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt turning about and ſubmitting to the mercy of their victors. They probably ſet their faces toward Niagara, 230 miles diſtant, without arms, or a ſcrap of cloathing or food, and have never been heard of ſince, which occaſioned great mournings at Niagara, as ſome priſoners inform. It is probable that the operation of famine and froſt, landed thoſe wretches, one after another, on a bed of ſnow, where they left the world, literally as naked as they came into it. Their horrid fate, had it fallen to the ſhare even of wild beaſts, ought to have moved compaſſion in every human breaſt; but when we conſider how richly thoſe monſters merited their fate by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked,

needleſs and voluntary hoſtilities, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with the moſt wanton ſtretches of inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and guilt, it moderates the pang of ſympathy, and conſtrains the minds of the compaſſionate, in ſome meaſure, to acquieſce in the providential ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of thoſe puniſhments, which human nature could not bare to inflict on the moſt accummulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilt.</p>
            <p>Our people ſpent the remaining part of the night very agreeably by the fire ſide, without any fear of the vanquiſhed ſavages. The booty which the indians left, was more than they could bring home, which determined them to make a raft of timber on the Suſquehannah, in order to tranſport themſelves, with their effects down the river; but this unluckily run aground, by which means they loſt all their proviſions and booty, excepting their fire arms, with which they made the beſt of their way home, having 75 miles to meaſure back, without any proviſions but what they could catch by the way. They travelled until Monday, when they killed a raccoon, and on Tueſday found the carcaſs of a deer, lately killed; with which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments they reached the ſettlements on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. At their unexpected return, with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their brilliant exploits, as we may well judge, they were heartily congratulated.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much of the ten ſavages, I proceed to a tale of the ſix. Theſe made their appearance on Monday the 27th of March, near a place called Kingſton, within the limits of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland, where they ſoon kidnapped Thomas
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018273_0016_0FA5C9830FD28980"/>
Bennet, with his ſon, twelve years old, and a Mr. Hammond, and without delay, ſet out for Niaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. The treatment they received from the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was rough and menacing, eſpecially Bennet, with whom they had long been acquainted, and at whoſe houſe they had been entertained: Such is the perfidious nature of theſe wretches, like the immortal Arnold, and his brethren, that hoſtilities, and inhumanity exerciſed on an old acquaintance, eſpecially a friendly one, but ſerves more highly to ſeaſon their taſte for inhumanity and ſavage tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. In ſhort, as to ſituation and proſpects, theſe people were ſimilar to thoſe who were priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to the other party of indians, which I need not repeat; they were reduced to the ſame deſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate alternative, which naturally in theſe brave men, produced a ſimilar reſolution. On Tueſday they agreed to attack the ſix indians the enſuing night, with the inequality of two to ſix, they placing no dependence on the boy. They were to endeavour, in couching at night, to place themſelves as favourable as they could, and to take the beſt obſervation, as to where the indians placed their weapons, when they went to ſleep, and by all means, each was to poſſeſs himſelf of a tomahawk, and watching each the others motion, Bennet was to give the ſignal, when both were to riſe in an inſtant, and addreſs themſelves to the indians with their tomahawks, in the true ſavage taſte. They had the addreſs to prepare, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves as was propoſed, and juſt as they were about to fix their choice on a fatal moment,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018273_0017_0FA5C983C1A68BE0"/>
to ariſe in the deſperate attempt, it ſo happened that one of the indians began to ſtir, and lift up his head, and preſently raiſed up his body, and ſat by the fire ſide, putting the fuel in order: Bennet determined ſtill to purſue the plan, and not let it die thus in embryo, began to ſtretch himſelf as if juſt awake from ſleep, and entered into ſome ſmall converſation with the indian, in order to amuſe him; be preſently aroſe, and ſtood on his feet, turning himſelf by the fire, and watching a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able moment to put into execution the daring plan, which greatly ſwelled and heaved in their anxious boſoms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hammond lay as if aſleep, though ready, and waiting the ſignal to ſpring and ſecond the blow of his fellow. Bennet began leiſurely to renew his requeſt for liberty to return home, promiſing, that if he might go home, he would ſupply them in a friendly manner with proviſions, whenever they ſhould apply; at this the indian turned up his face, pointing upwards with his finger; and in token of contempt, cries out with an indian accent, pee; at this inſtant, Bennit took his tomahawk, and with a violent blow buried it in the brains of the indian; Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ſprang at the ſame time, and with a lucky blow killed another; the other four indians im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aroſe, and turned to run, when Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, by a ſecond blow, wounded a third deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between his ſhoulders; Bennit's weapon was ſo faſtened in the indian's ſkull, that he could not extract it for a ſecond blow, but catched up a long indian ſpear which was at hand, and before
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018273_0018_0FA5C984774575B8"/>
they were out of reach, he puſhed it quite thro' the trunk of a fourth indian's body, who ran off with the ſame in his body, as did likewiſe he that received a wound from Hammond, with the two ſound indians, never preſuming to contend; though had they dared to face the aſſailants, and put the matter to the iſſue of bodily ſtrength, they might have had more than an equal chance; but properties of ſuch oppoſite natures as bravery and cruelty, cannot exiſt in the ſame breaſt. Our people from being priſoners to ſavages, ſuddenly became priſoners of rapture and amazement, at ſuch an extraordinary deliverance, and victory. They ſecured the arms, and without delay return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home to their applauding friends. It appears by ſome after diſcoveries, that the indians ſkulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about in the dark, until they perceived that our people had left the ground, when they came to the place, and picked up ſome proviſions and cloathing, hid their dead between ſome logs, in which point the indians are very aſſiduous, and marched for Niagara. The two ſavages who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped unhurt at this time, were all that reached Niagara, out of ſixteen, to report the ſorrowful fate to their ſhameleſs employers.</p>
            <p>To this narrative it may not be wholly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenent to ſubjoin a few hints concerning the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, government, cuſtoms and manners of the aborigines of this country.</p>
            <p>As to religion, theſe aborigines, though they are perhaps the moſt rude and illiterate of all the human race, yet the principle of natural religion
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018273_0019_0FA5C9852C25ECF8"/>
are not wholly extinguiſhed in them; and indeed, though ſome authors have amuſed the world with tales of whole nations of atheiſts, more abſurd to a man of thought, than the idea of nations of ideots and pigmies; yet I appeal to the common ſenſe of mankind, whether the grand leading ideas of an all-wiſe, all-ruling Being, the deathleſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mind, and a futute reckoning would not naturally ariſe in the mind of every thinking man, with an irreſiſtable concluſion, though he were diveſted of all the partialities of education. Theſe animals, though they trample on the rights of humanity, and the dictate of nature, yet ſeem to have ſome confuſed ideas of theſe leading points, as I have been informed. They addreſs the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being under the title of the Great Man, and frequently pronounce mandates, preſages and oracles, which they pretend to receive from him, on many occaſions, and more eſpecially at their powows, a kind of beaſtly maſquerade or frolic. There is a notion prevails among them, that when one is ſlain in battle, if the enemy get his body, he will fare worſe for it after his deceaſe, and for this reaſon they will hazard their lives more to bring off the bodies of the ſlain, than in almoſt any other attempt. A notable inſtance of this kind, we had a few years paſt, in an action at Weſtmorland: It is aſſerted, by all converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the indians, that at their funerals they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice burying bottles of rum, tomahawks, and ſuch things as the deſeaſed were moſt fond of, with them in their graves. Such rude cuſtoms,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018273_0020_0FA5C985F5B13D40"/>
conſonant to the ignorance of ſavages, diſcovers an aſſent to thoſe natural principles of religion. Thoſe who believe there is a God, and after a natural death, that they ſhall ſurvive in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and dominion, cannot ſuppreſs the idea of retribution. It is ſaid that among theſe ſavages, when one commits any abominable crimes, which are ſhocking in their view, they treat him with abhorrence, and ſuppoſe that the vengeance of heaven will ſurely overtake him.</p>
            <p>Theſe people are as wholly deſtitute of any kind of government, as any of the human ſpecies can be. There is no kind of animals which herd together, but have ſome kind of government: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong cattle, rank is determined by bodily ſtrength and activity; each one knows his ſuperiors and inferiors, and when a ſtranger is added to the flock, the firſt buſineſs is to determine his rank, which is ordinarily done without much ſtrife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this ſalutary regulation, ſuited to their natures produces general tranquility. Geeſe that paſs and repaſs our country, ſpring and autumn, for change of climate, flying in regular wedges, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one at head to direct their way, have a kind of inſtinctive policy in aſſigning the time and place of rendezvous, and appointing an expert leader: ſo theſe ſavages when they hear the din of war, if there are white people inhuman enough to encourage them to ſkulk, ſurpriſe, kill and capattive the unwary or defenceleſs, which are their only exploits, they repair to their ſtandard, and appoint or acknowledge certain leaders, whom
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018273_0021_0FA5C9874C7813E0"/>
they obey only in proportion to their natural talents, to awe, influence and command them: theſe are what they commonly ſtile head warriors; beſides which, eſpecially in times of peace, there are thoſe whom they ſtile great men; and if one of theſe becomes eminent above the reſt, and ſo continue for a number of years, perhaps he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the title of ſachem, Theſe great men are ſuch to whom nature has been ſomewhat more liberal in the beſtowment of ſenſe and ſtability, who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves on divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, or have a commanding addreſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; by ſuch means they of courſe obtain what I would call a natural authority: this kind of authority obviouſly obtains among all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by an irreſiſtable law of nature: conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous excellence commands obſequious deference. I am well informed theſe great men have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able awe over the reſt, who pay a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deference to their opinion and advice when they are under their inſpection, and free from ſtrong drink and paſſions.</p>
            <p>But leaſt we ſhould form too reſpectable an idea of theſe great men, we may conſider that they are drunk as often as they have cider, rum, or other ſpirits, and are frequently guilty of as groſs enormities as the reſt. Theſe are the moſt conſiſtent ideas I can form from the ſmall infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I have had, and the few obſervations I have made concerning rulers and authority among the indians, though I am willing to ſubmit to the opinion of any who may be otherwiſe and better
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018273_0022_0FA5C98770143658"/>
informed, I think I have repreſented them with as much dignity in theſe matters, as the ſpecimens of their government will poſſibly ſupport. It is univerſally acknowledged that there is no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among them that pretends to inflict any kind of puniſhment on thoſe who commit any kind of crimes; if this be ſo, it is ſufficient to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and without any comment, proves the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of government and authority to be wholly wanting. Murder is no very uncommon crime among them; they frequently gorge their unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed paſſions by mauling and ſtabing the objects of them to death; and herein the fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not much excite the caution of doing it by night, or in a ſolitary, place but whenever their paſſions and malice impels; the perpetrator ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects perhaps to be called by ſome an ugly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for a while, but is apprehenſive of no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs ſome relative or friend of the ſlain has bravery enough to avenge his death. I was ſome years paſt at an indian ſettlement, and ſaw a recent grave where a murdered indian had a few days before been buried; the murderer was about among the others, and though this was in the chief town of that tribe or nation, yet no other notice was taken of the matter, than that the more ſteady people viewed the murderer as a wretch, whom the vengeance of heaven would ſome time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. If no avenger aroſe in that caſe, as I doubt whether any did, I conclude the odium declined with time, adding one to their numberleſs ſtigmas of national guilt. It is common for a relative or
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018273_0023_0FA5C98832C0EF68"/>
friend in ſuch a caſe, to avenge the murder, and ſometimes the avenger meets the vengeance of a third, and ſo on until ſeveral fall. I ſubmit to common ſenſe the idea of a ſovereign or ſachem preſiding over ſuch a tribe.</p>
            <p>Theft and robbery among them are venial crimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which renders their ſmall property very precarious, and diſcourages the acquiſition of more, were they diſpoſed to it.</p>
            <p>As to marriage, it is attended with ſome ſmall ceremony among them; but an indian whenever he pleaſes, turns off one wife and takes an other: it is a little extraordinary for a man and woman to live together during life. It is ſaid that if their wives happen to be too familiar with another indian, the huſband is apt enough to reſent it, but not ſo if with a white debauchee.</p>
            <p>There is in the vicinity of ſome, if not all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian towns, a houſe conſtructed, called the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man houſe, to which their women periodically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort; to this the males never preſume to approach, but if their buſineſs calls them that way, they ſhun it by a circuitous walk; if the males have occaſion to carry them any neceſſaries, they leave the ſame at a certain diſtance, where, when they are gone, the women go and fetch it; this cuſtom reſembles one obſerved by the antient Jews. The manner of burying their dead, is to ſeat the body on the ſurface of the earth, with the trunk erect, and placing in his arms ſuch things as uſed to delight him in his life, and which they ſuppoſe will be uſeful to him in future, they cover him
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018273_0024_0FA5C989A8BE6798"/>
with a pile of earth; theſe piles are ſometimes flatted down by ſome means or other, and leave the bones and funeral treaſure above ground.</p>
            <p>The indians are univerſally intemperate in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; both males and females never fail of intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icating themſelves whenever they have the means. They are a moſt lazy, indolent generation, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the males, who by their greater ſtrength, and total want of delicacy, oblige the ſquaws to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the moſt laborious and fatiguing employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; theſe, uſe has taught to carry the moſt incredible burthens when they travel to and fro, and on all occaſions, while the males walk in their company without offering to partake of the burthen.</p>
            <p>A gentleman of veracity who had reſided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably among them informed me, that he never obſerved any of the males to attempt any domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic labour, but at one particular time, when the ſquaws were much involved in buſineſs, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed an entertainment, and invited the men to aſſemble and hoe a field of corn for them, which they accordingly did, and then partook of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt which the ſquaws had provided, which was a pig cooked with ſome indian corn and beans, the fleſh was carved into as many parts as their were gueſts, of which my informant by ſpecial invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was one, each was preſented with his ſhare of fleſh fixed on a ſharpened ſtick, and were told if any choſe to refreſh themſelves with the ſauce, and carry the fleſh home, they were at liberty ſo to do; accordingly ſome eat their allowance on the ſpot, and others bore theirs home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:018273_0025_0FA5C98A697F9C88"/>The indians by way of ornament, paſs a knife quite around the circumferrence of their ears, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating an annular piece of cartilage, near half an inch in width, which they curiouſly wind with wampum, but this is preſently broken by ſome accident in their ſylvan walks, and the ſtrips are left pendulous. They likewiſe paint one half of thir faces with a deep red, which gives them a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frightful appearance. What little cloathing that they wear, is made either of ſkins of wild beaſts, or ſome coarſe cloath when they can get it. The women wear a kind of petticoat reaching preciſely to their knees, and the men ſomething of ſmall width faſtened about their loins, and both ſexes a blanket, which is their chief garment, thrown over the whole; if they happen to get a linnen ſhirt, it is full mounted with ruffles of the ſame, ſeldom faſtened at the collar or wriſtbands, and never put off for waſhing until it is worn to rags.</p>
