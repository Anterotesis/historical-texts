            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>AND I SAY ALSO UNTO THEE, THAT THOU ART PETER, AND UPON THIS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH: AND THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAIL AGAINST IT.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words, which were ſpoken by Jeſus Chriſt to his diſciples <hi>in private,</hi> contain a more full declaration of his divine character, than he ſaw fit ever to make <hi>in public.</hi> In this conference, he acknowledged to his diſciples, without reſerve, that <hi>he</hi> was the promiſed Meſſiah. But, at the ſame time, "he charged his diſciples, that they ſhould tell no man that he was Jeſus the Chriſt."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030021_0004_0FE3C70D2EE01B58"/>THE occaſion of theſe words was this: Chriſt had been inquiring of his diſciples what opinion of <hi>him</hi> the public entertained. "Whom do men ſay, that I, the Son of man am? And they ſaid, ſome ſay that thou art John the Baptiſt, ſome Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets." He then aſked them <hi>their own</hi> opinion. "Whom ſay ye that I am? And Simon Peter anſwered and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed art thou, Simon Barjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."</p>
            <p>THIS reply of Chriſt was expreſſive of his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Peter's anſwer, and an implicit acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment, that <hi>his</hi> opinion of his maſter was juſt. And, on account of the faith, expreſſed in his anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Chriſt pronounced him <hi>bleſſed</hi>; and intimated, alſo, that <hi>that</hi> faith, which entitleth to happineſs, cometh not from man, but God. "Fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I ſay alſo unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church: and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it."</p>
            <p>CHRIST was pleaſed, as Peter had made a good profeſſion, frankly to declare himſelf to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, or the STONE, laid for the foundation of the church, which had been foretold by the prophets;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030021_0005_0FE3C711A30F3C28"/>
alſo, to declare the <hi>ſtability</hi> of the church.</p>
            <p>THIS paſſage of ſcripture hath occaſioned much controverſy amongſt the profeſſors of chriſtianity. The Papiſts have alledged, that, by <hi>this rock,</hi> on which Chriſt promiſed to build his church, was meant <hi>Peter,</hi> the word <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifying a rock, or ſtone. The Proteſtants, on the contrary, have maintained, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf</hi> was intended by <hi>this rock.</hi> Some, however, have ſuppoſed, that they might grant, that, by <hi>this Rock,</hi> Chriſt meant <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>other Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> (in whoſe name Peter anſwered) without help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the leaſt, the cauſe of the Papiſts, who wiſh, by the aid of this text, to eſtabliſh the ſupremacy of the Pope, denominated, by them, the ſucceſſor of the Peter; inaſmuch, as Chriſt faith nothing about any <hi>ſucceſſor</hi> of Peter, or of the other apoſtles; and as the apoſtles were, in a ſenſe, the foundation of the church, as is intimated in Eph. ii. 20, "And are built upon the foundation of the apoſtles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone." Alſo, Rev. xxi. 14. "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apoſtles of the Lamb."</p>
            <p>As the apoſtles were inſtruments, which God employed, firſt to propagate the goſpel, and ſet up the chriſtian church, in the world, they were, in a ſenſe, the foundation of the church. But, it doth not appear that <hi>Peter</hi> was a foundation, rather than
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030021_0006_0FE3C7168A44B538"/>
the other apoſtles, nor, that any of them had ſucceſſors in their office. The apoſtles were extraordinary officers, raiſed up, in the beginning of the age of chriſtianity, to ſpread the goſpel, and plant churches; and the office expired with thoſe, who were at firſt honoured with it.</p>
            <p>THAT Chriſt meant <hi>himſelf,</hi> and not <hi>Peter,</hi> it is alſo argued, from his varying the term, when he ſaid <hi>On this rock,</hi> and not uſing the very word <hi>Peter,</hi> though that alſo ſignified a rock. He might, alſo, point out himſelf, in ſome way, when he uttered theſe words, as he probably did at another time, when he ſaid, "Deſtroy this temple, and within three days I will rear it again." Some, <hi>then,</hi> underſtood him to ſpeak of the temple, to which the Jews reſorted for worſhip; "but he ſpoke of the temple of his body." So, in the paſſage under conſideration, without doubt, he meant <hi>himſelf,</hi> by <hi>this rock,</hi> alluding to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in Iſai. xxviii. 16. "Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner ſtone, a ſure foundation." As Peter had profeſſed to believe, that Jeſus was <hi>the Chriſt, the Son of the living God,</hi> Chriſt proceeded, in addition to his profeſſion, and ſaid, "On this rock," On the ſtone ſpoken of by Iſaiah—on Chriſt, whom you acknowledge me to be, "I will build my church."</p>
            <p>CHRIST, in many places of ſcripture, is ſtiled a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030021_0007_0FE3C719F2BA6F58"/>
               <hi>rock</hi> or <hi>ſtone,</hi> and is ſaid to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> foundation of his church. 1 Cor. iii. 11. "For other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can no man lay, than that laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt."</p>
            <p>FURTHER, it may be remarked upon the words of Chriſt in our text, that this mode of expreſſion, which he uſed, <hi>I ſay alſo unto thee,</hi> denoteth the thing aſſerted to be true and infallible—that what he predicts will aſſuredly be accompliſhed. The thing aſſerted by Chriſt is, that he will build his church on a <hi>firm</hi> foundation; and, that the <hi>gates of hell</hi>—the powers of darkneſs—the church's adverſaries, ſhall not prevail againſt it—ſhall neither be able to deſtroy it, nor, prevent its growth.</p>
            <p>It is implied, in theſe words of Chriſt, that the powers of darkneſs will fight againſt the church; and affirmed, that they ſhall not prevail againſt it. We may, then, be led by our text, in the enſuing diſcourſe, to conſider</p>
            <p n="1">I. The oppoſition which hath hath been made to the church, and</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſafety of the church, notwithſtanding its adverſaries.</p>
            <p n="1">I. LET us conſider <hi>the oppoſition,</hi> which hath been made unto the church.</p>
            <p>By the church are meant believers, or the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>the faithful,</hi> in the whole world, whether
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030021_0008_0FE3C71F9DD59E78"/>
Jews or Gentiles. Though this church, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, will be a glorious body, Chriſt being its head, and the banner diſplayed over it, LOVE; yet it hath its enemies! It was early foretold, even when the firſt intimations of the being of a church were given, that it would have a ſubtle, malignant foe. Gen. iii. 15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy feed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel." Further on in the ſacred ſcriptures, we learn, that, by <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> was meant <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the head of his church; that ſatan is the ſerpent, and the adverſary of Chriſt; and, that this ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction intimated, that there would be war between ſatan and the church, in which, Chriſt, or the church, would receive ſome wounds, <hi>not mortal,</hi> as they were in the <hi>heel</hi>; but that ſatan would be bruiſed <hi>in the head</hi>—diſappointed and ruined. We have ſome account of this war, in Rev. xii. 7. "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought againſt the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels." Michael is Chriſt; and by the dragon, as we are told in the following verſe, was meant, "that old ſerpent, called the devil and ſatan, which deceiveth the whole world. "This ſheweth, that the devil maketh great oppoſition to Chriſt and his church. Chriſt had no ſooner begun to build up his church
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030021_0009_0FE3C724DA349288"/>
(which he did ſoon after the apoſtacy of Adam) than ſatan began to oppoſe him, and to attempt to deſtroy the church, or, prevent its growth. And that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition hath been carried on, in all ſucceeding ages, even to the preſent time.</p>
            <p>SOME of the ways, in which ſatan hath fought againſt Chriſt, and endeavoured to prevent the growth of the church, are the following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By tempting, and perſuading, mankind to reject the offers, made unto them in the goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN that paſſage, juſt now quoted from Revelation, it is ſaid, that <hi>the devil deceiveth the whole world,</hi> that is, a great part of mankind. The apoſtle ſaith, in 2 Cor. iv. 3—4, "If our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them," It hence appeareth, that ſatan hath ſuch influence upon many, as to prevent their receiving the goſpel of Chriſt. Through the depravity of the human heart, men are eaſily deceived by ſatan, and prevailed upon to neglect the great ſalvation, offered to all in the goſpel. Hence they are ſaid to be "carried captive by him at his pleaſure." By the artifice of ſatan, the goſpel, <hi>as yet,</hi> hath been heard, but by the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of mankind. And a great part, there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030021_0010_0FE3C729C660B890"/>
to fear, of thoſe who hear it, are perſuaded by ſatan to diſobey, deſpiſe and reject it, and refuſe to give their aſſiſtance, in building Chriſt's church, by becoming believers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By prevailing upon ſome members of Chriſt's viſible church to conduct in ſuch a manner, as to bring a reproach upon religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHRIST hath ſet up a <hi>viſible</hi> church in the world, as a "light in a dark place," to enlighten the world, to recommend true religion, and induce many to embrace it. But, ſometimes, members of the viſible church, by their ſcandalous conduct, like David, "give great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme," bring religion into contempt, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, prevent the growth of the church. Whereas, if profeſſors of religion conducted with propriety, and walked as becometh their profeſſion, "others, by ſeeing their good works, might be led to glorify God."</p>
            <p>Satan entered into <hi>Judas,</hi> and prevailed upon him to betray Chriſt; alſo, in tempting <hi>Peter</hi> to deny his Lord and Maſter, he proved ſucceſsful. And how many of the profeſſed friends of Chriſt, ſince that time, have, <hi>by their works denied him,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his cauſe!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By propagating ſchiſms, herefies, and pernicious doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE were, in the <hi>viſible</hi> church, even in the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030021_0011_0FE3C72DB75515B8"/>
apoſtolic age, falſe doctrines, diviſions and hereſies. One was for Paul, another for Cephas. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended earneſtly for the obſervance of the Moſaic rites, denying, without this, the poſſibility of ſalvation. Some held, "that the reſurrection was paſt already, and thereby overthrew the faith of ſome." And, in all ages ſince, ſatan hath prevailed upon ſome of the viſible church to ſpread ſentiments, which have a tendency to prevent the converſion of ſinners, and to obſtruct the increaſe of Chriſt's church. Alſo, this malicious foe hath ſucceeded, in his attempts to ſtir up ſtrife and diviſions in the viſible church, and cauſe ſchiſms and ſeparations among the profeſſed followers of the Lamb of God. How many ſects, denominations, and parties, there are, in the Chriſtian church! Some appear to imbibe groſs errors and deluſions, implicitly "denying the Lord who bought them." And others ſeparate from, and hate, their brethren <hi>only</hi> for differing from them in opinion, with reſpect to modes, and rites, and <hi>non-eſſentials</hi> of religion. Such ſchiſms and hereſies have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to increaſe ſceptics and infidels, and hinder the growth of the church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>By exciting perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WICKED men, in almoſt every age, being inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto by Chriſt's adverſary, have cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the church. The prophets, who predicted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030021_0012_0FE3C732A3973C90"/>
the coming of Chriſt, were put to death. And <hi>he,</hi> and his apoſtles, fared no better.</p>
            <p>SOON after Chriſt's church, through the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the apoſtles, began to grow, <hi>the Jews</hi> ſeverely perſecuted it. Many, who profeſſed chriſtianity, were put to death. Afterwards, it was moſt violently perſecuted, by the Roman Emperors, <hi>Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Severus, Diocleſian,</hi> and ſeveral others. And ſome of theſe perſecutions were carried on, with ſuch fury, as to threaten the utter extirpation of the church. Thouſands of thouſands were put to death, and many of them, in a moſt cruel manner, <hi>only</hi> for profeſſing, and endeavouring to propagate, the chriſtian religion. Many, wrapt in combuſtible matter, fell victims to the devouring flames; ſome expired in agonies, like their innocent maſter, upon the croſs; others were drawn to pieces by wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>AN edict was made, by the bloody Emperor <hi>Decius,</hi> about the middle of the third century, by which, the Praetors, upon pain of death, were obliged to extirpate the whole chriſtian ſect. What diſtreſs among chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians, what horror, what torrents of blood, were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by this!</p>
            <p>AND, after the chriſtian religion had ſo far prevailed, as to be eſtabliſhed in the Roman empire;—when the pleaſing hope of being perſecuted no more, was excited in the breaſt of chriſtians, <hi>then,</hi> Satan, by his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030021_0013_0FE3C73820A5C1F0"/>
wiles, brought upon the church, perſecution, from a quarter, not in the leaſt ſuſpected. The <hi>viſible</hi> church, in conſequence of its eſtabliſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the national church, ſoon became ſo corrupt, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence <hi>a perſecutor.</hi> Profeſſed chriſtians perſecuted, to the death, other profeſſed chriſtians, becauſe <hi>they differed from them in ſentiments!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE church of <hi>Rome,</hi> called the catholic church, had ſwerved ſo far from the ſimplicity and purity of the goſpel, and introduced ſo many flagrant corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the relicks of paganiſm; that many conſcientious chriſtians were obliged to renounce ſome of her groſs errors and pernicious practices. The conſequence of which was, <hi>the reformers</hi> were perſecuted, in the moſt unchriſtian, inhuman man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and driven from the church, and declared to be heretics.</p>
            <p>AT length, they were protected by ſome temporal princes; and the reformed religion was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral other places. But, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to relate! the church called <hi>the reformed,</hi> which had once ſuffered perſecution, became a perſecutor <hi>herſelf.</hi> They refuſed thoſe privileges to their breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which <hi>they</hi> had claimed, <hi>as the rights of man,</hi> for <hi>themſelves.</hi> Thoſe, who could not conſcientiouſly conform to the eſtabliſhed modes of the church of England, were perſecuted, as ſeverely, by <hi>that church,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:030021_0014_0FE3C73CAD9422F8"/>
as the reformers, before, had been, by <hi>the papiſts.</hi> The ſame arguments, which <hi>they</hi> had formerly uſed, to judge their departure from the eſtabliſhed corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the church of Rome, were now offered to <hi>them,</hi> by their diſſenting brethren, with as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and with as <hi>little ſucceſs,</hi> to juſtify their non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to what they deemed antiſcriptural. The ſame pleas for liberty of conſcience, which <hi>they</hi> had once made, in their turn, they imprudently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly rejected.</p>
            <p>THIS perſecution was the occaſion of the ſettling of New-England. Thoſe, who were perſecuted in their native country, came into the wilderneſs of America to enjoy liberty of conſcience, denied unto them at home, by their cruel and unrighteous brethren.</p>
            <p>AND is it not a fact, that, wherever the chriſtian religion hath been eſtabliſhed as the national religion, none could enjoy liberty of conſcience, without ſome degree of perſecution, except that particular ſect, or denomination, which happened to bear rule? Have not New-England and other parts of the United States been diſgraced with perſecution?</p>
            <p>AND if, at any time, the civil government of any country, or nation, hath not allowed of men's ſuffering in their eſtate, or limbs, or life, for their religion, (as is now the caſe in the United States) Satan hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and carried into execution, another ſpecies of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030021_0015_0FE3C74166533BC8"/>
perſecution, even <hi>ſatire</hi> and <hi>banter,</hi> which, perhaps, is an improvement in the diabolical art, and better calculated to accompliſh the purpoſe of its author, and obſtruct the growth of Chriſt's church, than fire or ſword, the wheel or gibbet, or any other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cruelty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>By exciting profeſſors of chriſtianity to ſubſtitute ſuperſtition in the place of true and evangelical religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE children of Iſrael, before Chriſt's day, as appeareth from the writings of the prophets, ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the obſervance of rites and ſacrifices in the place of righteouſneſs and mercy. The Phariſees, a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſect of Jews, in Chriſt's day, ſtrictly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly tythed mint, anniſe and cummin, whilſt they neglected "the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith." And, how ſoon, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> church was corrupted, in this way! And to what an enormous height was ſuperſtition carried, by the <hi>Catholic</hi> church! how many rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ſome of them the moſt whimſical that could be imagined, were enjoined, by <hi>that</hi> church, to be religiouſly obſerved!</p>
            <p>THE natural conſequence of ſuch ſuperſtition, is, to cauſe men, when they become in a certain degree enlightened, to diſbelieve the divine origin of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion. They cannot readily diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween genuine chriſtianity, and its corruptions, blended with it, by the folly of men. Therefore,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030021_0016_0FE3C746ABFAC230"/>
when they ſee ſo much ſuperſtition and falſe religion, mixed with chriſtianity, they diſcard it all together; as many, at the preſent day, are doing in <hi>France,</hi> where ſuperſtition hath, for a long time, ſo greatly prevailed.</p>
            <p>AND, without doubt, one reaſon of the increaſe of infidelity, in chriſtian countries, is the prevalence of ſuperſtition among the profeſſors of chriſtianity. Let the chriſtian religion be ſeparated from ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be acted out, and taught, in its <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>purity,</hi> and it will recommend itſelf to every one, who is governed by reaſon. Then <hi>the age of reaſon,</hi> and <hi>the age of chriſtianity,</hi> will be ſynonymous.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſo long as profeſſors of chriſtianity are zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and conſcientious about <hi>indifferent</hi> matters, and ſlack in the performance of <hi>moral duties,</hi> the growth of Chriſt's church will be obſtructed.</p>
            <p>THESE are ſome of the ways, in which ſatan hath been oppoſing, and fighting againſt, Chriſt and his church. But his oppoſition is in vain. This leads to the next thing propoſed:</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE conſideration of <hi>the ſafety of the church,</hi> notwithſtanding its adverſaries.</p>
            <p>"THE gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it." The church is ſafe, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition, made againſt it, by the powers of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>BY the church's being ſafe, it is not meant, that every part of the <hi>viſible</hi> church, or every <hi>individual
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030021_0017_0FE3C74B91ACE700"/>
viſible</hi> church, ſhall be preſerved, and continue to the end of time. For many, which flouriſhed for a time, are now no more. Where are the churches, planted by the Apoſtles in Aſia;—thoſe, to which ſome of Paul's epiſtles were written, and to which john was ordered to write, Revelation? Their candleſtick hath been removed out of his place. That country, once bleſſed with the reſidence of chriſtian churches, is now inhabited, principally, by Mahometans and Pagans.</p>
            <p>THE JEWS, formerly the church of God, have been caſt off by Chriſt, for their unbelief and irreligion. And, probably, this is the caſe of ſome, who call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Chriſt threatened to ſpue the church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> out of his mouth, except they ſhould repent: alſo the church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were fore-warned of the removal of their candleſtick out of his place, unleſs they ſhould reform. And, long ſince, thoſe threatenings have been executed.</p>
            <p>NEITHER is it certain, that any one individual church, now on the earth, will endure to the end of the world. Moſt probably there will not. All are corrupt, and will be taken down, or paſs a great change, by reformation. Probably, among all the ſects, no one is entirely right. One hath one good qualification; and another, another: But all have their errors and imperfections, and moſt probably will be removed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:030021_0018_0FE3C75076569560"/>BUT by the ſafety of the church, as the phraſe is uſed in this diſcourſe, it is meant, that there ſhall be a <hi>viſible</hi> church in the world, ſo long as the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures; alſo, that Chriſt's <hi>inviſible,</hi> or real church ſhall live forever.</p>
            <p>THE ſafety of Chriſt's church, in theſe reſpects, depends on its <hi>foundation.</hi> Chriſt is the foundation of the church. It reſts on him—on him it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent for its ſupport, as a building reſts on its foundation. If Chriſt, then, is a <hi>good</hi> foundation, the building, erected on him, will ſtand. And, in our text, Chriſt calleth himſelf a <hi>rock,</hi> which, is a firm foundation; and by the prophet, who foretold his coming, he is ſtyled, "<hi>a precious corner-ſtone, A SURE FOUNDATION.</hi>" The church, then, being built on ſuch a foundation, is ſtable. And if the whole church be ſafe, then the <hi>individuals,</hi> of which the church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, are ſafe, and cannot be deſtroyed: For if one individual, who was ever built on Chriſt, could fall from him, and periſh, then why might not another, and the whole? How then is Chriſt <hi>a ſure foundation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſafety of each real chriſtian, and the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his periſhing, are aſſerted by Chriſt, in Mat. vii. 24, 25. "Therefore, whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man which built his houſe upon a rock: And the rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe: and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:030021_0019_0FE3C7544E90F160"/>MANY who have <hi>thought</hi> themſelves to be real ſaints, and have been deemed ſuch by others, may have their deluſion diſcovered, their garb of hypocriſy ſtript off, and, periſh: But every ſoul, built on Chriſt by faith, will endure, notwithſtanding all the ſtorms of temptation, which may aſſault him, and all the powers of darkneſs; <hi>for he is founded on a rock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHRIST'S being compared to a rock, denotes his ſtrength and ſtability—that he is able to uphold his church. And if he is able, we may be ſure that he will do it; for he hath expreſſly promiſed it. John vi. 37, 39. "All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out. And this is the Father's will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day." Alſo ſee John x. 27—29. "My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all: and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand." Here Chriſt declares, not only, that he will hold and ſave all that come unto him, but, that his <hi>Father,</hi> alſo, is engaged to hold them in his hand, that they may never periſh.</p>
            <p>THE ſafety, and continuance of the <hi>viſible</hi> church,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030021_0020_0FE3C75A1BE5A9A0"/>
to the end of the world, depend on the ſame founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. the promiſe and power of Chriſt. The power and providence of God have preſerved the <hi>viſible</hi> church in the world, from the beginning to the preſent time. When the world was deſtroyed by a deluge, in Noah's day, the church was preſerved in the ark. It was led, in ſafety, through the red ſea, where the hoſts of Egypt, purſuing it, were drowned. It hath been preſerved through many <hi>bloody,</hi> and <hi>fiery</hi> perſecutions. It hath been preſerved through the revolutions, which have taken place, in the kingdoms of this world. Nations have been diſperſed, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and extirpated from the earth: but <hi>the viſible church</hi> hath ſurvived.</p>
            <p>SATAN hath often been diſappointed, and baffled, in his attempts to deſtroy the church by perſecutions, by their being over-ruled, in Divine Providence, ſo as to have an oppoſite tendency. Perſecutions, ſometimes, have been the occaſion of ſpreading the goſpel the more ſpeedily, and enlarging Chriſt's kingdom. This was the effect of a perſecution in Jeruſalem, mentioned in the viiith of Acts: "And at that time there was a great perſecution againſt the church which was at Jeruſalem, and they were all ſcattered abroad, throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. Therefore they that were ſcattered abroad went every where preaching the word."</p>
            <p>The things, which God hath done to preſerve
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030021_0021_0FE3C75F94837318"/>
and enlarge his church, may be conſidered as a ſacred pledge, for the future accompliſhment of all his promiſes concerning the proſperity and increaſe of his church, in the latter day. The church, which is compared to <hi>leaven,</hi> will be preſerved, 'till it hath <hi>leavened the whole lump</hi>—'till it hath filled the whole world. For it is declared, by the ſpirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that, "In the days of theſe kings" (thoſe ſpoken of in the preceding verſes) "ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdom, which ſhall never be deſtroyed: and the kingdom ſhall not be leſt to other people, but it ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all thoſe kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand forever.</p>
            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE ought all to be upon our guard, leſt we be found to aid ſatan, in his attempts to injure the church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>WE have heard how he employeth mankind as inſtruments to execute his projects. Therefore, let not thoſe, who as yet have not obeyed the goſpel, be prevailed upon, by any temptation, to perſiſt any longer in their diſobedience. Let not profeſſors of religion be enticed, and drawn, into any conduct, which will wound the cauſe of Chriſt. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of embracing, or propagating, hereſies, and hurtful doctrines. When ſatan ſpreads theſe, he puts on the appearance of great religion, and "trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himſelf into an angel of light."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:030021_0022_0FE3C7647B24F9D8"/>LET us have no hand in any kind of <hi>perſecution</hi>: for this is the work of ſatan. And how vain, and unreaſonable, is perſecution! "Every plant," ſaith Chriſt, "which my heavenly Father hath not plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall be rooted up." Gamaliel ſaid, "Refrain from theſe men, and let them alone: for if this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; leſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye be found even to fight againſt God."</p>
               <p>LET us alſo beware of ſuperſtition, which is an enemy of true religion, and a weapon, with which ſatan fights againſt the church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THOSE may be pronounced <hi>bleſſed,</hi> who belong to Chriſt's church.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>viſible</hi> church is not meant here; for, though it may be conſidered as a great privilege to belong to <hi>that,</hi> merely <hi>that</hi> doth not enſure one's happineſs. For ſome have a ſtanding in the <hi>viſible,</hi> who do not appertain to the <hi>inviſible,</hi> church of Chriſt. "All are not Iſrael who are of Iſrael." All the natural ſeed, or deſcendants of Iſrael, were not in reality God's people: So now all, who are of the <hi>viſible,</hi> are not of the <hi>inviſible,</hi> church of Chriſt, which will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reign with him in glory. But all, who belong to the latter, that is, all who have ever heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt by faith, are ſafe—their ſalvation and eternal happineſs are ſure. They are built on a rock, and the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt them.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030021_0023_0FE3C768DE70B980"/>
They will not fall away and periſh; for Chriſt hath declared, that <hi>they ſhall never periſh,</hi> and that, <hi>none ſhall pluck them out of his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT none beſides theſe are ſafe; none are happy. There is nothing durable in this world. Let us, then, all join to this happy kingdom. All are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and <hi>he that cometh ſhall in no wiſe he caſt out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. WE ought gratefully to remember and acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge God's goodneſs and faithfulneſs, diſplayed in redeeming, preſerving, and ſaving, his church.</p>
               <p>WHAT goodneſs God hath diſcovered, by giving his Son to redeem, and to be the foundation of, his church! What faithfulneſs God manifeſteth, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting, and finally ſaving it, notwithſtanding all its <hi>external</hi> enemies, and <hi>internal</hi> corruptions!</p>
               <p>WHAT infinite mercy and wiſdom God hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, by preſerving a <hi>viſible</hi> church in the world, through all paſt ages—through times of darkneſs, ſuperſtition, and ignorance—times of diſtreſs and perſecution—times of infidelity and apoſtacy! This calleth for our admiration and gratitude.</p>
               <p>WE have convened, at this time, to take notice of a ſpecimen of this goodneſs and faithfulneſs of God, diſplayed, by his having preſerved a viſible church, in <hi>this place,</hi> for ſo conſiderable a length of time;—and, it is to be hoped, with a diſpoſition <hi>thankfully</hi> to acknowledge them.</p>
               <p>THIS day completes one century, ſince a viſible
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030021_0024_0FE3C76E6065EE18"/>
church was firſt gathered in this place. And, as it is preſumed that it will not be unacceptable to the auditory, a ſketch of its hiſtory will be recited. But, as the moſt ancient records of this church, are entirely loſt, a ſhort and imperfect account, <hi>only,</hi> is to be expected.</p>
               <p>IT is evident, from the date of the church's cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and confeſſion of faith, which have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and from other teſtimony, that the church, in this place, was eſtabliſhed, on Dec. 26th. A. D. 1694. O. S.; and, that the Reverend <hi>Samuel Fuller,</hi> a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of the church in Plymouth, was, at the ſame time, ordained its Paſtor. Of how many the church <hi>then</hi> conſiſted, and who they were, no documents, which we have ſeen, give any information, except, that it conſiſted partly of members from the church in Plymouth.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>FULLER</hi> continued but a ſhort time after his ordination, dying Auguſt 17th. 1695, (as appeareth from his grave-ſtone, which is yet legible) in the 71ſt. year of his age. He was conſidered to be a ſincerely godly man, and uſeful preacher. Before his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he had occaſionally preached to this people, above ſixteen years. His death was conſidered as a great loſs, and lamented by his people.</p>
               <p>AFTER his deceaſe, another deacon of Plymouth church, Mr. <hi>Iſaac Cuſhman,</hi> was invited, by this church, to take the paſtoral charge of them. But
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030021_0025_0FE3C7A7146B4B80"/>
he negatived their call, and ſettled in a contiguous pariſh, ſince called Plymton.</p>
               <p>HOW long they continued deſtitute, it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely be aſcertained; but, probably, it was not long after Mr. Fuller's death, when Mr. <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> was ordained to the paſtoral office: For, June 30th. 1708, by the advice of an Eccleſiaſtical Council of twelve churches, he was depoſed from the miniſtry, and laid under church cenſure. And, ſome time previous to that, he had been diſmiſſed by his church and congregation, and preached, in a private houſe, to a party of his adherents.</p>
               <p>THE Rev. <hi>Peter Thacher</hi> began to preach, in this place, Sept. 1707, and was ordained, Nov. 2d. 1709, to univerſal ſatisfaction. How large the church was, when he took the Paſtoral charge of it, cannot be aſcertained; but, during the whole of his miniſtry, 402 were added to it. Having, to good acceptance, officiated as Paſtor, about thirty five years, on the 22d. of April, 1744, he died, about fifty-five years of age.</p>
               <p>SOME of the remarkable events, during his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are the following: In March, A. D. 1718, the two deacons, <hi>John Bennet,</hi> and—<hi>Tinkham,</hi> died on the ſame week, and, (what is ſtill more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary) the wife of each of them died, and was buried at the ſame time, and in the ſame grave, with her huſband. About that time, ſickneſs and mortality
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030021_0026_0FE3C7AB692E6B60"/>
prevailed in this place, and ſeveral other uſeful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this church were taken away.</p>
               <p>LUKE SHORT, a man, ſuppoſed to be an <hi>an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old,</hi> was received into the church.</p>
               <p>TOWARDS the cloſe of Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi>'s life, there was a remarkable revival of religion, in this place, as well as in various other places in all parts of the country; ſo that, A. D. 1742, one hundred and forty eight were received into this church. But this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious commotion was followed by an unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and diviſion in this church, occaſioned by the different opinions concerning it, which different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons entertained. The contention was ſo ſharp, and party ſpirit run ſo high, as to occaſion a diviſion of this once happy people, and the ſetting up of another meeting. A large marjority of the church, with the <hi>minor</hi> part of the ſociety, made choice of the Rev. <hi>Silvanus Conant</hi> for their Paſtor, who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, March 28, 1745, within a year after Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi>'s death. The other part of the church, with the <hi>majority</hi> of the ſociety, the October following, ſettled Rev. <hi>Thomas Weld</hi>; who continued with them but a few years, his party gradually leaving <hi>him,</hi> and going to the other meeting, 'till at length <hi>he</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed; and then the church and ſociety, which had been rent aſunder, were again happily united.</p>
               <p>Mr. CONANT, a man, whoſe memory is yet very dear to many of this audience, died Dec. 8, A. D.

1777, in the 58th year of his age, and 33d. of his miniſtry; being called from his labours, in the midſt of his uſefulneſs, and in the full poſſeſſion of the love and eſteem of his large flock.</p>
               <p>It doth not appear, that, during the whole of his miniſtry, more than ſeventy five were added to this church.</p>
               <p>THE church remained deſtitute of a paſtor, after his deceaſe, about four years, in which time only four members were added.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>preſent Paſtor</hi> was ordained, Dec. 5, 1781; ſince which time, juſt as many have been admitted into the church, as were, during Mr. Conant's min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry. And in one of theſe, we have an inſtance of longevity, nearly equal to the one in Mr. Thacher's day, already mentioned. The widow <hi>Hannah Tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Nov. 6, 1788, delivered to the church and others, by the word of mouth, a rational and affecting account of the religious exerciſes of her heart—received the ordinance of baptiſm, and was admitted to full communion with the church, being <hi>ninety four</hi> years old. <note n="*" place="bottom">She died, March <hi>25, 1792.</hi>

               <p>AN accurate liſt of thoſe who have officiated as deacons in this church, by reaſon of the deficiency of the church records, cannot be given. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that ſome of the deacons were inducted into their office, in a very <hi>ſolemn</hi> manner. <hi>Samuel Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi>

and <hi>Ephraim Wood,</hi> July 25, 1725, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the office of deacon, having <hi>previouſly</hi> been proved above two years. A ſolemn charge was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them, <hi>faithfully</hi> to perform the work, incumbent on that office, which charge was preceded and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by prayer; alſo, as a token of their being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in that office, the <hi>right hand</hi> was given them by the Paſtor. The only other ſimilar inſtance was in March, A. D. 1737, when Samuel Wood, and Ebenezer Finney, having been elected to that office, previouſly, more than two years, were ordained.</p>
               <p>THIS church hath been diminiſhed, at various times, by ſupplying members for the eſtabliſhment of other churches—as that in Halifax, and thoſe in the ſecond and third Precincts of this town; beſides many, who have emigrated to Vermont, and other places. But it is ſtill preſerved. <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us.</hi> How much longer it will continue, God only knoweth. No particular <hi>viſible</hi> church is ſure of remaining; though Chriſt will have a church in the world, to the end of time. Sometimes, when a church becomes corrupt, and <hi>lukewarm,</hi> Chriſt ſpues it out of his mouth.</p>
               <p>LET us, therefore, <hi>be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.</hi> Let us take heed, that we do not corrupt our ways, nor the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God. Let us ſpeedily reform in every particular, in which we have erred from the rule of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030021_0029_0FE3C77323F82CF8"/>
God's word, and followed the traditions of men. And let us all remember the need there is of <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> in thoſe, who belong to Chriſt's kingdom. They have powerful, crafty, and malicious enemies, who are conſtantly ſeeking their deſtruction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us comply with the exhortation of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in thoſe words: "Finally, my brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devil. For we wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all, to ſtand."</p>
               <p>"NOW unto him who is able to keep you from falling, and to preſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his glory, with exceeding joy—to the only wiſe God our Saviour, be glory and majeſty, dominion and power, both now and ever. AMEN."</p>
