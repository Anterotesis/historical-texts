            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADDRESS TO THE INHABITANTS OF NORTH-AMERICA.</head>
            <p>AS it has been thought requiſite, by a continental aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to put a ſtop to the importation of manufactures into America, it is abſolutely neceſſary to fall ſpeedily on ſome effectual method to furniſh, at leaſt, the coarſeſt articles of our cloathing.</p>
            <p>OUR country produces <hi>wool, cotton, hemp</hi> and <hi>flax,</hi> mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials amply ſufficient to anſwer every demand of neceſſity and convenience. The quantity may be increaſed by attention and diligence, and wrought up with a degree of ſkill eaſily attainable.</p>
            <p>WE ſee already many families, ſcattered throughout theſe provinces, almoſt entirely cloathed in their own home-ſpun manufactures; why therefore ſhould any of us deſpair of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing that which is actually practiſed, before our eyes, by ſo many?</p>
            <p>BY beginning with coarſe manufactures we ſhall begin at the right end, we ſhall, every ſucceeding year, improve upon the paſt, and, after a fair exertion of the means in our power, we ſhall look back, with wonder and aſtoniſhment, at our preſent apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:014022_0004_0F92ADF35B87FD28"/>
WE muſt now exert ourſelves in manufactures, or, from an unconquerable indolence, be driven to the baſeſt and moſt humiliating conceſſions, conceſſions that others may diſpoſe of our lives, liberties, and properties, at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>WHEN every thing valuable to men is thus at ſtake, the author claims the privilege of a citizen, and entreats the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the public, to a ſubject of ſo great conſequence to this country as that which is now ſubmitted to their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It is no leſs than a certain, cheap and eaſy method of ſupplying, internally, the moſt neceſſary and conſiderable parts of or cloathing.</p>
            <p>A GREAT increaſe of the quantity of wool may gradually be effected, by a general purſuit of the means recommended by the congreſs; but, as it will require much time before a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity, for every purpoſe, can be obtained, it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the inconvenience may be, in a great meaſure, obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, by blending it, for moſt uſes, with another material, which may be eaſily procured in the utmoſt plenty.</p>
            <p>COTTON may be raiſed, in many parts of theſe colonies, with ſucceſs; and, being uſeful in all, the cultivation of it ought to be encouraged in thoſe places where the climate and ſoil are favourable, with a view of not only anſwering their own exigencies, but alſo in quantity ſufficient to ſupply their neighbours, who have not the ſame advantages.</p>
            <p>THOSE who have attempted the manufacture of linen in this country, have generally made it of <hi>flax,</hi> and have been greatly diſcouraged, from frequent diſappointments in their expectations of a crop: <hi>Flax</hi> ſown, even on our beſt and freſheſt lands, is often ſcarce worth the ſaving. The ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the crop is, doubtleſs, ſometimes owing to bad huſbandry; but, where there are ſo many inſtances of its fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014022_0005_0F92ADF494245388"/>under the utmoſt attention and diligence, it is fairly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable, that the want of ſucceſs is, generally, owing to ſome other cauſe than miſmanagement.</p>
            <p>IN Zealand, along the ſhores of the Baltick, particularly about Riga, in Scotland and Ireland, and in ſome parts of Flanders, where the greateſt quantities of <hi>flax</hi> are raiſed, we are informed, that, even in theſe northern countries, it thrives only upon deep, moiſt, ſtiff, clayey, or loamy ſoils; and that the province of Zealand, which conſiſts, almoſt entirely, of wet, heavy, low, clayey land, is remarkable for producing the beſt <hi>flax</hi> of any part of Europe; whilſt the gravelly, lighter ſoils produce <hi>flax,</hi> fine, indeed, in quality, but in very ſmall and uncertain quantities. And in thoſe countries they have double, perhaps treble, the moiſt drizzling weather that we have in theſe colonies, though not ſuch heavy ſhowers, or the ſun ſo parching as with us.</p>
            <p>SUCH of our lands, only, as are freſh, rich, deep, and ſtrong, and have a low, moiſt ſituation, can give reaſonable hopes for a tolerable crop of <hi>flax;</hi> and even on theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſpots, we know from experience, that the ſeaſon muſt continue moiſt and warm; for, if it proves dry, which ofteneſt happens, the <hi>flax</hi> is ſeldom worth the pulling, either for its ſeed or bark.</p>
            <p>WEEDS, which are deſtructive to all crops, are more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſo to <hi>flax,</hi> which ſuffers greatly from them, in its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as quantity; nor is it abſurd to conceive, that weeds and dry weather ſhould prove the bane of this crop, when we reflect that, from its firſt ſhoot it continues a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time very weak and low, its leaf ſmall and narrow, affording ſcarce any ſhade, leaving the ground expoſed to the powerful action of a ſcorching ſun, which exhales and dries up
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014022_0006_0F92ADF8DB31F5B8"/>the moiſture ſo neceſſary to the ſupport of the <hi>flax,</hi> and puſhes into vegetation the ſeeds of much hardier plants.</p>
            <p>FROM experience, then, we have reaſon to deſpair of raiſing flax in ſufficient quantities to anſwer all our demands. Our climate is not moiſt and dropping enough, and our ſoil, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is too ſandy and dry, to rely on <hi>flax</hi> entirely, or indeed principally.</p>
            <p>A TOTAL neglect of <hi>flax</hi> is not intended to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; where it ſucceeds tolerably, let the raiſing of it be continued, but the author hopes to be able to ſhow, that, where the cultivation of <hi>flax</hi> cannot be carried on to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, HEMP may be ſubſtituted in its room, and will effectually anſwer, eſpecially in coarſe manufactures, every purpoſe to which <hi>flax</hi> hath been applied. Indeed nothing but a total ignorance of the very great eaſe, advantage, and certainty, with which HEMP may be raiſed, and of its moſt valuable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, could ſo long have prevented it from becoming gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cultivated for domeſtic purpoſes.</p>
            <p>BENEFICENT nature, which has made this plant ſo uſeful, hath alſo moſt indulgently fuited it to almoſt every <hi>climate,</hi> as well as to every ſort of <hi>ſoil;</hi> for we find it raiſed in ſo many countries of Europe, as well as in America, lying under ſuch different latitudes, that it, moſt aſſuredly, may be cultivated, with great advantage, from the ſhores of Florida to the banks of St. Laurence.</p>
            <p>UNDOUBTEDLY one climate, or ſoil, may ſuit this plant better than another; <hi>this</hi> colony may produce better HEMP for <hi>linen,</hi> whilſt <hi>that</hi> produces better for the rope-walk: For though, on ſtrong, fat, cold grounds, the HEMP may be ſtronger and fitter for ſome purpoſes, yet we may be aſſured, that ſuch HEMP as grows on a light, dry, well cultivated ſoil, even if it doth not grow ſo high, or ſtrong, will be fitter to anſwer our domeſtic
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014022_0007_0F92ADF9D98E86B8"/>wants. We may therefore reaſonably imagine, that, in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climates, our own for inſtance, eſpecially in the lower parts of theſe provinces, and of the ſouthern colonies, where the lands in general are light and warm, they are properly adapted to raiſe this plant to the greateſt perfection.</p>
            <p>A MOST peculiar advantage attending the culture of this plant is, that it may be repeatedly ſown on the ſame piece of ground, experience having ſhown that any dry land, ſo that it is properly prepared with <hi>manure,</hi> will produce much heavier crops than the richeſt freſh lands, and that the ſame piece of ground, aſſiſted with a moderate quantity of <hi>manure,</hi> will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of being ſucceſſively ſown, probably to the end of time, without any diminution of crops.</p>
            <p>HOW eaſy therefore is it in every man's power to prepare, even on the meaneſt land, a portion of ground ſufficient to raiſe what is neceſſary to ſupply, at leaſt, his family wants? It will not require a fourth, perhaps not a tenth of the ground neceſſary to produce an equal quantity of <hi>flax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE heard of three hundred and a half of clean broken <hi>flax</hi> raiſed from one acre, but we commonly put up with near a third leſs, and eſtimate that as no bad crop.</p>
            <p>FRESH lands, ſown with HEMP, will produce from four to eight hundred of clean broken HEMP; old ground, duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, will yield, according to the ſeaſons, from half a ton, to twelve or fourteen hundred on the acre. I know a piece of upland, which has been ſown with HEMP, ſucceſſively, for at leaſt ten years paſt, produce, in a favourable ſeaſon, at the rate of twenty-four hundred per acre; ſo powerful are the effects of a proper cultivation!</p>
            <p>HEMP alſo produces a moſt certain crop, it being by no means ſubject to thoſe accidents to which <hi>flax</hi> is expoſed, from the uncertainty of ſeaſons; rain, it is true, is neceſſary at the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014022_0008_0F92ADFBECCB8780"/>time of ſowing, and it will indeed be ſomething extraordinary if there doth not happen, during the courſe of ten weeks, (for ſo long the ſeaſon for ſowing HEMP continues) a ſhower ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this purpoſe; for its vegetation is ſo quick, that, in a very few days after it is ſown, its leaves entirely cover and ſhade the ground, protect it from the ſcorching ſun, enable it to retain the moiſture, and prevent the ſeeds of the common weeds from ſprouting. From this time the dews alone will prove ſufficient to bring it to perfect maturity, and, indeed, heavier crops are produced on ground highly manured, in dry ſeaſons, than in over wet years.</p>
            <p>THE more we conſider the nature and properties of HEMP, and reflect how happily it is adapted to our climate and ſoil, the more reaſon there is to wiſh that the inhabitants of theſe colonies would avail themſelves of its advantages.</p>
            <p>IF we had not this invaluable plant to rely on, we ought <hi>now</hi> to bend our attention to manufactures; but, with it, after a trial, we ſhall moſt certainly find it our intereſt to continue making our coarſe linens, notwithſtanding the moſt perfect harmony ſhould be again reſtored between Great-Britain and America; for, as the greateſt part of the coarſe <hi>linens</hi> that hath been conſumed in theſe colonies theſe many years paſt, hath been imported from foreign countries, and there pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for our uſe, and paid for in ſpecie by the Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, a proſecution of this manufacture would not interfere with the intereſt of our mother country.</p>
            <p>THE baſis of the moſt uſeful manufactures is, with us, full as certain as in any other part of the world, and the groſs materials are excellent, and procured in plenty with very little labour. Proviſions are good, plenty, and cheap; either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage would be ſufficient encouragement, in any other country, to begin manufacturing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:014022_0009_0F92ADFC567EB290"/>
THE manufacturers, who in Great-Britain are now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to ſuch a pitch of ſkill and dexterity, were once as ignorant in the arts of manufacturing as we are at preſent. They had rivals and difficulties far greater than ours to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, but their induſtry and perſeverance have ſurmounted every obſtacle; why then ought we to deſpair of attaining a ſufficient degree of facility in working up theſe coarſer materials, where ſo little art and ſkill will be wanted? We cannot pretend to rival Great Britain in ſuch manufactures as require much time, aſſiduity, and attention to bring to perfection; nor is this a diſadvantage to us: Satisfied in our preſent <hi>infant</hi> ſtate, with manufacturing thoſe articles that are moſt neceſſary for preſerving our exiſtence, we can <hi>yet</hi> employ our hands to better advantage in raiſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a variety of produce, ſufficient to pay for theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities which we want in return from the mother country, which will turn to the mutual advantage of both.</p>
            <p>THE goodneſs, and conſequently the real value of the coarſeſt manufactures, depends principally on the quantity of the finer part of the material of which it is compoſed, rather than the workmanſhip; in this we ſhall have a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantage, for we can afford a much greater proportion of the fine part of the material, in our coarſe linens, than can be afforded in Europe, where the cloſe working the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials conſtitutes a great part of the profit.</p>
            <p>NOTHING is wanted but the countenance, example, and encouragement of people of influence; and docility, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and induſtry in the poor.</p>
            <p>INSTEAD of the number of negroes amongſt us being, as imagined by ſome, an impediment to manufactures, they might eaſily be made very uſeful, in forwarding the work; they muſt do as directed, and even ſlavery itſelf, we find, in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014022_0010_0F92AE00CA7E5720"/>numberleſs inſtances, has not extinguiſhed their ſpirit to excel.</p>
            <p>HUMANITY and the intereſt of the maſter bid us treat the female negroes with lenity and indulgence, at leaſt during their pregnancy, and whilſt they are ſuckling their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in the latter univerſally, and often in the former ſtate, they are too feeble to labour conſtantly in the field: Had they not better, for themſelves and maſters, at ſuch times be employed in ſpinning?</p>
            <p>WE have generally a good deal of weather in winter when little or nothing can be done in the field; our evenings are long, and labouring people in Europe imploy the hours before bed time in working on ſome manufacture; we have many white, as well as negro children, who have ſtrength and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs enough to ſpin, wind yarn, pick wool, cotton, &amp;c. though now, becauſe not able to labour in the field, kept en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely idle. If the young and the weak, and, in the winter evenings and bad weather, when they cannot labour out, all the working hands were employed in dreſſing, ſpinning, and weaving HEMP into coarſe linen, what family need purchaſe imported oſnabrigs?</p>
            <p>BY a proper diſtribution of our time, and employing the almoſt uſeleſs and burthenſome parts of our families, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where there are a number of negroes, the buſineſs of the plantation or farm may go on as profitably as at preſent, and the neceſſary coarſe cloathing be fabricated at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>MANUFACTURES cannot be carried to perfection in an inſtant, nor was planting or farming, yet this country has made great advances lately in the latter, nor has any country, with half the advantages of this, failed in the former.</p>
            <p>ARTS, manufactures, and commerce, only, can ſupport mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people, in a narrow compaſs, and numbers will not
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014022_0011_0F92AE02E2E11F78"/>be wanting where theſe are cultivated with vigour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; nor are proofs wanting of the amazing effects of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry when ſupported and encouraged by liberty; for wherever there is employment and protection for people, there will population thrive.</p>
            <p>WE are certainly now in a ſituation to make a beginning; when we can ſupply ourſelves with coarſe ſubſtantial cloathing, our hands will become more numerous, both from our natural increaſe, and emigrations from Europe, and we ſhall advance towards perfection by degrees; but what is moſt wanted ſhould be firſt fully accompliſhed; by ſuch means, and ſuch only, can we become populous or truly rich.</p>
            <p>IT is a certain fact, though not attended to, that the landed intereſt will be moſt benefited by ſuch improvements; the value of land depending ſolely on population, and riſing or falling as the people are numerous or otherwiſe; the landed gentlemen ought, therefore, as well for their own intereſt as that of the public, to be aſſiduous in forwarding manufactures, and conſequently population.</p>
            <p>PREMIUMS, or perſonal encouragement, to ſuch as may deſerve well, together with bounties judiciouſly propoſed, might be of ſingular uſe in promoting improvements, and the manufacture of linen in particular; their good effects have been wonderfully felt in Scotland, and in Ireland, by the dint of which the linen manufacture, in both kingdoms, has been brought to the greateſt perfection, and has proved of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt advantage to both.</p>
            <p>THE true intereſt of a ſtate is not always to inſiſt upon too uncommon perfection in its fabrics; that manufacture, for which there is the greateſt demand, ought always to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in preference to any other, and, as we want larger
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014022_0012_0F92AE031D8DB068"/>quantities of coarſe than of fine linens, the encouragement ſhould be directed to that end.</p>
            <p>A MANUFACTURE, thus diſperſed and encouraged, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate itſelf into every family, and, from its natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with agriculture, it ſeems peculiarly adapted to the country, and muſt neceſſarily concur with it in increaſing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, and prove a ſource of many advantages to theſe colonies.</p>
            <p>CONSCIOUS that, in the following eſſay, little is advanced but what has reſulted from experiments, the author can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with the greater confidence, ſubmit it to the impartial public; from the importance alone of the ſubject he preſumes to engage their attention, for, deficient as he is in point of abilities, and little accuſtomed to writing, he claims no merit but that of wiſhing to do his duty; far from flattering himſelf that he has exhauſted a ſubject ſo intereſting, and ſo extenſive, he will think himſelf happy if his weak efforts ſhall contribute to excite men of greater abilities to take under their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a ſubject, from the cultivation of which ſuch great and important advantages will, moſt probably, be derived to the community.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> A Deſcription of the Plant.</head>
               <p>HEMP is commonly diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts, one that grows wild, the other produced by cultivation; this latter is male and female in different plants, the male, bearing the flower, is commonly called <hi>fimble hemp,</hi> and the other, bearing the ſeed, <hi>karle hemp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE root of HEMP, produced by cultivation, is from three to eight inches long, according to the quality of the land, and the quantity of ſeed ſown thereon. It is of a whitiſh colour, undivided and running to a point, having fibres only on two lines, exactly oppoſite to each other, when not ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened for want of room. The ſtalk is round, from the root for ſome little way up, it then aſſumes a fluted quadrangular form, is hollow, covered with a greeniſh bark, compoſed of filaments; this bark, as it appears upon the ſtalk, forms a knotty, rough, or prickly covering to it. Theſe knots and prickles are mere excreſcences of gum, which ſerve to glue the fibres of the bark together, and to cover, ſtrengthen, and protect them, till they arrive at full maturity; at proper diſtances, this bark is ſecured, from place to place, by ſix ſmall faſtenings, which keep it cloſe to the ſtem, like ſo many little nails ranged on the circumference of the ſame circle.</p>
               <p>ITS length and thickneſs are various, owing to many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſes. A grain of <hi>hemp-ſeed,</hi> ſown by itſelf in a ſoil that agrees with it, commonly produces a ſtalk large and firm, with many branches, and looks like a little tree. If it is of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014022_0014_0F92AE091E48CAD8"/>that ſex which produces the ſeed, it will yield a great number of grains, and thoſe very good; but its bark, being too hard and coarſe, is only fit for the rope-walk: on the contrary, the due quantity of ſeed, ſown in a field that is properly prepared for the purpoſe, produces ſtalks that are ſtreight, ſlender, without branches, and the bark of ſuch, being ſmooth, fine, and ſoft, is valuable for many other uſes. The leaves grow two and two oppoſite to one another, they are divided into many ſegments, being oblong, ſharp pointed, jagged, full of veins, of a deep green, rough to the touch, and of a ſtrong ſmell, that affects the head.</p>
               <p>THE flowers, that grow on the male ſtalk, iſſue from the <hi>aloe</hi> of the leaves, are of a purple colour without, and whitiſh on the inſide; theſe flowers are not followed by any ſeed; and, on the contrary, the ſeed, on the ſtalks that produce it, is never preceded by any flower.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER the order of nature may be in the vegetation of this plant, both the male and female ſtalks are produced indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately from the grains of ſeed that grow on the ſame ſtalk: and the difference cannot be known till they come to bloſſom.</p>
               <p>THE ſeed grows, in a great number of bunches, at the end of the ſtalk and branches; this, when come to maturity, forces the membranous capſulae, or outer huſks, which contain it, to open, and diſcover a round ſmooth grain, ſomewhat flattened, containing, under a thin ſhell, of a ſhining light grey colour, a white tender kernel; this kernel is encloſed in a green film, or thin covering, and conſiſts of two lobes that terminate in the germ, from which proceeds both the root and bud of the future plant. Its ſubſtance is ſweet to the taſte, of a ſtrong ſmell when freſh; of a fat, ſpongious, gummy or oily matter; being very porous, or open, it moſt readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impreſſion of heat and humidity, which tranſmit to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014022_0015_0F92AE09F48F1400"/>it the nutritious juices, ſupplied by a fat well laboured ſoil, and occaſion it inſtantly to ſwell and ſpring up as ſoon as it is ſown; the two lobes unfolding, form two thick, green, oval ſhaped leaves, opening a paſſage through the earth for the tender bud of the germ, which ſprings up at the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; after a quick germination the plant ſhoots up, its fibres are formed, and attain to maturity, the oil and gum being the principles of their ſtrength and union.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the land proper for <hi>HEMP;</hi> and the methods of preparing the ground.</head>
               <p>IT is an opinion generally received, that HEMP can only be raiſed on ſuch lands as are <hi>naturally</hi> the beſt and richeſt; this being a crop that requires a great deal of ſuſtenance, there is no doubt but that it certainly may be raiſed on ſuch lands to moſt advantage, yet experience hath demonſtrated, that HEMP is one of thoſe plants which may be cultivated in many different ſituations, and in almoſt every different ſoil, no plant yielding, in our climate, a crop more certain or more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.</p>
               <p>RICH, dry bottom lands are thoſe where HEMP has hitherto been principally raiſed amongſt us; but rich ſwamp well drained, high lands, either loamy or light, ſo that they are rich and made mellow, will all, in their natural ſtate, bring this plant to great perfection.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is moſt probable that this plant may be cultivated, to great advantage, on ſuch dry marſhes as are, either, from their natural ſituation, or by means of drains and banks, out of danger from inundations. This is but conjecture; however, as there are in every creek and bay conſiderable quantities of marſh, it certainly would be worth the trouble for the poſſeſſors to give it a fair trial, by having it properly broke up and thoroughly rotted; ſhould the hemp fail, it could be laid down in graſs to great advantage.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:014022_0016_0F92AE0AB8C831A0"/>
THOUGH moſt ſituations are ſuitable for HEMP, yet, as it requires a vaſt quantity of nouriſhment, and in a few crops exhauſts the richeſt ſoil, the land intended for it ought not only to be the beſt that can be procured, but, to inſure a good crop, a quantity of <hi>manure,</hi> proportioned to the quality of the ground, ought to be added; for experience ſhews us, that lands highly manured amply repay every extraordinary trouble and expence of this kind, by producing double the quantity that is uſually raiſed on the richeſt lands in their natural ſtate.</p>
               <p>IT may therefore be moſt adviſable, for thoſe who propoſe to cultivate this plant, to ſet apart a piece of level land, not too low, far leſs a wet ſituation, but convenient and beſt adapted to be improved. This piece of ground ought, by the aſſiſtance of manure and other compoſitions, to be as highly prepared as poſſible; when this is once accompliſhed, a very little dreſſing will be requiſite to keep it in proper tilth, and it will then admit of being ſown without any diminution of <hi>crops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A DEEP light mould, which gives freedom for the fibres to paſs every way, is abſolutely requiſite for HEMP, but at the ſame time warmth is ſo eſſentially neceſſary, that it will grow better in a poorer ſoil, that is warm and mellow, than in a very rich one that is cold and wet. For which reaſon, ſand becomes a moſt eſſential ingredient in HEMP grounds, and therefore, rich, light, dry ſoils ought to be preferred.</p>
               <p>THOSE lands which are of a deep, black, or duſky loams, as they conſiſt of a proportion of ſand, with a large quantity of pure mould, will be eaſieſt, and beſt cultivated.</p>
               <p>STIFF or clayey lands, though they may not be ſo eaſily cultivated in the beginning as the poor ſandy lands, yet, after they are once prepared by labour and proper <hi>manure,</hi> will be eaſily kept in order, as they will require leſs <hi>manure,</hi> and laſt much longer than the very poor ſandy ſoils, which, from their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014022_0017_0F92AE0B56BB65A0"/>texture, are but ill calculated to retain the manure; therefore, when this ſort of ſandy land is intended for HEMP, that this waſte of the moſt eſſential parts of the manure may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented as much as poſſible, it will be proper that its nature be changed by means of ſuch bodies or compoſitions as will tend beſt to effect this purpoſe, for which clay is peculiarly uſeful, and particularly ſo when half burnt, or mixed with lime, which conveys fertility, and corrects the bad qualities of the clay, by rendering it more friable, or its parts more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united, and therefore the more readily mixed with the ſand.</p>
               <p>THE ſea owſe, that is the ſettling of the tides on the ſhores between high and low water mark, is an excellent manure for looſe ſandy ſoils; the cleanings of ponds and ditches, as they conſiſt of the putrid animal and vegetable bodies, mixed with the rich earth depoſited there by rains, &amp;c. becomes likewiſe here of conſiderable benefit: The ſame may be ſaid of the mud in rivers, and creeks or bays, where, by the ſtagnation of the water, the rich particles of the ſoils carried down by the floods, have time to ſubſide. But of all correctors or alteratives for ſandy ſoils, none is preferable to <hi>marl,</hi> where it can be had. In ſhort, all bodies or compoſitions, which tend to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence or ſtability to the ſoil, are proper in this caſe; for, by intermixing thoſe ſubſtance with the ſand, its nature becomes changed from a ſandy to a loamy ſoil, in which ſtate it is better calculated to retain the manure, which it may be afterwards neceſſary to give it, as the nutritive particles thereof will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſo readily waſhed thorough, nor exhaled by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſun.</p>
               <p>WHEN lands which incline to be clayey or ſtiff are intended for HEMP, they ought to be well broke up, and then thrown up in ridges, as high and narrow as poſſible, which may be moſt readily done with a good plough, by throwing one furrow to the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014022_0018_0F92AE0C2F1E3D98"/>back of another, and this work ought to be done in the fall, before the froſt ſets in; the benefit that will ariſe from this operation is too conſiderable to be neglected; in this ſituation the glebe is beſt expoſed to the action of the following ſeaſon, the rains, the ſnows, and froſts of winter penetrate to the center, thereby opening and diſſolving its parts, by which much of your future labour will be abridged, for, when this method has been executed properly, and in time, the ground will be mellow and in good order.</p>
               <p>THOSE, who may not be furniſhed with ploughs fit for this purpoſe, ought to have the ground well dug over with the ſpade, or the hoes, and either thrown up into ridges, as before directed, or into high narrow hills, ſimilar to thoſe of the firſt hoeing for tobacco.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as the ſevere ſeaſon is over, in February or March, the ground may be levelled, which is ſooneſt and beſt done by running an iron toothed harrow once or twice over it; ſoon after this it ought to be ploughed over, though, immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ploughed, the <hi>manure</hi> you intend to put upon it ſhould be carried out and ſpread. This point of time is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as the nutritive particles, with which the <hi>manure</hi> abounds, will have full opportunity to be ſufficiently diſſolved and blended with the ſtaple, before they can ſuſtain any diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>manure,</hi> or compoſt, when laid on at this time, ſhould be well rotted or mellow; it will then be in ſuch a ſtate as to mix freely with the ſoil; if the dung is new, it will be far better to plough it down in the fall.
<p>Stable dung, rotten wood, ſaw-duſt, tanners bark, aſhes, the dung of ſheep, hogs, pigeons and poultry, are excellent <hi>manures</hi> for ſtiff land; as cow dung, rotten wood, the bottoms of wood pits and rotten tanners bark are ſuitable for lighter ſoils. Dung, which has been blended with other ingredients, and mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where it could lie ſecured from the weather until it becomes mellow and rotted, is far preferable to that which is freſh.</p>
                  </note> From this time, it may lie till the ſeaſon for ſowing arrives, when it is neceſſary to plough it again, not only that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014022_0019_0F92AE0E82A97CF0"/>ſuch weeds as may have ſprung up may be ploughed down, but that the dung may be more equally blended with the earth. If this ploughing ſhould not bring your ground into proper tilth, for it is requiſite that as few clods be left as poſſible, and that your field be light and looſe as may be, it will be proper to run the plough through it once more, though, before it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives this ploughing, it is adviſable to have the lumps, or clods firſt broken in pieces, either with a wooden mallet with a long handle, or with the eye of the hoes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE ſeaſon for ſowing this ſeed rarely begins ſooner, in our part of the country, than the beginning of May, the weather ſeldom being ſettled till then, and continues till about the middle, or even the laſt of June. However the time of ſowing ought to vary, according to the difference of weather which is often times very conſiderable in the ſame province, and even under the ſame latitude, the ſpring proving later as we leave the ocean, and approach towards the mountains.</p>
               <p>IT may be neceſſary to obſerve, that as the HEMP which is firſt ſown, provided it does not meet with any accident, moſt commonly, yields the heavieſt crop, thoſe lands which are high or dry ſhould be ſown as ſoon as the ſeaſon will permit, provided they are in order; thoſe which are low or moiſt, as they often cannot be got in order ſo ſoon as the uplands, may lie a little later. It is however by no means eligible to ſow this ſeed, till you can reaſonably expect that no danger is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from the froſt; nor is it, by any means, proper to ſow when the ground is very <hi>dry,</hi> or that there is an appearance
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014022_0020_0F92AE0F37189570"/>of a continuance of dry weather, in either of theſe caſes, it will be far more prudent to delay the ſowing for a little, until the ſeaſon is more advanced, or proves more mild and favourable; for HEMP ſown, eſpecially on upland, when the ground is dry, or the weather cold, ſeldom proves good unleſs rain happens to fall immediately. In ſhort, as the ſucceſs of your crop, in a great meaſure, depends upon the ſtate of the weather at the time of ſowing the ſeed, attention ought to be given to ſeize the moſt favourable ſeaſon, and, as it has been obſerved that early ſown HEMP generally thrives beſt, provided that the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon does not prove too untoward, it is therefore prudent to have the ground made ready by the time that the weather is expected to ſet in mild and ſettled; the firſt opportunity ought then to be taken to ſow the ſeed, either immediately before a rain, or as ſoon after as the ground will admit; ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the ſhower ought to be preferred, only becauſe the ſeed will be covered much better and more equally when the ground is dry, than when it is wet: immediately before ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ground muſt be laid level with the harrow, and the beſt and quickeſt method of covering the ſeed is, either with a ſhort toothed ſingle harrow, or a bunch of bruſh, which ought to be dragged once or twice over the land, and, directly after, a wooden roller of about fifteen or eighteen inches diameter ought to be run over it<note n="*" place="bottom">A wooden roller, of fifteen or ſixteen inches diameter, by means of a box fixed on the frame, may be encreaſed to any weight, by loading the box with ſtones. This is an inſtrument that no farm ought to be with out; a light roller run over the wheat in the ſpring, as ſoon as it gets tolerably dry, after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere froſts are paſt, is of very conſiderable benefit to the crop; it is alſo of great advantage to graſs lands and meadow grounds.</note>; when there is only a ſmall piece of ground ſown, the ſeed may as well be covered with a garden rake. Any inſtrument that covers this ſeed unequally is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014022_0021_0F92AE0FD75BCC20"/>proper, for as this plant ſhoots inſtantly, thoſe ſeeds that lie ſhallow will be up before thoſe which are covered deep, and as its growth, in ſeaſonable weather, is moſt rapid, that which comes up firſt is very apt to keep that under which is later in ſhooting,</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the <hi>SEED,</hi> with the quantities proper to be ſown.</head>
               <p>THE uſual quantity of HEMP, where the hemp is intended for the rope-walk, ſeldom exceeds one buſhel on the acre, which is rather too little, for, where the land is in tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable tilth, not leſs than one buſhel and a half of good ſeed ought to be put on each acre; but, when HEMP is intended for domeſtic purpoſes, there ought not to be leſs than two buſhels of ſeed on each acre, and when the land is perfectly good and mellow, two buſhels and an half, or even three buſhels, will be found a far better proportion. Upon the whole, an allowance muſt be made for the difference of ſoils equally well laboured; a good ſoil will afford nutriment for a large quantity of ſeed, and bring the plants to the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whilſt a like portion of ſeed would dwindle on a poorer ſoil. Upon land which is highly cultivated, and in the beſt order, even the above quantity of three buſhels may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, without any detriment, or diminution to the crop, and often with great benefit.</p>
               <p>IN recommending the above quantity of ſeed, it is ſuppoſed to be good, clean, and freſh, for none but ſeed of the laſt crop ought to be uſed, provided ſuch is to be had; when this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained, ſeed of two years, though not ſo good, may
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014022_0022_0F92AE10CD43B8B0"/>be tried, and if it has been well cured, and carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, may chance to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>IT is an eaſy matter, for thoſe acquainted with this plant, to diſtinguiſh good ſeed from bad; when the ſeed ſeems light, with a number of white and greeniſh coloured grains amongſt it, which, when cracked, are found either entirely empty, or to contain but a ſmall ſhrivelled kernel, it is not to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon: on the contrary, that ſeed which is heavy, of a bright grey colour, and when cracked appearing full of a white tender kernel, is aſſuredly good, provided that the male or flower plants were not drawn out till the proper time, this alſo may be known from a careful examination of the kernel, for if the ſeeds have been duly impregnated by the <hi>farina,</hi> or duſt from the flower, the germ, or future plant, will appear to an accurate obſerver, particularly with the aid of a magnifying glaſs, lying with its bud between, and a little tendril, which pierces the ground to form the root, running along the two lobes of the kernel; however, the beſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt method to know the quality of the ſeed, is to ſow a ſmall quantity on a border of light good earth, and from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ſprings up, the goodneſs of the ſeed may be very nearly aſcertained.</p>
               <p>THE uſual method of ſowing this ſeed is by broad-caſt, but, in whatever way it is done, all imaginable care muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to diſtribute the ſeed as equally over the ground as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: and as all kinds of birds, but more particularly pigeons and turtle doves, are remarkably fond of this ſeed, and will, if they are permitted to frequent the ground, deſtroy great quantities of it, even during ſome few days after it is ſprung up; it is neceſſary to keep them off until it has gathered ſtrength,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014022_0023_0F92AE116ACE5FC0"/>and the leaves become expanded <note n="*" place="bottom">The time of the birds feeding upon the ſeed is principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſun-riſe: after this they are leſs ravenous, till toward even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they feed again till near ſun-ſet.</note>: from this time no further attention is requiſite, until the ſeaſon for pulling, unleſs it is to obſerve that your incloſure be ſufficient to keep out ſuch animals as might trample or break it down.</p>

               <p>IN about ſix or eight weeks after ſowing, according as the ſeaſon has been more or leſs favourable, the plant which bears the flower begins to bloſſom; ſometimes this happens when the plant is not much above two feet high; the HEMP, when this is the caſe, ſeldom grows much higher, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues weak; this may be owing to different cauſes, but it moſt commonly proceeds either from the weakneſs of the ground, or from the HEMP having been ſown in dry cold weather. At other times it riſes to the height of four, and oftener five feet before it bloſſoms, and grows greatly after. The plant which bears the flower uſually riſes above that which produces the grain, and, by the time that it gets in bloſſom, is generally ſeveral inches above it.</p>
               <p>THIS ſuperiority, in the order of nature, may be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, when we conſider, that the powder which iſſues from the flower of the male, ſerves to convey fertility to the grain on the female ſtalks that produce the ſeed. When the HEMP gets in full bloom, the flowers are loaded with the <hi>farina</hi> or duſt in ſuch abundance, that, upon the firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the morning breeze, it appears like a fog, or a cloud of ſmoke floating over the HEMP field.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:014022_0024_0F92AE12478FB6F8"/>
AS ſoon as this phaenomenon begins to diſappear, and the bloſſom to drop, the HEMP is at full maturity, and we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately begin to pull it.</p>
               <p>THIS is beſt and eaſieſt done when the ground happens to be tolerably dry. When you begin to gather the HEMP, it will be expedient that each perſon employed clear before him as many feet of ground as the HEMP is high, in order that, after pulling it up by the roots, and beating off the earth that ſticks to them, by ſtriking the roots againſt his foot, he may conveniently ſpread it on the ground from whence he has pulled it, where it muſt lie until it is quite dry; it is then to be tied up in bundles, and put under ſome cover, or carefully ſtacked in the ground, in which caſe it muſt be well thatched with ſtraw, to prevent any wet from getting to it. Under this ſhelter it remains till about the middle of November, when it is ſpread out to rot; it is laid out in rows, taking care that it is ſpread ſo thin as that it may get equally wet, and dry nearly alike; it will be prudent to ſpread it out in ſome incloſure, for example on winter grain, that it may not be moleſted by the hogs or other animals; from this time it generally lies till towards the beginning of February, and ſometimes a month later, before it is fit to be taken up, this however depends on the weather; ſhould the winter prove moiſt and open, and the HEMP happened to meet with ſome ſhowers whilſt it lay out to dry when it was pulled, in that caſe it may get rotted by the laſt of December or middle of January. The proper time for taking it up may eaſily be known by cracking a few of the ſtalks, or breaking a handful in the brake, and, if the bark is found to ſeparate readily from the ſtems, the HEMP ought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be taken up, which muſt however be done in clear weather, that the HEMP, when lifted, may be as dry as poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:014022_0025_0F92AE144BD0DB48"/>
WHEN it is intended that the HEMP ſhould immediately be put through the brake, it is commonly ſet up in the field in ſmall parcels, the root end down, gathering them together and binding them at the top, in which poſition it is not apt to get injured, till the weather turns warm; but when it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to brake it directly, it ſhould be put under cover, ſo as to be entirely ſafe from the weather.</p>
               <p>THIS is the method generally uſed in this country, in place of watering, and is called <hi>winter rotting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN HEMP is intended to be watered, it is tied with the ſhort HEMP rather towards the upper end, in ſmall bundles as it is pulled, ſetting up about ſix bundles in a parcel, root end down, ſpreading them wide at the bottoms, but preſſing them cloſe at the tops; in three or four days, if the weather is good, it will be dry enough to put into the water, where it lies ſeldom leſs than nine days, but oftentimes before the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is effected, ten or twelve days; warm weather forwards the watering, and cold retards it; however, as the ſooner that the watering is effected there is the leſs danger of the HEMP being hurt, it is better to put the HEMP into the water as ſoon as may be after it is pulled, and whilſt it is yet green; in this ſtate it ſeldom or ever requires to be longer in the water than five days, but it ought to be obſerved, that this is in Auguſt, our month for pulling, when the weather is generally at the warmeſt.</p>
               <p>BEFORE placing the HEMP in the water, it will be neceſſary to take care that the bundles have not been made too large, and that the HEMP is tolerably even at the roots, and, when the HEMP happens to be very tall, it will be proper to bind it with a ſingle ſtalk or two near to the roots, as well as near the top; care however muſt had not to bind it too cloſe, an error, <hi>here,</hi> being of more conſequence than may be imagined, the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014022_0026_0F92AE1486112190"/>watering never ſucceeding thoroughly when the bundles are hard tied, the fermentation going on unequally in the ſeveral parts, as they are more or leſs confined.</p>
               <p>THESE precautions being uſed, there is little danger of waſte from the bundles breaking or tangling, and, that the HEMP may be prevented from getting quite to the bottom, and not only be placed, but preſerved in ſome order in the water, it will be proper to lay two or three ſtraight poles, or ſaplings, parallel in the water, ſo as the two outſide pieces may be about three or four feet aſunder, and, for greater ſecurity, they ought to be joined with a ſmall croſs piece near to each end: acroſs this frame the HEMP muſt be laid, interlocking the tops, and placing the butts out, after this manner it is to be piled on (ſinking it under the water) till it is within a few inches of the ſurface, it ſhould then be covered over with ſtraw, or green boughs, to keep the ſun from getting to the HEMP, and over this ſhould be laid ſome logs of wood, or a few fence rails, to keep it under the water.</p>
               <p>WHEN we conſider that the effect produced by watering, being a diſſolution of a certain quantity of that gum, or gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſubſtance which ſerves to join the fibres of the HEMP to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and attach them to the ſtem, we are apt to imagine that a fine clear ſtream would be fitter to accompliſh this end, becauſe, at the ſame time that it diſſolved, it would alſo purge and waſh it from that gum and filth, thereby leaving the HEMP in a purer ſtate, but experience, againſt which there is no reaſoning, convinces us, that the propereſt places for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering HEMP, are deep ditches, or pits of ſtagnated water, ſuch as mill-ponds, or deep pools, where the water is ſeldom or never changed. The more ſtill and putrid the eaſier it fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and penetrates the HEMP more quickly, as well as more effectually, and, though that which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:014022_0027_0F92AE168B224BC8"/>limpid ſtream will appear far whiter, at the brake, than that which is watered in ſtagnated water, yet, upon minute examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the firſt will be found inferior in quality to this laſt, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in a manner exhauſted and dead as it were, and of a pale white, whilſt the other appears with a fine lively gloſs, with a bluiſh caſt which never quits it; for the cloth made of this HEMP moſt readily attains a perfect degree of the pureſt white, whilſt the cloth made of the river watered HEMP, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the efforts of art, will ſtill retain a yellowiſh caſt, and appear of a fainty diſagreeable colour, which never quits it, and without great care, will increaſe as the linen is uſed.</p>
               <p>SUCH perſons as have not natural watering places convenient to them, may, with great eaſe and very ſmall expence, have a pit dug for the purpoſe, about eight or nine feet in breadth, ſo deep as to have full five feet water, and in length, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quantity of HEMP intended to be watered, and it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that this pit may be filled with HEMP two or three times in one ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>THIS pit, if poſſible, ought to be in ſuch a place, that no floods, or ſtreams of muddy foul water can flow into it, but at the ſame time ſo ſituated, that a ſmall quantity of ſoft water, free from any mineral, may, when clear, be let into the pit, upon any occaſion, and it will be very proper that this little ſtream of water ſhould, during the time the HEMP is in the pit, be permitted to run through it; if the water but trickles or juſt runs it will be ſufficient; it is only wanted to effect a little change in the water in the pit, near the ſurface, which, elſe, from the exceſſive power of the ſun at this ſeaſon, would be much warmer at the top, and conſequently the HEMP there would be ſooner watered than at the bottom. Where no freſh water can with convenience be admitted, the pit may be ſhaded by means of a few more green boughs, which may be
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014022_0028_0F92AE16EF6B01F0"/>thrown over it ſo as to obſtruct the rays of the ſun from the water.</p>
               <p>AS ſuch places may be made with little trouble, ſo no water has yet been diſcovered more proper for this purpoſe, and it will be found that the HEMP, watered in them the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year, will be preferable in colour and quality, to that of the firſt, which proves, that the older and longer the water has remained in theſe pools, without being entirely changed, the fitter it is to anſwer our expectations. It is certain, the longer the water ſettles or ſtands the ſofter it proves, and the more kindly it ferments with the ſaponacious juices of plants; and to fit theſe pools the better and ſooner for the purpoſe, it will be neceſſary to have them dug two or three months before they are uſed, and to throw therein, to rot, any ſucculent weeds or plants, which may be taken out immediately when the HEMP is ready to be laid in, by which means the water will be ſtirred up from the bottom, and mixed with that at top.—As undoubtedly the future qualities of the HEMP depend greatly upon the manner in which this proceſs is performed, it therefore becomes of conſequence to attend to the different methods; next to the HEMP which has been watered in the pits, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience gives the preference to that which can be ſafely rotted by the dew in the fall, its ſtrength and colour being little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that which is watered in the pits, and ſuperior in both to that which is winter rotted, which nevertheleſs ought to be preferred before watering in a ſtream, therefore ſuch as do not chuſe to be at the trouble of providing pits ought to prefer the method of dew rotting. The principal danger at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this method, is from the too great heat of the ſun, which is apt to injure the HEMP, if ſpread out too early in the fall, and therefore is beſt guarded againſt, by not laying it out
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014022_0029_0F92AE17585819F8"/>till towards the firſt of October, which will yet leave time to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot the HEMP before the ſnows ſet in.</p>
               <p>IN whatever manner this operation is effected, we know, that the HEMP is watered ſufficiently, when the bark parts freely from the ſtem, therefore, if the HEMP has been put into the water quite green, as directed above, it will be neceſſary to draw out every day, beginning at the fourth at furtheſt, a few ſtalks, which are to be well dried, if then the bark is found to ſeparate freely from the ſtems, the HEMP is ſufficiently watered, and ought immediately to be taken out; permitting the HEMP to lie a day longer than neceſſary, at this ſeaſon of the year, when the weather is commonly very warm, would be greatly prejudicial to it, as the fibres of the bark, from being too much macerated, would occaſion not only great waſte in handling, whilſt wet, but, from not having ſtrength ſufficient to ſuſtain the effort of the brake, part of the bark would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with the ſtems. However, until experience teaches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in this, it is the beſt way to lean to the ſafer ſide, and draw the HEMP rather too early than too late; if a bandle of the HEMP is tried daily, as directed above, no great error can be committed: when the HEMP is taken out of the watering place, though it is by no means proper to water it in clear ſtreams, it would be well, however, for thoſe who are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to ſuch, to waſh the HEMP carefully therein. As the bundles are taken out of the water, they may be laid on each other upon the bank with their tops ſloping downward, in which poſition the water will more readily drain off, by which means the bundles will be more ſafely and eaſily moved to the place where the HEMP is to be ſpread to dry, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in ſome old field or piece of ſhort graſs land.—If it is perceived that the HEMP has been taken out too ſoon, it is only permitting it to lie a few days longer where it is ſpread,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014022_0030_0F92AE1816F5A7B0"/>and the dew or rain will not only compleat what the water has left undone, but it will alſo take off ſome of the harſhneſ of the HEMP: as ſoon as it is thoroughly dry, it is then fit for the brake, and ſhould be gathered up, and tied with ſtraw bands in large bundles, and laid away under ſhelter, where it can receive no injury from the weather.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Directions for raiſing and preſerving the <hi>SEED.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHEN it is intended to let ſeed plants remain in the HEMP ground, for the purpoſe of providing ſeed, which is the method, though a very bad one, commonly uſed, the bloſſom HEMP ought not to be pulled until the duſt has entirely fallen from the flowers, when they will begin to wither, and turn of a browniſh yellow, and the ſtalks white at the root; it may then be pulled without any injury to the ſeed, and, if this is done with proper caution, it will give new ſtrength to thoſe ſeed plants remaining in the ground, for, only the beſt and ſtrongeſt of this kind being left, the HEMP ground is delivered, not only from a great number of plants that exhauſted its ſtrength, and injured and choaked one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but the raiſing and looſening the ground, about thoſe that remain, will prove equal to a hoeing.</p>
               <p>THOUGH this is the method, as has been obſerved, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed for raiſing ſeed, yet it is by no means to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of; ſeparating the ſeed plants from what you pull up occaſions a great deal of trouble, and takes above double the time to gather and ſecure the HEMP from off the ſame ground; for, as the ſtalks of theſe plants left in the field, eſpecially when it has been ſown of a proper thickneſs, being for the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014022_0031_0F92AE191245C7B8"/>moſt part ſmall and without any branches, yield but very little ſeed, and even that none of the beſt, it will require a vaſt number of them to produce but a very moderate quantity of ſeed; beſides the bark of this latter HEMP gets harſh from ſtanding ſo long, and is not ſo fit for linen as it is for cordage.</p>
               <p>A FAR better method is to raiſe the ſeed <hi>apart by itſelf,</hi> either on a portion of the ground allotted for the HEMP, or, what would be yet more proper, on any other good ſpot that is convenient for this purpoſe, which muſt be reduced into proper tilth, either by the hoe, or plough, in the ſame manner as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for the other. This ought to be done ſo as to have the ground ready to receive the ſeed as ſoon as the froſts are over, for, provided that the weather is mild and will permit, the earlier what you intend to raiſe ſeed from is put into the ground the better, not only becauſe the forward plants bring their ſeeds better to maturity, and produce a greater quantity, but, in caſe of accidents, there will be time to ſow the ground again.</p>
               <p>THE ſeaſon for ſowing being come, the ground ſhould be laid off, either with the plough or hoe, into flat hills, about four feet aſunder, in each of theſe hills from ten to fifteen grains of the HEMP ſeed may be depoſited, and, as ſoon as they are ſprung to ſuch a height as to be paſt danger from the froſt, or other accidents, the hills ought to be thinned, pulling up the ſuperfluous ſtalks, leaving about eight or nine plants in each hill.</p>
               <p>THE remaining plants ought to be kept clear of weeds, and the ground looſened, either by the plough or the hoe, until the HEMP grows to ſuch a ſize that it becomes inconvenient to work amongſt it. About the middle or towards the laſt of Auguſt, when the male or flower plants have entirely loſt their duſt, and begin to drop their bloſſoms and wither, they ſhould then
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014022_0032_0F92AE19AAF53528"/>be carefully pulled up, ſo as not to injure the female plants, which muſt remain in the ground, commonly for five or ſix weeks longer until the ſeed is ripe.</p>
               <p>AS the ſeed of this plant does not ripen equally, or all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, attention muſt be given to ſecure it in the proper time; ſhould the ſeeds get too ripe, and a wind happen when in this ſtate, it might occaſion the loſs of the very beſt of the grain. As that ſeed which ripens firſt is the beſt, ſo the danger of loſing it is the greateſt, ſome, therefore, ſpread a ſheet cloſe by the ſide of the plants, and bending their tops carefully over, beat out the ripe ſeed into the ſheet, by gently ſhaking or beating the bunches, by performing this once or twice, permitting ſome days to intervene, the very beſt of the ſeed is all ſaved, and the plants may ſafely be permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſome time longer in the ground, by which means more of the ſeed arrives to maturity.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon, then, as the ſeeds begin to burſt the capſules, or outer huſks, and appear well formed, and ready to drop out of themſelves, ſome of the ſeed bunches ſhould be examined, and if it is found, upon opening the green huſks, which have not yet burſted of themſelves, that the ſhell, which covers the kernel, is firm and plump, of a grey colour, and tolerably well filled, then is the time for ſaving the ſeed; this is moſt ſafely and quickly done by cutting down the ſtalks with a ſharp reap hook, near the ground, and, before the huſks can have any time to dry, or ſhrink from the ſeeds, they ought to be carried near to the barn, or the place where you intend to clean out the ſeed, where they muſt be ſet up in ſmall parcels, with their root ends down, and ſpreading wide at the bottom, and the heads bearing the ſeeds compreſſed cloſely together at the top; it will be eligible to cover theſe ſhocks, or parcels, with ſtraw, or afford them ſome other protection from the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014022_0033_0F92AE1A6064A5F8"/>weather and the birds. It is done, both expeditiouſly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, by tying ſmall bundles of rye ſtraw ſecurely together at the top, and ſpreading its butts over the heads of the HEMP, when it forms a roof ſhaped like a ſugar loaf, which, being tied about with a ſingle ſtalk or two at the butts of the ſtraw, ſafely ſecures the ſeed from injury; in this poſition it may remain till the ſeed is cured, and it is convenient to threſh it out; or it may remain until the middle of November, when it is time to ſpread out the HEMP to winter rot, this being by far the leaſt troubleſome way of treating this latter HEMP, which is too coarſe and harſh for linen, but exceedingly fit for many purpoſes in huſbandry; the ſeed may be threſhed out in the barn floor, or on a ſtrong cloth ſpread on the ground, or it may be got off by means of an inſtrument called a ripple; this is made in the form of a rake, only the teeth are placed cloſer together, through theſe teeth the tops of the HEMP are combed until all the ſeed is pulled off, and, after being cleaned, and as much of the light ſeed as poſſible ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it, that which is good may be put away in caſks, or any other place, until it is wanted, where it will be moſt ſecure from the vermin.</p>
               <p>AN acre of ground, managed in this manner, will produce from twenty to twenty-five or thirty buſhels of ſeed.</p>
               <p>THIS ſeed, beſides being neceſſary for the propagation of the plant, poſſeſſes other uſeful qualities; it yields an oil in large quantities, which is fit either for the lamp or coarſe painting; a buſhel of good ſeed will yield about ſix or ſeven quarts, it is therefore profitable to raiſe it for its oil; this ſeed is alſo a proper food for fowls or birds, and, made into a paſte, fattens, in a very little time, hogs or other animals which are fed on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:014022_0034_0F92AE1C61C82D98"/>
WHEN only a few buſhels of ſeed are wanted, this may be as well procured from a few hills, made as directed above, or on any convenient bye ſpot, ſuch as ſpare borders in a garden, where old tobacco or fodder houſes have ſtood, or even about the doors of tobacco houſes, or indeed upon any ſpots where wood, dung, or litter of any ſort has lain to rot; upon ſuch places oftentimes five, ſix, or ſeven quarts of ſeed is produced from one hill.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the breaking and preparing of <hi>HEMP</hi> for the Hackle.</head>
               <p>THE HEMP being ſafely watered, we now proceed to treat of the methods for ſeparating and clearing the ſtems from the bark; this is moſt expeditiouſly, and moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually performed by means of a ſimple inſtrument, called a brake, which is conſtructed in the ſame manner as a <hi>flax</hi> brake, only larger, being not only longer, but the fingers or ſwords ſhould be ſtronger, and placed conſiderably wider at the hinder end.</p>
               <p>ONE need ſee HEMP or <hi>flax</hi> broken but once, to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately maſter of the whole operation. The man or woman (for though this is a laborious work, it is nevertheleſs often performed by women) takes in his left hand, near to the middle, and ſo as that the root end may go firſt under the brake, as much of the HEMP as can be conveniently graſped and with the other hand the upper jaw of the brake is raiſed, the HEMP is inſtantly thrown between the two jaws of the inſtrument, firſt towards the end where the brake is wideſt, when the jaw which was lifted up is immediately let fall, and thus, by alternately raiſing and letting fall the upper jaw, with all the agility and force that can be given it, and, at the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014022_0035_0F92AE1C9AB94B18"/>intervals of raiſing, ſhifting the HEMP into every different po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, moving it as it gets more broke towards the fore end of the brake, where the fingers are cloſeſt, the ſtems are in a little time broke into ſmall pieces, which are made to quit the bark, by ſhaking it, or ſtriking it againſt the brake: when the root end is ſufficiently broken, the other part is put under, and treated in like manner; care muſt be taken to graſp the HEMP firmly in the hand, that it may be kept as even at the butts as poſſible. When this operation is carefully performed, there will be very little waſte, and the fibres will retain, as far as poſſible, their natural length.</p>
               <p>THIS firſt performance, as it clears the HEMP from a great part of the duſt and gum, prepares it better for the next ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than the method of peeling, which is by no means to be uſed for this ſort of HEMP: ſuch as have not the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of uſing the brake, may perform this operation as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, by holding the HEMP on a block, or a large ſmooth ſtone, and beating it with a maul, until the ſtems, being thereby broken and ground into ſmall pieces, become eaſily ſeparated from the bark.</p>
               <p>INDEED the HEMP, from which the ſeed was raiſed, may properly enough be peeled, and will afford fit employment for young Negroes, or ſuch who are ſo old as to be paſt other labour, and this is eaſily effected by breaking the ſtalks at the root end, when the bark may be readily ſtripped entirely off the ſtems to the top.</p>
               <p>IN whatever way this work is done, it will be very much facilitated by having the HEMP made as dry as poſſible.</p>
               <p>IN thoſe parts of England, where this plant is much culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, they make uſe of ovens for this purpoſe, by means of which the HEMP is ſafely and effectually dried through all its parts.</p>
               <p>

THE oven is heated over night to ſuch a degree, that a perſon can juſt ſtand in it without uneaſineſs, it is then cleaned and filled with the HEMP, and, being cloſed up, the HEMP next morning will be fit to work off, and is taken out of the oven, as it is wanted, and carried to the brake, quite dry and criſp, by which means this operation is not only more expeditiouſly performed, but, as the HEMP, when thoroughly dried, requires leſs violence to clear it from the ſtems than when it is damp and tough, there will be little or no waſte, as very few of the fibres or ribbons of the HEMP will be broken in paſſing through the brake: from theſe reaſons it appears, that this method of drying the HEMP is attended with conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, but when we reflect, that they have a great deal more damp weather in England, than with us, ovens for this purpoſe are certainly more neceſſary there than here, where we generally perform this work during the cool clear dry weather of the ſpring, when the HEMP commonly requires no other preparation than opening the bundles, and expoſing it to the ſun for an hour or two, before it is put through the brake; however, ſhould the weather prove damp when this operation requires to be performed, it will be neceſſary to have recourſe to ſome other method to dry the HEMP: this is ſometimes done by ſticking four ſmall pieces of forked wood in the ground, two on each ſide, with a ſmall pole laid from the one fork to the other, on theſe two ſide poles are laid a few thin laths reaching acroſs, upon which the HEMP is ſpread over a fire, that blazes but little. This method will do in calm weather, but it is better and ſafer done by digging a hole about eight feet into the face of a hill or bank, and about five feet broad.</p>
               <p>THE earth out of this hole being thrown upon each ſide forms with the hill three walls, from the ſide walls a few ſmall
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014022_0037_0F92AE1FE71AF0C8"/>pieces of wood, about the ſize of tobacco ſticks, are laid acroſs, upon theſe the HEMP intended for the brake is laid to dry, and turned from time to time over a ſmall fire: in this place the heat, being confined by the ſide walls, and the bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, acts more upon the HEMP, which is more regularly and effectually dried than it can be the other way.</p>
               <p>WHEN the HEMP is broken, and cleared from the ſtems, if it is for the rope walk, it is tied up with a few ſtrands of the HEMP, about eight or nine inches from the root end, into hands or ſtricks, of four or five pounds each, and is then ready to pack up into bales or bundles: but a laborious operation remains to prepare that for the hackle which is intended for cloth, this is beating, or pounding, which is performed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ways: in thoſe parts of the country, where HEMP is much cultivated, mills are erected for this purpoſe, and, though they will admit of great improvement, yet they prepare the HEMP much better, and far quicker than can be done by the mallet. Where theſe mills are not to be had, the hammers of the fulling mill will effect the ſame end; they are a little more tedious in preparing the HEMP, but they do it full as well as it is done in the mills built for the purpoſe; ſometimes it is prepared under a bark mill, but, where none of theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances are convenient, it is laid in a ſtone or wooden mortar, or on a block of wood, and either pounded with a heavy peſtle, or large mallet; precaution muſt be taken, that the HEMP be not injured during this operation, by continuing to pound it after it becomes too warm, for when it gets hot, which it ſoon will do, from the ſevere action of the mallet, it ought to be laid aſide until it gets cool, when it may be again taken in hand; the HEMP is to be firmly twiſted up, and the ends doubled in to prevent it from tangling, and ought to be placed and turned in every different poſition, ſo as to receive
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014022_0038_0F92AE209E8BEA70"/>the impreſſion of the mallet on all its parts. The intention of this work is to divide and ſeparate the fibres of the HEMP, and, by diſengaging it from the remaining gum and dirt, render it more ſoft and pliant, and fit it the better for the hackle.</p>
               <p>THIS operation, beſides being a ſevere one, is often prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the health of the work people, the gum, which in pounding flies off from the HEMP, fills the air with diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able duſt, which, being drawn in with the breath, frequently brings on diſorders, occaſioned by obſtructions in the lungs, to ſuch as are obliged to follow this labour for a livelihood: It is full as diſagreeable for thoſe who attend the mills.</p>
               <p>THE hackling is nearly as noxious when much of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining duſt, in paſſing the HEMP ſo quickly through the hackle, is rubbed off.</p>
               <p>THE hackles uſed for this buſineſs are of different degrees of fineneſs, agreeable to the quality of the manufacture intended.</p>
               <p>THE whole of this operation, though it requires uſe and practice to dreſs HEMP to the beſt advantage, may neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be performed by any careful perſon. There is another method which is made uſe of, on ſome occaſions, to improve the quality of <hi>flax,</hi> as well as HEMP; a large pot, with as much weak lye in it as to cover the bottom, is placed over a ſmall fire, juſt ſufficient to keep the lye boiling; a few nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſplits of wood are placed acroſs each other, until they are ſo far above the lye as to prevent the HEMP, which is to be placed upon them, from touching it; upon theſe ſticks the ſtreaks, or parcels of HEMP, are placed in layers, leaving a little ſpace between each parcel; the layers are to croſs each other, ſo that the ſteam may thereby paſs freely through to the top or upper parcels; when the pot is nearly full it is covered almoſt cloſe, and, after that moſt of the lye has evaporated,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014022_0039_0F92AE2164DEB498"/>the HEMP is hung up, out of the wind, or ſpread on the graſs to dry; when it is quite dry, it is twiſted up, and pounded a little, to ſeparate the fibres, which get matted together in drying.</p>

               <p>HAVING thus endeavoured to communicate ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as appear beſt adapted to our climate, as well as thoſe moſt commonly made uſe of amongſt us at this time, for cultivating and preparing HEMP for domeſtic purpoſes. Yet, after all the fatigue, labour and pains in the preparation, it is found to produce but a very coarſe, ill coloured thread, and ſo harſh, that, before it can be made fit to be wove into cloth, it is neceſſary to boil it in ſeveral lyes, and the cloth, made of this yarn, is ſtill ſo hard to be bleached, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a tedious operation, which is both laborious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive, before it can be brought to any tolerable colour, ſo that it has hitherto been deemed only fit to make the coarſeſt kinds of cloth.</p>
               <p>WITH a view of encouraging a general cultivation of this moſt neceſſary plant, we ſhall endeavour to communicate a method, which not only abridges the moſt laborious, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes with the moſt diſagreeable operations now uſed in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring HEMP, but, from numbers of experiments which have been made, will evince that HEMP has many valuable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we have hitherto but very little attended to, and that it may be applied, with eaſe and great propriety, to anſwer many elegant and conſiderable purpoſes in life, for which it has been hitherto deemed utterly unfit.</p>

THE bark of the HEMP, as it appears in its original ſtate upon the ſtem, ſeems ſurrounded, or entirely covered with a dirty glutinous oil, or gum, which not only ſerves to attach the bark to the ſtem, but alſo to join, or glue the fibres of the bark lengthways together: experience ſhews that this gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſubſtance has different degrees of reſiſtance; the common watering ſerves to diſſolve ſo much of this gum as to fit the HEMP for the brake, but ſtill, after this operation, the bark remains in broad ſtrings or ribbons, and it is neceſſary, before a further ſeparation of the fibres can be effected, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome other proceſs to clear them from the remaining gum; the mill, or the mallet, has been hitherto generally uſed for this purpoſe, by means of which operation, part of the gum being beat off, the bark becomes more divided, yet ſtill the-fibres remain coarſe and harſh. Experience, however, has demonſtrated, that a ſecond watering, when performed with care, not only accompliſhes the work of the mill, but goes a great way further. The HEMP, by means of this ſecond wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, being waſhed and diſengaged from the remaining gum and dirt, becomes white and flexible, and its fibres eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to a great degree of fineneſs, by means of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing operation of the hackle.</p>
               <p>THIS method of preparing HEMP appears to have been practiſed with ſucceſs in many parts of France, and is ſtrongly recommended in a treatiſe publiſhed by <hi>M. Marchandier,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of Bourges, the capital of Berry, a province long cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for its hempen cloth.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>AFTER having long conſidered, ſays this writer, the various means that might be found to relieve thoſe who work upon HEMP, and obſerved thoſe admirable qualities, of which, hitherto, no improvement has been made, we found that the common watering of HEMP was nothing but
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014022_0041_0F92AE23051BA1E8"/>the diſſolution of a tenacious gum, natural to the plant, the parts whereof are joined together merely by means of it, and that, in order to this firſt preparation, it was ſufficient to leave the HEMP in the water, in proportion to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and tenacity of this gum, that after having prepared it only for being peeled, or braked, it ſeemed very proper to give it a ſecond watering, to ſoften the bark, that ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains hard, elaſtic, and incapable of being brought to a proper degree of fineneſs. Accordingly, by the different experiments we made, in the preſence, and under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Monſ. Dodart,</hi> intendant of Berry, we have found means, eaſily, and without expence, to give it thoſe qualities which are natural to it, and the uſes whereof were not hitherto known.</p>
                  <p>THE water that has already had power to ſeparate the bark from the ſtem, ſerves alſo to divide, without trouble or hazard, the fibres from one another, by a total diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gum that remains in them?</p>
               </q>
               <p>IT is needleſs to enumerate the many different methods and experiments which have been tried, it will be ſufficient to lay down the neceſſary directions in as few words as will render them intelligible to the meaneſt capacity, for no operation can well be more ſimple, plain and eaſy.</p>
               <p>THE HEMP, being previouſly broke, and tolerably well cleared from the ſtems, muſt be divided into ſmaller parcels, each of the handfuls from the brake may be divided into two, or, if very large, into three parcels, theſe are to be doubled in the middle, twiſting them very ſlightly, and ſecuring the ends by doubling them in, or by wrapping the longeſt fibres of the ends two or three times round, ſo that the parcels may not only be kept from mixing with each other, but alſo that the HEMP of every individual parcel may be kept ſtraight, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014022_0042_0F92AE25313E9CF8"/>in due regularity. The parcels thus prepared muſt be placed in regular layers in the tub or veſſel, which you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the purpoſe, which is to be filled with water, the propereſt for the purpoſe is pond or rain water, or the ſofteſt that can be procured; in this the HEMP may continue for twelve, eighteen, or even twenty-four hours; by this time, if the weather is warm, the gum remaining on the HEMP, though not diſſolved, will be thoroughly moiſtened. The HEMP is then to be taken out, and, that the gum may be the better looſened, and more readily waſhed off, it will be neceſſary to waſh the HEMP well in clear water, as it is taken out; this may be moſt conveniently done in an old tub, the ſtaves of which are cut off within about ten or twelve inches of the bottom; this tub ſhould be placed in a run of water, or below a ſpring, ſo that the water may continually paſs through it; the HEMP is then to be trampled on by the perſon's feet, who is employed in this work, and as there will be a conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of clear water, the dirt and gum will be waſhed away as faſt as it is ſqueezed out of the HEMP; when the water appears to paſs clear from the HEMP, it ſhould then be taken up, and, after the water is gently wrung, or rather ſqueezed out, it is then to be laid on a block, and beat with a beetle, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſed to beat cloaths with, when waſhed: The edge, which is commonly two inches thick, is better for this purpoſe than the flat ſide; in this manner it muſt be beat, moiſtening and ſhifting the poſition of the HEMP, until you judge that it is diſengaged from the remainder of the gum, and that its fibres begin to divide, and ſeparate; it ſhould then be thrown into the water, untwiſted, and by ſingle parcels waſhed very clean, when the good effects of this ſecond watering will appear; the HEMP being purged and diſengaged from the gum and dirt, by the foregoing operation, its fibres will appear
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014022_0043_0F92AE25A31CC500"/>fine, and as completely divided, as if they had already paſſed through the hackle. When the HEMP is very well rinſed, it is to be carefully wrung, and, after ſhaking it out, hung acroſs a rope to dry; ſhould the weather prove windy, it will be beſt to ſpread it on the graſs, as the wind is ſaid to impair the ſtrength both of HEMP and <hi>flax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is the mode which we have adopted for performing this operation during warm weather, which is undoubtedly the fitteſt time for this buſineſs, heat being abſolutely neceſſary to aſſiſt in clearing the HEMP from its gum and filth, for which reaſon, it will not only be more tedious to effect this in cold ſevere weather, but it is rather diſtreſſing to the perſons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſtand or work in cold water, however, when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find time conveniently in ſummer, to perform this work, another method may be adopted during the cold weather, which, though it occaſions a little more trouble than the other, enables us, nevertheleſs, to perform this proceſs full as quickly.</p>
               <p>A POT of weak lye is to be prepared towards the evening, and, after having previouſly ſoaked the HEMP in warm water, for two or three hours, it is to be wrung out and placed in the tub, as before directed, the lie, after having ſettled, is to be poured as warm as poſſible over the HEMP, which ſhould be kept under the lye, by means of a cover nearly adapted to the ſize of the mouth of the veſſel, which will alſo keep the ſteams from evaporating, and enable the HEMP to retain a warmth until morning, when it muſt be taken out of the lye, and trampled upon and beat as before directed, uſing a little warm water, occaſionally, to temper the ſeverity of the cold during the trampling and beating, which are the moſt tedious parts of the proceſs, as only the rinſing will require to be done in cold water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:014022_0044_0F92AE266F39C478"/>
WHEN the HEMP is dry, four or five of the parcels may, as they are taken off the rope, be twiſted up firmly together, doubling in the ends, to prevent it from getting looſe in pounding; for as the HEMP, in drying, is apt to get matted together, it is abſolutely neceſſary, before it can be hackled, that the fibres ſhould be ſeparated again; this may be effected altogether by the mallet, though this purpoſe is anſwered full better by means of another inſtrument called a clove.</p>
               <p>THE HEMP, after being beaten until it begins to get ſoft, is then ſhook looſe, and one or two of the parcels being graſped in the right hand, near to the middle, giving the HEMP a turn round the hand to keep the fibres more firmly in their place, the woman, who works this inſtrument, ſits on the bench or block, in which it is fixed, and having hold with her left hand, of the handle of the lower piece or jaw, which only moves, ſhe cauſes it to open by raiſing her hand; with the other, the HEMP is thrown between the two jaws, and then, by lowering the left hand, the moving jaw is raiſed, the HEMP being thereby inſerted or forced into the groove of the upper piece, is immediately drawn forcibly through, while the jaw is held faſt. The HEMP, in its paſſage, being ſeverely rubbed againſt the edges of the inſtrument, is both ſoftened and ſeparated; this work, being briſkly repeated, in a very ſhort time it ſoftens, diſengages, and ſeparates the fibres of the HEMP more quickly, and prepares it better for the hackle, than the mallet alone.—When the one end is done, that which was wrapped round the hand is treated in like manner.</p>
               <p>FROM this proceſs, than which nothing can be eaſier, and which differs in no eſſential point from the directions given by <hi>Monſ. Marcandier,</hi> moſt of the difficulties formerly attending the preparation of HEMP are removed, and, what is of more
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014022_0045_0F92AE27382FE558"/>conſequence, its qualities appear very much improved. "This work (ſays <hi>Monſ. Marcandier</hi>) formerly ſo hard, on account of the ſtrength it required, and ſo dangerous, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the fatal duſt the workman drew in with his breath, will be, henceforth, only a buſineſs moderately ſevere. There will be no occaſion to look for machines to ſave the labour of men, and prevent the dangers attending the work. The buſineſs of hemp-dreſſing, henceforward, would be confined to an eaſy beating of the HEMP, and the common operations of the hackle: it is ſo much the more eaſy that the materials are ſofter, and no longer exhale unwholſome duſt: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there is ſcarce any waſte in this operation. If you want it to paſs through the fineſt hackle, the HEMP thus waſhed will afford dreſſed ſtuff capable of producing the beſt thread, comparable to what is yielded by the fineſt flax, and you will have little more than a third of very good hards.</p>
               <p>"Now theſe hards, which were formerly an object of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and ſold commonly for about five farthing, the pound, by this new operation, becomes a matter of very great advantage. By carding them like wool, they produce a fine white, marrowy ſubſtance, the true uſe whereof was never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered till now. They may be ſpun alone into very beautiful thread. They may be alſo mixed with cotton and ſilk, with wool, and even with hair; and the thread, that reſults from theſe different mixtures, affords, by its vaſt variety, materials for new eſſays, very intereſting to the arts, and of vaſt utility to ſeveral ſorts of manufactures.</p>
               <p>"IN HEMP, duly prepared, beſides ſilk, hair, wool, and cotton, we find a new material, which, till now, had never any exiſtence in commerce, nor in manufactures, but may be made extremely uſeful in both. By mixing it with wool, for inſtance, half and half, we work it into caps and cloths, which are no
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:014022_0046_0F92AE280C47B128"/>ways different from thoſe that are made of wool alone, even in their greateſt perfection. By mixing the hards of it with cotton, we make cloth and ſtuffs, and even coverlids, which, with regard to whiteneſs, ſoftneſs, fineneſs, and other qualities, may be preferred to thoſe, which, at firſt, we only propoſe to imitate. Nor is it to be doubted, but it may be alſo employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in manufactures of hats, becauſe it will be an eaſy matter to make felts of it, if we mix it with wool proper for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>"IN a word, by the different combinations made with the hards of HEMP, they aſſume the nature and properties of the materials with which they are mixed, and the price of ſuch materials will be leſſened in proportion as they are now dear, uncommon and rare.</p>
               <p>"We have already given, in ſeveral cities of the kingdom, ſuch ſamples of theſe mixtures as have been demanded of us, that the firſt ſight of them has excited the ſurpriſe, and merited the approbation of the beſt judges."</p>
               <p>FROM the above quotations we may form ſome opinion of the idea which Monſ. <hi>Marcandier</hi> entertains of the properties of HEMP, and the advantages which it may be of to manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when prepared agreeable to this new method; but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo many new qualities are attributed to HEMP, when prepared by a ſecond watering, this method is attended with more waſte of the HEMP than when it is prepared in the mill, when it will doubtleſs yield more dreſſed ſtuff, though not ſo fine in quality, and if the labour is not ſo ſevere or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy, it muſt be allowed to be more tedious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; however, ſhould this mode of preparation fail in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all the advantages we are made to hope from it, yet there are many very important ones to be urged in its favour, and when we conſider that the yarn, which is ſpun of the ſtuff
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:014022_0047_0F92AE28CA762D48"/>hackled from that prepared in the mill, loſes greatly of its weight in boiling (a proceſs which all linen thread muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo to prepare it for weaving) the difference will not be ſo conſiderable, when the ſecond watering is performed with care.</p>
               <p>A MOST conſiderable advantage reſults from the coarſe tow, or hards, of the firſt hackling, which, by means of the ſecond watering, becomes an object of great utility, being thereby excellently prepared to make the beſt ſorts of coarſe linens, fit for cloathing our labourers and negroes, and preferable in ſtrength and quality to imported oſnabrigs, being greatly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the coarſe tow of the HEMP prepared in the mill, which is only capable of making a very coarſe, harſh, unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cloth, and indeed, even the coarſe cloth made from the hackled HEMP, which has been prepared in the mill, will not do equal ſervice to the cloth made from the coarſe watered tow; a large portion of the gum remaining with the HEMP, is twiſted up in ſpinning, therefore the cloth continues harſh and ſtiff, whereby it cuts itſelf before it is fairly worn; this reaſoning may be further confirmed from knowing that coarſe cloth, made even of flax tow, will wear longer than linen made from yarn, ſpun very coarſe from dreſſed flax; therefore, as we find that very coarſe linens, made either from dreſſed HEMP or <hi>flax,</hi> are, from their ſtiffneſs, but ill calculated for ſome ſorts of ſervice, we may reaſonably expect that the linens made from HEMP duly prepared by a ſecond watering, as they are ſoft, flexible, and pliant, and ſtrong withal, will be found more durable, and therefore on every account to be preferred.</p>
               <p>WHEN the HEMP is intended for more elegant purpoſes, it ſtill becomes more neceſſary to prepare it by a ſecond watering, as, by that means, it becomes more ſuitable for ſuch uſes, than it poſſibly can be by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>ITS thread alſo, being ſo readily whitened, is not only proper for checks, ſtriped linens, bed ticking, &amp;c. but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a material, by this preparation, moſt excellently calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to anſwer as the warp for all fabrics of wool and cotton, fine as well as coarſe, and the tow produced from the ſecond, or finer hacklings, yielding a fine ſoft ſubſtance, in ſome degree ſimilar to wool and cotton, it ſeems reaſonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that, upon being blended and carded with theſe materials, the thread, reſulting from theſe different mixtures, may prove productive of a variety of new and profitable manufactures, ſimilar, and not inferior, to many of the various bleached and dyed ſtuffs of Mancheſter, as the HEMP, after being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, will as readily receive, and retain the tints of any dye, as the wool or cotton with which it is blended.</p>
               <p>AFTER the particular account that has been given of the nature and properties of HEMP, and at the ſame time reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with how much eaſe and certainty it may be cultivated, it is greatly to be wiſhed, that the inhabitants of theſe colonies would avail themſelves of ſuch advantages; the ſucceſs which muſt attend the undertaking will have a better effect than all that can be wrote in its favour, as it would be an argument to the meaneſt capacity, and give irreſiſtable encouragement to this moſt uſeful branch of domeſtic manufacture; the ideas here ſuggeſted will readily receive a better form from prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and be carried further <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
