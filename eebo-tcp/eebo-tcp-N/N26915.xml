            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Such were the words delivered by madame Maſerini to her daughter, as the latter held the dying hand of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in an agony of grief liſtened to thoſe inſtructions, which ſhe was certain would be the laſt ſhe ever ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from a parent, whoſe maternal tenderneſs and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were the moſt ſincere, and of which ſhe now would ſeverely feel the loſs. Madame Maſerini immediately after fell into a fainting fit, which laſted ſo long, that the nurſe as well as Matilda thought ſhe was no more; but in this they were miſtaken; for to the joy of all her attendants ſhe recovered, and inquired, as ſhe had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether her ſon (who was an officer) was yet arrived; they anſwered her in the negative; for as he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſeveral times that it was thought his mother's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order would prove fatal, it was known he might obtain
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:035833_0003_10093C282B302ED0"/>
leave of abſence from his regiment, which was then ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Flanders. But ſome little time before, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs had been ſent to him, ſetting forth that madame Maſerini was much worſe, and they thought her life in great danger; they alſo mentioned that it was her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſire to ſee him; he was therefore now expected every hour: but after this fit ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould not ſurvive that evening, and ſeemed extremely impatient to ſee her ſon; ſhe ſaid ſhe had ſomething of the greateſt importance to communicate to him, which ſhe refuſed to relate to her daughter; but ſtill finding that he did not arrive, ſhe aſked for her confeſſor, when to her inexpreſſible ſurpriſe and grief ſhe was informed that he was ſent for, that morning, by a ſick relation, ten miles off, and was not yet returned; ſhe called for pen and ink, and though ſo weak as hardly able to be ſupported in her bed, with great pain and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſhe wrote ſeveral lines, then dropped her pen, claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hold of Matilda's hand, and expired.</p>
                     <p>The grief of all who were preſent was moſt poignant; but particularly that of Matilda; ſhe now beheld herſelf an orphan with a very ſmall fortune, which was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport her genteelly without ſome other addition; ſhe was bere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a mother whoſe good inſtructions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhe could now no longer receive; in ſhort, ſhe was diſtracted.</p>
                     <p>Not many minutes after the diſſolution of madame Maſerini, the phyſician came in; he found the attendants ſtupified with grief, and Matilda in the ſame poſture as ſhe was at the moment her mother expired; he parted her hand from that of the corpſe, which ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and bathed with tears; but ſhe had the preſence of mind to take up the paper on which her mother had wrote, and when ſhe entered her chamber, threw it careleſsly in
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:035833_0004_10093BE89B60D9A0"/>
the eſcritoire, without once looking at the writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſhort, her mind was in ſuch a ſtate that for many hours ſhe had not the leaſt remembrance of the affair.</p>
                     <p>About half an hour after the deceaſe of madame Maſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini, Alfred her ſon arrived. When he firſt heard of his mother's illneſs, he would have ſet off for Paris directly, but was prevented by the indiſpoſition of a ſuperior officer. Immediately as he received the laſt expreſs, he obtained leave of abſence for a month, and left Flanders the day after; but, unfortunately, in one part of his journey, where he was obliged to ride on horſeback, the animal took fright and threw him; he was taken up for dead; but being only ſtunned by the blow, he ſoon recovered; yet it ſerved to detain him a few days; as ſoon as he was able to ſtand, he made the beſt of his way to the city, but arrived too late to receive the important ſecret that madame Maſerini ſo much wiſhed to impart to him.</p>
                     <p>Madame Maſerini was the youngeſt daughter of a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe power and dignity were well known in all parts of France; having no ſon, he reſolved to aggrandiſe his name through his eldeſt daughter; for which purpoſe, he determined to place his two youngeſt in a convent; and, if poſſible, to prevail on them to take the veil: in this caſe, the fortune he would have been neceſſitated to have given them, might be added to that of their eldeſt ſiſter, which moſt likely would procure her a huſband of great note; he could then have his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> name transferred to his ſon-in-law, and by that means the family honours would deſcend to poſterity, the ſame as by male iſſue:—thus did the unjuſt marquis intend to bury from the world two amiable young women, to ſatisfy an empty and ridiculous ambition.</p>
                     <p>The marchioneſs died when the children were very

                        </gap>;—the marquis now thought it full time to put his ſcheme in execution; he accordingly perſuaded the young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>nt of N****, and affected the greateſt grief at parting from them; in private he begged the lady abb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſs to let no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity paſs that might haſten their deſire of taking the veil. Felicia, the youngeſt, ſeemed perfectly contented with her ſituation; but her ſiſter, who was of a more lively diſpoſition, very much diſliked it; and though the greateſt art was uſed in order to make her take to a religious life, yet it all proved ineffectual; for, at the year's end, though the former determined to comply with their wiſhes, yet Clementina declared her averſion to them, and proved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in her opinion; ſhe uſed all the arguments in her power to perſuade her ſiſter to relinquiſh the thoughts of making ſuch a place a reſidence for life; but Felicia was ſo charmed with the convent and its inhabitants, that the conſtantly replied, nothing in the world ſhould ever tempt her to leave them; ſhe accordingly took the white veil. Her father (who conſtantly received intelligence) read the news with the greateſt pleaſure; but it was in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure damped by hearing that Clementina had ſo great a diſlike to follow her example, and that ſhe wiſhed much to be permitted to return home:—this requeſt he reſolved not to grant; as he thought time, and a little more uſe to the rules and orders of the place, might work an entire change in her ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>It was at this period Louis XIV aſcended the throne of France; and, among others who had buſineſs to tranſact at court on that occaſion, was a young gentleman, the ſon of an Italian of large fortune. He brought with him from
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035833_0006_10093BEB99F8B268"/>
Italy his ſiſter, whom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he was permitted to ſee any one in company with the lady abbeſs, or any other perſon whom ſhe could depend upon; this kind of behaviour, he thought, would be more likely to win her over to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than by laying her under any reſtraint; her diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being naturally good, and by far more inclined to yield to entreaty than force. Signor Maſerini often came on viſits to his ſiſter, who was placed with her ladyſhip, and the choſen companion and friend of Clementina:—it was at theſe times, when no one was preſent (which would often happen, the marquis's orders not being ſtrictly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to), that he would declare his paſſion, which he might plainly perceive was not liſtened to with diſlike, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina felt a ſtrong partiality for him, which ſoon ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into love: ſhe told him the ſtate of her affairs; but when he entreated her to elope with him from the convent, ſhe always reminded him that they muſt expect nothing in point of fortune from the marquis. That, he anſwered, would not give him the leaſt concern; for his father, who had no children except his ſiſter and himſelf, was worth a conſiderable deal of money, and had often told him, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he could meet with a wife, whoſe birth, virtues and accompliſhments, would bring no diſgrace upon their houſe, that wealth would be no object with him, as he ſhould be able to give him enough to keep them not only in plenty, but in affluence.</p>
                     <p>Clementina's mind was on the rack which way to reſolve; if ſhe rejected the propoſal, ſhe would moſt likely be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

to remain in the convent for life, and be conſtantly haraſſed with the importunities of all about her to take the veil; which would be worſe than death; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if ſhe conſented to fly with ſignor Maſerini to Italy, ſhe muſt run the hazard of travelling many miles, and when ſhe arrived in that country, would ſee no one that ſhe knew, except himſelf and his ſiſter;—the thoughts of leaving Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia, the difficulty of eſcaping, and the idea of what would be the conſequence if they were diſcovered, made her ſhrink with horror from the thoughts of leaving her preſent habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Thus ſhe delayed coming to a reſolution for near ſix months; when one morning as ſhe entered a cloſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the lady abbeſs, ſhe perceived on the floor a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, directed to her ladyſhip; it was her father's ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>SIGNOR Maſerini called in the afternoon, as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected—he only ſaw his ſiſter, thoſe meaſures being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready put in execution which the marquis had mentioned

in his letter. She informed her brother of the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that had happened in the morning, and alſo acquainted him with Clementina's reſolution to leave the convent. At theſe words he was in raptures; but they were ſoon ſubdued by the thoughts of what difficulties muſt be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to eſcape from it; for Clementina was totally confined to her chamber; not even ſignora Maſerini was permitted to ſee her—theſe orders had been given about an hour before—the young friends had therefore only time to fix, that whatever reſolutions the latter intended to put in practice, ſhe was to write them down, and contrive to drop them in the hand of the former at evening veſpers. But both the brother and the ſiſter were at loſs how to elude the watchful vigilance of the different people belonging to the convent, till a ſcheme, propoſed by ſignora, ſeemed as if it would prove favourable. She told her brother to go to the houſe of father Abſalom, (a prieſt) who was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that night at a late hour to have a conference with the lady abbeſs, and to tell him her ladyſhip could not receive him; he ſhould then procure a dreſs as much like father Abſalom's as poſſible, and, at the ſame time when he was to have attended, to come to the gate of the convent, thro' which he might paſs unnoticed, if he would hold up his handkerchief ſo as to cover his face, which the reverend father generally did to avoid the night air. By this means he might get to the lady abbeſs's apartments; but inſtead of entering them, to turn round a contrary way, that would take him to a winding ſtaircaſe, which, after deſcending ſome time, would terminate in a large vaulted chamber; and in this place he was to wait the arrival of Clementina and his ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>"But how is it poſſible," returned ſignor Maſerini, "if you ſhould be able to meet me there, that we can eſcape? You will certainly be known."</p>

why ſhe wept. The latter, by degrees, and with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt circumſpection, informed her of her intentions of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the convent. Horror ſhowed itſelf in every feature of Felicia while ſhe liſtened to the relation; at length, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by ſurpriſe, grief and weakneſs, ſhe fainted. Water ſtood by; her ſiſter, hardly able to ſupport herſelf, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to her relief, and had the preſence of mind not to make any noiſe. After ſome minutes, ſhe recovered, but was almoſt too ill to ſpeak. Clementina ſupported her in her bed, and received the laſt words of her ſiſter with a look of anguiſh and madneſs.</p>
                     <p>"Clementina," ſaid Felicia, whoſe voice was hardly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate, "Heaven preſerve you in this ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

O! my ſiſter, may you ſee many happy years; and when the ſunſhine of proſperity ſheds its beams upon thee, may they never be obſtructed by the chilling wind of adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                     <p>THE ſituation of Clementina was now dreadful beyond expreſſion. The diſtant tinkling of a clock at a remote part of the monaſtery proclaimed the hour to be ten. The wind, which had been ſo very high, had entirely drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the moon, quite obſtructed by heavy clouds, could not be diſcerned; large drops of hail beat againſt the windows, and by degrees increaſed to a violent ſtorm; the moſt tremendous claps of thunder followed faſt on each other; flaſh after flaſh of vivid lightning darted through the ſhattered caſements, which had no ſhutters. This war of elements was far more dreadful, it being an uncommon time of the year, the latter end of January. The body of Felicia lay ſtill in the arms of her ſiſter, who, totally inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, reſted her hand on the ſame pillow, till a violent clap of thunder, which ſhook the convent, rouſed her from this reverie. She ſtarted up, and at firſt hardly knew where ſhe was; but recollection ſoon came with redoubled force; it wanted but one hour to the time when ſhe was to meet her friend; ſhe was unable to come to a reſolution in what manner to act. She took up the letter ſhe had received from ſignora Maſerini, and read it once more over.</p>
                     <p>She ſtill conſidered, that, if ſhe eſcaped, ſhe might once more be happy; but if ſhe remained in the convent, there was not the ſlighteſt hope that ſhe ſhould ever enjoy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hour of peace or comfort. She had now no one to leave, that could any way claim her regard or tenderneſs: the maternal love and affection of a mother ſhe had never known; her father had not fulfilled that tender name, by either aſſiduity or kindneſs; her eldeſt ſiſter ſhe hardly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035833_0012_10093BF7CC9494C0"/>
ever ſaw, as ſhe was placed, before her remembrance, with a relation of her mother's in Germany, who took the care of her education. The old lady viſited the marquis but once only, accompanied by his daughter, and then made but a ſhort ſtay; yet, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>his little time, the lady Eleanor's behaviour to her ſiſters was proud and diſdainful, ſo as not to call forth either eſteem or fondneſs. As to friends, ſhe had none except ſignora, for the marquis never ſuffered them to cultivate any acquaintance. Felicia would have been the only cauſe that could have made her leave the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with regret; ſhe, alas! was now no more; ſhe had conceived a ſincere friendſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ip for ſignora Maſerini, and her heart plainly told her, her affections were placed on her brother; ſhe therefore thought it would be more prudent to run the hazard of elopement with two perſons by whom ſhe was certainly beloved, than remain in a place where her life would be made uncomfortable. But ſtill ſhe was chilled with horror at the thoughts of being diſcovered; and the loſs of her ſiſter greatly preyed upon her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>It was now near the time when ſhe was to repair to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora Maſerini's room: ſhe put ſome trinkets of her ſiſter's, which Felicia had given her before ſhe took the white veil, into a ſmall ſilver caſket which ſhe could place in her pocket, and among them the picture of her mother; ſhe ſhed a flood of tears at the thought, that if the original had lived, how happy ſhe might now have been; ſhe then, according to the directions in the letter, wrote with her pencil feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed memorandums relative to their eſcape, and the names of ſeveral roads quite contrary to thoſe they meant to take; and dropped this book in the place where it was moſt likely to be found.</p>
                     <p>Eleven o'clock now ſtruck, and the hail had in ſome meaſure abated, though the thunder and lightning ſtill
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035833_0013_10093C366DACCF60"/>
continued, when Clementina took a laſt farewell of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſiſter; ſhe embraced the corpſe, wept over it, and was for ſome time unable to move, till ſhe at laſt tore her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf away from the body, and, with her eyes ſwimming in tears, implored the Author of all events to ſupport her in the few critical hours ſhe muſt undergo. With a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand ſhe then unbarred the door, which opened into a long gallery, on each ſide of which were different cells; ſhe could not take the lamp, for fear of the light glancing into any of the apartments, and was therefore only guided by each flaſh of lightning that came through a large window at the further end. So weak as to be hardly able to walk, ſhe at length arrived at the caſement, and ſat down on a ſeat under it to recover her ſtrength. The way ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come was by far the moſt dangerous on account of diſcovery, there being one or more inhabitants in each of the rooms ſhe had paſſed. She now went through ſeveral paſſages that led to a large vaulted chamber, and from thence began to aſcend a ſtone ſtair-caſe that wound round the ſouth tower of the convent, and took her entirely away from the cells below, belonging to the nuns, to the ſleeping rooms of the boarders above. The thunder in this place had a moſt awful ſound; the lightning, though it could only enter a ſmall painted caſement which ſtood at a great height, yet ſerved to ſhow the gloomy horrors of the place.</p>
                     <p>She was already half way up; but, terrified at the thoughts of her ſituation, ſhe reſted for a few moments againſt the old iron railing, when a light ſtep ſeemed to move on the ſame ſtair. Almoſt convulſed with horror, ſhe ſhrunk back, and was fortunately unable to call out, when at the ſame moment a ſtrong flaſh of lightning dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the window above, and ſhowed her the figure of a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035833_0014_10093BF9558B6180"/>
man; the ſight of it was but momentary, and all again was ſilent and dark. With breathleſs agitation, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quickneſs, ſhe ran up the other part of the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, flew acroſs two paſſages, and arrived at the chamber of ſignora Maſerini. She gave the ſignal they had fixed on, and the door was carefully opened by her friend, who with aſtoniſhment received Clementina, fainting in her arms.</p>
                     <p>She ſoon recovered, and informed ſignora of the death of her ſiſter, and alſo of the event that had ſo much alarmed her. The former intelligence ſhe was ſurpriſed and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at; but the latter, concerning the perſon on the ſtairs, ſhe told her was her brother, who was to wait in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber below. This circumſtance ſignora had neglected to mention in the letter, which might have been the cauſe of diſcovery. She inſiſted on Clementina's taking a glaſs of wine, and helped her to dreſs in the apparel of a prieſt, and then made herſelf ready in another diſguiſe of the ſame kind.</p>
                     <p>She now thought it full time to attend her brother, and begging Clementina to ſupport herſelf through this great trial, ſhe ſoftly opened the door; they proceeded to the ſtair-caſe, and deſcended it. It was quite dark, the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning being over. When they had got to the bottom, ſignora, in a whiſper, called her brother, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly anſwered. He was going to congratulate them on having got ſo far without diſcovery; but his ſiſter ſtopped him—"This," ſaid ſhe, "is not a place for compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments." They all three then reaſcended the ſtair-caſe, paſſed through a long paſſage, and arrived at the door of the lady abbeſs's apartments; they ſtopped there about two minutes, and then, holding their handkerchiefs partly over their faces, they croſſed a large hall, and arrived at
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035833_0015_10093C39B4C44148"/>
the door at the further end; they here paſſed two perſons, who made no inquiries. This door led them to an inner court, and from that to an outer one, in which there were ſeveral porters; but they, ſuppoſing them to have returned from a conference with her ladyſhip, aſked no queſtions. They had now only to paſs the outſide gates, which they did in the ſame manner, without any obſtructions, and ſaw themſelves totally free from the convent.</p>
                     <p>Signora and her brother were overjoyed at their good fortune; but Clementina, though ſhe was happy in having eſcaped, yet ſorrow ſtill hung upon her brow. They walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about half a mile, and then entered the chaiſe that waited for them; ſignor Maſerini's ſervant was on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; they deſired the poſt-boy, whom they were obliged to acquaint with the whole affair, to drive as faſt as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and he might depend on being rewarded. Signora acquainted her brother (who had very tenderly inquired after Clementina's health, and the cauſe of her melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) of Felicia's death, and begged him not to force her to talk; that her ſpirits, which within a few hours had been ſo greatly ſhocked, might again be a little compoſed.</p>
                     <p>This obſervation was juſt: Clementina had in a little time gone through a great deal of trouble: the ſurpriſe and concern which followed the finding of her father's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the grief ſhe felt at thoſe orders being ſo ſoon put in execution, the terror and anxiety ſhe was under when ſhe read ſignora's billet, the ſudden ſhock of her ſiſter's death, the horror ſhe felt during the ſtorm, with the alarm ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on the ſtair-caſe, and her dread of being diſcovered the whole night, conſpired to overwhelm her with ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions almoſt equal to madneſs; her looks plainly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe was exceedingly ill, and it did not eſcape ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora or her brother. He was almoſt diſtracted to know
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035833_0016_10093BFC31492448"/>
in what manner to act. To wait for advice, would be as bad as to diſcover themſelves; yet to ſee her in ſuch a ſtate, without any aid, was diſtreſſing beyond expreſſion. He could not perſuade her to take any nouriſhment, though he had proviſions in the chaiſe to prevent their ſtopping on the road for any thing elſe than to change horſes. Signora was extremely ſorry to ſee her friend ſo much indiſpoſed; ſhe perceived a fever was coming on; ſhe therefore adviſed her brother, about three o'clock in the afternoon, to order the poſt-boy to turn out of the high road, and drive into a wild part of the country, which, though it might take them out of the way they intended to go, yet in ſuch a place they might find ſome retired cottage, where they could ſtop for ſome time in ſafety; for ſhe was very certain Clementina would not be able to proceed on the journey.</p>
                     <p>Her brother conſented, and ordered the boy accordingly, who turned into another road, which led them to a wild heath, and from that to a remote, ſolitary foreſt. They continued in one track for ſome miles, till it began to grow dark, when they deſcended into a deep valley, at the bottom of which was a cottage that ſtood by itſelf. The chaiſe then ſtopped, and ſignor Maſerini and his ſiſter alighted; they were obliged to help Clementina carefully out, who, ſupported by each of their arms, walked up to the retired dwelling, which ſeemed to be the reſidence of virtue, contentment and happineſs.</p>

The happy pair, bleſſed with each other's love, whoſe health and ſtrength permit them to earn their daily bread, and care for no one, might here enjoy repoſe, and, with comfort to themſelves and others, breathe out a life of piety and virtue." Such were the thoughts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ignor Maſerini, as he aided to ſupport Clementina to the door of the cottage; he knocked, and it was opened by a young man who ſeemed not yet to have attained his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year.</p>
                     <p>"Friend," ſaid the diſguiſed prieſt, "admit under your hoſpitable roof three travellers, who for one night beg a lodging, and will repay you to the utmoſt of their power, with gratitude and prayers."</p>
                     <p>The young ſhepherd (for ſuch his dreſs denoted him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

be) courteouſly invited them into a ſmall clean room, where, on one ſide of the fire, ſat a man and woman ſeemingly much advanced in years, and on the other a beautiful young girl, who looked to be about eighteen: they roſe, and ſeemed greatly ſurpriſed at the entrance of the prieſts: the old man inſtantly ordered ſupper for his reverend gueſts, after aſſuring them they were ſincerely welcome.</p>
                     <p>Signora Maſerini placed Clementina next to her, while her brother went to the poſt-boy, whom he liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and told him to make the beſt of his way home, and acquaint his maſter he had been with only one gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, quite a different road from that they had travelled; he then re-entered the cottage with Edward, whoſe horſe they turned looſe in a field behind it. Clementina, ſince he had been out, had fainted, and was juſt recovering.</p>
                     <p>Amazement might be ſeen in each face of the cottagers; that three prieſts ſhould ride in a chaiſe attended by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, was ſtrange, as ſuch ſort of people uſually walked; the effeminate beauty of two of them was remarkable; and then one of them fainting, was aſtoniſhing. Signora thought it would be better to inform them of their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at once, and truſt to their generoſity in concealing them; ſhe therefore gave her brother the hint, and called on one ſide the old woman, whom ſhe acquainted with the whole affair, while he did the ſame to the man. They both greatly wondered in what manner they could eſcape, but readily promiſed their protection.</p>
                     <p>Clementina all this time ſeemed totally inſenſible of what was going forward, and, in ſhort, was in a ſtate of ſtupidity; for ſhe hardly gave any anſwer to thoſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were put to her, nor could they perſuade her to take any nouriſhment; ſhe was therefore undreſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

put into a warm bed. Neither the brother nor the ſiſter could partake of the homely fare that was ſet before them; but about eight o'clock ſignor Maſerini left the cottage with the young ſhepherd and Edward, and walked to a ſmall cot, that belonged to the father of the former, who was acquainted by his ſon with the hiſtory of the gentleman he had brought. There was one bed to ſpare, which ſignor Maſerini took poſſeſſion of, and Edward ſlept with Cyril, which was the young man's name.</p>
                     <p>La Faril, the old cottager, inſiſted on his daughter Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina ſitting up with Clementina, and begged ſignora to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to reſt, as he was ſure the fatigue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Both La Faril and his wife gave Sabina a charge to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the young lady, and then they themſelves bowed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of the drowſy god.</p>
                     <p>Signor Maſerini was at the cottage early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he eagerly inquired after Clementina's health, and was informed by Sabina that ſhe was very ill, and had been delirious the greater part of the night; ſhe was now aſleep, but was ſo diſturbed ſhe feared it would not refreſh her; neither his ſiſter nor her mother was up, and her father was gone out. He had not changed his dreſs, but was ſtill in the diſguiſe of a prieſt. He aſked Sabina whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any medical man lived near; ſhe ſaid there was one about three miles off, who always attended their family; he aſked her for a direction, which ſhe gave hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Father," ſaid he, "there is ſad news." "What, my ſon?" replied ſignor Maſerini. "Why," returned he, "there are two young ladies gone off with a young man, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſay, is brother to one of them, from the convent of N****; and the other, who is daughter to ſome mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, has poiſoned her ſiſter, for the was found dead in the morning"</p>

                     <p>She was not ſo much alarmed as might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and ſeemed extremely happy in the contrivance of the cave. Since the ſleep ſhe had in the morning, though it was much diſturbed, ſhe had mended, and was now able to ſit up for an hour to have her bed made.

The place was ſo exceedingly retired, that none of them had been ſeen, except by La Faril, his wife and daughter, Cyril, his father, the young girl and the man before mentioned; nor was any ſtranger obſerved in that part, ſometimes for three months together; and the only way they had of procuring poviſion was, by going to a ſmall town four miles diſtant. Signor Maſerini thanked both the father and the ſon for their hoſpitality towards him, and, after wiſhing them a good night, retired to his bed.</p>

                     <p>THE dejected lover had now time to recollect his ſituation. Though his father was exceedingly fond of him, yet there was a haughty pride and obſtinacy in his diſpoſition, that made him tremble l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It was true, he had ſeveral times told him that, with reſpect to his marrying, he ſhould conſider wealth as no object; but uſed always to lay a particular ſtreſs on his conſent being firſt obtained: this laſt circumſtance he had never mentioned to Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina.

again intruded on his mind, and he ſhrunk with horror from the idea that Clementina might ſuffer an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death: ſleep refuſed its aid, and the reſt of the night was ſpent in melancholy reflections on the dangers they had paſſed, and diſagreeable conjectures on thoſe that might ſtill be to come.

                        </gap>ight. Clementina was conſiderably better; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora Maſerini was in good ſpirits, but they were damped by ſeeing her brother look ſo ill: ſhe however concealed her uneaſineſs, for fear of alarming Clementina, who had alſo taken notice of it.</p>
                     <p>After a haſty breakfaſt, they thought it full time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the garden; it was a diſagreeable morning, though not ſo cold as might have been expected for the time of the year; yet there was a chilling dampneſs in the air, which made it far more uncomfortable than a ſevere froſt; and a few ſmall ſtars, ſcattered about the heavens, gave the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy black clouds which encompaſſed a large ſpace a more dreary appearance. It was juſt beginning to grow light, when the melancholy party came out from the cottage. La Faril went firſt: his thoughts were fixed on the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the preſent ſcene with that when he conducted his only ſon to the ſame gloomy habitation.</p>
                     <p>The recollection of this circumſtance drew a tear from his aged eye; for the good old man could not help paying that tribute to his memory, though he had ſhed many on account of his vices and extravagances. Signor Maſerini walked after him; he was wholly taken up with the idea of their being diſcovered; and when he looked on Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina, who reſted on one arm while his ſiſter laid hold
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035833_0026_10093C0BF9DCC650"/>
on the other, he almoſt curſed himſelf for leading her into ſo much danger.</p>
                     <p>Clementina was diſtreſſed to ſee him look ſo ill, but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing while ſhe was under his protection.—Signora had no misfortunes of her own; to ſee them happy, ſhe thought would make her ſo; and therefore her anxiety or happineſs was heightened or decreaſed according to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of her brother and her friend.—Sabina and her mother followed, with their hands and eyes lifted towards heaven, imploring bleſſings on their viſitors, and praying that they might remain undiſcovered.</p>
                     <p>When they arrived at the care, La Faril touched the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſpring, and the door flew open;—they were received by Edward, who had, as he was ordered, kept good fires all night, ſo that the place felt perfectly warm: their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor then told them that Sabina ſhould come every night after it was dark, to inform them if any thing particular had happened, and to be uſeful in any way that might ſerve to make them comfortable:—ſignor Maſerini return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a thouſand thanks for his kindneſs and friendſhip.—La Faril and his family then took their leave, and the door cloſed after them.</p>
                     <p>The cave, as was before mentioned, ran a great way back;—it was divided into three regular apartments, which, though narrow, were each of them long:—the firſt they made their ſitting room; in the ſecond ſignor Maſerini ſlept; and in the third, Clementina and his ſiſter.—Edward had a ſmall bed placed for him cloſe to the entrance, that he might be ready to give an alarm if he heard any noiſe that ſeemed to threaten danger.—They received no light but from candles or lamps:—this, added to the antique manner in which it was fitted up, and the hollow echo that ſent back every ſound they uttered, gave the place a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035833_0027_10093C4A4627ED80"/>
gloomy and melancholy appearance;—but, diſagreeable as it might ſeem, it was to them a comfortable retreat;—it might preſerve them from their enemies; and with that hope, any ſituation would be acceptable, though, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ten times more diſguſting than that they now poſſeſſed.</p>
                     <p>Sabina arrived at the cave about ten o'clock at night, attended by Cyril;—they informed ſignor Maſerini that no inquiries had been made after them that day; but they had heard the king's officers were within a few miles of the place; and there was not a doubt but they would remain there until the next morning. The young lovers ſtopped about an hour, and then took their leave.</p>

                        </gap> ſignor Maſerini, who had been reading to Clementina and his ſiſter ever ſince the departure of Cyril and Sabina, declared he was fatigued, and propoſed going to reſt; they both readily conſented, and had retired to their chamber about a quarter of an hour, when Edward ran into his maſter's room, with the news that the officers were certainly arrived, for he had heard them talking cloſe to the cave.</p>
                     <p>Fortunately, he did not ſpeak loud; and ſignor Maſerini, who was juſt beginning to undreſs, deſired him not to diſturb the ladies, and he himſelf would come to the door and liſten to their converſation.—They both proceeded to the mouth of the cave; the wind was high, and the noiſe which it occaſioned among the trees, prevented them from hearing but now and then a few words.—The firſt perſon
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035833_0028_10093C1030DE1220"/>
whoſe voice they could diſtinguiſh, was Cyril.—Signor Maſerini was very glad he was there;—he ſeemed to be talking to one of the officers—</p>
                     <p>"You ſee," ſaid he, "there are no ſigns of a place where we could conceal any one, even if we had ever ſuch an inclination."</p>
                     <p>"Hold—not ſo faſt, young man," anſwered a ſtern voice:—"we ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He was, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, that old man's ſon."</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" exclaimed La Faril," call him not by that name; he is now no more; and thoſe epithets are ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on one who has long ſince been in his grave, and is by this time partly turned to earth again"—Here the old man burſt into tears, and, as they ſuppoſed, retired to the houſe; for they heard him no more.</p>
                     <p>The officers ſtopped about half an hour, during which time Cyril remained with them.—Signor Maſerini won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at his having ſtopped ſo late, but looked on it as a fortunate circumſtance, as La Faril was too weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to attend them in a proper manner. He was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly glad to think that neither his ſiſter nor Clementina had known any thing of the matter, and pleaſed himſelf with the thoughts how happy they would be, when he informed them the affair they moſt dreaded was now over; nor were his conjectures wrong; for his intelligence gave them the greateſt pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The following night, Sabina arrived at the cave. She told them that when Cyril and herſelf entered the cottage from ſeeing them the night before, the father of the former had called to tell them the officers were within two miles
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035833_0029_10093C7C71667C00"/>
of them; he had heard it at a place where he had been in the afternoon; they therefore thought it would be beſt for Cyril to ſtay all night, in caſe they ſhould come at a late hour to ſurpriſe them. It was fortunate they took that precaution; for about midnight they were knocked up by the unwelcome viſitors. Cyril let them in; and, after their coming from the garden, they ſtopped about a quarter of an hour, and then departed.</p>
                     <p>Their only fear was now to fix in what manner they ſhould proceed to Italy without diſcovery; but at all events they determined to remain in the cave, at leaſt a month, that the affair might be in ſome meaſure forgotten; and they could then conſult what diſguiſe would be the moſt proper for them to travel in. They had reſided in their habitation near a fortnight before La Faril dared to make them a viſit; but receiving intelligence that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were certainly returned, he took the firſt opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rtunity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſee them, and propoſed they ſhould travel to Italy in the diſguiſe of Savoyards, as he had dreſſes which would fit them, and every thing proper for that character; they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been made for a maſquerade. His ſcheme met with the greateſt approbation, and they accordingly ſet about carrying it into execution.</p>
                     <p>In about three weeks every thing was prepared, and the morning fixed when they were once more to venture forth in ſearch of happineſs. Sabina and her mother attended them very early, in order to aſſiſt in putting on the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. La Faril arrived ſoon after; and at ſix o'clock they thought it full time to ſet off, as it would be neceſſary they ſhould get ſome diſtance from the cottage before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. La Faril made ſignor Maſerini perfectly acquainted with the way acroſs the country: and in caſe any queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were aſked them by the villagers, they were to reply
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035833_0030_10093C974A59A0B0"/>
they were going to Italy, the place where ſuch ſort of people moſtly reſide. Cyril alſo attended to take his leave. The ſpring of the cave was turned, and they once more breathed in open air: yet the thoughts of leaving the place which had preſerved them from their enemies, created a pang in their breaſts, and particularly ſince they knew not how ſoon they might once more wiſh to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within its cloſe receſs. Signor Maſerini claſped La Faril's hand, and ſtammered out his gratitude, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with tears, while the good old man, whoſe ſilver hairs and aged form denoted thoſe pearly drops which hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his withered cheek were not the firſt ſoft emblems of his feeling heart, preſſed him to his boſom; then, almoſt overcome with weakneſs and the effect of years, he nearly funk inſenſible on the earth—This was too much for ſignor Maſerini;—he preſſed his ſiſter and Clementina to haſten their departure, and hurried away from the ſpot to which he before ſeemed rooted.</p>
                     <p>It was an exceeding cold morning, and the twinkling bright ſtars which illumined the heavens, plainly ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be a ſevere froſt. They got three miles from the cave before day-light, and continued travelling without any diſagreeable circumſtances happening on the road, except the curioſity of the peaſants, whoſe homely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and good nature made ample amends for their ignorance.</p>
                     <p>After ſome days, they had the pleaſure to enter Italy. Signor Maſerini hired lodgings ſome miles from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's reſidence, and entreated Clementina to become his, before he made himſelf known to him. She was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to conſent; but at laſt, overcome by the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the brother and the ſiſter, he had the rapture to receive her as his own, about a fortnight after their arrival.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035833_0031_100937CA40650360"/>
The only difficulty that now remained was, to make it known to his father, which he determined to do in three or four days after their marriage, but firſt wrote to La Faril. In the letter he incloſed a conſiderable preſent, and ſent it by a friend who was going that way, as he was certain every method would be taken to intercept any letters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to him, as La Faril lay under the greateſt ſuſpicion in point of concealing his ſon, as well as ſignor Maſerini.</p>
                     <p>The day arrived on which he was to pay a viſit to his father. He begged his ſiſter to ſtay with Clementina, as ſhe would be in want of company, and was a ſtranger to the place. He ſet off early in the morning, and, after ſome hours' quick travelling, during which time his ideas were entirely taken up in thinking of his father, and in what manner he ſhould be received, he arrived at the large hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy gates of the abbey. With a trembling hand he pulled the bell, but could not hear it ring. After another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, he found the wire was ruſty; yet it made a noiſe. A thought ſtruck him, which chilled him with horror—his father might be dead!—for he made himſelf known to no one ſince his coming to Italy, but his friend who carried the letter to La Faril; and he could give no intelligence concerning his friends, as he arrived the ſame night as ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Maſerini, from Spain, was taken ill, and did not go out till he proceeded on his journey to England, when he promiſed to leave the letter as he went through France.</p>

                     <p>Signor Maſerini turned pale; the bridle dropped from his hand, and he muſt have fallen upon the ground, had he not been received into the arms of the villager.</p>
                     <p>"You are not well, ſir," ſaid the man, as he placed him on a ſeat under the large heavy portico of the abbey.—"Lubin, run and get the gentleman ſome water from yonder ſpring."</p>

He informed the peaſant he was a diſtant relation of the late count, and was come upon a viſit to the abbey; that the hearing ſo ſuddenly of his death had quite overcome him.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, your honour," replied the man, "there has been ſtrange doings for theſe laſt ſix months; heaven knows beſt;—but one cannot be hanged for thinking, as the ſaying is."</p>

                     <p>"If you will ſtep with me to my cot, ſignor, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to you the circumſtances that have happened. My wife expects me home to dinner, as I muſt return, in leſs than an hour, to my labour in yonder vineyard"</p>
                     <p>He readily aſſented; and having walked a ſmall diſtance, they arrived at his habitation. The horſe was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a field When they entered the cottage, a neat middle-aged woman was preparing dinner: they wiſhed much their gueſt would partake of their homely fare; but he could not eat.—They had not reſided in that part above ſix

months, therefore knew nothing of ſignor Maſerini's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon He conjured the man to begin his narration; and the honeſt huſbandman complied, as follows:—</p>
                     <p>"You, no doubt, ſignor, were acquainted with young Percival Maſerini and his ſiſter Siſera, the only children of the late count. Twelve months have not yet paſſed ſince they both took leave of their father at that very abbey, and travelled into France, on account of ſome buſineſs which required Percival's attendance at court, as Louis XIV had juſt then aſcended the throne. Siſera was to be placed in the convent of N****, while her brother ſtaid, which they ſuppoſed would not be above four months; and then they were to return together. The count for ſome time received letters from them both: but though the buſineſs which cauſed their journey was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the expiration of the four months, they did not by any means ſeem inclined to return to Italy; and, in a little while after, their correſpondence dropped; for though letters were continually ſent to them, no anſwers were received.</p>
                     <p>"This gave the count great alarm, and he wrote to a principal perſon near the place, concerning them. In a little time he received information that his ſon had run away with a young lady from the convent of N****, where he had placed his ſiſter; that ſhe alſo had eloped with them, as well as the ſervant who ſtopped with Percival in France: he concluded with ſaying, the ſtricteſt ſearch was making after them, as it was ſuppoſed the young lady had poiſoned her ſiſter, who was placed in the convent with her, had taken the white veil, and was found dead in her bed the morning after her departure.</p>
                     <p>"This news, ſignor, was like a thunderbolt to the old count: he had not a doubt but they would be taken.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035833_0034_10093C9BF71E9C68"/>
From that day he drooped, and in about a week after was laid up with a violent fever. Count D'Ollifont, his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, was ſent for." Here Percival trembled: he knew D'Ollifont to be his enemy. The man continued—"He attended his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This news cauſed a relapſe in the old gentleman's diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Nor was it he alone who ſuffered: every domeſtic of his houſehold, ſignor, ſhed tears for the loſs of two ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able children, who were never known to give a tender parent one pang of ſorrow, except in this circumſtance, and that coſt them their lives."</p>
                     <p>"Would it had!" repeated ſignor Maſerini to himſelf. "That ever I ſhould have lived to have ſeen this day!"</p>
                     <p>The woman was too much employed in cooking her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's dinner, and the huſband too much taken up in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and telling the ſtory, to take any particular notice of him; or elſe the inward workings of his ſoul might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have been obſerved. The man continued:—</p>

"The old count now grew conſiderably worſe; his phyſicians gave him over, and, in about a week after his relapſe, he died of a broken heart. when he heard of the death of his children, he altered his will; the ſervants were all left mourning, and a genteel legacy; old Abſalom a comfortable allowance for life; his tenants a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month's rent; except which, and a few other legacies, he bequeathed the whole of his fortune to count D'Ollifont.

                     <p>"How happened that, my friend?"</p>
                     <p>"I know not, your honour; but folks ſay ſtrange things—that there has been ſoul play, and that the place is haunted by the father and his children; but it is known for certain, that count D'Ollifont intended to ſleep there the night o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Signor Maſerini inquired if he himſelf had ever ſeen any thing at the abbey to confirm the reports of its being haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and how he came to be ſo particularly acquainted with thoſe affairs relative to its late inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>"Why, by old Abſalom the ſteward, ſignor," anſwered the man.

                     <p>Signor Maſerini was in this ſtate while the huſbandman related to him the account of his father, and the villainy of count D'Ollifont. His aſtoniſhment was ſo great, that the death of the former, and the total loſs of his fortune, were entirely forgotten, and he thought only on the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood his couſin had propagated. He left the cottage; his horſe took his own courſe for ſome time; nor did he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he was entering by degrees into a thick wood, till ſome trees obſtructed his way; he leaped from his horſe, and threw himſelf on the ground; the thoughts of his ſituation now flaſhed on his memory, and the loſs of his father he regretted with the moſt ſincere grief. The impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which had been put in practice to deprive him and his ſiſter of their fortunes, excited both his ſurpriſe and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035833_0037_10093C5386295CB0"/>
anger; in ſhort, the different emotions he felt, almoſt drove him to a ſtate of diſtraction.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation he remained for near two hours, till, harraſſed through diſtreſs and fatigue, he fell into a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Horrid dreams diſturbed him, and his ſleep was both uneaſy and diſagreeable; yet he remained in this ſtate of forgetfulneſs till it was nearly dark: he ſtarted up and mounted his horſe, which had not moved from his ſide; he remembered he had promiſed Clementina and his ſiſter to be at home early in the evening; but that would now be impoſſible, as the wood was intricate, nor was he acquainted with the way out. He wandered about in ſearch of the right path for near two hours, but was unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, till chance led him to the direct track: he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and in a little time found himſelf clear of the laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. He was very ill, and hardly able to ride; the cold had ſeized him by being ſo long in the open air; he, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, continued a good pace till he once more found himſelf before the gates of Graſville Abbey.</p>
                     <p>The night was very dark, the thunder rolled at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and faint flaſhes of lightning followed one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with conſiderable quickneſs; he ſtopped once more to look at the place where he had ſpent ſo many happy juvenile hours, and where he had that day hoped to have been received with cordiality and tenderneſs. He had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the reverſe; he had found his father was no more, and that he had been duped out of his right by one who was allied to him by the ties of blood, and, as he had ſuppoſed, by thoſe of friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>A tear fell from his eye while he looked on the venerable ſtructure, every part of which ſeemed deſerted; a gloomy ſtillneſs reigned through the heavy pile, nor was the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſilence broke but by the bird of night, which had
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035833_0038_10093CA39DC2E198"/>
taken up its habitation under one part of the pòrtico. The idea of the place being haunted now entered his imagination.</p>
                     <p>"Would to heaven," ſaid he, "the report I have heard was true, that I might be permitted to converſe, nay, only to ſee, the ſpirit of my ſire! ſurely he would—"</p>
                     <p>Here he was interrupted by a ſtong flaſh of lightning, which darted right on his face, and was followed b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Though he was ſtruck ſilent, his eye was ſtill fixed on the abbey; the noiſe of the thunder had not died away above three minutes before a violent craſh was heard at the other part of the building; it ſeemed like the falling of armour, and continued for ſome little time.</p>
                     <p>Signor Maſerini was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment; horror and expectation ſeized him at the ſame moment; he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his horſe round, and rode to the ſide whence the noiſe ſeemed to proceed; all again was ſilent, yet he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued locking on the place. It was by the weſt tower—he recollected the account he had heard of the light being ſeen there. At the moment he was thinking on this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, a faint glimmering paſſed a ſmall caſement in the very part of the weſt tower the woman had deſcribed. His ſituation may be more eaſily imagined than deſcribed: He was a perfect ſtatue with aſtoniſhment; ſtill he thought it might be fancy; but he was thoroughly convinced, when a ſtronger light appeared in the ſame place a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes afterwards, but diſappeared in an inſtant. Every nerve was ſtiffened with horror; he ſtill drew nearer that part of the abbey; five minutes had not elapſed before the light again appeared in the ſame place; he now plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived a figure paſs, bearing a lamp; it vaniſhed as quick as the former light had done, and all again was ſilent and dark.</p>

                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:035833_0039_10093C564F6E8BD8"/>
His paſſions were now wrought up to the higheſt pitch; he galloped round to the front gates, alighted, and in vain attempted to enter the abbey; every entrance was ſtrongly faſtened; his brain was diſordered, and he ſtill continued to force the doors; but, after a long time, finding his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions all in vain, he again mounted his horſe, and rode as faſt as poſſible towards his own home.</p>

                     <p>SIGNORA Maſerini waited with impatience the return of her brother; ſhe wiſhed much to hear of her father's health, and in what manner he received the account of Clementina: nor was Clementina leſs anxious; her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were depreſſed, ſhe trembled for fear of ill news, yet the vivacity of her ſiſter-in-law ſupported her tolerably well through the day.

                     <p>A little while after midnight, a loud rap was heard at the door: Edward flew to open it; neither Siſera nor Clementina could aſk who it was, before ſignor Maſerini ſtood before them: his appearance for a moment ſtruck them motionleſs with ſurpriſe; nor was it to be wondered a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Well," he exclaimed; "but if you wiſh to know, Siſera, aſk the angels in heaven: they beſt can tell thee."</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſhe cried, and burſt into tears: "my father is no more; I know it by thy looks—by the ſtrange an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers you give to my queſtions."</p>
                     <p>"You are right," ſaid he: "our father has paid the debt of nature."</p>
                     <p>He ſeemed now rather more compoſed; yet complained of violent pains in his head and limbs. Signora Maſerini grieved much for the loſs of her father: ſhe could get no further intelligence from her brother's diſcourſe, which was very incoherent and difficult to be underſtood, but that her father was no more, and they were duped out of their right; but by whom, and in what manner, ſhe could not poſſibly find out. He talked much of an appearance he had ſeen in the abbey; but they looked upon it as the effect of a diſordered brain.</p>
                     <p>The morning found them ſtill more diſtreſſed.

Clementina and Siſera anxiouſly inquired the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's opinion; he told them he had a very violent fever, and ſome very alarming ſymptoms; nor could he give any ſatisfactory anſwer concerning what might be the iſſue of his diſorder: he however aſſured them he would do all in his power to forward his recovery.</p>
                     <p>They both returned him their ſincere thanks. Siſera begged to know how the report concerning their death could be believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the particulars of her father's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, as ſhe ſuppoſed he attended him in his illneſs.

An illneſs of ſome days followed the ſudden ſhock ſhe felt at the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician's recital; for though no proof could have been brought to confirm ſo terrible a charge, yet ſhe ſhuddered at the thought of the diſtreſs and horror it would have occaſioned her. They now wondered not at Percival's ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035833_0042_10093CA8A16D7AD8"/>
and ſuppoſed his talking ſo much about the light and appearance in the abbey, was occaſioned by the report of its being haunted.</p>
                     <p>New difficulties now perplexed them: a week had elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no ſigns of amendment appeared in ſignor Maſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni's diſorder; yet all their money was nearly exhauſted. In this dilemma they reſolved to apply to the phyſician; he immediately lent them as much as they deſired; and if at any time they ſhould want more, begged they would ſpeak, and he would accommodate them.</p>
                     <p>In about a month ſignor Maſerini began to alter for the better; he talked more rationally, and by degrees gained ſtrength; in ſix weeks he was able to leave the room, and ſoon after, by the aſſiduity and judgment of the doctor, found himſelf nearly as well as ever. He returned the good man a thouſand thanks for his care and friendſhip, and hoped it would ſoon be in his power to repay him the ſum he had ſent them: he alſo begged him to contradict, as much as poſſible, the ſcandalous report his couſin had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, and make it known that he now intended to live by the practice of his pencil. The phyſician promiſed to comply with his wiſhes, and aſſured him he ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf happy to ſerve him in any reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Signor Maſerini paid a viſit to the old uncle, at whoſe death he was to receive the fortune before mentioned;—he was aſtoniſhed at the ſight of him; railed at count D'Ollifont for his villainy, and teſtified the greateſt joy at ſeeing his nephew.</p>
                     <p>Percival now began to apply himſelf to his profeſſion; he was ſoon known, but received with coldneſs by thoſe who once called themſelves his friends; his abilities, however, gained him patrons, and his induſtry preſerved them. He was in a little time able to diſcharge his debt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035833_0043_10093C5E1B54A0B8"/>

He determined, however, if poſſible, to retrieve ſome part of his father's fortune, yet reſolved not to act raſhly, but proceed by a due courſe of law. In the firſt place, he wiſhed much to ſee the inſide of the abbey: this took up a great deal of time; he was near three months before he could get a ſanction to enter it: he had then to ſend to Spain for the keys, as count D'Ollifont had them in his poſſeſſion, nor would he give them up without great trouble; in ſhort, it was near ſix months before he could gratify his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The light and figure he had ſeen in the weſt tower continually haunted his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and though he was not by any means ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, yet many diſagreeable ideas ſerved to perplex him; he, however, never mentioned the circumſtance to any one ſince the recovery of his reaſon; not even to his wife or ſiſter; as he naturally ſuppoſed it would prey upon their ſpirits, and make them fearful of ſearching the abbey, which he was determined to do alone.

                     <p>SIGNOR Maſerini did not intend to enter the building that night; yet curioſity prompted him to take a view of the weſt tower. He accordingly diſmounted, and told Edward to hold his horſe at the front gates, while he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the abbey. Having arrived at that part where he had before ſeen the figure and the light, he ſtood ſome time obſerving the window, when a faint glimmering paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſmall caſement a little above it. He thought it might be fancy, yet in about two minutes ſaw it again; His reſolution was now fixed; he reſolved to enter the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey directly; having returned to Edward, without commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating his reaſon, he ordered him to open the gates immediately.</p>
                     <p>The poor fellow was aſtoniſhed, and naturally ſuppoſed his maſter's head was again affected. "For heaven's ſake, ſir," ſaid he, "do not attempt to enter ſuch a drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place at this time of night, and in the dark."</p>
                     <p>"Your light, Edward," returned his maſter, "will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>erve me; therefore open the gates without delay."</p>
                     <p>The man reluctantly produced the keys: great exertion was required to turn the lock; it however, after ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-time, yielded to force, and they beheld themſelves in the large paved court. Edward faſtened the horſes on the outſide; at the front doors they were again detained on account of the faſtenings being ruſty; but after a little trouble they opened them, and diſcovered the large hall or entrance of the abbey: it was ſupported by columns of the ancient orders, and arched over in the Gothic ſtyle; at the farther end were a pair of heavy folding doors, which led to an extenſive ſuite of apartments; on each ſide wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

a flight of ſtone ſtairs, which wound round to the different rooms on both ſides of the building.</p>
                     <p>Graſville Abbey was an ancient ſtructure, and had, in former times, been a place of religious worſhip. Some monks, at a time when Italy was involved in war, kept themſelves concealed in this place, on account of atrocious crimes they had committed againſt the ſtate, by keeping up a correſpondence with the enemies of their country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were all diſcovered except one, who ſecreted himſelf in an obſcure part of the abbey, while his companions ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the moſt ſevere puniſhment that could poſſibly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them. Their only aim was now to deſtroy the ſurviving one; they accordingly found means to mix a large quantity of poiſon in ſome food which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and which they obſerved he partook of every day. The ſcheme ſucceeded, and he fell a ſacrifice to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; for they found the victuals after that time were never touched. He died, however, in that part where he uſually reſided, for his body was not diſcovered till many years after; and the abbey from that time was called after his name.</p>
                     <p>The late count Maſerini's father purchaſed the eſtate juſt before his marriage, and had the whole of the internal part repaired; from him it deſcended to his ſon, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in it the remainder of his life. Signor Maſerini plainly perceived nothing had been moved in the hall, as every article was in the ſame order as if the place was in habited, and his father ſtill the poſſeſſor of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the appearance of the furniture plainly told it had been taken no care of for ſome time. He began to aſcend thoſe ſtairs which led to the weſt tower.</p>
                     <p>Edward followed: but his maſter, after ſome little time, ſuddenly turned round, and deſired he would wait below
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035833_0046_10093CAF6F2F1DE8"/>
and take care of the horſes. The man begged of him with tears, not to go alone. Signor Maſerini was pleaſed with this mark of his fidelity, and haſtily replied—"However ſtrange, Edward, my conduct may appear to you at this time, believe me, I have the moſt weighty reaſons to juſtify my behaviour; and, if I live to return, you ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them."</p>
                     <p>He then ran up ſtairs—and, ſtrange as it may appear, was never ſeen again.</p>
                     <p>Edward ſtood for ſome time fixed with amazement—there was a myſtery in his words and looks, which plainly told all was not right. He heard him aſcend the ſtairs for ſome time, till the ſound of his footſteps died away, and all was again ſilent: he then walked ſlowly acroſs the court, and ſeated himſelf under the portico; the night was not by any means cold; he therefore choſe that place in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the inſide of the abbey, as he was near the horſes. Sleep in a ſhort time overpowered him, and he did not wake till two in the morning:—he thought it ſtrange his maſter was not returned, but waited another hour with ſome degree of impatience; at the expiration of it he was ſeriouſly alarmed; yet to enter the abbey without a light, would be madneſs; he ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fore reſolved to defer it till day-break.</p>
                     <p>Edward had heard of the abbey's being haunted, yet he always laughed at the idea; his natural courage and intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity forbid his believing ſuch fabulous reports: the only reaſon he could alledge for his maſter's ſtay, was, that the wind might have blown out the lamp when he was at ſome intricate part of the building; and in that caſe it would have been impoſſible for him to have found his way back, there being ſeveral ſuites of apartments which were never inhabited in the count's life-time, and which ſignor Maſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini might hardly ever have ſeen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:035833_0047_10093C6161ADA0B8"/>
As ſoon as it was light he again croſſed the court, and aſcended thoſe ſtairs which his maſter had done before; he followed the marks of his feet up a conſiderable height, and then traced them through ſeveral rooms that led to the weſt tower: one of theſe, which was rather larger than the others, was covered with footſteps of different ſizes; and in one part of it lay the picture of Clementina, which ſignor Mazerini always wore next his heart; the ribband to which it was tied ſeemed as if it had been torn by force, and the boards were ſtained with ſeveral ſpots of blood. There was not in any other apartment the leaſt mark of a foot, nor any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igns of their having been opened.</p>
                     <p>Edward was aſtoniſhed; he almoſt ſuppoſed himſelf in a dream; yet every object realized the ſcene. He knew not in what manner to act; to ſtop any longer in the abbey was of no uſe; yet to whom was he to apply!—He at length reſolved to go immediately to the phyſician, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to him the circumſtance, as he would be the propereſt perſon to adviſe with concerning thoſe meaſures they ought to take relative to ſignor Maſerini's diſappearance, as well as in what manner they ſhould proceed in communicating the news to his wife and ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>Edward took up the picture, and placed it carefully in his pocket; he then deſcended the ſtair-caſe, and cloſed the doors after him; but determined to lock neither them nor the outſide gates. Having placed his maſter's horſe in one of the ſtables belonging to the abbey, and mounting his own, he departed with the utmoſt ſpeed towards the houſe of the phyſician.</p>

                     <p>EDWARD found himſelf at the end of his journey in a few hours. Fortunately, the good man was at home, and heard his recital with the utmoſt conſternation and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; he by no means approved of either the wife or ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being informed of this dreadful news, till it was more fully confirmed; and having, from the ſervant's account, obtained two officers of the civil power to thoroughly ſearch the building, he reſolved to attend them himſelf; and they ſet off in leſs than three hours after Edward's arrival.</p>
                     <p>The evening was advancing, when they beheld at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the lofty towers of the abbey; they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obliged to defer their intention till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Neither Clementina nor Siſera expected ſignor Maſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini's return till the evening following the day he left his lodgings. Edward, therefore, informed the phyſician they would not be unhappy though they ſhould receive no intelligence from them. As ſoon as it was light they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the abbey, attended by a workman who was able to remove any kind of intricate wood work which might tend to a diſcovery. They firſt examined all thoſe apartments that led to the weſt tower, and which, by the marks of the footſteps, ſeemed as if ſignor Maſerini had croſſed them: they plainly perceived the ſpots of blood, but could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver no other mark or clue to their wiſhes, in either of the rooms. They then ſearched each part on that ſide of the building; but their diligence proved unſucceſsful: in ſhort, every receſs of the abbey was looked into with the moſt ſcrutinizing attention, yet not the leaſt ſign could be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035833_0049_10093C65D3673190"/>
diſcovered that indicated a mortal to have been in the place, except <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he footſteps and the blood. They were all at a loſs what to ſuppoſe; and about evening they finiſhed their ſearch, and left the abbey more perplexed than when they entered it. Edward took his maſter's horſe from the ſtable, and ſhut the gates, but determined to leave them, as before, unlocked.</p>
                     <p>After a haſty meal, the phyſician, two officers and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſet off for the former's habitation: it was very late before they arrived there; the men were liberally reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their trouble. Edward then conſulted what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod would be the moſt prudent, to inform the ladies of this mournful event; the old gentleman undertook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the diſagreeable office of communicating it to them the next morning; it was therefore agreed that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at his houſe till the affair was over. They then took leave for the night, the one grieved for the loſs of his young friend, whom he had loved and admired from his infancy; the other for an excellent maſter, whom he had revered and ſerved from his cradle.</p>
                     <p>To deſcribe the ſituation of Clementina and Siſera at the phyſician's recital, though he related the dreadful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance by degrees, and with the utmoſt caution, would beggar deſcription; it will therefore be neceſſary to draw a ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l over this affecting ſcene; and ſuffice it to ſay, their grief was little ſhort of diſtraction. The extraordinary manner of ſignor Maſerini's diſappearance left room for the moſt horrid ſuppoſitions, whilſt the faint hope which the uncertainty of his diſſolution inſpired, ſerved to make each cruel idea more terrible and laſting. Clementina's ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, if poſſible, more dreadful than her ſiſter's, as ſhe was in a ſtrange country, and ſome time gone with child. The phyſician acted like a father to them both, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035833_0050_10093CB3881BD610"/>
that while he lived they ſhould never want a friend.</p>
                     <p>The wonderful event of ſignor Maſerini's diſapearance was ſoon ſpread over the country. Graſville Abbey was now become a place of much greater terror than before, as thoſe ſuſpicions of its being haunted ſeemed in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to be confirmed; none of the peaſants would go near it after dark; in ſhort, every inhabitant was ſurpriſed and terrified.</p>
                     <p>Six weeks had not elapſed, before ſignor Maſerini's uncle died; the fortune now devolved to his ſiſter: a more lucky circumſtance could not have happened, as ſhe would have it in her power to ſupport Clementina and herſelf in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel and comfortable manner, without remaining under the leaſt obligation to any one in point of pecuniary aid; and the phyſician undertook to ſettle thoſe affairs relative to the old gentleman's death.</p>
                     <p>In a little time, every thing was completed, and ſhe found herſelf in poſſeſſion of not only a moderate, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent income. Signora Maſerini now determi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed to make the life of her ſiſter-in-law as agreeable as poſſible; ſhe knew that Clementina wiſhed much to return to her own country; nor had Siſera any deſire to remain in Italy, where every object reminded her of her late misfortunes; ſhe therefore reſolved, after Clementina was brought to bed, to conſult if ſome method could not be taken to clear her innocence in reſpect to Felicia's death, and a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought about with the lady abbeſs, ſo that they could, without impropriety, reſide totally in France.</p>
                     <p>Clementina was delivered of twins, a boy and girl. For ſome time her life was deſpaired of, although the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the phyſician and the tenderneſs of Siſera were equally exerted towards her recovery; but in ſix weeks, to
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035833_0051_10093C6B0E5A5CB8"/>
the joy of both, ſhe ſo far mended as to be pronounced out of danger.</p>
                     <p>Signora Maſerini now reſolved to aſk the doctor's opinion concerning their appearance in France. He offered to go himſelf to the convent of N****, and, if poſſible, to ſettle with her ladyſhip thoſe diſagreeable circumſtances that had cauſed her diſpleaſure</p>
                     <p>Siſera returned him many thanks, and accepted his friendly aſſiſtance. They, however, reſolved to let Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina know nothing of it, till the buſineſs was finiſhed: an excuſe was therefore made for his leaving Italy, and his journey to France ſaid to be on account of family affairs, which he had to tranſact in that country.—He was ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to return in a very ſhort time, with the agreeable intelligence, that Clementina's character was entirely clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reſpecting her ſiſter's death, and all their affairs ſettled at the convent, in an amicable manner.—This gave Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina as much pleaſure as it was poſſible for her to enjoy; every thing was ready in a few weeks; the parting with the phyſician was affecting on both ſides; to ſpeak of their obligations to him would, they knew, be the only way to make him repent of his goodneſs:—they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſitated to expreſs their gratitude in as few words as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>A houſe was prepared for them in a private part of Paris, and every thing made ready for their reception.—In this ſtate they lived for ſome years, and enjoyed as much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the remembrance of thoſe misfortunes they had ſuffered, would permit.—The children were their greateſt care; they ſerved in ſome degree to diſpel that melancholy which had taken ſo deep a root in their boſoms ſince ſignor Maſerini's diſappearance.</p>

Graſville Abbey remained in the ſame condition, except the gradual and ſlow decay of the external part: it was taken no notice of by its owner, while fear and ſuperſtition prevented any interruption from thoſe who reſided near i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Alfred and Matilda were now obliged to exert their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh abilities, to comfort their mother for the loſs of her only friend; ſhe had often made repeated ſolicitations to be admitted to her father's favour; but the marquis was obſtinate, and complained of her elopement from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as an excuſe for his cruelty.—Her whole attention was, therefore, paid to her children; and through a fond yet miſtaken notion, ſhe impaired her income, by giving them an education far ſuperior to any ſituation in life ſhe could ever hope to procure them; they, however, rewarded her love in the tenderneſs of their conduct towards her, and the quickneſs of their capacity in receiving thoſe inſtructions that were given them.</p>
                     <p>Alfred already ſhowed a wiſh for the army; his mother determined not to check his inclinations, though ſhe dreaded the dangers he might be expoſed to:—ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purchaſed a commiſſion for him, and he ſoon after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for Flanders, where the regiment was ſtationed.</p>
                     <p>Madame Maſerini had never informed her children of the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035833_0053_10093C6EE9386610"/>
dreadful manner in which their father diſappeared; ſhe conſidered it might impreſs their young minds with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which might caſt a gloom over the brighter ſcenes of life; they were therefore always taught to believe ſigner Maſerini was killed by a fall from his horſe, when hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor was there any probability to ſuppoſe the real cauſe would ever be diſcovered to them, as neither Clementina nor Siſera had informed any one to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>About ſix months after her ſon's departure, madame Maſerini was taken ill; for ſome time it was thought only a ſlight diſorder, but afterwards confirmed to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.—The moſt eminent phyſicians were procured; but their exertions proved fruitleſs.—She now wiſhed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to her ſon that which ſhe had ſo ſtudiouſly kept from him; ſhe determined, however, not to relate it to Matilda, as the ſurpriſe and ſhock would be too great for her; this cauſed madame Maſerini to wiſh ſo much to ſee Alfred, which was before mentioned; he did not, however, arrive till her diſſolution.</p>

                     <p>This was Alfred's argument to his ſiſter, as he tenderly conjured her to moderate her grief, and look upon him not only as a brother, but as a guardian and protector.</p>

                     <p>Alfred was almoſt petrified with aſtoniſhment and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; the fatal name, ſo near being known, was not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: his mother's ſenſes might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He reſolved for the preſent to conceal this from his ſiſter; ſhe had already ſuffered enough by her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death: to inform her, therefore, of the contents of the writing, would only occaſion new ſorrow and diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>The next morning Matilda eagerly inquired the purport of her mother's letter: ſhe was ſhocked to ſee him look ſo ill, but naturally ſuppoſed he had not reſted well. Alfred told her it was a memorandum relative to her fortune, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Alfred gave orders for his mother's funeral, and had her handſomely interred. He then conſulted with his ſiſter in what manner ſhe meant to proceed with the ſmall ſum ſhe was now poſſeſſed of. Madame Maſerini had equally divided her fortune between them, but always particularly recommended Matilda to her brother's care; he therefore generouſly determined to add half of his to his ſiſter's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035833_0056_10093CBD2B90D8E8"/>
but firſt wiſhed to ſettle her in ſome genteel ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before he returned to his regiment.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, after ſome perſuaſions, promiſed Matilda he would write to the marquis of ****, their grandfather, to inform him of his daughter's death, and her ſituation. She conſidered, as lady Eleanor had been dead ſome time, and his hopes concerning her marriage entirely at an end, that he might receive her with ſome degree of tenderneſs, though he never would look upon their mother.</p>
                     <p>The young ſoldier felt himſelf hurt, to write a letter of ſupplication to a man who had behaved ſo inhumanly to his own daughter, and ſlightingly to himſelf and ſiſter; however, the idea of Matilda's welfare quenched thoſe ſparks of pride which had before kindled in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
                     <p>About a week after madame Maſerini's funeral, he ſent the following letter, in which might be obſerved a kind of inward diſdain, not likely to move or gain upon the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a man ſo utterly void of ſenſibility as the marquis.</p>

But, if poſſible, my lord, a more forcible reaſon urged me to intrude on your patience; it is to ſupplicate a ſmall ſhare of that favour and protection for my ſiſter Matilda Maſerini, which her mother was ſo unfortunate as never to receive. Your lordſhip muſt naturally ſuppoſe my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in life prevents me from affording her that attention ſo neceſſary at her preſent age and ſituation; the ſervice of my country will in a very ſhort time call me to Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; otherwiſe, I ſhould glory to make it known to your lordſhip and the world, that I could prove myſelf her guardian and protector, without remaining under an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to either relations or friends.</p>

                     <p>Alfred ſhowed it her; it was his own letter returned. They had heard that a prieſt was the conſtant companion of the marquis, and that it was ſuppoſed he would ſtand a chance for ſome part of his patron's wealth: but the meſſenger informed them that father Laurence entirely liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the caſtle, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The only perſon they now had to apply to, was a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in England, a diſtant relation of their mother's: he had been ſent over to this country by an uncle, on af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs relative to the family. The old gentleman died while he was in London, and left him a ſmall fortune. After this event, he determined to ſettle in the city, and commenced buſineſs in the liquor trade: he firſt kept wine-vaults; from that roſe a ſtep higher, and was called a wine merchant; in this line he accumulated a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deal of money by importing foreign goods to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. To add to his good fortune, he one year received a prize of ten thouſand pounds from the lottery; and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years after married an heireſs whoſe fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to three times that ſum.</p>

                     <p>MADAME Maſerini had received repeated ſolicitations from her relation to viſit him in London; ſhe, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a few months after Siſera's death, determined to ſee England, conſidering it might diſpel the melancholy that event had occaſioned her: the children ſhe committed to the care of a faithful ſervant, during her ſtay, which was about two months. Mr. Peviquil had not then quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted buſineſs. She received the moſt polite and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attention both from him and his lady, and reſided totally at their houſe while ſhe remained in this country. She always ſince that time had ſpoken of them to Alfred and Matilda, as people well worthy their eſteem, and had often regretted their living ſo far diſtant as to make their ſociety impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>Since his mother's death, Alfred had received a letter of condolence from ſir Peter, who had accidentally heard the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035833_0061_10093C7AE96D7800"/>
news from a friend; this letter contained a kind and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing invitation for them to ſpend a few months in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: which offer they were now reſolved to accept, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Alfred could obtain leave of abſence long enough, and permiſſion to quit his country. This, through inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, he accompliſhed, on condition he ſhould be ready to return at a ſhort notice.</p>
                     <p>Matilda, little uſed to the gaiety of the world, though ſhe had nearly all her life reſided in a city renowned for its luxury &amp; diſſipation, conſidered that if ſhe was pleaſed with ſir Peter's family, by paying a ſmall gratuity ſhe could reſide with them without any inconvenience. This was, in ſome degree, Alfred's opinion; but he was much better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with mankind, and the dangers that attended a faſhionable life, to view this ſcheme in ſo pleaſing a light as his ſiſter. He well knew the diſſipated life of intrigue, and other vices, ſo cloſely followed by moſt of the Engliſh circles; he had been neceſſitated, in ſome reſpects, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of thoſe follies in Paris, which he knew were daily practiſed in London; and his ſoul ſickened at the thought of leaving Matilda expoſed to ſuch dangers, friendleſs and unprotected. Poſſeſſed of that nice ſenſe of honour which is ſuppoſed to conſtitute the ſoldier and the gentleman, it in ſome reſpect ſerved to make his life uncomfortable. Generous to a great degree, he was never ſo happy as when he could make others ſo; but a haughty and ſtubborn pride hurt him when he received an obligation. Ready to take an affront, and as ready to reſent it, he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſagreeable company; yet his perſon, behaviour, and character, procured him admittance to the firſt parties.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was totally unacquainted with the vices of the great; her mother had only kept up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

elegant without affectation; her deportment graceful, yet eaſy; and her accompliſhments by no means inferior to the firſt ranks of life. Yet her ideas of the world in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral were entirely ill founded: ſhe judged of others by herſelf, and had ſo little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After ſome perſuaſions of his ſiſter, Alfred determined to anſwer ſir Peter's letter, with an acceptance of his kind invitation. The ſame day month was fixed for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; and that period of time was fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Matilda was all expectation, yet a deep melancholy ſtill clouded her future proſpects; the loſs of her mother prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much on her ſpirits; and while her eye beamed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at the idea of ſeeing London and gay life, a watery gem would oft intrude, and dim its luſtre, when ſhe conſidered the diſtance ſhe ſhould be from the tomb of a parent whom ſhe had ſo dearly loved, and whoſe memory ſhe ſo much revered. Alfred was ſilent and thoughtful; his ſpirits were fled; the contents of the paper written by his mother ſerved to perplex and diſtreſs him, while his anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the welfare of his ſiſter continually preyed upon his mind. As the time drew nearer for their leaving Paris, he became leſs pleaſed with the plan on which they were going to proceed. He had always heard his mother ſpeak highly of the family; but their ſituation in life at that time was entirely different from the preſent.—Tho' in a capital <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035833_0063_100937C8B7A4FEC0"/>
on their being ſo, he entirely placed his hopes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Matilda's making one of their family.</p>
                     <p>Sir Peter's letter was extremely friendly; to have refuſed what he ſo earneſtly requeſted, would not only have been impolite behaviour, but would, without doubt, have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.—This mode of reaſoning, in ſome degree, leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſquietude; yet he reſolved within himſelf not to leave his ſiſter in England, without being certain her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſtrictly accordant both with propriety and honour.</p>
                     <p>The day of their departure at length arrived,—Matilda, as they paſſed through the gates of the city, bid a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly adieu to her native country.—The recollection of thoſe happy juvenile hours ſhe had enjoyed with a parent whoſe tenderneſs and maternal fondneſs ſhe never more could experience, added to her ideas of the friendleſs ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and unprotected condition ſhe would be left in when parted from her brother, entirely overcame that fortitude ſhe had ſhewn at the beginning of their journey; and, almoſt convulſed with grief, ſhe burſt into an agony of tears.</p>
                     <p>Alfred raiſed his head from a reverie which he had been in from their firſt ſetting off; he conjured his ſiſter to be compoſed, and once more tenderly aſſured her of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.—A poſt carriage conveyed them from Paris to Calais; an elderly man attended them, who had lived in the capacity of a ſervant with their mother, ſince the death of Edward; he was by birth an Engliſhman, though he chiefly had reſided in France.</p>
                     <p>They were neceſſitated to wait ſome time for the packet-boat; Matilda, therefore, who was much indiſpoſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to take a few hours' reſt, while Alfred looked over ſome papers of his mother's, which were in a ſmall trunk.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:035833_0064_10093CC89AB65D18"/>
Matilda had not yet examined it, ſuppoſing it to be full of waſte papers, which were of no conſequence; ſhe only brought it with her to hold a few articles of dreſs when ſhe arrived in London.</p>
                     <p>After having removed a few of the upper papers, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a miniature of his mother; it was the ſame which Edward found in the abbey, and had the identical piece of ribband hanging to the ring, the remaining part of which had ſeemingly been broken by force, or by a ſudden ſhock. Alfred looked on the reſemblance with attention; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the features of his departed mother, with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy pleaſure, and ſighed at the idea that he never more ſhould look on the original.—Cloſe to it was the picture of his father.—Alfred had always been told he was extremely like him, and for the firſt time thought ſo himſelf.—Both he and his ſiſter had often ſeen the miniatures before their mother's illneſs, and after her death every place was ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, but to no purpoſe; nor had they the leaſt idea of their being placed in this trunk.</p>
                     <p>Alfred carefully looked over the papers, and found none of them worth notice, till he had nearly emptied them all out upon the table, when a roll of parchment, with the name of Siſera Maſerini at the bottom, ſtruck his eye. He immediately peruſed it, and found it was written by his aunt, about ſix months before her death.—It contained an account of their misfortunes, from his father's firſt ſeeing his mother at the convent, till their return to France, and every minute particular relative to ſignor Maſerini's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Graſville Abbey, and his diſappearance. She alſo at one part ſeemed to ſuſpect his couſin, count D'Ollifont, to be privy to the affair, though he was then in Spain.</p>
                     <p>Alfred's emotion and aſtoniſhment were paſt deſcription; he burnt with eager deſire to ſee the inſide of the abbey;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035833_0065_10093C7E20272BB0"/>
but that would now be impoſſible, till he ſhould return to France. He knew not how to revenge the loſs of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as no proof could be brought to charge any one with the guilt;—yet, according to what he had read, he could not avoid ſuppoſing that the count was concerned: nor was there a doubt but his mother alſo intended to have written the ſame name.</p>
                     <p>He carefully placed the manuſcript in a private drawer of his own, and determined not to inform his ſiſter of the event, as her ſpirits were already agitated enough, without any new ſource for horror of diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe roſe, he agreeably ſurpriſed her by the diſcovery of the pictures, and informed her he had looked over the papers in the trunk, and could find none but frivolous frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of no uſe or conſequence.</p>
                     <p>They were obliged to remain at the place till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next day; they then croſſed over to Dover, and ſlept there that night. Matilda was yet much indiſpoſed, partly occaſioned by ſea-ſickneſs. The next evening, after a fatiguing day of poſt travelling, they found themſelves at a principal inn at London.</p>

oppreſſive ideas, by taking a retroſpect of the calamiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s that may attend futurity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ideas ſink our ſpirits under new horrors and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; imagination preſents to the fancy troubles and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows we are never likely to experience.</p>
                     <p>To be too confident of our ſucceſs and abilities at the firſt out-ſet in life, naturally leads to extravagance and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect; we are diſappointed at our ambition's not being gratified ſo early as we expected, and conſequently ſicken of that employment which occaſions our mortification and chagrin. Yet diffidence and timidity are far worſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to ſtruggle with through the rugged path of life: we continually ſtumble on dangers and vexations in our hazardous voyage; while they chiefly contribute to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply adverſity, and paint the events that may ſucceed, worſe than thoſe we have already ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>Fortitude forſakes the breaſt which is governed by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and ſelf-intereſt; happineſs is no more, the ſun-ſhine of hope is eclipſed by the heavy clouds of deſpair, and we ſink into that miſery which, through courage and exertion, we might have overcome with honour and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Matilda did not totally deſpair: and Alfred, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of this nature, ſtrove to diſpel that melancholy which was ſettled in her features during the latter part of their journey. It was entirely through her perſuaſion that her brother undertook the affair; ſhe was now ſorry ſhe had biaſſed his opinion; for ſhe even regretted leaving Paris; and the nearer ſhe arrived to London, her pleaſure in ſeeing it gradually decreaſed.</p>
                     <p>Reflection had in a great degree leſſened thoſe expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe ſuppoſed would be gratified when ſhe entered this city; and the romantic ideas ſhe had formed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with ſir Peter's family in England, ſeemed now to have many obſtacles which ſhe never before thought of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="unknown:035833_0067_10093C81D93016F0"/>
It was about ſix o'clock, in a wet uncomfortable evening of February, when they arrived at the inn. After ſome little time, the chief part of their baggage was put into a hackney coach, and Leonard, who was tolerably well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with London, diſpatched in it to Groſvenor-ſquare, with a polite meſſage, ſaying his maſter and miſs Maſerini would pay their reſpects in perſon, in leſs than two hours.</p>
                     <p>Alfred and Matilda, having ordered coffee, remained till near eight; during which time they made ſome little alteration in their dreſs. They then ſtept into a hack, and ordered it alſo to drive to ſir Peter Peviquil's, in Groſvenor-ſquare.</p>
                     <p>Neither of them was under any embarraſſment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh language, as they both had been uſed to converſe in it from their childhood, and pronounced it nearly as well as their own language.</p>
                     <p>On their arrival at the place to which they had ordered the coachman to drive, the ſquare was full of carriages; nor did they obſerve more than one hackney-coach in the whole train: they ſtopped cloſe to it, unable to proceed any farther for the crowd. Alfred looked out to ſee if there was any probability of their getting nearer to ſir Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's houſe, which he was informed was on the oppoſite ſide of the ſquare, when, to his inexpreſſible ſuppriſe, by the light of a footman's flambeau, who paſſed at the ſame time, he beheld Leonard in the coach he had before noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſeated with the baggage in the ſame ſtate as when he ſet out from the inn.</p>
                     <p>The man at the ſame moment recognized his maſter, and acquainted him that he found, from his firſt entrance in the ſquare it would be impoſſible for him to get to the door of ſir Peter's houſe, there being a grand entertainment
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035833_0068_10093CCD184B44D0"/>
there in honour of his daughter's birth-day; and that the gentlemen's carriages would not permit a common hack to draw up; he was afraid to go himſelf in ſearch of it on account of the baggage he muſt have left behind; but he ſaid he had ſent ſeveral meſſages to the ſervants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his ſituation, but that he had received no anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Alfred was vexed, yet he could not help ſmiling, at the fellow's recital: they were now in a line of carriages lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the houſe: he knew it would be ſome time before they could arrive there; yet to walk would be almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible on account of his ſiſter, as the rain poured down with uncommon violence. They therefore determined to wait till the coach, in due courſe, ſhould draw up to the door: in about twenty minutes they found themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the entrance of ſir Peter's manſion.</p>
                     <p>The coachman, by Alfred's order, knocked a ſingle rap: a footman in a handſome livery appeared; he aſked, in a ſurly manner, what was wanted? the man anſwered, a gentleman in a hackney coach wanted to ſee ſir Peter Peviquil.</p>
                     <p>The footman replied with ſome inſolence, "His maſter could not then be ſpoke with," and immediately ſhut the door.</p>
                     <p>Alfred's pride (who overheard this converſation), took fire;—he directly gave the coachman a card, and ordered him to knock a double rap at the door, and deſire the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to deliver it to ſir Peter.</p>
                     <p>The man at firſt heſitated, but at laſt complied with the requeſt. In a ſhort time he returned with a polite meſſage from ſir Peter, requeſting they would make his houſe their home; and that he himſelf would, if poſſible, welcome them to England in leſs than an hour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:035833_0069_10093C8737DEDB40"/>
The ſervant was now all civility; both the coaches were diſcharged, and Leonard ſaw the baggage ſafe in the houſe, while Alfred and Matilda were conducted by ſir Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's valet, through a noble hall, elegantly adorned with lamps, and lined with ſervants in waiting, to a handſome parlour. The houſe ſeemed in total confuſion; and the number of faſhionable company and nobility that was there was evident from their names being announced, as they aſcended the great ſtairs leading to the rooms of reception. Sir Peter's genteel conduct in ſome degree compenſated for the impertinence of his porter, and baniſhed that anger from Alfred's boſom, which the inſolence of the latter had occaſioned. In about two hours the gentleman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf appeared: he tenderly embraced them both, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, with the moſt pleaſing affability, his happineſs in ſeeing them in London: he regretted (he ſaid) the eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette which prevented lady Peviquil and his daughter from leaving the rooms above, to perform the duties o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He, however, begged they would make themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; order ſupper, and retire to reſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THE noiſe and confuſion in the houſe did not ſeem over before four in the morning;—Matilda heard the doors faſtened half an hour after;—and about five, ſilence reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through every part.</p>
                     <p>She once more ſtrove to drive away uncomfortable reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fell into a diſturbed ſlumber: diſtreſſing dreams haraſſed her imagination with horrid viſions; the figure of her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Alfred had been up near an hour, and was equally aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with his ſiſter, at the ſervant's intelligence:—he propoſed a walk round the ſquare, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Matilda ſeized the opportunity to aſk her brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the little they had ſeen, how he liked their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and alſo his opinion of ſir Peter.</p>
                     <p>Alfred replied, from the ſhort time he had been in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſir Peter Peviquil, he ſeemed to be a man who would intereſt any one in his favour, even at a firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</p>
                     <p>"But, Matilda," ſaid he, "we muſt not depend too much on the ſmooth, well-timed ſpeeches of a man of faſhion; for though both he and the family in general were friendly and agreeable in every reſpect, yet their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

of living would kill you. Leonard informed me laſt night, that he had learnt from the ſervants, the family hardly ever retired to reſt before three or four in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that they were never without company when at home, and that their rooms are filled with the firſt people of diſtinction and faſhion. Even if their diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Matilda acquieſced with his obſervation, yet was hurt at the idea of her own inſignificance.</p>
                     <p>In about an hour they returned to the houſe; prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were made for breakfaſt, but the family had not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled.</p>
                     <p>Sir Peter, in a ſhort time, entered the room, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his lady, daughter, and ſon.</p>
                     <p>Lady Peviquil was, in perſon, tall and elegant, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment was graceful, and in her manner ſhe was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of faſhion; yet a haughty pride in her diſpoſition was viſible, even to a common beholder, at firſt ſight; and caſt a deep ſhade over thoſe accompliſhments which ſhowed her a lady of rank. Miſs Peviquil had the day before entered her nineteenth year; ſhe was tall, genteel, lively, and good tempered; in the ornamental part of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhe was accompliſhed, but, like her mother, a total ſtranger to domeſtic duties. In converſation, ſhe was gay and witty, and accounted, by the connoiſſeurs of faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manners, a tolerably ſmart, pretty girl.</p>
                     <p>Henry Peviquil was one-and-twenty; entirely free from pride, handſome in his perſon, and pleaſing in his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and addreſs; extremely diſſipated, and fond of being thought ſo.</p>
                     <p>He had received the education of a gentleman, and was left a fortune of ſix hundred a year by an uncle of his
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035833_0072_10093CD514C5A850"/>
mother's. He was ſhortly expected to ſet out on the grand tour, and only waited till a proper companion could be obtained.</p>
                     <p>The young travellers were treated in the moſt friendly manner by ſir Peter. Lady Peviquil, her daughter, and Matilda, took an airing in the coach; while Henry drove his new friend round Hyde Park in his curricle.</p>
                     <p>Cards were delivered out to form a ſelect party of friends in the evening, who were to be introduced to the young foreigners.</p>
                     <p>At their return, they dreſſed for dinner, which was ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by candle-light. The ſelect party at night conſiſted of about thirty perſons of faſhion and diſtinction. The formal introduction to them all by her ladyſhip, was tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and diſagreeable to Matilda: yet ſhe returned the compliments of each individual with a grace which did honor even to the drawing-room of ſir Peter Peviquil.</p>
                     <p>Alfred had been uſed to the gaieties of Paris, and being as well verſed as his ſiſter in the Engliſh language, found himſelf under no embarraſſment in a London company.</p>
                     <p>The next day he declared his intention of taking lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for himſelf and ſervant; this was ſtrongly oppoſed by ſir Peter; but he perſiſted in his reſolution, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the aſſiſtance of Mr. Peviquil in the undertaking. Henry, with his uſual good-nature, eagerly complied with the requeſt, and declared, he knew of handſome apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were to be let in Bond-ſtreet; which was no great diſtance from Groſvenor-ſquare, and made it the more agreeable, as ſir Peter requeſted he would ſpend as much of his time as poſſible with him and his family.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen viewed the rooms that morning, while the ladies attended a muſic-meeting. Alfred approved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035833_0073_10093C8DA14A3398"/>
engaged them, and was to take poſſeſſion the next day.</p>
                     <p>Henry Peviquil was engaged for the beginning of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſir Peter rather indiſpoſed with a cold; it was therefore agreed that Alfred ſhould eſcort her ladyſhip, his ſiſter, and miſs Peviquil to the theatre; and a ſtage-box was accordingly retained for them.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was delighted with the tragedy, which was Hamlet: although her knowledge of the language would not permit her to underſtand every ſentence, yet ſhe could perfectly make out the plot and management of the piece; and was charmed with the ingenuity of the author. Her ladyſhip paid more attention to the company than to the ſtage; while her daughter was entirely taken up in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Alfred, whoſe attention was fixed on a lady in the oppoſite box. Her figure and manner charmed him; in ſhort, the latter part of the evening he quite neglected the performance, in the notice he took of the fair incognita.</p>
                     <p>At the cloſe of the entertainment, Alfred inquired of lady Peviquil the name of the young lady oppoſite them: her ladyſhip anſwered, "It was lady Caroline Albourn, daughter of lord Albourn, a nobleman renowned for his large fortune and good character; and, lady Caroline," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her ladyſhip, "is allowed to be a beautiful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed young lady." "My ideas, my lady." returned Alfred, "perfectly agree, in the former obſervation, with the opinion of the world."</p>
                     <p>"Lord, Mr. Maſerini," ſaid miſs Peviquil, hurt at the compliment paid to another, "ſurely there are as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome women in the houſe as lady Caroline Albourn!"</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, madam," replied Alfred, "all are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; yet ſome more beautiful than others; nor can the remark be more fully exemplified, than when lady Caroline or miſs Peviquil make their appearance."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:035833_0074_10093CD88D58CF20"/>
This well turned compliment entirely ſtifled the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the lady, and ſhe immediately reſumed her uſual gaiety and good temper.</p>
                     <p>As they croſſed the lobby, they were met by Henry Pevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil, who, after helping Alfred to aſſiſt the ladies to their coach, ſtopped him from following.</p>
                     <p>"Ladies," ſaid he, "I muſt requeſt you will diſpenſe with the company of your knight-errant from conducting you home, as I arreſt him for the remainder of the night. Therefore, my dear Maſerini, take leave of the fair dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and follow me."</p>
                     <p>Alfred begged to be excuſed, and deſired he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider there were none but ladies in the coach.</p>
                     <p>"Oh!" returned Hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y, "there is a footman behind, who is able to defend twice as many."</p>
                     <p>"I do not take it kind of you," ſaid her ladyſhip, "to force Mr. Maſerini from us, if you do not like to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>Matilda was anxious her brother ſhould return with them, and miſs Peviquil afraid of loſing the gallant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the young Frenchman: but it availed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Henry, after begging all their pardons, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would make it up with them in the morning, cloſed the coach door, and ordered the coachman to drive home.</p>
                     <p>He then ſaid hold of Alfred's arm and told him he muſt now introduce him to a ſet of friends, whoſe names he did not chuſe to mention before the ladies: "for though," ſaid he, "I am not a gameſter myſelf, yet I ſpend ſome of my time in the faſhionable company of thoſe who love play."</p>
                     <p>Alfred was rather diſpleaſed at his impetuous beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; but conſidered it as the warmth of his friendſhip,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035833_0075_10093C909A7B30A8"/>
and the conſequence of his having partaken that evening rather too freely of the bottle.</p>
                     <p>They arrived, after ſome time, at a well known houſe in St. James's-ſtreet, and were conducted to the room of faſhionable company.</p>
                     <p>Alfred was ſtruck with their appearance: the horrid countenances of ſome, whom fortune had not ſo favoured that evening—the intoxicated joy of others who had emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the pockets of their friends—and the extreme agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole aſſembly, whoſe expectations were all on the table, made it a ſcene of diſagreeable reflection to thoſe who had never been addicted to that deſtructive vice. Alfred plainly perceived his companion was well known to them; he was aſked to play, but refuſed; and Alfred likewiſe begged to remain out, but was obliged to bet, that he might not ſeem particular, as all thoſe who did not ſit down, laid on the ſucceſs of each player: but the ſtakes were not large at their part of the room.</p>
                     <p>In about an hour a table was vacant, and a party accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly muſtered to fill it. Alfred was over perſuaded, and ſat down with Henry Peviquil, who propoſed no high play: this was unanimouſly agreed upon, and a ſmall ſum ſettled, to the ſatisfaction of every perſon. They broke up in about three hours, and Alfred found himſelf a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of about a guinea. He was complim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ted on his judgment of the game, and invited for the next evening. Henry and Alfred both returned to Groſvenor-ſquare, and arrived there about four in the morning.</p>
                     <p>When the family met the next day, Henry Peviquil made his peace with the ladies; but he found more difficulty in the undertaking than he expected: his mother and ſiſter were ſeriouſly offended; nor could Matilda forgive him, though ſhe was neceſſitated to ſay to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:035833_0076_10093CDA19FB42A8"/>
Alfred was far from being diſpleaſed with the company he had ſeen; ſtruck as he was at firſt with their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the latter part of the time they ſeemed more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him; and their ready acquieſcence to play for a ſmall ſum, confirmed him in the miſtaken opinion that they were not a common claſs of gamblers. He was not averſe to meet them the following evening, nor did morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection by any means alter his ideas concerning the tranſactions of the night.</p>
                     <p>Lady Peviquil informed them, ſhe had ſummoned a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous company for that evening, "and amongſt the reſt," added her ladyſhip, with a ſmile, which was well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, "I expect lord Albourn and his daughter."</p>
                     <p>Alfred was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment—he had engaged himſelf to the party in St. James's-ſtreet; but this obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to his wiſhes he determined to ſurmount, by begging Henry Peviquil to make his excuſe, as he could not poſſibly be guilty of ſuch impolite behaviour, as to abſent himſelf from lady Peviquil's drawing-room, when ſhe herſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted his company.—But he might have ſaved himſelf the trouble, as Henry intended to ſpend the fore-part of the evening in Groſvenor-ſquare; yet he inſiſted on Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred's accompanying him there, after the rooms cloſed, which he ſuppoſed would not be very late.</p>

                     <p>MATILDA took more pains than uſual at the toilet: ſhe underſtood from lady Peviquil that numbers of faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people were to be there; ſhe therefore conſidered it would be a compliment to her ladyſhip to make ſome few additions to her dreſs, which conſiſted of white ſatin. She
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035833_0077_10093C9221954E28"/>
wore the picture of her father ſuſpended on her boſom, by a gold croſs and chain; her appearance was beautiful, and ſhe received no ſmall compliments from ſir Peter and his ſon. Lady Peviquil and her daughter were rather cool in their behaviour, and ſeemed envious of her ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or beauty and elegance. The rooms began to fill at nine o'clock, and many perſons of diſtinction were announced: among the reſt the Spaniſh ambaſſador was uſhered in, and begged to introduce to ſir Peter and his lady, an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend, who had accompanied him from Spain to England. The gentleman was a foreigner of note, rather in the decline of life; yet his perſon was handſome, and his manners elegant and accompliſhed: his excellency had not yet been made known to Alfred or Matilda; ſir Peter therefore introduced them both at one time, the firſt as the Spaniſh ambaſſador, the ſecond as count D'Ollifont.</p>
                     <p>Alfred was ſtruck motionleſs with horror and ſurpriſe; the ſuppoſed murderer of his father ſtood before him: nor was the count's embarraſſment leſs; for before ſir Peter could mention the name of Maſerini, he caſt his eye on the picture of their father; his countenance immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately turned pale, and he ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>wed the greateſt emotion.</p>
                     <p>Matilda, though ſhe had never heard her mother ſpeak highly of the count, received him with politeneſs; but Alfred, after a few cold compliments, joined lord Albourn and his daughter at another part of the room.</p>
                     <p>The behaviour of both gentlemen was generally noticed: but each excuſed himſelf, by ſaying it was ſurpriſe at the ſudden introduction to a relation almoſt unknown.</p>
                     <p>The count ſeemed ſtruck with Matilda's figure and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; he chiefly attended her the whole evening; which cauſed great envy and uneaſineſs in the breaſts of her fair friends; among theſe was miſs Peviquil, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hurt at being forſaken by Alfred Maſerini, and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035833_0078_10093CDD183CBA28"/>
more ſo at receiving ſuch few compliments from the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador and his friend.</p>
                     <p>Alfred dedicated the whole evening to lady Caroline, nor did ſhe ſeem by any means diſpleaſed at the attention paid her by the young Frenchman; her father gave him a general invitation to Soho-ſquare, as the friend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſir Peter Peviquil.</p>
                     <p>The agreeable converſation he had with the young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in ſome meaſure made up for the ſurpriſe, horror, and diſſatisfaction be felt at an introduction to the count.</p>
                     <p>The attention paid Matilda by her relation did not paſs unnoticed by her brother; he determined next day to hint to his ſiſter his diſlike of him, without entering into a particular de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ail of circumſtances, which would only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and perplex her.</p>
                     <p>The rooms began to be thin about twelve; and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time after, lord Albourn and his daughter took their leave; Alfred conducted the latter to her carriage, then joined Henry Peviquil, and proceeded to St. James's ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>The ſame company was aſſembled, with ſome additions: and one of the ſtrangers was at the table where Henry and his friend were placed; they played higher than the night before, and Alfred, at the breaking up of the party about half paſt four in the morning, found himſelf a loſer of thirty pounds; he paid the money without the leaſt chagrin, and was promiſed his revenge the next evening. Henry Peviquil was alſo declared a debtor to the table, of twenty guineas. They parted a little way from the houſe; the latter for Groſvenor-ſquare, the former for his new lodgings in Bond-ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>Matilda had taken notice of her brother at his intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the count, nor could ſhe conceive a reaſon for his abrupt behaviour; her ſurpriſe, however, was greatly
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035833_0079_10093D31AA403538"/>
heightened at the ſlighting manner in which he ſpoke of him, when they were alone the following day. In vain ſhe aſked his meaning for the diſlike he ſhowed; the more they converſed on the ſubject, his converſation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the more ſtrange and intricate. His ideas alſo ſeemed entirely changed concerning their reſidence in London; her fears of diſſipation and bad hours he laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at; declared himſelf pleaſed with ſir Peter's family; and would not permit her to mention a wiſh of leaving it.</p>
                     <p>Alfred was a conſtant attendant at lord Albourn's, the fore part of the day; the latter he generally ſpent in the gay family of ſir Peter; and the night and beginning of the morning at the gaming table: he was now univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known as a man of faſhion, and his name familiar in the firſt circles, as the diſſipated, lively, and handſome Frenchman.</p>
                     <p>His ſiſter ſaw, with concern, the effects of their Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don journey; ſhe could plainly obſerve her brother's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would be ſoon exhauſted, in the manner he lived: his character, as a gambler, was conſtantly made free with, and his midnight exploits and quarrels commonly mentioned in general converſations. Her own ſituation was alſo particularly diſagreeable. Harraſſed by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duities of the count and many other admirers, ſhe was continually plagued with their importunities and flattery. Lady Peviquil had entirely thrown off the few amiable qualities ſhe ſeemed to poſſeſs; and being further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her circumſtances and friendleſs ſituation, ſhe treated her little better than a dependant on her bounty.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Peviquil hated her for her beauty, and was hardly civil; in vain Matilda begged her brother to leave England, and return to France; he laughed at her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints:
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035833_0080_10093CE1206B4548"/>
ſhe requeſted him only to conduct her there, and ſhe would immediately place herſelf in a convent, and cauſe him no further trouble:—but her ſolicitations were vain; the deſtructive vice of gaming had already taken poſſeſſion of him: every obſtacle, difficulty, and intereſt, vaniſhed before it; even the welfare of his ſiſter, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his family, the treatment of his father, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he had to ſee Graſville Abbey, were thought of no more, when the gaming table appeared; lady Caroline was almoſt forgot; in ſhort, every ſentiment of fortitude, courage, and humanity, with other virtues which ſtamped on him the name of a gentleman and a ſoldier, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſwallowed up in a curſed infatuation for a faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vice.</p>
                     <p>Sir Peter, who was entirely governed by his lady, paid hardly any attention to his fair relation:—the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily treated her with the utmoſt indifference, except Henry Peviquil:—his gallantry, like that of the count, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſguſting; and the moſt villanious views appeared under the maſk of friendly concern and pity for her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; he would often hint his knowledge of her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the extravagance of her brother; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance he firſt introduced him to:—his diſcourſe would then turn into violent proteſtations of his regard for her, and admiration of her beauty and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Before Alfred, he ſhowed no further ſigns of particularity in his behaviour than what common politeneſs required. Affairs were in this ſtate, when one evening, at a grand ball given by lady Peviquil, a ſtranger was introduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Milverne, an only ſon of a lord of that name: he was juſt arrived from Italy, where he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his father, who was in a declining ſtate of health:
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035833_0081_10093D346BD0A8D8"/>
his elegant figure and agreeable manners were univerſally noticed;—he was requeſted to open the entertainment with a minuet, and a lady was alſo fixed on for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Alfred danced with lady Caroline: but he was by no means ſo great a favourite with his lordſhip as at their firſt interviews; nor did he ſeem pleaſed with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's reſigning her hand to him as a partner: lady Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line herſelf appeared much attached to him; and Matilda thought ſhe could perceive, in her eyes and manner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than common regard; yet ſhe never, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral viſits and times ſhe had ſeen her ladyſhip, which had brought on an intimacy between the young ladies, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaſt information to confirm the opinion her ideas had ſuggeſted.</p>

                     <p>THERE are a number of vicious and licentious vices, which will ſo far triumph over human nature, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe from a track of virtue, that for years have been reſpected as valuable members of ſociety. Yet we ſee few but what, at ſome time or other, feel the moſt ſevere pangs from remorſe of conſcience, and a retroſpect of the fair character they once held in the world; contraſted with the ſcorn and ſlighting treatment they are neceſſitated to ſuffer from many who, at an early part of life, would have been proud of their eſteem, yet had lived to behold their ſuperiors reduced to the loweſt ſtate of penury and diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Reflection is never more poignant than when happy ſcenes once enjoyed are compared with the miſery of a preſent ſtate—which miſery has been occaſioned by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, indolence, or extravagance. The moſt abandoned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience moments, when acute feelings aſſail them with redoubled force: yet theſe feelings in ſome meaſure ſerve only to harden them in their crimes, and drive them to acts of deſperation. On others they take different effect; repentance, and ſhame for what is paſt, urge them to amend for the future; give them ſtrength and inclination to diſentangle themſelves from thoſe embarraſſments they are plunged into, and make them more cautious and wary through the remainder of life.</p>

Alfred, at ſerious intervals, was nearly diſtracted with the idea of his own conduct; yet he had no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: thoſe reſolutions of amendment made in a morning, were thought of no more when the gambling hour approached; his care for the welfare of his ſiſter would ſometimes make him thoughtful in the midſt of diſſipation, but he was laughed at by his gay companions, and ſuffered to be melancholy no more.</p>
                     <p>His pride was hurt at the behaviour of lord Albourn; yet he knew he merited it: and his love for lady Caroline ſtill drew him to a houſe where he was received by its owner with little cordiality and politeneſs.</p>

                     <p>Leonard ſeemed hurt that he had gone ſo far, and, after ſtammering an excuſe, would again have withdrawn; but ſhe inſiſted on his ſitting down and ordered ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that was however uſeleſs; his appetite was gone, and he ſeemed in the laſt ſtage of conſumption. She then implored him, by the love he bore her family, and by the regard he had for his maſter and herſelf, to inform her of every circumſtance relative to his affairs: "for I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain," continued Matilda, "they are in a diſagreeable ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the expenſive manner in which he lives, added to his fondneſs for play, confirms thoſe reports which have been hinted to me by many, whom I know to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his proceedings.</p>

a morning, after I have been ſitting up for him all night, in ſuch ill temper, that it cuts me to the heart."</p>
                     <p>Matilda found herſelf incapable of bearing this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view any longer with fortitude; ſhe therefore diſmiſſed the faithful ſervant, with repeated aſſurances of her eſteem for him, and a requeſt that if any other circumſtances ſhould ariſe concerning her brother, he would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repair to Groſvenor-ſquare, and relate them to her. She directly retired to her chamber, and broke open the letter: ſignora Maſerini's manuſcript dropped from the cover, on which Alfred had wrote a few lines. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with ſaying, he could plainly perceive by her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhe had an attachment for count D'Ollifont, which gave him the greateſt uneaſineſs; and though he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto kept the incloſed from her ſight, through motives of tenderneſs, yet the common force of nature urged him to take every method in his power to prevent her forming a wretched alliance with a villain, the ſuppoſed murderer of their father.</p>
                     <p>The paper fell from her hand, and ſhe fainted in the chair. Miſs Peviquil at that moment opened the door: ſhe was aſtoniſhed to ſee Matilda in a fit, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rang the bell.

                     <p>Miſs Peviquil felt herſelf hurt at the diſappointment her curioſity ſuffered by not ſeeing the letters which had cauſed ſuch violent emotion in her friend: ſhe directly ſuſpected it to be a love affair, and maliciouſly determined to be revenged on her, by relating the whole ſtory in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. With theſe charitable reſolutions ſhe took leave, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting to ſee her in the drawing room, as Mr. Milverne and ſome other gentlemen had paid them a morning viſit, and were inquiring after her health. Matilda returned her many thanks for her care and attention, and promiſed to join them in a few minutes.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Milverne had been a conſtant attendant at ſir Peter's, ſince his firſt introduction at the ball: his particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs to Matilda plainly told ſhe was the chief magnet which drew him to the houſe; and though lady Peviquil was not by any means pleaſed with this information, which was firſt hinted to her by her daughter, yet ſhe knew not how to diſmiſs from her parties a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of high birth, noble character, and elegant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. Their only hope was, that he could not poſſibly entertain any ſerious ideas of an honourable connection, without his father's conſent; which conſent they were partly certain would never be granted, on account of the old gentleman's avaricious diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Every one expreſſed their concern at the languid appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Matilda, when ſhe entered the room: ſhe excuſed herſelf by her having been rather indiſpoſed that morning.</p>

of a ſympathetic tear occaſioned by a tale of woe, or a recital of the misfortunes of others."</p>
                     <p>Both lady Peviquil and her daughter ſmiled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Matilda thanked him, and ſaid, ſhe ſhortly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to leave England, as ſhe did not find the climate agree with her conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>He changed colour inſtantly;—his ſurpriſe and emotion were viſible to all.—"To leave England, madam!" he replied.—Having recollected himſelf, he in a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Miſs Peviquil conſidered this would be a fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to exerciſe her ill-nature, which was greatly heightened by Mr. Milverne's behaviour to Matilda, on the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the letter; and immediately anſwered to that gentleman's queſtion, by ſignificant hints, that it was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the heart, which was extremely difficult to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:—ſhe then, with the utmoſt irony and malice, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the affair in the moſt ridiculous terms, and concluded with a requeſt to know the name of her admirer.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Milverne ſeemed petrified:—Matilda was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at her converſation; the inſulting and malicious wit of miſs Peviquil was more than ſhe could ſupport; nor had ſhe power to utter a word, but burſt into a flood of tears. Her brother at that moment was announced, and entered the drawing-room.</p>
                     <p>The embarraſſment of the whole party was general: the gentlemen, who, except Mr. Milverne, were chiefly ſtrangers, teſtified their approbation of Miſs Peviquil's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital by laughing; but the idea that their mirth had drawn tears from a beautiful young woman, caſt a gloom on their countenance, and gave them no very favourable opinion of her whoſe ſatirical talents had ſo much enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them.</p>

                     <p>ALFRED Maſerini was going to pay the compliments of the morning with more than uſual gaiety, when the ſight of Matilda, ſtriving to conceal her tears, ſtruck his eyes; her manner and peculiar ſituation prevented his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance: reflection darted on his memory, and his late ill-treatment of her appeared in the moſt black and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous colours: ſhe had been inſulted, he could perceive; friendleſs and unprotected, ſhe had no one to take her part; their mother had always recommended Matilda to his care:—how had be fulfilled her requeſt?—by cruel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, when ſhe was ſurrounded with ſeducers, danger and diſſipation: in ſhort, every part of his behaviour ſince their reſidence in London preſented itſelf in the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful light; and the ideas of his own baſeneſs kept him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs ſome time.</p>
                     <p>The ſilence was not broken till he himſelf, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tenderneſs, aſked his ſiſter the cauſe of her tears.—She found he was hurt; and the recollection of his former kindneſs, contraſted with his preſent conduct, threw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another agony of weeping.</p>
                     <p>He immediately turned, and, with the greateſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his looks, aſked an explanation of his ſiſter's unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which he ſaid he ſuppoſed was occaſioned by ſome affront ſhe was unable to reſent.—"If ſo," continued Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred—"I am arrived here in proper time, to afford that protection which by duty I am bound, and by inclination I am moſt willing, to give."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Milverne was the only gentlemen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> No ſooner had this thought ſuggeſted itſelf, than, in a reſolute tone, he inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his reſolving the queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Milverne ſtarted from a reverie, which the late converſation had thrown him into, and, with a manly compoſure, addreſſed the diſtracted Alfred: "Moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, ſir! My carriage is at the door:—if you will favour me with your company round the Park, I will inform you of the whole affair; and permit me to ſay, ſir, had miſs Maſerini's brother been always as anxious after her wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and happineſs, there would have been no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>auſe for him to have requeſted information, or my aſſiſtance to have given it."</p>
                     <p>This juſt reproach ſtruck the young Frenchman to the heart; he frowned, and they left the room together.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen who remained ſoon after took their leave. Matilda found herſelf alone with lady Peviquil and her daughter. The ſituation was diſtreſſing; but ſhe was ſoon relieved from it, as both retired to their dreſſing rooms, the latter making an aukward apology for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs ſhe had occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Milverne in the moſt friendly terms informed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred of the cruel treatment his ſiſter had received, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that morning, but at many other times, when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had in the ſame manner been witneſs to it. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him to remove her from ſir Peter Peviquil's—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded him it was a houſe of diſſipation, pride, and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury—begged him to conſider how dangerous many parts of the company were to a young lady but newly entered into the gaieties of life;—he even hinted his ſuſpicions of Harry Peviquil, and count D'Ollifont.—This name touched Alfred to the ſoul; he made no anſwer, but heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a convulſive ſigh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:035833_0090_10093CF5D8B9A6A0"/>
Mr. Milverne ſtill continued: "My attention to your ſiſter has, I own, Mr. Maſerini, been particular; and I now in your preſence avow that I love her; love her to diſtraction."</p>
                     <p>"Why not then, ſir," returned Alfred,—"avow it to the world, and openly addreſs her as a man of honor? Not, ſir, that I wiſh for your alliance with her, more than that of any other gentleman; yet I conceive, when ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love and attachment are declared for a young woman, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound not with propriety till ſanctioned by the open behaviour of an intended huſband."</p>
                     <p>"And that, ſir," replied Mr. Milverne, "ſhould before now have been exemplified in me, had it not been for a whimſical father whoſe conſent I muſt, if poſſible, obtain, for the ſake of us both:—If this can be done, I ſhall be happy to make her my wife, and think myſelf bleſſed in the poſſeſſion of ſuch a treaſure"</p>
                     <p>Alfred ſtill remained thoughtful; reflections crowded on his mind, and they were almoſt too much for his ſenſes.—Henry Peviquil, he was now informed, wore a maſk of friendſhip to cover his villany: he had more than once thought ill of him, in his tranſactions at St. James's-ſtreet; yet he was a young man of the firſt faſhion, the ſon of a perſon of diſtinction. But were theſe idle pompous orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make amends for the ruin of his ſiſter, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of his family, the curſe of himſelf;—that ſiſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to his care by a fond mother—that ſiſter whom he was bound to protect by every tie of blood, love, and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our—that ſiſter who herſelf foreſaw danger, and wiſhed to eſcape it, but was prevented by him—that ſiſter whoſe regard for him he knew ſo be ſincere—that ſiſter who had been inſulted yet had no one to defend her, but thoſe who, under motives of charity, would expect a reward that muſt at once cruſh her to the loweſt ſtate of human nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:035833_0091_10093CF1B55215E0"/>
"Accurſed idea!" exclaimed he, in a voice hardly artic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulate, pulled the check-ſtring, and deſired the coachman to ſtop.</p>
                     <p>There was a wildneſs in his look, which alarmed Mr. Milverne. "You are not going to leave me, Mr. Maſerini?" ſaid he: "I intended to aſk you to take a friendly dinner with me."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you, ſir!" returned Alfred, "but muſt bag to be excuſed." He leaped from the carriage, and darted acroſs the Park towards Piccadilly.</p>
                     <p>He had arrived at the turnpike-gate when lord Albourn's poſt chariot drove through. Alfred juſt perceived his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and his daughter were in it. The young lady's eyes met his at the ſame moment;—they both bowed;—but her father did not obſerve him. He ſtopped the ſervant, who was on horſeback paying the toll, and aſked if his lordſhip was going a little excurſion from London.</p>
                     <p>"He is going beyond a little excurſion, ſir," replied the man—"many miles from hence."</p>
                     <p>Alfred was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment.—"Many miles!" returned he: "why, lady Caroline never informed me of at, although I ſaw her yeſterday."</p>
                     <p>"Her ladyſhip," ſaid the man, "did not know of it herſelf two hours before we ſet off, as it was a ſudden whim of lord Albourn's."</p>
                     <p>The ſervant ſeemed in a hurry to overtake the chariot, which had got ſome little diſtance;—but Alfred ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him, to inquire what place they were going to, and when they were to return.</p>
                     <p>The man anſwered, "He really could not tell to what part they were going; but the diſtance was near two hundred miles from town;—that his lord returned in a week, but that lady Caroline was to be left behind." He then ſpurred his horſe, and left his hearer in a ſtate little better than ſtupefaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:035833_0092_10093CF867EC7580"/>
That lord Albourn had taken his daughter from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don merely to avoid any further intimacy with him, was certain; in ſhort, the occurrences of the morning had overwhelmed him, with deſpair, and he found himſelf at his own lodgings, before his recollection had reminded him he was going that way. Leonard opened the door; this faithful ſervant plainly ſaw the agitation of his ſpirits.—Alfred ſtrove to diſguiſe his uneaſineſs, and aſked, with ſome degree of compoſure, if any perſon had called ſince he left home? Leonard anſwered, "No one, except a mean-looking man, who had left a note for him, which lay in the dreſſing room."—He immediately repaired to it and read the contents; it was from his taylor, requeſting the payment of ſeventy pounds on the next day—and, if diſappointed, threatened an arreſt. He had, a week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, drawn upon his banker in France, for the laſt three hundred pounds of his fortune; this would not even pay his debts. Ruin and confuſion learned to encircle him: where was now his pride—his honor—his character as a gentleman and a ſoldier? Where was his love for his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? In what manner was he to make good his word, of adding a part of his fortune to hers?—If he remained in England, diſgrace and infamy muſt ſurround him;—nor could he fly, but like a mean and beggarly outcaſt of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, leaving behind him the name of a ſwindler and a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain. Even in his own country, he muſt meet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of thoſe to whom he uſed to preach leſſons of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and by example enforced his doctrine. Matilda too, what was to become of her? Her fortune would not ſupport her. "Muſt ſhe," ſaid he, "through my faults and follies, ſink with me into deſtruction? Who is to protect her when I am in jail? That villain, count D'Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifont, whom I ſuſpect to be the murderer of my father, may ſeize on the moment to complete his accurſed inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

and, like the fiend of hell, laugh at thoſe his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief has hurled headlong into irremediable ruin. It is too much," exclaimed he, running to a part of the room where his ſword hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The glittering ſteel trembled in his hand;—his arm wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ound it with-held by a perſon behind him. He turned, gaſping with convulſive madneſs; the good old Leonard dropped before him on his knees:—"Merciful father," exclaimed he, "look on him with an eye of pity!"—then turning to Alfred with a ſtern aſpect; "is this, ſir," ſaid he, "a time to appear before that God, to whom you have ſo much to anſwer for, and from whom ſo little to expect? Look, ſir, in the mirror before you; and conſider if your figure is in a proper ſtate for a dying man; your countenance convulſed and agitated; your ſenſes in a ſtate of diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ſword of your departed father lifted in your hand ready to ſuperſede the power of your God, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an end to that exiſtence he gave you, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly has alone a right to extinguiſh."</p>
                     <p>The ſword dropped from his hand; he ſunk into a chair, and felt ſeverely the juſt reproaches of his ſervant; "I thank you, Leonard," was all he could ſay; but he made a motion to be alone. Leonard firſt ſecured the weapon, and then left him to meditate on his raſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>He continued for ſome time in a ſtate of ſtupid inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but by degrees recovered, and ſhuddered at the danger he had eſcaped. His reſolution was fixed, never more to game; he ſwore by the moſt ſolemn oath, never to play but for a trifling ſum, nor any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

himſelf at a place where, to his coſt, he had experienced the villany of mankind under the maſk of friendſhip and kindneſs. With theſe reſolutions Alfred ſtaid at home the remainder of the day, thanked Leonard again for his care, and retired to reſt with more compoſure and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than he had for months before.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was overpowered with misfortunes. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her father's diſappearance, and the ſuſpicion which reſted on the count, whom ſhe had before diſliked, but now even ſhuddered at his name, ſunk her into new troubles and diſtreſs. The inſults ſhe had received from miſs Peviquil, although they had confirmed her in the idea of poſſeſſing the eſteem if not the love of Mr. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, entirely ſettled her determination of leaving Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. To accompliſh this, ſhe reſolved to demand of her brother a ſmall part of her fortune, to carry her over to France; and, immediately on her arrival in that country, to enter a convent, and totally ſeclude herſelf from a world where, young as ſhe was, ſhe could plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the intereſted and ſordid views of mankind; and ſickened at thoſe gaieties of high life ſhe once languiſhed to enjoy.</p>

in a greater degree than woman? To protect the weak and defenceleſs from the gripe and cruelty of the wicked; to give ſuccour to thoſe who in their nature are leſs capable of bearing up againſt impoſition; and who conſequently require that aid, which, according to the laws of chriſtianity, he is bound to afford them.</p>
                     <p>Who is the cauſe of this horrid downfal to infamy and ſhame? Man! he who in the book of nature was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to bear the image of the Supreme Being, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take on him the godlike office of protector to the female part of the world; yet doth he blunt his feelings againſt every trait of humanity, and dares deſtroy that which the Almighty intended he ſhould preſerve. Of this deſcription there are many: but it is to be hoped they are greatly overbalanced by the more noble and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous part of mankind, who equally feel the effects of beauty, yet ſcorn to gratify their paſſions by villanous and deliberate ſchemes of ſeduction.</p>
                     <p>Count D'Ollifont was ſtruck with Matilda's charms, the firſt evening he was at ſir Peter's; and, in the few minutes' interval between ſeeing her and being introduced, he ſettled within his own mind, if poſſible, to ſeduce her.</p>
                     <p>The count was a man who experienced no diſturbance from the intruſion of honor, conſcience, or feeling; the milk of human kindneſs was not in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y reſpect concerned, in ſoftening his compoſition: the tear of compaſſion was never ſeen in his eye, nor could the moſt diſmal tale or even ſight of woe procure from him an accent of pity, or even a ſympathetic ſigh. The gratification of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions was his whole concern; nor did he ſtop at any thing to accompliſh what his wiſhes prompted him to poſſeſs. He now enjoyed the whole eſtates and large fortune of count Maſerini, grandfather to Alfred and Matilda; he could therefore well afford to live in the moſt ſplendid and elegant manner. On riches he chiefly depended to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035833_0096_10093CFB79C0E980"/>
with the ladies; as he knew his age would almoſt give him the title of an elderly man.</p>
                     <p>He had juſt planned in what manner to make his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on the beautiful young foreigner, when ſir Peter Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viquil, as was before related, led him up, and introduced her under the name of Maſerini. The picture of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plainly confirmed who ſhe was. A ſudden horror overcame him; he felt a ſomething ſtrike his heart, which he had heard deſcribed as the touch of remorſe; he, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oon recovered, and reſumed his natural gaiety and politeneſs. Yet the behaviour of Alfred did not go unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by him; and it ſeemed as if he had actually known thoſe intentions the former had been weighing in his mind five minutes before.</p>
                     <p>Reſt forſook the pillow of the count that night; his ideas of ſeduction received a check at the mention of the name; yet every circumſtance coincided with his wiſhes, except her brother: him he feared. Mean and daſtardly in his diſpoſition, he was fearful even as a child, and would ſhrink like a wretched reptile from the juſt revenge of a man whom he had cringed to with meanneſs, for the purpoſe of deſtroying his happineſs, and ruining his family.</p>
                     <p>He reſolved not to be too haſty in the affair, but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect to make himſelf agreeable to Matilda, and wait for an opportunity, when, by ſome means or other, Alfred ſhould be unable to afford that protection his ſiſter would require.</p>
                     <p>That opportunity was now arrived; the tailor, who had threatened in a letter to arreſt him, was the ſame that made the count's clothes; it was he who firſt perſuaded the man to take that method; ſuppoſing that, not being able in ſo little a time to procure bail, he muſt be confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at leaſt for one night, and during that time he could by force (finding that none of his perſuaſive eloquence
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035833_0097_10093D44EEDC1FD0"/>
had any effect on Matilda) convey her to ſome ſecret ſpot, where he might, unmoleſted, take advantage of her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>This diabolical ſcheme was, accordingly, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deliberation, put into execution; and the tailor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the count in the evening, that he had not received his money; the latter then ordered the man, on pain of his diſpleaſure, and entire loſs of his cuſtom, not to fail to put his threats in practice. To add greater force to this requeſt, he preſented him with a ten pound bank-note, over and above the bill he then paid him; and received a ſolemn promiſe, in return, that his wiſhes ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with the greateſt exactneſs.</p>
                     <p>Count D'Ollifont then proceeded to ſir Peter Peviquil's; he plainly perceived there had been a miſunderſtanding between the ladies: but it did not in any reſpect alter his plan.</p>
                     <p>He preſented the family with tickets for a grand maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade which was to be at the Pantheon the next even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and alſo begged Mr. Milverne's acceptance of one, who entered the room ſoon after him.</p>
                     <p>Matilda at firſt declined going; but the count would take no refuſal. She ſeemed particularly cool in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards him; but this did not in any reſpect damp his ſpirits in the plot he had undertaken.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of converſation, he hinted that he ſhould like Mr. Maſerini to be of the party, and pretended he ſhould likewiſe ſend him a ticket the following morning. He gave them to underſtand the manager of it was patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed by himſelf, and conſequently he ſhould exert his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as much as poſſible in his behalf.</p>
                     <p>The count, Mr Milverne, and Henry Peviquil, eſcorted the ladies to a concert: they returned to ſupper. Mr. Milverne ſeemed unhappy; Matilda extremely dejected.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035833_0098_10093D00B0228E38"/>
She inquired how he left her brother; he did not wiſh to relate to her the manner in which Alfred flew from the carriage; but turned the converſation by ſaying, "He could not perſuade him to take a dinner."—She would have continued, but was interrupted by the count's aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what characters they intended to appear. Matilda and Mr. Milverne reſolved to go in dominos; Henry Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viquil declared he ſhould aſſume the character of Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote; ſir Peter, a hermit; her ladyſhip, a nun; and miſs Peviquil, a gipſy. The count ſaid he did not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf able to ſupport a character, and therefore ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of his fair couſin, as he was pleaſed to ſtyle her, and appear in no particular dreſs. About one o'clock he took his leave, and promiſed to be with them the next evening. Mr. Milverne likewiſe appointed to call in Groſvenor-ſquare at the ſame hour.</p>
                     <p>Matilda retired to her chamber, but not to ſleep; ſhe diſliked even the ſight of count D'Ollifont; yet ſhe had con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

She however reſolved, if poſſible, to perſuade her brother to accompany them, and for once be the cauſe of ſpending a diſſipated evening: ſhe ſhould then conſider herſelf ſafe in his preſence, and have greater enjoyment of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                     <p>Alfred Maſerini aroſe in the morning, more compoſed than he had been for many weeks; having already reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, immediately on receiving the ſum he expected from M.

                     <p>Alfred's aſtoniſhment at reading this extraordinary epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, may well be conceived. He ſhowed it to Leonard, and aſked his advice; the old man begged him to attend to its contents: "No one, ſir," ſaid he, "could have an intereſt in writing ſuch a letter; and the bank-note fully confirms it to be no idle frolic." His ideas were the ſame as his maſter's, and they determined to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute implicitly the directions given. The receiving of the money hurt him; but it was abſolutely neceſſary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o diſcharge the debt, as he had none of his own, till that he had ſent for arrived: he however reſolved to find out, if poſſible, the perſon, and repay him with every acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, if the ſuſpicions were well grounded.</p>
                     <p>Alfred determined, in the firſt place, not to ſee his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and gave Leonard orders, if any of the ſervants ſhould come from, Groſvenor-ſquare, to ſend word back he was not at home.</p>
                     <p>About eleven o'clock, the tailor arrived, was introduced, and received his money. The man was aſtoniſhed. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred inſiſted on his taking a glaſs of wine, and made him a preſent for the trouble he had cauſed. He then related to him the ſcheme which he had heard was to be put in practice by the count and himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Surpriſe, guilt, and conſternation, ſtopped the tailor's utterance: he believed it muſt be ſome ſupernatural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that had informed him of it. Alfred argued with him for ſome time, explained the villainy of ſuch proceedings, and the ruin that might have enſued. In ſhort, he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much on the poor fellow's feelings, that he fell at his feet, aſked ten thouſand pardons, and begged to know
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035833_0101_10093D4DAAFEE988"/>
if he could in any reſpect ſerve him, to recompence the injury he had intended to commit.</p>
                     <p>Alfred took him at his word, and informed him that the only way to make reparation, would be, to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the count, and ſay that every circumſtance had ſucceeded to his wiſhes, for that Mr. Maſerini was in cloſe confinement. The man promiſed to be punctual in the meſſage, and, after again thanking him for his generoſity, departed.</p>
                     <p>As it was expected, a ſervant called from ſir Peter's, to my that miſs Maſerini wiſhed much to ſee her brother Leonard told him he was juſt gone out.</p>
                     <p>Alfred then ſent to procure his dreſs with as much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y as poſſible: it was a plain domino, that he might not be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of the afternoon, the ſervant from Groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venor-ſquare arrived a ſecond time; but was anſwered as before, that Mr. Maſerini was not yet returned; he left a note from his ſiſter, and deſired it might be given him as ſoon as he came home. Alfred opened it: Matilda in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him how much againſt her inclination it was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the count to a maſquerade; yet ſhe could not decline the invitation without abſolute rudeneſs. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted her brother would be there, and concluded with ſaying, ſhe ſuppoſed he had alſo received a ticket.</p>
                     <p>He reſolved to take no notice of the letter, but as the anonymous epiſtle deſired (the contents of which he had now every reaſon to believe authentic), to go himſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to every one.

The wiſhed-for hour of twelve was announced; when, having placed in his pocket a brace of piſtols, he threw himſelf into a hackney coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to the Pantheon.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
                     <p>ALFRED ordered the coachman, when he ſtopped at the front doors in Oxford-road, to drive round and wait for him at the back entrance.</p>
                     <p>The Pantheon was crowded; the company were nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and elegant; every one looked happy and pleaſed with each other. "I," ſaid Alfred, "am the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſeem unſociable and alone." Several characters paſſed, which he knew by their voices; but he could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where trace thoſe he wiſhed to recogniſe; when on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a group of bacchanals ruſhed by him, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among them he obſerved Don Quixote. Having addreſſed the figure in a feigned voice, by inquiring after his Dulcinea del Toboſo, he immediately received a witty anſwer from a tongue which plainly confirmed it to be Henry Pevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil.</p>
                     <p>He now judged the reſt of the party muſt be in the rooms, and accordingly continued his ſearch.</p>
                     <p>In about a quarter of an hour he perceived the knight join his company; they were dreſſed exactly as the letter had deſcribed, except that he could obſerve only two do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minios, which he found were his ſiſter and the count; but ſoon after heard them ſpeak, as if they were ſurpriſed at not ſeeing Mr. Milverne</p>
                     <p>At ſupper the greater part of the company unmaſked,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035833_0103_10093D4F31725340"/>
and Alfred was confirmed that his conjectures on each of the characters were right. He ſtill continued diſguiſed, with his eye fixed on them: and it gave pleaſure to ſee Matilda treat the count with the utmoſt coolneſs: but yet he thought he could perceive, in the countenance of the latter, a malicious ſmile occaſioned by the hope of having her ſhortly in his power. Theſe ideas made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double his vigilance; and he directly after the repaſt join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them almoſt cloſe, but ſtrove as much as poſſible to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape notice.</p>
                     <p>Henry Peviquil and his father ſeemed heated by the wine they had drank; miſs Peviquil was chiefly taken up in gallanting with a gambling friend to her brother's; and her ladyſhip in paying compliments of her faſhionable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Count D'Ollifont attended to none but his fair relation; and the inattention ſhe received from the others, gave him an opportunity of continuing his polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Alfred remarked a magician who followed alſo the ſteps of the count; his dreſs was, truly conformablo to the part he performed, and he held in one hand a wand, the emblem of his power. This figure gave him ſome chagrin, and he reſolved to addreſs it, by aſking him in what manner he made uſe of his art: the magician an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, in a voice which he thought he had ſomewhere heard, "That he puniſhed the guilty, and gave ſuccour to the innocent. I know you, young man," ſaid he: "and you are in a noble cauſe; be cautious how you execute it."</p>
                     <p>Alfred was ſtaggered at this reply, but yet thought they might be words of chance, and begged an explanation of the incoherent ſentence. The magician ſaid, he would convince him of his knowledge; and immediately wrote on a card the following words. "Your name is Maſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni; your buſineſs at this place is to protect the honor of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035833_0104_10093D081F678148"/>
your family in the perſon of your ſiſter: the time draws near: be diligent, and fail not."</p>
                     <p>By the time he had read theſe few words, the magician was gone; and the aſtoniſhed Alfred ſtood for ſome time motionleſs: he ſeemed in a dream, and could hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his ſenſes; yet he ſuppoſed this ſtranger muſt be the perſon who had ſent him the letter. The count and his ſiſter were nearly out of ſight at a different part of the Rotunda, but he quickly made up to them; their party had entirely diſperſed, and Matilda ſeemed extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy. The former in vain ſtrove to give her comfort; ſhe could hardly conceal her tears. It was about three o'clock, the time fixed for the horrid ſcheme, when Alfred obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the count draw his ſiſter to another room, under the idea of ſeeking their friends. He followed, and heard him inform her that he had been juſt told they waited for them in their carriages at the back entrance. He led her to the door; that being a place for chairs only, there were no coaches near. The count conducted Matilda down the ſtreet, and turned into a part where there was a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot and one hackney coach waiting at a little diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Matilda, ſeeing no one in the carriage, refuſed to enter it: the count entreated, but ſhe ſtill continued obſtinate, and ſeemed extremely alarmed. They were not within hearing of any perſon but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he hackney coachman and another man who ſtood with him. Alfred gaſped for breath; his very ſoul was convulſed with rage. Count D'Ollifont with ſome vehemence again inſiſted on her complying with his requeſt: ſhe anſwered, ſhe would die firſt, and burſt into a flood of tears: he then began to force her into the carriage.</p>
                     <p>"Your brother, now, madam," ſaid the count, "is
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035833_0105_10093D5302828848"/>
not here to encourage your pride, or fruſtrate my wiſhes." She ſcreamed, and fainted.</p>
                     <p>"Damnable villain!" exclaimed Alfred: "know thou art miſtaken: for you now behold him ready to protect the honor of his houſe, by cruſhing to the earth that wretch who dare ſeduce his ſiſter."</p>
                     <p>While he uttered theſe words, Matilda remained in the arms of one of the count's ſervants, inſenſible. Leonard, who had dreaded his maſter's violence of temper by the piſtols he had taken in his pockets, determined to be near at the time, to aſſiſt his young lady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he accordingly waited with a hackney coach, the ſame that ſtood near the count's chariot. He immediately ran to the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Matilda, forced her from the footman, and placed her in the vehicle he had hired.</p>
                     <p>During this time count D'Ollifont was ſtruck motionleſs: he could hardly believe himſelf awake; but the figure of the enraged Frenchman, who had now unmaſked, plainly confirmed the truth.</p>
                     <p>"I was only," ſaid he with a ſmile, "going to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct your ſiſter to ſir Peter's."</p>
                     <p>"Liar I villain!" exclaimed Alfred, "thou waſt going to take her to a place where, unprotected, ſhe muſt have ſunk beneath thy diabolical intentions; nay more," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, in a low voice, "I ſtrongly ſuſpect thee to be the murderer of her father."</p>
                     <p>He ſtarted, ſtood about a minute in a thoughtful poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then uttered with a curſe—"Deſperate cauſes require deſperate rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dies!"—pulled a piſtol from his ſide pocket, and fired at his adverſary:—owing to his agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the ball paſſed, and Alfred remained unhurt: but he inſtantly diſcharged one at the count, who fell, and every ſpark of life ſeemed extinguiſhed. The coachman
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035833_0106_10093D0C523C8888"/>
and the footman cried their maſter was murdered, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſecured the young foreigner, who made no reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but ſeemed buried in a reverie; till the magician, whom he had noticed in the rooms, came up.</p>
                     <p>"I ſee," ſaid he, "there has been bloody work here; but puniſhment has fallen on the right perſon." He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſked, and diſcovered the features of Mr. Milverne.</p>
                     <p>The men ſtill kept their hold of Alfred: but no crowd had aſſembled, as they were ſome diſtance from the doors, and in a private ſtreet. Mr. Milverne took the part of his friend, ſoon diſengaged him from confinement, and with the aſſiſtance of Leonard, who had by this time made himſelf known, forced him to the coach. They promiſe the man a large reward, if he would drive as faſt as poſſible towards the firſt ſtage to Dover.</p>
                     <p>The horſes, which had not been out in the day, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the utmoſt ſpeed; and the driver, in hopes of the money, failed not to exert his abilities in keeping up their pace, inſomuch that he brought them to an inn at Dartford by eight in the morning.</p>
                     <p>During the time of their journey, Matilda learnt from her brother the whole affair, and plainly perceived they muſt be plunged into new difficulties in conſequence of the count's death.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Milverne might be ſuſpected as the cauſe of it; and the idea that ſhe ſhould never ſee him more, added new pangs to thoſe ſhe already experienced.</p>
                     <p>Leonard informed them, when they had got ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from town, that a packet from France had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the people of the houſe where they lodged; who had neglected to give it till after his maſter had ſet off to the maſquerade: he therefore, having no place to
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035833_0107_10093D57B7F04448"/>
put it under lock and key, determined to bring it in his pocket.</p>
                     <p>This was a fortunate circumſtance, as the direction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it to come from M. Le Mercier: on opening it, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred received the money he had wrote for; it gave them ſome comfort, as it would ſupport them with economy for ſome time. But this was of little conſequence when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> his life muſt be ſacrificed as ſoon as the count's death was made known in France; his intereſt being ſo great at court, as to prevent any de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ence from ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon who had deprived him of his exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>He determined, however, rather to die than cowardly ſhrink from juſtice, and diſgrace the name of a ſoldier. He related to his ſiſter his reſolution; but ſhe conjured him not to riſk his life, from a punctilio of honor.</p>
                     <p>"You are engaged in a juſt cauſe," continued Matilda, and need not be aſhamed of your conduct being known to the world." She uſed many other arguments, and aſked him, "To whom ſhe was to look for protection, when he was no more."</p>
                     <p>"To God," he exclaimed; "for among mankind all honour is loſt. I am ſick of the world, Matilda, and care not how ſoon I leave it." "Surely," ſaid ſhe, "that fortitude, courage, and patience, which were the leading traits in your character, and which uſed to charm our departed mother, are vaniſhed: have you no deſire to ſee Graſville Abbey?" The name ſtruck him to the heart. "Who can tell but it is ordained for you to unravel that myſtery which has ſo long hung over our family, and been the ruin of our houſe? But heaven forbid, Alfred, that I ſhould perſuade you to act contrary to that honour which for years has been the boaſt of our forefathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035833_0108_10093D0DD825C340"/>
if, therefore, you reſolve to make yourſelf known in France, I will cheerfully enter a convent, and take leave of a world in which I have little happineſs to expect." Here ſhe ſighed deeply; her heart reminded her that the image of Mr. Milverne would often intrude amid thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties ſhe would then be bound to perform.</p>
                     <p>Alfred continued ſilent; his curioſity to ſee the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of his anceſtors, the hopes of finding ſome clue to the myſtic diſappearance of his father, urged him to adopt the plans his ſiſter had propoſed; but his honour, his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter as an officer and a man, forbade it.</p>
                     <p>Every mile he found himſelf farther from London, his perplexity increaſed; nor was his determination by any means fixed, when the coach drove up to the principal inn at Dartford. Alfred handſomely rewarded the man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to ſay nothing concerning the buſineſs he had been witneſs to, but give feigned anſwers to thoſe who ſhould wonder at ſeeing a hack ſo far from London. The coachman promiſed faithfully to obey his orders. They each took ſome refreſhment, hired poſt horſes, and ſet off again in leſs than an hour towards Dover.</p>
                     <p>Alfred during the journey informed his ſiſter that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions were fixed to join his regiment, and throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the mercy of his countrymen. "I ſcorn," ſaid he, "to fly ignobly from a puniſhment I flatter myſelf I do not juſtly deſerve."</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſhed a flood of tears, but perfectly acquieſced in his wiſhes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he ſtrove to think no more of Mr. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne; that was impoſſible, but yet ſhe conſidered, the ſtrict and awful ceremonies of a monaſtic life would, in a courſe of time, eraſe thoſe thoughts from her boſom. Alfred in ſome reſpects was in a ſimilar ſituation; his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with lady Caroline Albourn was firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035833_0109_10093D5AFAE17898"/>
in the midſt of diſſipation, yet he felt many pangs at the idea of loſing her for ever. In this career of folly he had perſuaded himſelf that he was no farther intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the affair, than merely the idea of being intimate with a young lady of faſhion, and having an opportunity of toaſting a beautiful girl; but he now plainly perceived that he loved lady Caroline ſo far as to make his life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable without her. There was alſo another cauſe for uneaſineſs; his debts in London were unpaid to the name of murderer, the appellation of ſwindler muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: a title he in ſome meaſure merited.</p>
                     <p>His ſilence plainly told the ſtate of his mind; while his ſiſter ſhed many tears at thoughts of their preſent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and at the recollection of thoſe happy hours ſhe had experienced under the care of maternal tenderneſs, never, never, to return.</p>
                     <p>Leonard ſhared the ſorrows of them both; yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome little comfort at the thoughts of returning to that country where he had ſpent the chief part of his life. They arrived rather late at Dover; Leonard was directly diſpatched to inquire what time the packet would ſail, and brought word back, not till the following evening. This intelligence was extremely diſagreeable to them; as they might before that time be recogniſed, taken into cuſtody, and conducted back to London. They were neceſſitated, however, to wait patienely the event; but Alfred reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with ſome terror, on the horrors of a jail, in a ſtrange country, and under laws he was equally a ſtranger to. Under theſe circumſtances, they remained at the inn as private as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>About two hours before they intended to ſail, a man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived poſt from London; he aſked if any travellers were in that houſe, who intended going to France, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035833_0110_10093D10EFE96568"/>
in the affirmative. Leonard, who by chance over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard the conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ation, ran to his maſter, and informed him of the affair; each conjectured it to be an officer of juſtice, and Alfred waited with fortitude and compoſure the event; when they were agreeably ſurpriſed, by ſeeing the innkeeper introduce Mr. Milverne's valet.</p>
                     <p>He delivered a letter, the firſt ſentence of which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following words:</p>
                     <p>"Count D'Ollifont is not yet dead."—"Thanks be to heaven!" exclaimed Alfred, and communicated the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able intelligence to his ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Milverne informed him, that he was kept in cuſtody till late in the morning, when he procured bail; being then taken before a magiſtrate, he explained the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and was honourably cleared. He further informed him that the count's indiſpoſition was very uncertain, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him by no means to remain in England, or make himſelf known in France, as count D'Ollifont had many friends in that country, who, immediately as they knew of the event, would, through particular intereſt at court, place him in the Baſtile for life, even if the former ſhould recover of his wound.</p>
                     <p>In the latter part of the letter he mentioned Matilda with the utmoſt tenderneſs, pitied her ſituation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Alfred by no means to run hazards, through falſe notions of honour, and leave his ſiſter deſtitute of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. He concluded with ſaying, he thought they had better paſs over as quick as poſſible to Italy, but requeſted he would ſend word what part they reſolved to viſit, as he himſelf hoped to join them in a few weeks.</p>
                     <p>Alfred wrote an anſwer, expreſſing his gratitude for the gentlemanlike and friendly treatment he had received; informed him that he at firſt reſolved to throw himſelf on
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035833_0111_10093D5C85228F58"/>
the laws of his country, although he knew them to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere where a courtier or man of intereſt was concerned;—but that his letter had entirely altered his reſolutions, and that he now intended to travel as faſt and as privately as poſſible towards Italy: that the hope of ſeeing him there, and making proper apologies for the ſtrange behaviour he had been guilty of towards him, would in a great meaſure alleviate the diſagreeable manner of his journey. He concluded with his ſiſter's thanks for his kind inquiries, and the equal pleaſure ſhe would enjoy with himſelf, on ſeeing Mr. Milverne in a ſhort interval of time.</p>
                     <p>This letter was given to the valet, and he ſet off imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. The veſſel ſet ſail a ſhort time after, and Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard informed his maſter, while they were croſſing the Channel, that he had learned from Mr Milverne's ſervant, that the anonymous letter he had received was ſent by that gentleman; for that he, the valet, was employed by his maſter to draw the plan of proceedings from the count's confidential ſervant, whom he contrived to intoxicate with liquor, and then communicated to Mr. Milverne the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence he had received.</p>
                     <p>Alfred was vexed that Leonard did not inform him of this circumſtance ſooner, that he might have returned the money he received, and acknowledged the obligation.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was ſtill more attached to him: ſhe was happy in the change of ſentiments which his letter had cauſed in her brother, and looked forward with a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of pleaſure for the time when he ſhould join them abroad.</p>
                     <p>After a pleaſant voyage of a few hours, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves landed in their native country; but in a far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſituation from that they were in when they left it:
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035833_0112_10093D12ACFB2300"/>
then they were honoured and reſpected by all, and afraid of meeting no one: now they were under misfortunes and concealment, ſhrinking from the eyes of every beholder, like wretched outcaſts of ſociety, and terrified at being obſerved by every individual.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035833_0113_10093D5F1D84E668"/>
of diſagreeable events at a former part of life, but with anguiſh and diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Of the numberleſs griefs and afflictions to which human nature is ſubject, poverty is held up as one of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble magnitude; it generally procures contempt and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatment from the haughty ſons of wealth; and the opinion of the world in general is by no means favourable to thoſe who are not poſſeſſors of riches and affluence. Theſe miſtaken and ſhameful ideas are almoſt too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in every country; and the child of miſery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives great addition to his woes by the ſneers and ſcandal of his neighbours. Equality, though a word of terror to the great, if taken in its true meaning, implies ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt noble and generous kind; inſtead of pulling down laws, and levelling the whole claſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it would confirm unity, peace, and good order.</p>
                     <p>The rod of oppreſſion too often falls upon that man who is unable, through misfortunes or peculiar circumſtances, to raiſe himſelf againſt the weight; but cruſhed by its power, he ſinks beneath the force of injuſtice, and is loſt to his God, his family, and himſelf; whereas, in the time of his ſorrows, had he received comfort, ſuccour, or aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he might have continued to have proved a valuable member of ſociety.</p>
                     <p>Alfred Maſerini meditated with painful ideas on thoſe diſtreſſes which had happened, through his own miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, during the time they had been in England. He not only beheld himſelf ſurrounded with difficulties, but his ſiſter, who was innocent of the cauſe, equally involved, through his errors and vices. Young, beautiful, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, ſhe was but ill calculated to undergo the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of life; yet ſhe ſubmitted to them with reſignation, and could even teach patience to him who had brought her
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035833_0114_10093D18207D2380"/>
to the preſent diſquietude. This would cut him to the ſoul; and the ſcalding tear of repentance would often ſtart from his eye, in defiance of the many efforts he made to conceal it.</p>
                     <p>He was impetuous, proud, and courageous in his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; yet, in feelings he was a woman: nor was his pride of that nature to make him over-look affliction, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though concealed in a hut of poverty and miſery. But he laid too great a ſtreſs on the punctilios of honour and high birth; he valued the name he bore, with ſuch ardour as to make him reſent the leaſt affront offered in the family to which it belonged.</p>
                     <p>Their arrival at Calais was attended with diſagreeable and degrading circumſtances, on account of their giving in their names, which were feigned ones, and the review of their baggage, which conſiſted of clothes and a few arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which Matilda had received from Mr. Milverne's va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; that gentleman having procured from ſir Peter's what little goods ſhe ſet a value on, and deſired his ſervant to deliver them at Dover. Their travelling through France was in every reſpect extremely uncomfortable, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties they met with in conſequence of their endeavouring to conceal themſelves from vulgar curioſity, extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing.</p>
                     <p>They had nearly arrived at the Alps, when they halted for the night at a ſmall inn. The accommodation was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indifferent, and they were given to underſtand by the hoſteſs that ſome Engliſh perſons of diſtinction were then in the houſe, who took up the beſt rooms. They were therefore neceſſitated to put up with the inconvenience, and, after a ſcanty meal, retired to poor and deſolate apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Both Alfred and Matilda, with Leonard, had, the laſt day's journey, rode on horſes which the former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035833_0115_10093D61BA2066D0"/>
of a ſmuggler at a low price, conſidering that it would be the cheapeſt and moſt ſecret way of travelling. Leonard ſaw the cattle ſafely placed in a barn ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the houſe; the ſtables being occupied by the horſes and ſervants of the perſons whom the landlady had mentioned: he then laid himſelf down on a ſmall bed in one corner of the building.</p>
                     <p>Leonard had not been aſleep above two hours, before he was awakened by a glare of light which darted right on his eyes through an opening on one ſide of the barn. He immediately ſtarted up, and looked out at the door, and perceived that the inn was in flames. He hurried on his clothes, and ran as faſt as poſſible to the ſpot, in order to aſſiſt his maſter and young lady. By the time he got there, one part of the houſe was entirely burnt down, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſurrounded with flames: he was happy however to ſee his maſter and Matilda ſafe; and the former deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him the trunks, which he took care to place in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                     <p>A number of peaſants were aſſembled round, and each ſeemed to bewail the ſituation of a young lady and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſlept in thoſe rooms which were on fire; but no one dared to go to their aſſiſtance, as the whole fabric was expected to fall in a few minutes. Nor was the general conjecture wrong, for in a very little time the front gave way, and fell; which diſcovered the internal part of the two rooms. They could ſee nothing of the gentleman; it was therefore ſuppoſed that he was ſuffocated, and had fallen among the ruins at the back part; but the eyes of the ſpectators experienced a moſt horrid ſight in the other apartment: a young lady was ſtanding in the middle of the flames. The agony ſuch a ſituation muſt inſpire, had made her inſenſible; her hands were
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035833_0116_10093D1C29A740F8"/>
claſped together, and her eyes lifted towards heaven. The people cried out to give her aſſiſtance; but none dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed try the experiment, till Alfred, touched with compaſſion for the unfortunate female, ſprang forward with a ladder, and placed it againſt the part of the building which was yet ſtanding: he had aſcended above half way, when the part where the ladder reſted againſt broke from his weight; but he had roſe far enough to perceive, to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment, that it was lady Caroline Albourne.</p>
                     <p>At this ſight, Alfred forgot all danger, and reſolved to die or ſave her: he accordingly, when he found the ſteps fall from under him, claſped a poſt which ſupported the ſtory, and with an amazing agility ſprang on the tottering floor of the room. He took her in his arms, but found no ladder ſet for his deſcent; the people were afraid to come near, on account of the falling in of the building, which, would bury them in the ruins. He called to them; but his cries were vain; till Leonard, who was returned from conducting Matilda to a houſe a little diſtance from the ſpot, ſeeing his maſter in ſuch a ſituation, ran for the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but it was too late, for Alfred felt the place on which he ſtood, muſt ſink with them, before he could get to the ground by that method: he therefore, with remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity, jumped from the part with lady Caroline in his arms, and fell on a feather bed which by chance had been thrown out at the beginning of the fire.</p>
                     <p>They were immediatly dragged ſome diſtance off, and in one minute after, the whole fabric fell to the ground.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of the unfortunate lady Caroline may be better imagined than deſcribed; for even when ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the inſenſibility which the thoughts of her danger had cauſed, it was but to experience new miſery. Her father, without doubt, was buried in the ruins; ſhe
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035833_0117_10093D659F1DC648"/>
had not yet ſeen her deliverer, nor knew of the heroic cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that had been exerted in her behalf; for, from the moment the front of her chamber fell, ſhe ſaw nor heard no more till her recovery in the houſe to which ſhe had been conveyed. She was now attended by ſeveral perſons, and her own woman ſervant, who had ſlept in the back room, and leapt from the window at the firſt alarm. At this period, while all were bewailing the loſs of lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne, he entered the room, ſupported by two ſervants. Lady Caroline fainted, and afterwards fell into hyſterics, occaſioned by the joy of ſeeing her father, whom ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as no more. He embraced her, and ſhed tears of paternal tenderneſs for the ſafety of his child.</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip, when awaked by the alarm of fire, knew it would be ſome time before he could enter his daughter's chamber, as ſhe always bolted her door on the inſide; and that the fright which ſo ſudden an information might give her, would moſt likely prevent her from opening it at all; he therefore conſidered it would be beſt to get out at the back part as ſoon as poſſible, and fly to her aſſiſtance in the front. With this idea, he attempted to deſcend the ſtair-caſe, but found it in flames: this ſight drove him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. Without waiting for help, he jumped from the window, and was ſo hurt by the fall, that he lay inſenſible for ſome time, when one of his ſervants found him in that ſituation, and conducted him to the houſe which was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by the other ſufferers.</p>
                     <p>Alfred Maſerini, his ſiſter, and Leonard, were in another apartment; they neither of them judged it expedient to appear before lord Albourne, his daughter, or any of the ſervants, for fear a ſudden exclamation of their name ſhould diſcover them to thoſe who were about. They reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore, to remain private till morning, and then
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035833_0118_10093D1EE9646F80"/>
have an interview with his lordſhip. The fire being part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſhed, the people diſperſed, and quiet was in ſome meaſure reſtored.</p>
                     <p>At breakfaſt his lordſhip inquired in what manner his daughter eſcaped death. They were both informed of the circumſtances relative to the behaviour of the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who had ſo valiantly undertaken to reſcue her; and heard not the repeated praiſes of the ruſties unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Lord Albourne's heart, as well as his daughter's, overflowed with gratitude, and they both requeſted to ſee him as ſoon as poſſible. The woman of the houſe ſaid ſhe would call him directly, for that he had deſired to be alone the remainder of the night. She left her noble gueſts, and repaired to the room where Alfred ſlept. Having knocked ſeveral times without receiving any anſwer, ſhe opened the door, and, to her aſtoniſhment, found it empty. She immediately entered the chamber of his ſiſter, and ſaw that was alſo deſerted. The ſtables and loft where Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard ſlept, were alſo ſearched; but neither cattle nor man could be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>In Alfred's deſerted apartment, they obſerved a note which lay on the table; it was directed to lord Albourne: he received it, and the intelligence that the writer could no-where be found. His lordſhip read the following words:</p>

                     <p>If lord Albourne was aſtoniſhed at the elopement of lady Caroline's preſerver, he was, if poſſible, far more ſurpriſed at the contents of this note; and although he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Lady Caroline ſighed; her underſtanding told her his lordſhip's arguments were juſt; but her heart informed her ſhe muſt ſuffer in the acquieſcence to them.</p>

                     <p>Lord Albourne was now ſeriouſly alarmed, and reſolved on a ſudden ſcheme, to break off at once the connection.</p>
                     <p>He had received advice to travel, on account of his health, which had been in a declining ſtate for ſome months. He conſidered this as a good opportunity to comply with the wiſhes of his friends; and by taking lady Caroline with him, the novelties of other countries, diſtance, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, might break an acquaintance which threatened her happineſs for ever.</p>
                     <p>He accordingly ordered the ſervants to deny their young lady, whenever Mr. Maſerini ſhould call that day; and then gave immediate directions for a long journey, which
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035833_0122_10093D254E587858"/>
he intended to take the next morning, having buſineſs of importance to tranſact in the country.</p>
                     <p>Lady Caroline was aſtoniſhed, when ſhe was requeſted by her father to accompany him, and prepare her ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe in as little time as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>"Your lordſhip I ſuppoſe means to make no great ſtay: conſequently, I ſhall have little occaſion for many dreſſes."</p>
                     <p>"If I find, Caroline," returned lord Albourne, "that the air agrees with me, I may perhaps remain there ſome weeks, if not months; and, in that caſe, ſhall without doubt wiſh for your company. You had, therefore, better order the chief part of your clothes to be packed up: even your writing and drawing implements I would adviſe you to take with you."</p>
                     <p>The young lady was ſtill more ſurpriſed and vexed at the ſtay her father intended to make; but even to wiſh not to go with him, was, in her ideas, cruelty to a parent who had always been ſo tenderly attached to her.</p>
                     <p>The next day they took leave of London. Lady Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line did not mention the circumſtance of ſeeing Alfred at the turnpike gate. At a late hour in the evening they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Lady Caroline made no anſwer; but her looks ſhowed ſhe thought her father's proceedings right, although they were entirely againſt her own inclinations. The next morning they croſſed over to Calais, and travelled ſlowly towards the Alps, when they ſtopped at that inn where our young adventurers arrived a few hours after.</p>
                     <p>It was not a wonder that lord Albourne ſhould be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined at the note he received; when it informed him that the very man who had given him ſo much uneaſineſs, and on whoſe account he left England, had in a few days' time overtaken them, and, by a noble act of courage and generoſity, bound himſelf by the ſtrongeſt ties, to the grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude of both his daughter and himſelf.</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip, however, was ſoon convinced that his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on the cauſe of Alfred's departure was ill founded; but his knowledge of the actual reaſon of it ſerved, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to hurt him more than ever in that nobleman's opinion.</p>
                     <p>It will be now neceſſary to acquaint the reader with thoſe circumſtances that occaſioned the young travellers precipitate elopement from the inn.</p>
                     <p>Leonard was a ſecond time going to retire to his bed, which was no better than a heap of ſtraw placed by the ſide of his horſes, when a large paper, ſtuck on the door of the ſtable, met his eye. Fatigued as he was, curioſity prompted him to hold up the lanthorn which he had in his hand, in order to read the contents; when, to his aſtoniſhment and horror, he preceived it to be an order for apprehending Alfred Maſerini, as a deſerter from his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a large reward to be given to any one who would produce him.</p>
                     <p>Aſtoniſhed and alarmed at this intelligence, he ſtood
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035833_0124_10093D26D6BF1308"/>
ſome moments motionleſs. Having in ſome degree recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, he ran back to the houſo; fortunately the entrance was not faſtened, and he arrived, without difficulty, at his maſter's chamber. He knocked, and Alfred anſwered: Leonard begged to be admitted. No ſooner had he entered the room, than he informed him of the advertiſment which he had ſeen, and entreated his maſter to ſet off again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. "I am perfectly well acquainted, ſir, with a way acroſs the Alps, and will be bound to conduct you ſafe into Italy."</p>
                     <p>This information was the moſt ſevere trial Alfred had ever yet experienced; he now ſaw his character and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ruined, his name branded as that of a coward, and even publicly expoſed as a villain, by a reward to be given for his perſon. "Leonard," ſaid he, half frantic "take care of my ſiſter, and I will this moment fly and deliver myſelf up to my country; then I will explain my motives for my preſent behaviour, and die in a manner that ſhall not diſgrace my family."</p>
                     <p>"Alas, ſir," anſwered Leonard, "conſider my young lady. I am a poor man, and little able to afford her that protection you requeſt: not but that I would die in her defence; yet I am afraid my exertions in her behalf would be only looked on with contempt."</p>
                     <p>Alfred was tortured with contending paſſions:—one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his honour made him reſolve to give himſelf up a victim to the ſentence of a deſerter; but then his ſiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the power of count D'Ollifont, (who might recover) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented herſelf to his fancy, nor was the idea of lady Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line abſent from his mind. A hope, a diſtant hope, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſpire him with a wiſh to fly once more ignobly from purſuit, and try his fortune in that part where his parents had experienced the moſt poignant diſtreſſes.</p>

Leonard was overjoyed at this reſolution, and directly crept down ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> horſes; and Alfred promiſed to follow in a little time. Having knocked at the door of his ſiſter's apartment, he requeſted in a low voice that ſhe would riſe immediately, dreſs herſelf, take every thing out of the room that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, and come to his chamber.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was aſtoniſhed; but it was not a time for inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; ſhe accordingly did as he deſired, as ſoon as poſſible. In the mean time he wrote with a pencil thoſe few lines that were delivered to lord Albourne Being joined by his ſiſter, he took their trunk, and led her to the ſtable; when, being placed on her horſe, they departed with as much expedition as the darkneſs of the morning would permit.</p>
                     <p>There was not a doubt but that an order from France for Alfred's return to his regiment, at a very ſhort notice, had been ſent a few hours after he left his lodgings; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to advertiſe him as a deſerter, was a method equally ſtrange and uncommon.—In ſhort, count D'Ollifont's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference ſeemed to appear in the affair; and they greatly ſuſpected it was through his friends, ſome of whom were ſuperior officers, and others in great favour at court, that ſuch cruel proceedings were occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>Alfred remained in a deep reverie; and it was from Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard that his ſiſter learnt the reaſon for ſo ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable a flight. They wore ſome miles from the houſe by day-light, and halted at a ſmall cottage for ſome refreſhment, before they began their journey on the Alps. They had here, fortunately, an opportunity of changing the three horſes for two mules and a kind of carriage which would be more convenient and ſafe for Matilda to travel in; and alſo prevent remarks, which the ſight of
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035833_0126_10093D29D3049760"/>
other animals might have occaſioned among the peaſants. In about an hour they again ſet off, and Leonard acted as driver the chief part of the way.</p>
                     <p>Nothing particular occurred during their journey acroſs the Alps, which was extremely difficult and tedious, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a viſible alteration in Alfred's health for the worſe, and a ſettled deep melancholy in his ſiſter, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened a total decline in her conſtitution. Leonard in vain ſtrove to point out to them the beauties of the country and the romantic ſcenery which ſurrounded them; their own misfortunes engroſſed every idea; and the cloud of miſery, which had ſo long been gathering over their heads, ſeemed now ready to burſt with full force and horror.—Their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in Italy was productive of little joy or comfort, as they had every reaſon to ſuppoſe the ſame papers had been publiſhed through that country. They ſecreted themſelves as well as poſſible at every place where they ſtopped, uſing the niceſt economy for fear of exhauſting their little ſtore; which, although it might laſt them a conſiderable time with frugality, yet, with extravagance, could be but of ſhort duration.</p>
                     <p>Alfred had reſolved in his own mind, from their firſt ſetting off from Dover, to viſit Graſville Abbey; he now conſidered it would be a place of great ſervice in point of ſecreting them from their enemies, as there was little doubt but ſuperſtition had kept it entirely free from inhabitants or curious viſitors. But theſe intentions he determined to keep from the knowledge of Matilda; for he well knew the idea of reſiding there would add greatly to thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhe already experienced: and the circumſtances of the light in the weſt tower, the noiſe which was heard by their father, and his remarkable diſappearance, were ſubjects which his ſiſter dwelt on with horror, whenever ſhe read
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035833_0127_10093D758EF4D3B0"/>
the manuſcript of her aunt. But he hoped to purſuade her to remain there for ſome little time, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that ſhe would ſoon become comfortable in it, even as a place of abode.</p>
                     <p>Leonard well knew the roads that led to the Abbey, as he had often ſeen it when young, and could well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the hoſpitality and goodneſs of the old count Maſerini. To him Alfred privately conveyed his intentions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him to bring them to the manſion on a ſudden, and unknown to Matilda. The man ſeemed hurt on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his young lady, and begged leave to remind him that it would be cruel to diſtreſs her, when ſhe needed no more occaſions for terror or alarm.</p>
                     <p>"I thank you for the caution," returned Alfred coolly; "but am not yet ſo great a villain as to behave in the manner you ſuppoſe."</p>
                     <p>Leonard looked confuſed; his maſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ontinued—</p>
                     <p>"I will not even propoſe a favourable argument to keep her there againſt her own inclination. But you muſt agree, that if Matilda could diveſt herſelf of idle terrors, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the plan, it would in every reſpect be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly fortunate, both in preſerving our little property, and concealing us from the eye of malice or contempt."</p>
                     <p>With theſe intentions they rode ſome leagues each day, and, on the fifth morning from their firſt entering Italy, found themſelves within ſix hours' travelling of Graſville Abbey. The clouds ſeemed to indicate an approaching ſtorm; rain fell in large drops, and ſeveral claps of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were heard at a diſtance. Matilda was alarmed, and begged they might alight at ſome place where they might find ſhelter till the tempeſt ſhould in ſome degree abate. In vain they looked round for a cottage or hovel to anſwer their purpoſe; no ſuch place could be ſeen; when their
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035833_0128_10093D2C81E444A8"/>
attention was called off by the ſight of a young girl, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly about ſixteen. Her hands were claſped, and her eyes lifted towards heaven. Her appearance ſhowed both terror and diſtreſs. Leonard drove to the ſpot where ſhe ſtood, and Alfred offered the ſhelter of their vehicle, which ſhe accepted with joy; and by her thanks for their kindneſs they perceived ſhe was a native of France. Matilda in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to what part ſhe was going. She anſwered, with an unaffected ſimplicity, "Any where." They were both aſtoniſhed at the reply, but reſtrained their curioſity and deſired Leonard to drive on.</p>
                     <p>The ſtorm had now blown over, though the clouds were ſtill gloomy and unſettled; but the latter part of the day they again joined, and ſeemed to foretel another war of elements. Vivid flaſhes of white lightning darted on the ground, and loud claps of thunder (which was now much nearer) burſt over their heads. Matilda declared ſhe would rather put up with any ſituation, than travel while it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Agnes (which was the name of the young girl) was extremely terrified. At that moment they perceived the turrets of Graſville Abbey riſe above the trees which ſurrounded it. Alfred ordered Leonard to drive immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to it.</p>
                     <p>Matilda <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſhuddered, yet was aſhamed to confeſs her fears. It was now nearly dark, and they entered a grove of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cedars that led to the front gate. The lightning was horrid, and the thunder ſeemed to ſhake even the centre of the earth: both Agnes and Matilda were nearly inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when the carriage ſtopped before the Abbey. One wing ſeemed entirely in ruins, but they had no time for obſervations. Leonard had not quitted the mule he rode on two minutes before the animal was ſtruck dead at his feet, and each expected the ſame fate. Alfred flew to the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035833_0129_10093DA83269C6E8"/>
gates, and being aſſiſted by his ſervant, after ſome efforts, they yielded to their ſtrength, and burſt open, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked.</p>
                     <p>Leonard drove the carriage into the court; having puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the heavy folding doors that led to the internal part, they eaſily opened, but with a conſiderable noiſe, that confirmed no one had entered this dreary manſion for many years. Agnes and Matilda were carried into the hall, and the mules and vehicle put under a piazza.</p>
                     <p>Leonard having kindled a fire on the pavement with ſome faggots, by the help of a tinder-box which he had in his pocket, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>SUPERSTITION (though greatly encouraged by idle converſation and fabulous tales) is natural to mankind, and often inhabits the breaſts of thoſe whoſe valour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity in other reſpects have been equally known and experienced.</p>
                     <p>It produces terrors of all others the moſt to be dreaded and ſtrove againſt; for although they cannot be entirely overcome, yet, by giving the leaſt way to them, life is at once made uncomfortable and diſagreeable.</p>
                     <p>From childhood we are taught to believe in the reality of preternatural apparitions, by the prattle and ſimple ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe who, in general, abuſe their care of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by inſtilling into their young minds terrific and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ideas. As age advances they are more likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe than decline; and the number of relations, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly authentic, which are continually in circulation, ſerve greatly to confirm the horrors of imagination. Whether

ſuch hiſtories proceed from the viſionary remorſe of guilty conſciencees; from affectation, or the tongue of falſehood; from inſanity, weakneſs, or oppreſſion of ſpirits; from nervous diſorders, or romantic thoughts and contrivances; is equally difficult to be aſcertained, as whether ſome of them are not actually true, and the works of a Supreme Deity, for wiſe and unknown ends. Many men of great learning and genius have differed widely on this point: and though even the immortal Addiſon could not poſitively give a deciſive opinion on thoſe topics, yet his words on the ſubject will ever be remembered and admired:</p>
                     <p>"I know of but one way of fortifying my ſoul againſt theſe gloomy preſages and terrors of mind; and that is, by ſecuring to myſelf the friendſhip and protection of that Being, who diſpoſes of events, and governs futurity.

When I lay me down to ſleep, I recommend myſelf to his care; when I awake I give myſelf up to his direction. Amidſt all the evils that threaten me, I will look up to him for help, and queſtion not but he will either avert them, or turn them to my advantage. Though I know neither the time nor the manner of the death I am to die, I am not at all ſolicitous about it; becauſe I am ſure that he knows them both, and that he will not fail to comfort and ſupport me under them."</p>
                     <p>Graſville Abbey was ſituated near Montſerrat in Italy, and but a little diſtance from the Gulph of Genoa; its lofty turrets on one ſido, commanded a view of Piedmont, and the proſpect was bounded by the towering and majeſtic ſummits of the Alps: the other wing looked over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective

                        </gap>, Placenza, Mirandola, and the river Po; while at the extremity of the proſpect, in an oblique view, Venice might juſt be obſerved. The back front looked over Valentia, Caſal, and Vercelli, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in a diſtant ſight of Savoy.</p>
                     <p>But none of theſe countries could be ſeen but from the top caſements of the two towers; the lower part of the Abbey being entirely ſurrounded by thick foliage, pines and cypreſs trees, with many ancient cedars.</p>
                     <p>The building was in every reſpect calculated to inſpire awe and ſolemnity, both in the external and internal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. After the death of the count Maſerini, many ſtrange accounts were talked of by the peaſants; and D'Ollifont's ſudden departure from it, at the funeral of his uncle, ſeemed to confirm thoſe reports that had before been circulated through the ſurrounding country. From that time it was ſhut up, without any of the furniture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed; and no one had been known to enter it till ſignor Maſerini, ſon to the late count, and father to Alfred and Matilda. His ſudden and remarkable diſappearance raiſed the horror of the place, if poſſible, more than ever; even thoſe who had before laughed at the ſuperſtition of their neighbours, were extremely alarmed at ſo dreadful and uncommon an occurrence. No perſon ever walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the entrance of the grove that led to the gates; and the only human habitation that ſtood near it was a cell which contained an old hermit, who had lived there ever ſince the Abbey had been forſaken, and ſubſiſted on the charity of the neighbouring cottagers.</p>
                     <p>The travellers remained in the hall till day light, when the ſtorm abated, and they began to wiſh for ſome repoſe. Leonard pulled two arm chairs, which ſtood in the receſs, towards the fire, and Agnes and Matilda ſtrove to ſleep in
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035833_0133_10093D771B435EC0"/>
them; while Alfred and his ſervant laid themſelves down on an old bench that ſtood near the ſpot. After ſome hours they awoke and found themſelves much refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Leonard was immediately diſpatched to ſee that the gates were cloſe in the ſame manner as they were before, to prevent ſuſpicion of any one having paſſed them.</p>
                     <p>They then opened their portmanteau, and found they had proviſions for that day: this circumſtance was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fortunate, as they could have time to contrive ſome method of repleniſhing their ſtore. Leonard had alſo got victuals for his ſurviving mule. They had now an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to take a more particular account of their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Alfred ſmilingly aſked his ſiſter if ſhe had any objection to explore with him the apartments by day-light: ſhe cheerfully conſented; but Agnes was terrified at the idea of attending them, and equally afraid of remaining in the hall by herſelf, but at laſt reſolved on the former.</p>
                     <p>The hall was of ancient architecture, but extremely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though heavy in the deſign. It was ſupported by large Gothic columns; the capitals were chiefly decayed; the ſhafts were compoſed of ſtained marble; and though of a conſiderable height, the diameters were greater than the ſtrict rules of that kind of architecture would admit. The top opened in a large dome and gallery, the walls of which had exhibited beautiful paintings, that were now nearly deſtroyed; a large painted ſky-light terminated the height; and additional light was received from four elevated caſements on different fides of the hall. Pilaſters of the ſame dimenſions upwards ſtood oppoſite the pillars, between each of which were niches that held ſtatues larger than life; theſe were in ſome preſervation, as the count had them placed when he firſt came to the eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Two large fire-places ſtood at each and, which ſeemed to ſhow that hoſpitality and the comforts of life had once

been enjoyed in this dreary and melancholy abode. The pavement was of black and white marble, the ſtones of which were of a conſiderable ſize. In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Two ſtone ſtair-caſes appeared on each ſide, which wound to the chambers above. Alfred reſolved firſt to examine the lower apartments, and accordingly opened the folding doors, which diſcovered a ſmall paſſage, ſupported by Tuſcan pillars; at the further part of it was a deſcent of ſeveral ſteps, which were in many parts broken and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at the bottom of them was a pair of large iron gates, through which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They re-aſcended the ſteps, and diſcovered in the paſſage two large openings, which ſeemed to lead to different ſuites of apartments. They firſt entered thoſe of the weſt wing. The furniture in the firſt room had been extremely elegant, though antique; it was in tolerable preſervation, conſidering the number of years it had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> there without care; many noble paintings were yet hanging, but ſo decayed by damps that it was impoſſible to make out the ſubjects. The ſecond room was rather larger than the firſt, but in far worſe condition; the tapeſtry was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtroyed, and both the caſements and ſhutters broke nearly to pieces; the columns which ſupported it ſeemed alſo rotten and decayed.</p>
                     <p>From this apartment they walked through many others that were in the ſame condition, and ſhowed no ſigns of having contained any mortal in them for many years. In
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035833_0135_10093D7A529343A8"/>
the laſt room there was a ſtrong door, which they perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a window, opened into a court or terrace.</p>
                     <p>Having returned to the hall, they entered the apartments of the caſt wing. They were ſmaller though more in number than thoſe they had left; and by the plainneſs of the internal part, they ſuppoſed them to have been offices for ſervants. At the extent of them there was a door of the ſame ſize with that they had obſerved on ſhe other ſide, and which opened alſo to the other end of the terrace.</p>
                     <p>"The ſituation of this place," ſaid Alfred, "ſhows that the inhabitants left it on a ſudden; but yet it is amazing that ſo noble a building, and ſuch elegant furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould have been left to periſh by the ravages of time and neglect."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot ſay I am altogether ſo aſtoniſhed at that," anſwered Matilda: "for after ſuch circumſtances happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, for heaven's ſake who would willingly chooſe it for a habitation?"—Her brother ſmiled; and having again returned to the hall, they aſcended one of the ſtair-caſes, but ſoon perceived that they both terminated in one land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Abbey here was not divided; the chambers were conſequently far more intricate: the apartments were ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and had been nobly furniſhed; the beds were heavy and antique; but all nearly deſtroyed. They however, after ſome trouble, contrived to change one thing with another, till they made up three tolerable beds. Two of them were in a large chamber, and the other cloſely adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They deferred, however, finiſhing their ſearch till the next day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on account of airing what they were to lie on at night. Leonard accordingly made a good fire in the hall, and the clothes were placed before it immediately. After another repaſt, Matilda begged Agnes to relate to them thoſe occurrences that cauſed her to be expoſed to the fury
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035833_0136_10093DC1DE5C4720"/>
of ſo terrible a ſtorm. "Alas! Mademoiſelle," returned Agnes, "I ſhould even before this have related to you my little ſtory, had I not been afraid you would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned my conduct; but at leaſt," continued the poor girl, with tears in her eyes, "you ſhall never have reaſon to reproach me with ingratitude for the favours I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you."</p>
                     <p>Both Alfred and Matilda deſired her, if the relation would bring freſh grief to her memory, to decline it, as in that caſe they would willingly ſuſpend their curioſity.</p>
                     <p>Agnes declared that, though it might raiſe in her mind many ſorrows, yet it would in the end give her pleaſure to make them acquainted wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"They had a ſon and a daughter; the former was the eldeſt, but it was to the latter they looked up for comfort and conſolation in their old age. Leolin had manifeſted from his birth a proud and haughty diſpoſition, which made him rebel againſt all controul, and be aſhamed to own his parents, on account of their inferior condition in life. Both tried in vain, by inculcating honeſt and induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ideas, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"He there entered into the ſervice of a diſſipated noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as valet de chambre. In this ſituation he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to ſcenes of luxury, villainy, and diſhonour; while every trait in his character, which had when a child only appeared at intervals (though enough to alarm his parents) now blazed forth with redoubled vigour, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed thoſe few good qualities he had ſhown in his youth: in ſhort, he was both a gameſter and a ſwindler.

Sabina. About four years after Leolin had left his home, he returned to it, for the firſt time, one night, at an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual hour, but greatly altered, not with the healthful bloom of youth upon his cheek, but feeble, emaciated, and an old man in conſtitution, though only twenty-one years of age.</p>
                     <p>"His father and mother were greatly ſhocked at the ſight of him, but far more ſo when he demanded to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in a cave that was at the bottom of the garden; they however loſt no time in complying with his deſire, as he ſaid he expected to be followed by the officers of juſtice in leſs than two hours, on account of a robbery he had committed: nor was his conjecture wrong; for early in the morning the cottage was ſurrounded by ſeveral men; but their ſearch proved ineffectual; for the cave was ſo cloſely concealed as to prevent any diſcovery. He remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at home ſome little time, but ſhortly returned to thoſe vices which had already taken too faſt hold on his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſuffer him to relinquiſh them, while he had health or ſtrength to follow their purſuits.</p>
                     <p>"The next news they heard of him was about ſix months after, when his father was conducted to Provence, where Leolin lay at the point of death, encompaſſed with miſery, wretchedneſs and want; eaten up with diſeaſe, his ſoul torn with remorſe for paſt crimes, and ſinking into eternity with a conſcience racked by the contending paſſions of horror and diſmay. He, however, ſurvived long enough to receive a parent's bleſſing, who would, even then, have ſacrificed his own life to have ſaved that of a profligate and undutiful ſon.</p>
                     <p>"After ſeeing Leolin decently interred, the good old man returnéd to his cottage overwhelmed with grief, yet with ſome hope of enjoying a few years of tranquillity,

which might make him a recompenſe for paſt misfortun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>. But how vain is the foreſight of mortals! in a very little time he loſt the beloved partner of his heart, who had ſtruggled with him through the early part of life, and been equally a partaker in his adverſity and pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>"His health and ſpirits ſuffered now a greater ſhock than ever, and every week viſibly altered him for the worſe. His daughter Sabina had for ſome months received offers of marriage from Cyril, the ſon of a neighbouring cottager; and the ceremony was ſhortly to have taken place, had not the ſudden death of her mother put it aſide. But after ſome time they were joined together in the holy bands of wedlock; and La Faril ſtill remained with his child, whoſe attendance and affection he now needed more than ever.</p>
                     <p>"I was born about twelve months after their marriage, and was greatly beloved by my parents and grandfather. I had juſt attained my thirteenth year when my father's father died, and though every perſon had ſuppoſed him to be a man poſſeſſed of ſome little property, yet even his ſon was aſtoniſhed to find himſelf heir to a conſiderable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. After the funeral, we were ſurpriſed to find my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intended to leave his native valley and cottage, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the luxuries of Paris. This news was like a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt to my mother, who knew it would break her parent's heart to leave that place, where he had been born, brought up, and continued ſo many years; and ſhe was certain it would equally diſtreſs him to be robbed of her company and attendance. In vain ſhe adviſed her huſband to give up all ideas of abandoning their cottage for diſſipation and vice; but to purchaſe ſome land in that part, which would then be doubly dear to them.</p>

"My father was deaf to all intreaties, and declared his intentions of ſetting off in a ſhort time. Our only hope was now that the ſolicitations of the good La Faril would have more effect on him:—but alas! he was too weak, and too much ſhocked, to make any exertion in the affair; and his prayers failed like thoſe of his daughter. The poor old man was conſequently obliged to be removed to the houſe of a neighbour, while his beloved child was forced from him by a cruel huſband, whoſe ambition was kindled by the poſſeſſion of a little wealth. The cottage and goods being diſpoſed of, with many tears on the part of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and me, we took leave of my grandfather and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vale. At the expiration of a day we found ourſelves in the gay city of Paris: and being ſettled in handſome lodgings, the firſt news we received was, the death of La Faril, who ſurvived but a very ſhort time after his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's departure. It will be needleſs to enlarge on the grief that both my mother and I felt on the occaſion; we even thought we could trace ſome ſigns of remorſe and ſorrow in the breaſt of my father.</p>
                     <p>We were ſhortly introduced to thoſe gaities and vices which are ſuppoſed to conſtitute genteel life. Having been ſettled about ſix months in our apartments, my mothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Theſe pernicious principles were certainly, in one reſpect, the ruin of us; for he heeded not the advice of his wife or real friends, but plunged into every extravagance that ſeemed to gratify his wiſhes.</p>

"He, however, took ſome little care of my education, and I was inſtructed in every branch of uſeful learning.</p>
                     <p>"Matters continued in this ſituation for three years; during which time my father purchaſed a handſome villa, and our houſe was conſtantly crowded with company. His wife moſt earneſtly entreated him to contract his expenſes; but her prayers were uſeleſs, and he ſtill anſwered in the ſame careleſs manner, 'Let to-morrow take care for itſelf.'

My mother had ſometimes hinted to me, the cauſe of this ſtrange behaviour was gambling; and we were thoroughly convinced of it, when a man, one night, brought a note directed to him, and deſired an anſwer to it immediately. Having opened it, we found it contained an appointment to a gaming-houſe that evening.</p>
                     <p>"I need not deſcribe to you the freſh anxiety this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation gave us, nor the rage of my father at the diſcovery of it: but we could now plainly tell when he was a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite of fortune, and when not, by the different turns of his temper. Among the moſt intimate of his friends was a Monſieur Le Selet. This man was a well known gambler, and withal a dangerous character in point of gallantry (as he ſtyled it) among the ladies. He was a conſtant viſitor; and we ſeldom ſat down to table but he was one of the party. Monſieur Le Selet, more than once, offended both my mother and myſelf by his behaviour to us in private, and we complained of it to my father; but he only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But he would then fly into a violent paſſion: nor was it till three months after, that he confeſſed the cauſe of it was the entire loſs of his fortune; and not only that, but he was a debtor to Monſieur to a very conſiderable amount.</p>

'My maſter! my maſter!' was all ſhe could ſay. In vain we aſked her to explain her meaning; ſhe could utter no other words.</p>

We ran to the former: he had juſt recovered from a fainting fit, and languidly looked up. We knelt by him and wept; he ſeemed affected; and thoſe eyes which were half cloſed by death, ſhed tears of ſorrow and repentance when it was too late.</p>
                     <p>"My wife! my child!' he cried in a voice ſcarcely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate, 'I have injured you much: I have taken you from the peaceful habitation of innocence, to be ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vice and villainy, to experience poverty, diſtreſs and oppreſſion.

My father begged the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of a week to diſcharge it; this the former abſolutely refuſed, but told him the whole might on one condition be forgiven. He aſked with eagerneſs by what method he ſhould cancel the obligation; when Le Selet gave him a paper: this paper a ſervant had ſnatched from the floor, and preſented to us: it was a bond by which my father was to reſign his child to the arms of a villain, without any ceremony or articles of marriage. The horror he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at this propoſal was too much for him to ſupport, and he gave way at once to the paſſions of revenge and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair: he ſeized a dagger, and plunged it into the breaſt of the infamous Le Selet; then rang the bell violently, and afterwards, with the ſame hand, ſtruck the bloody ſteel to his own heart.

and accordingly took leave of Paris, and ſoon found ourſelves before that cottage which we had once called our own, and where the remembrance of paſt felicity made our preſent misfortunes more poignant.</p>
                     <p>"We were obliged to the charity of a neighbour for a lodging, till we purchaſed a lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Among the neighbouring villagers was one of the name of Oliver. His character was without reproach, and he aſked my hand in marriage.</p>
                     <p>"Neither his friends nor my mother had any objection to this match, though the latter would frequently ſay, ſhe thought my perſon might command a richer huſband. On the evening before that day which was to have united us, as we were ſitting before our cottage, ſometimes joining in the ruſtic dance, we were ſuddenly ſtopped in our amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the arrival of a gentleman and his ſervant. The former advanced with a corteous air: but judge of my aſtoniſhment and horror, when I perceived it to be Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Le Selet. He ſeemed perfectly recovered, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak with my mother alone.</p>
                     <p>"I trembled at the reſult of their diſcourſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome time: but all my miſeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He ſprang to embrace me, but I ſhrunk from his arms, and fainted away. On my recovery they were each ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by me and entreated me to diſcard my preſent lover; while the artful Le Selet talked in ſo inſinuating a manner, as to bring over my mother entirely to his favour; for ſhe

ſuppoſed it would ſecure a handſome independence for her child. But this converſation had no effect on me, and they each retired with anger, and I with grief and diſtreſs. But I determined that night to leave them all. Whether you will blame my conduct, I know not, mademoiſelle; but I was certain that monſieur was by no means the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant perſon he ſeemed to be; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I was alſo ſure that my mother could get a living in the ſame employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as myſelf; for it had been agreed that ſhe ſhould take my ſchool after I was married. With theſe ideas I packed up a few clothes, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I had not yet, however, reſolved to what part I ſhould go, but determined to apply to a carrier whom I had known for ſome time. He was to ſet out on a long journey early in the morning, and he lived about a mile diſtant. By the time I arrived there, he was juſt going to ſet off. The man's ſurpriſe was exceſſive to ſee me, who he ſuppoſed was to have been made a wife that day. I explained to him the reaſons for my viſit, and threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his protection: he readily granted it, and told me he was going to Italy. This information gave me great pleaſure, as I thought I might there get employment, and conceal my real name and family.</p>
                     <p>"We had not entered this country above two days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baſil (the carrier's name) was taken ill; his diſorder proved violent, and in leſs than a week he was no more. I was neceſſitated to ſell his cart and the whole of his goods to pay the expenſes of his funeral and illneſs. I now found myſelf in a ſtrange place, without money or friends.

I accordingly applied: but how great was my diſappointment to find they were juſt provided with one! I found the whole of my little proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would ſupport me but three days longer, and began ſeriouſly to repent leaving my cottage, when I was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by that violent ſtorm, which proved one of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt incidents of my life, by introducing me to your friendſhip, care, and generoſity; to which I moſt certainly owe my exiſtence."

Not only their own feelings at the time prompted them to this, but gratitude for the aſſiſtance their parents had received from her family. After ſome further converſation, the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035833_0147_10093D8E9BC3F8A0"/>
bed furniture was carried to the rooms above; and, having partook of a ſlight ſupper, they retired to their apartments. The chambers, however, ſeemed extremely cold, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> begged Leonard would make up a little fire of fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots in each of them.</p>
                     <p>This was accordingly done; and Agnes having lighted a wax taper, which ſhe placed on a large marble flab, they took leave of Alfred for the night, who, with his faithful ſervant, entered the room adjoining.</p>
                     <p>"Before we go to reſt," ſaid Matilda, "I will take a more particular ſurvey of this chamber."</p>
                     <p>Agnes trembled; Matilda took the taper and walked round it. The apartment was not ſo large as many, but had equally the ſame gloomy appearance. The bed had formerly been noble and elegant, but was now partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed; the high and heavy cornice of it ſeemed rotted by time; the furniture, they could juſt perceive, had been of crimſon velvet; but the curtains were now, in many parts, entirely threadbare. An old-faſhioned cabinet and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-table, both of which had been ornamented with gilded figures, and ſtood in a gothic receſs, by the dim light ſeemed in form to repreſent a tomb. Matilda in vain ſtrove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o open the former; it was locked, nor could ſhe find any key. The wainſcotting was hung round with large pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but, except one, they were all nearly deſtroyed, ſo as to make it impoſſible to diſcover the ſubjects. That which was in ſome preſervation was the portrait of a man, in an Italian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, at full length. He ſeemed of middle ſize, and elegant figure; but the countenance was melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and dejected, while he reſted with one arm on the fragment of a grave-ſtone. Matilda gazed on it for a conſiderable time; it was extremely like the miniature of her father, which ſhe wore in her boſom. She ſtood in
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:035833_0148_10093DD3CA77F268"/>
ſuch a ſituation that the eyes ſeemed to look full at her. Painful and horrid ideas now aroſe in her mind; ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fancied ſhe ſaw the features move: the thought over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her: ſhe ſhuddered, ſunk in a chair, and burſt into a flood of tears. Agnes had attentively obſerved her, and now joined her tears with thoſe of Matilda; yet, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected ſimplicity, ſtrove to give her comfort and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Her efforts at laſt ſucceeded; and, drying her tears, the former retired to a reſtleſs pillow.</p>
                     <p>It was a conſiderable time before Matilda could cloſe her eyes; the misfortunes that encompaſſed her appeared now more terrible than ever. Agnes was in a ſerene ſleep; all was ſilent and gloomy: her eyes wandered over the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late chamber; and ſhe could ſtill ſee by the ſudden light of the wood fire, which was dying away, but now and then blazed at intervals, the face of the picture, which ſtill ſeemed to look at her. The ember was at laſt entirely extinguiſhed, and the room was left in total darkneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from the flame of the wax taper. At length, tired out with melancholy and terrific recollections, ſhe fell into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Horrid viſions and ghaſtly figures now floated on her brain. Her father approached, covered with blood, and with an angry tone, called on her to revenge his murder She ſtarted, turned, and again compoſed herſelf to reſt but it was impoſſible.

disfigured with wounds, he fled, and Matilda, in the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of horror and affliction, again awoke. In ſhort, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole night her mind was ſo entirely diſordered by uneaſy ſlumbers, that ſhe aroſe in the morning with a conſiderable degree of fever, and by no means refreſhed. It was remarkably fine, and ſhe ventured to open the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy caſement of her chamber. There was no danger of being obſerved; the high trees that ſurrounded the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made it impoſſible ſhe could be perceived but by thoſe in the inner part. The air refreſhed her, but the languor of her ſpirits ſtill continued.</p>
                     <p>The breakfaſt, which Agnes had prepared with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt neatneſs, was ſerved in the firſt apartment next the hall. Leonard had got up very early, and cleaned it out; and the room now wore a far more comfortable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than it had done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

She declared ſhe had not been in the leaſt alarmed; and each anſwering in the ſame manner, their fears of ſupernatural intruſion partly vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>They now conſulted the beſt method to procure provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which muſt be done that day, with ſeveral other articles: at laſt it was agreed that Leonard ſhould take a baſket, and go out of the abbey ſo as to be ſeen by no one in the way to it: and that he ſhould mix with other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the public market, where he could purchaſe what he wanted, and perhaps gain ſome intelligence concerning their reſidence, and other circumſtances relative to the count<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Alfred deſired him by no means to force the converſation, as it might raiſe curioſity in the peaſantry to know who and what he was. This matter being ſettled,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:035833_0150_10093DD7712BF3A0"/>
Leonard was ſhortly equipped, and ſallied forth with the utmoſt caution.</p>
                     <p>Alfred now propoſed to his ſiſter to examine thoſe apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they had not had time to look at the night before. Agnes ſaid ſhe now had courage enough to ſtay in the great hall, which ſhe had much rather do, and employ herſelf in preparing the dinner.</p>
                     <p>Alfred and Matilda accordingly aſcended the ſtair-caſe, and walked through the ſuite of rooms they had before ſeen. They then croſſed ſeveral others, larger and far more heavy. Theſe terminated in a paſſage ſupported by ſmall columns, and arched over in the Gothic ſtyle. This place was extremely dark; they, however, with ſome difficulty, paſſed it, and entered, by a pair of folding doors, a more ſpacious apartment then they had yet ſeen, and, if poſſible, more gloomy. It had been entirely hung with black, and, from every appearance, had contained a corpſe that had lain there in ſtate at ſome former period. Several pieces of tapers were ſtill ſtanding in black glaſſes; and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſtood bearers for the purpoſe of ſupporting a coffin; but there was now only the remains of a large plume of black feathers.</p>
                     <p>Matilda thought of her dream, and trembled. Alfred himſelf ſeemed at firſt ſtruck with awe, but preſently reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himſelf, laughed at his ſiſter, and ſtrove to keep up his own ſpirits by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>allying Matilda on her fears. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to return; the gloomy horror of this chamber overcame her, and ſhe found herſelf extremely faint. He placed her on a kind of couch, that had alſo been covered with black velvet, and made ſeveral efforts to open the windows: this was, however, to no purpoſe; but after ſome trouble h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> pulled down a part of the broken ſhutters,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035833_0151_10093D920CADC9E0"/>
and conſequently received more light, which had before only entered from an opening at the top.</p>
                     <p>Matilda in a few minutes recovered, but declared ſhe would proceed no further. Alfred perſuaded her to aſcend the ſtairs that wound round the weſt tower; but ſhe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively refuſed.</p>
                     <p>He wiſhed much to ſee the apartment which, by his aunt's manuſcript he was informed, terminated, as was ſuppoſed, the ſearch of his father. But his ſiſter abſolutely refuſing to go any further, they returned to the hall. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes noticed the dejected looks of Matilda, but did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the cauſe. Alfred reſolved within himſelf to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the weſt tower the following day, and ſatisfy his curioſity concerning the myſtery of that extraordinary chamber.</p>
                     <p>Agnes was in far better ſpirits than ſhe had been in ſince their meeting, and tried every way to comfort and entertain her dejected friends. Both felt the kindneſs of her intention, and acquainted her with moſt of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances relative to their misfortunes: there were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſome events they thought proper to conceal.</p>
                     <p>Lady Caroline Albourne was, however, ſtill one of the chief objects of Alfred's thoughts. He loved her, yet was conſcious he had not even merited her eſteem. By her manner, juſt before he left England, he flattered himſelf he could perceive innocent traits of a confeſſion of more than a common regard for him. But even though his conjectures ſhould prove right, her prudence, her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, muſt have told her to tear from her heart a man who, by the conduct he then purſued, muſt bring her to wretchedneſs, want and miſery. But there was yet even a greater misfortune to ſtrike him with remorſe. His name, his character, were tarniſhed with diſhonour. That name
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035833_0152_10093DDBF449AA78"/>
which, he had been proud to ſay, had not ſhamed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily it belonged to, and that nicety of honour which is had been his utmoſt pride to preſerve, were now, through folly and extravagance, ruined by the ſlanderous tongue o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> calumny, both in England and his own country. In the former it was moſt likely he would receive the appellation of an aſſaſſin and a ſwind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er; in the latter he would be branded as a baſe, mean, cowardly deſerter from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his country; a diſgrace to France and the noble profeſſion he had been brought up to—the defence of his country's rights.</p>
                     <p>"Damned ideas!" he would exclaim, in a voice of frantic rage. His ſiſter and Agnes were alarmed. He beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their pardon:—it was the recollection of former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs that croſſed his brain at that moment. Matilda plainly peeceived his impetuoſity of temper broke out at every interval when the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Her griefs were conſequently buried in her own boſom; yet they were not leſs poignant than thoſe of her brother. She loved Mr. Milverne; but every hope of ſeeing him again appeared almoſt impoſſible. His letter, which they received at Dover, mentioned that he would join them as ſoon as poſſible in Italy; but they had little thought of an occurrence happening that obliged them to keep more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in this place, than their ſituation might have requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to have done, had they remained in England. Nor was it likely Mr. Milverne ſhould even have an idea that they were inhabitants of Graſville Abbey. The more ſhe thought on thoſe ſufferings ſhe had experienced ſince

This was pleaſing intelligence, and they ſat down to dinner with ſome degree of cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But yet there was ſomething in Leonard's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which ſhowed he had been greatly chagrined, and that he had heard more than he choſe to communicate. At the latter part of the day he requeſted to ſpeak with his maſter alone.</p>
                     <p>Alfred immediately granted his requeſt, and they aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their chamber.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was a ſilent ſpectator of this myſterious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Agnes was extremely alarmed; ſhe was certain, ſhe ſaid, from Leonard's behaviour, that he muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome very dreadful intelligence; and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability he thought it of too terrible a nature for them to be informed of.</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſmiled, and ſtrove to diſpel her fears, but was herſelf very much hurt. Agnes's conjecture was by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

When they returned to the parlour Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard's countenance was ſtill more gloomy, while Alfred ſtrove to aſſume a gaiety foreign to his heart. Their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was a ſilent meal; each ſeemed abſorbed in melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflections; and, after ſome little time, they retired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
                     <p>ANOTHER ſleepleſs night was paſſed by Matilda; and Agnes requeſted ſhe would take her breakfaſt before ſhe aroſe for the day. She therefore acquainted Alfred with his ſiſter's indiſpoſition. He was extremely concerned, and far more ſo to obſerve her dejected manner and pale countenance, when ſhe joined them at dinner. Leonard ſeemed rather more cheerful than he had been the night before; but his maſter ſtill retained a gloomy ſadneſs, that ſhowed ſome cauſe of diſtreſs lay heavy at his heart. Both ſurveyed Matilda with a ſcrutiniſing eye, and Alfred after ſome little time aſked, with a pretended air of indifference, if ſhe had reſted as free from diſturbance as the night before.</p>
                     <p>It would not have been difficult for a common perſon to have perceived he pauſed with unuſual anxiety for an anſwer, though he ſtrove as much as poſſible to conceal that emotion which was viſible to all. She told him ſhe had. This reply ſeemed to give him conſiderable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and on her returning the queſtion, he alſo anſwered in the affirmative. The alteration in his manner continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a few moments, and he again relapſed into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer melacholy. He new mentioned his intention of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the rooms in the weſt tower, and aſked Leonard to accompany him in his reſearches. Matilda ſaid, languidly, that ſhe alſo meant to be of the party; at which declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her brother looked very much chagrined.</p>
                     <p>"I rather think, Matilda," ſaid he, "you had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>She thought it might amuſe her, and was certain the walk would be of ſervice. Agnes attended; and they opened the large heavy door that ſhowed the winding ſtone ſtair-caſe of the weſt tower. They found it very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to aſcend; the place having been ſo long forſaken, that large webs of duſt and dirt almoſt impeded their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.

this blood was their father's! the idea ſtruck each of them. Agnes was greatly ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cked and terrified; Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard converſed with conſiderable emotion in private with his maſter for ſome minutes, while Matilda, unable to bear her own feelings, burſt into a flood of tears. After an hyſteric fit of weeping, ſhe found herſelf much better; and, having cloſed the apartments, they deſcended to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arlour.</p>
                     <p>Some hours were again ſpent by Alfred and Leonard in a private conference above. Both ſtill retained a ſettled me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy on their features; while Agnes was more aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Matilda more alarmed, than ever. The reaſon of her brother's ſecreſy ſhe could by no means diſcover; hitherto ſhe had been made acquainted with every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance concerning their ſituation; but Alfred was now ſilent even on general topics, and only put confidence in his ſervant. Her pride forbade her to aſk queſtions, yet her curioſity prompted her to the humiliation, as being the only means of gratifying it. Evening approached: their ſupper was again a ſilent meal, and they retired without any converſation having paſſed.</p>
                     <p>Agnes was ſoon in a profound ſleep; but Matilda's thoughts on her brother's behaviour robbed her of repoſe. It was now the laſt hour of night, and ſhe ſtrove again to compoſe herſelf to reſt, when ſhe thought ſhe heard her brother's voice; yet ſhe conſidered ſhe muſt be deceived, as both Leonard and he had been in their apartments near two hours. The wind was extremely high; Matilda how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtill liſtened, and found ſhe was not miſtaken. A liſtener ſhe deteſted; but ſhe thought her preſent ſituation took every ſtigma from the character. She was, however, ſtill irreſolute in what manner to act, when a loud word
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035833_0157_10093D9BD254CB78"/>
from her brother made her determined to hear more. Having accordingly thrown over her a night-gown, ſhe crept to the door. All was ſilent again for ſome time: but after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of many minutes, ſhe heard her brother check Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard for talking ſo loud; "Matilda," ſaid he, "may not yet be aſleep." They then continued ſo low that ſhe could not even underſtand one word. After another inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, Leonard anſwered to a queſtion which Alfred aſked him, that "It was not the time."</p>
                     <p>"If I die in the attempt," ſaid Alfred "I will unravel this myſtery: and if once—"</p>
                     <p>Here a violent guſt of wind rattled through the chambers, and ſhe was unable to diſtinguiſh their diſcourſe, though they ſtill continued talking. At length, however, ſhe heard Leonard ſay, "I will be very careful, ſir: you may depend upon my fidelity."</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake," continued Alfred, "follow it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he utmoſt: but at all events do not diſcover—"</p>
                     <p>Here again the wind drowned their voices; and ſhortly after, ſhe heard them retire for the night.</p>
                     <p>Matilda, chilled with horror and uncertainty, returned to her bed, and fell into a diſturbed ſlumber. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe appeared at breakfaſt, though her looks plainly told the ſtate of her mind.</p>
                     <p>"Leonard," ſaid her brother, "is this morning going again to the public market." Matilda was aſtoniſhed; ſhe knew they were in want of no proviſion. Alfred wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to procure ſome wine, an article he was certain they were all in need of.</p>
                     <p>"But ſurely," anſwered his ſiſter, "Leonard purchaſed enough when he was laſt there."</p>
                     <p>"True," ſaid he "but we have had an accident, and broke nearly all the bottles which were full."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="unknown:035833_0158_10093DE30DFC1018"/>
Although ſuch an accident was not impoſſible, yet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda greatly doubted the truth of this aſſertion; and in her brother's manner ſhe thought ſhe could perceive an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, which ſhowed it was merely an excuſe to keep from her the real cauſe of Leonard's errand. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſet off in a little time, equipped the ſame as when he before left the Abbey, and uſing the like caution at leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                     <p>After his departure they walked on the terrace which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the eaſt to the weſt end of the building. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was ſome diſtance from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Matilda conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this would be a good opportunity to mention to her brother the great alteration ſhe had noticed in him, ſince his long and ſecret conference with Leonard. Alfred at firſt ſeemed only to laugh at her fears, and wiſhed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her ſhe was miſtaken; but ſhe urged the matter ſo cloſe that he at laſt confeſſed Leonard's information that night had given him conſiderable uneaſineſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs.</p>
                     <p>"Then," ſaid Matilda with quickneſs, "let me ſhare in that diſtreſs; which will be far better than to remain in this horrid ſuſpenſe."</p>
                     <p>"That is impoſſible," returned Alfred; "you cannot, muſt not, be acquainted with the affair."</p>
                     <p>His vehemence alarmed her.</p>
                     <p>"Is then the circumſtance of ſo ſecret a nature, that I, who have hitherto been made a partner in the knowledge of all thoſe misfortunes that have befallen us, muſt not now know that which your ſervant is privy to, and which may concern me equally with yourſelf?"</p>
                     <p>"Be not offended, Matilda, if I tell you again it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that in this caſe I ſhould gratify your wiſh: but be aſſured every method I take will be for your good and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035833_0159_10093DA0798D75A0"/>
nor muſt you be ſurpriſed at any remarkable behaviour in me at different intervals, or terrify yourſelf at any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common occurences in this Abbey, as our reſidence here is now more neceſſary than ever."</p>
                     <p>"Have you then ſeen any thing more than common?" ſaid his ſiſter, with great emotion.</p>
                     <p>"With reſpect to this, too, you muſt excuſe me," anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Alfred. "At all events, however, we have one conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that thoſe who truſt in the Supreme Being need never fear the interruption of deceaſed perſons."</p>
                     <p>Agnes at this moment overtook them, and he hurried from his ſiſter with conſiderable precipitation into the hall.</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſtood motionleſs for ſome minutes.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſure madam," ſaid Agnes, "ſignor Maſerini has been ſaying ſomething very dreadful; for I watched you all the time, and, though at a diſtance, could perceive your countenance change ſeveral times." Matilda wiſhed to keep the laſt equivocal words of her brother from Agnes, as ſhe knew ſhe was, if poſſible, more timid than herſelf; but her looks contradicted her ſpeech, and little uſed to ſay untruths, even the queſtions of the innocent Agnes puzzled and perplexed her. They returned to Alfred in the hall. He was more melancholy than ever, and Matilda was ſorry ſhe had ſpoken to him on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>After ſome time Leonard returned, and produced plenty of wine, with part of a French newſpaper, which he told them he had by chance laid hold of. One of the paragraphs mentioned the death of count D'Ollifont, and that, by the account of the phyſicians, he was murdered by a wound given him at a maſquerade by his relation, the chevalier Maſerini, who had fled to France; but that ſtrict

                        </gap>earch was now making after him, both in that country and Italy.</p>
                     <p>"At all events, then," ſaid Alfred, "we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here till either juſtice brings my cauſe to a proper criſis, or till I am cruſhed by arbitrary power and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs villainy."</p>
                     <p>He ſeemed much affected, yet bore the news with unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual fortitude. Leonard requeſted to ſpeak to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and they retired to their apartment. Agnes again wondered at theſe private conferences, and Matilda was yet ſilent,</p>
                     <p>In about an hour and a half they returned to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Leonard ſtill continued gloomy: but there was a conſiderable alteration in his maſter—he was now as full of ſpirits as he had been before melancholy; but yet they ſeemed forced, and it appeared more like a madman's mirth, than the regular ſenſations of joy. He laughed, talked immoderately, but yet often ſighed.</p>
                     <p>Matilda obſerved him with anxiety and terror; while Agnes and Leonard were ſilent ſpectators of his ſtrange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. Supper-time at length arrived; when the little group formed an expreſſive ſcene. Alfred at one end of the table, firſt in an exceſſive fit of merriment, then looking round him with horror, hardly able to ſuppreſs the riſing tear. His ſiſter was ſeated next him; her colour entirely faded through diſtreſs, while her fine eyes were fixed on him with a look of miſery that well ſhowed the inward workings of her ſoul. Agnes wept, and looked up to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda for conſolation, who was now unable to give it.</p>
                     <p>The good old Leonard was ſeated at a little diſtance from them, ſurveying each with attention, and often wiping from his aged eye the watery drop of ſympathetic tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. "Give us more light," ſaid Alfred; "we will
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:035833_0161_10093DA399DB4B10"/>
make a jovial night of it; and ſet on another bottle of the laſt wine."</p>
                     <p>Leonard obeyed; two more candles were lighted, and the bottle placed before him.</p>
                     <p>"You do not conſider," ſaid Matilda, "that it grows late, and we have already had the uſual quantity."</p>
                     <p>"I care not," he anſwered: "the Tuſcan grape revives me."</p>
                     <p>His ſiſter perceived it had already taken great effect on his ſpirits. The night now began to grow extremely ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the thunder rolled over the building with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable noiſe. The room being very large, the further part from where they ſat was entirely dark; but even this ſpace was at intervals illumined by the flaſhes of lightning which darted through the windows in that part, the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being entirely decayed. Matilda and Agnes once more begged him to retire to reſt; but he was obſtinate, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would not, and ordered another bottle, having drank the chief part of the former one. In ſhort, he took bumper after bumper for ſome time, while every moment he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more frantic, and the avidity with which he drank confirmed him to be diſtracted. His behaviour alſo ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be intoxicated; and the walls of Graſville Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, which had ſo long remained in ſilence, now rung again with his exclamations and noiſe. Yet his voice was often drowned by the repeated claps of thunder, while the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning became more and more dreadful. Matilda, Agnes, and Leonard, were all ſilent ſpectators of this ſcene. It was now midnight, and they gave up all idea of perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to retire to reſt</p>
                     <p>"Fill your glaſſes!" he cried "I am going to give you a noble health." He roſe from his ſeat, and ſighed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035833_0162_10093DEA6D85AFC0"/>
then holding up the ſparkling goblet, he exclaimed, "Lady Caroline Albourne!"</p>
                     <p>A moſt tremendous clap of thunder!</p>
                     <p>Each looked with horror: Alfred ſtood in the ſame poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as when he uttered the health; nor had he been able even to put his lips to the glaſs; but, after the noiſe entirely died away, ſeemed to be liſtening with a degree of terror, as if he then heard it. In a few minutes he recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"This is a dreadful night," ſaid he to his ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>"It is indeed," anſwered Matilda. For "heaven's ſake, Alfred, let us retire to reſt: I aſſure you I can hardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Another health!" he cried, relapſing into his former manner; "another I muſt drink. Leonard, repleniſh the goblet."</p>
                     <p>"You forget, ſir, that it is now full."</p>
                     <p>"True, true," he cried, "I had forgot. Here then," ſaid he, laughing, "is to the old ghoſt that inhabits this Abbey."</p>
                     <p>A violent craſh!</p>
                     <p>All ſtarted from their ſeats. Agnes ſhrieked; Matilda looked wild; Leonard ran to their aſſiſtance; while Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred was ſtill unable to put the goblet to him mouth, but ſtood half ſtupefied with wine, horror and aſtoniſhment. The noiſe ſeemed to come from an apartment which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a pair of folding doors into the dark part of the room where they were now ſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Before any one could ſpeak, a violent clap of thunder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"This is a terrible night," continued Leonard; "but I will protect you to the laſt drop of my blood."</p>
                     <p>"And ſo will I," cried Alfred, ſtaggering from his ſeat; "I will protect you too."</p>
                     <p>"Talk not of protecting us, Alfred," anſwered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda: for if the ſpirit of our father at this time walks in theſe apartments, it is but to reproach you for your preſent diſgraceful ſituation.—Come, Agnes, we will go to bed."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no indeed, mademoiſelle! I dare not," ſaid Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: "I cannot move."</p>
                     <p>Matilda's reproach ſeemed to have ſome effect on her brother. "My father!" he exclaimed.</p>
                     <p>A deep groan.</p>
                     <p>"Hark! hark! he anſwers me: it is from that room: I'll ſee him, if I die."</p>
                     <p>"Not for worlds," ſaid Leonard, holding him. "There may be treachery in this buſineſs, ſir; pray ſtay where you are."</p>
                     <p>Another groan!</p>
                     <p>"Hark again!" he exclaimed, "I will go; by heavens, I will be ſatisfied." At that moment he diſengaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Leonard, who, catching up a ſword, followed him. They both ruſhed to the dark part of the room. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred was firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he puſhed open the folding doors. An a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing flaſh of lightning illumined the apartment they entered Alfred, in a tone of horror, exclaimed, "There!"</p>
                     <p>The object caught Leonard's eye. "In the name of the Holy Virgin," ſaid the old man, "who art thou?"</p>
                     <p>"'Tis gone, 'tis vaniſhed," anſwered Alfred. He was right; there was nothing now to be ſeen. They returned

to the parlour; Matilda and Agnes, who had been entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten by them, were lying on the couch, nearly ſenſeleſs; but the former had heard the words that paſſed, diſtinctly. Alfred had in a great degree regained his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Matilda and Agnes after ſome little time recovered, and, with aſſiſtance, arrived at their chamber: here they parted for the night; and thus ended an adventure which ſeemed in a great meaſure to confirm all the terrific reports concerning Graſville Abbey.</p>

                     <p>WHILE in the midſt of buſineſs or employment, we often ſuppoſe, on account of many diſagreeable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are apt to impede our paſſage through life, that we could with pleaſure relinquiſh all commerce with mankind, and live after the manner of a miſanthrope, totally ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our fellow creatures. However theſe ideas may intrude at certain intervals, yet it is improbable they ſhould continue: when once brought to the trial, we ſhould, like the inhabitants of Graſville Abbey, languiſh after ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, though our ſituation might totally preclude ſuch a wiſh from being gratified.</p>
                     <p>

The agitation of Matilda's ſpirits, and her loſs of reſt the few preceding nights, combined to throw her into a profound ſlumber; and though ſhe was ſtill haraſſed with uncomfortable and terrific dreams, yet ſhe enjoyed ſome repoſe; but the little benefit ſhe received from it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtroyed when ſhe awoke in the morning, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the late ſtrange and uncommon circumſtances. Her brother's behaviour was as incomprehenſible as the violent craſh and diſmal groans which had been heard in the apartment adjoining the parlour. There was alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther myſtery to be explained, that is, what the appearance was which had drawn from Alfred and his ſervant thoſe exclamations of horror that ſhe had heard. This was a point of curioſity, with reſpect to which ſhe in particular wiſhed to be ſatisfied; but at all events ſhe reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt no further communication from her brother. Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, therefore, was the only perſon ſhe could queſtion on the ſubject; and to him ſhe determined to apply at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per opportunity.</p>
                     <p>At a very late hour they aſſembled to breakfaſt. Alfred, ſeemed buried in melancholy reflections, but made an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for his late frantic behaviour.</p>
                     <p>Matilda looked extremely ill: Agnes ſeemed by no means recovered from her terror; while Leonard's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was ſtill ſorrowful and gloomy. Matilda under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, at the latter part of the morning, that Leonard was again going to the public market; but it cauſed no ſurpriſe, as they were in want of proviſion. He accordingly, in a little time, ſet off for the purpoſe of procuring ſome.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, after his departure, retired to his chamber, and took pen, ink, and paper with him. Agnes cooked the dinner, and Matilda took up a book. The former now began to converſe on the events of the night before. "It
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035833_0167_10093DAC822A8CD8"/>
does not ſignify, mademoiſelle," continued Agnes, in a harangue of ſome length; "but there is ſomething very unaccountable in this abbey. I am ſure I ſhall now be afraid even to remain in this parlour by myſelf. The holy Virgin protect us! but I ſhould not wonder if we were all to be carried away one of theſe days by the hobgoblins that haunt the place."</p>
                     <p>"Rather one of theſe nights," anſwered Matilda, willing to put off the diſcourſe with a jeſt.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, mademoiſelle, but father Dunſtan uſed to ſay ſuch things have been ſeen, even when the ſun ſhined."</p>
                     <p>Matilda could not help laughing; but Agnes looked more ſerious, and declared father Dunſtan was a man who had often converſed with them, and knew their tricks as well as they did themſelves.</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake, Agnes," replied Matilda, "do not encourage theſe ſilly ideas, or you will make your life a ſcene of uncomfortable apprehenſion and terror."</p>
                     <p>"It is a misfortune, mademoiſelle; and you muſt pity inſtead of blaming me. Yet," continued Agnes, with an arch look, "I rather think you only talk in this indifferent manner to me, with the kind intent of diſpelling my fears: I thank you; but you muſt give me leave to ſay, I think your thoughts are far different from your words."</p>
                     <p>This remark was juſt; and Matilda's heſitating manner and bluſh confirmed Agnes that ſhe was right. After ſome time, Alfred returned from his chamber. He ſpoke but little, and ſeemed to wait with a degree of impatience for Leonard's return. He, however, ſtopped longer than uſual; and they had nearly finiſhed their dinner when he entered. He brought with him a good ſtock of proviſions; but the information he had received was by no means agreeable. The people, he ſaid, talked much of the death of count
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035833_0168_10093DEEDAB77A40"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'Ollifont, and the large reward that was offered for the chevalier Maſerini, his relation; "and though the general voice is much in favour of you, ſir," continued Leonard, "yet we muſt not truſt to that, and forget the temptation the money will excite;" an obſervation which they all agreed was very juſt. In a ſhort time he requeſted a private conference with his maſter: and they returned to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in about an hour.</p>
                     <p>Alfred was then more compoſed than he had been for ſome time, and Leonard rather more chearful. After ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the latter informed them that he had heard, among other things concerning the abbey, that an old hermit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in a cave near it, which had been his habitation for a number of years.</p>
                     <p>"I wonder," ſaid Alfred, "if it would be poſſible to pay him a viſit without being obſerved by any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon."</p>
                     <p>"Nothing more eaſy, ſir," anſwered Leonard. "His cave is at the bottom of the long walk of cypreſſes, on the weſt ſide to this building. The ſituation is ſo retired, and withal ſo near the abbey, that it is never intruded on by any of the vilagers."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould wiſh much to ſee him," ſaid Alfred: "he may give me information of conſiderable importance."</p>
                     <p>"It is not at all unlikely, ſir; for people ſay he knows more about the ſtory of Graſville Abbey than any one in this part; though he is always ſilent on the ſubject."</p>
                     <p>"To-morrow, then, I will viſit him," anſwered Alfred; "firſt as an indifferent perſon: but, if I find him a man of piety, and inclined to prove my friend, I will make him acquainted with the whole ſtate of my affairs."</p>
                     <p>"But I hope you will firſt," ſaid Matilda, "be perfectly ſatisfied he deſerves your confidence."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="unknown:035833_0169_10093DAFDE961400"/>
"That you may depend on; but I can ſee no objection to you and Agnes being of the party; and you will then, Matilda, be able to judge of my conduct."</p>
                     <p>Matilda was pleaſed with the propoſal, and ſaid ſhe was certain the air would he of ſervice to her. In ſhort, this ſcheme ſeemed to meet with the approbation of all; and the evening was ſpent with more ſociality than they had enjoyed ſince the ſecond night of their reſidence in the abbey.</p>
                     <p>At an early hour they retired to reſt; and as Agnes and and Matilda left the parlour, each gave a ſide look at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>olding doors on the further end, and trembled as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to their chamber.</p>
                     <p>Matilda reſted better than ſhe had for ſome weeks, and roſe with more than common ſpirits. She contrived to get down ſtairs before her brother, purpoſely to obtain an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſpeaking to Leonard alone. According to her wiſhes, he was in the parlour ſetting the breakfaſt-table, while Agnes was preparing it in the hall. She immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately opened the ſubject, and begged him to diſcloſe to her thoſe circumſtances which had occaſioned ſuch myſterious behaviour.</p>
                     <p>Leonard looked chagrined. "Alas! mademoiſelle," he anſwered, "it is impoſſible excuſe me; but I cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you."</p>
                     <p>Matilda was diſpleaſed.</p>
                     <p>"It cuts me to the heart," continued he, "it does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, mademoiſelle, to refuſe your requeſt: but I am bound by a ſacred tie."</p>
                     <p>"I would not have you break it, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" replied Main da: "yet, though you are much older than I, Leonard, I muſt caution you not to be too precipitate in entering into every ſcheme my brother propoſes to you.

                     <p>"Heaven forbid they ſhould be deranged," anſwered this faithful ſervant: "for then I am ſure—" here he ſtopped ſhort, and was ſilent.</p>

                     <p>Matilda repeated the queſtion. He was going to anſwer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Agnes brought in the breakfaſt, and the diſcourſe became general. It was reſolved they ſhould walk to the hermit in the fore part of the morning, that they ſhould tell him they reſided near, and that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity brought them to his retreat.</p>
                     <p>Being all equipped for the journey, they ſet off, walked round the weſt ſide of the abbey, and from thence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a quantity of thick foliage, to the grove of cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, which, as they ſuppoſed, led to the cave. After ſome time they came to a ſpot entire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They ſtood ſome moments conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they ſhould enter: but curioſity overcame their ſcruples, and they ſtepped ſoftly forward. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone a few yards, they found the paſſage wound to the left, and could ſee at ſome diſtance a lamp which gave but a dim light, and ſeemed to hang down from the roof. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Matilda again ſtopped; but Alfred laughed at their fears, and they continued to walk in ſilence. As they came nearer, the paſſage widened, and they could juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a table covered with cloth, on which lay a human ſcull and bones, with a large book and hour-glaſs. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda trembled, and Agnes involuntarily turned round Alfred, however, by a motion, begged them to be ſilent. They liſtened, and heard the voice of a perſon praying.</p>
                     <p>Their fears were now in ſome meaſure diſpelled; and they walked a little further, when a reverend form caught their eye, in a long gown, which was faſtened round him by a belt: he knelt, with his back to them, before a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix. Struck with a ſacred awe, they ſtood in ſilent admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and liſtened to the hermit's prayer.</p>
                     <p>"Father of mercy," he exclaimed, "hear the petition of thy ſervant! cleanſe him of thoſe ſins and wickedneſſes he has been guilty of in the ſight of thee, and pour into his breaſt that balm of comfort and conſolation thou only c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

before him, and at that moment, lifting up his head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the intruders on his privacy. He gazed at Alfred, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a faint groan, and fell ſenſeleſs on the ground. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at the emotion they had cauſed, each ran to his aſſiſtance, and ſtrove to recover him from ſo alarming an inſenſibility. Their efforts, however, for ſome time proved ineffectual; but he at laſt ſhowed ſome ſigns of returning life.</p>
                     <p>"Forgive us, father," ſaid Alfred: "we come not with an intent to alarm you: the fame of your pious character raiſed in us a deſire to ſee ſo venerable a perſon. But be aſſured, if we had known the effects our entering in ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a manner would have occaſioned, our wiſhes ſhould have remained ungratified."</p>
                     <p>The hermit ſtill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ept his eyes fixed with a wild look, and was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, father," ſaid Matilda, "we regret that you have ſuffered ſo much on our account."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! and are you there?" ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>laimed he: "I think I know you both."</p>
                     <p>Each turned aſide: a thought ſtruck them that the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit might have ſome knowledge of them; and they were in their turn greatly alarmed. Their fears, however, ſoon vaniſhed, when in a more compoſed manner he aſked who they were.</p>
                     <p>"We live not for diſtant," returned Alfred, "and, as I before told you, were tempted, by the reports of your piety and goodneſs, to pay you a viſit."</p>
                     <p>"You are very young," anſwered the hermit, "to covet ſhe company of ſo old a man. I have been extremely ill, and, at preſent, am but ſaint: pray all be ſeated. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, if I do not obſerve the laws of hoſpitality, as I
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035833_0173_10093DB3F7B1C060"/>
am ſo little uſed to company, and am not quite recovered from my indiſpoſition."</p>
                     <p>They refuſed his offer, with thanks for his kindneſs, and promiſed to return at the ſame hour the next day. "You will not, I ſuppoſe, father," ſaid Alfred, "have any other viſitors."</p>
                     <p>"None, my ſon," replied the hermit: "alas! I ſeldom ſee a ſoul in this retired ſpot. The dread of paſſing yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abbey totally precludes me from ſtrangers. I am, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever glad that there are ſome, whom report has not ſo far intimidated with idle fears."</p>
                     <p>"Adieu, father!" ſaid they, as they came forth to the entrance.</p>
                     <p>"Adieu, my children!" anſwered he: "the Holy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy guide you!"</p>
                     <p>Here they parted. Father Peter (for ſuch was the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit's name) returned to his cell, and his viſitors hurried to the abbey as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Their converſation at dinner was chiefly on their new acquaintance. None could account for the effect which their preſence had on him, or the particular emotion he ſhowed when by chance he turned his eyes towards Alfred, There was ſomething myſterious in theſe circumſtances, which made them rather dubious of performing their promiſe the next morning. They, however, at laſt reſolved to riſque, it, and truſt the external appearance of this man, in which were combined benevolence, humanity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Matilda, alſo, particularly noticed in his prayer the mention of the ſins and wickedneſſes he had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. This again raiſed their ſuſpicions; but Alfred ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that to humble ourſelves before the Supreme Deity, is a duty incumbent on every chriſtian; "and," continued he, "ſuch was, no doubt, the idea of Father Peter."</p>
                     <p>

Here the diſcourſe dropped, and Alfred and Leonard, after dinner, had another private conference.</p>
                     <p>Matilda declared ſhe found herſelf much better for the walk. This evening was again ſpent with ſome degree of comfort, and they retired to their chambers rather at a late hour. Agnes was ſoon undreſſed; but Matilda ſeated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſeat of one of the Gothic windows, and viewed, with a mixture of pleaſure and awe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he gloomy proſpect before her. The clouds were low and heavy: yet it was moonlight; and the dark ſhadows of the ſurrounding trees, which terminated the proſpect, ſpread over that ſpace which remained uncovered in the court.</p>
                     <p>In an angle ſhe could juſt obſerve the mouldering, decayed ſide of the weſt tower, and the two where caſements were to be perceived. The wind was high and tempeſtuous, and ſeemed to threaten an approaching ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>Matilda's ſpirits were uncommonly low; ſhe wept abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. "Alas!" thought ſhe, "could I have known the ſorrows, the ſufferings, I was to have experienced, gladly would I have welcomed death, and ſunk into an early grave, without even a wiſh to ſurvive. But I was then happy, cheriſhed by a tender mother, ſurrounded with friends, beloved by all, and knew not the duplicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or the misfortunes human nature is ſubject to. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father," exclaimed ſhe with fervency, "forgive my murmuring at thy will: ſtrengthen me to ſupport thoſe ſcenes of adverſity I am deſtined to go through; and give me fortitude enough to bear that fate it is ordained I ſhould experience."</p>
                     <p>She found herſelf more compoſed, yet did not ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſleep, but continued watching the different chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ſky. Her eyes wandered over the wild ſcene of

foliage, which was in a continual motion by the impulſe of the wind. She thought it lightened twice, and was turning from the window, when her eye caught the caſement in the weſt tower, and a ſtrong glare of light at that moment darted from within it. Matilda could not move: ſhe was motionleſs with ſurpriſe and horror, but ſtill kept looking at the object, which continued illumined. In about three minutes a hand ſeemed to wave from one ſide. At that moment the light vaniſhed, and all was again in perfect darkneſs. Matilda, ſcarcely able to ſupport herſelf, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to the bed, ſunk on it, cloſed her eyes through fear, and, after a conſiderable time, fell into a ſlumber.</p>

                     <p>AGNES was aſtoniſhed, when ſhe awoke in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to perceive Matilda was not undreſſed, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inquired the cauſe: the latter, who had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on an anſwer, told her, that, having ſat up lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than uſual to finiſh a book, ſhe ſell aſleep for the night. Agnes doubted not her veracity, and cheerfully went to prepare breakfaſt.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was perplexed to know in what manner to act concerning the light in the weſt tower. The ſtrange circumſtances which ſeemed to encompaſs this abbey with a miſt of doubtful horror, every day became more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable and diſagreable. It was true, the good ſenſe and inſtructions of her mother had brought her up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe ſuperſtition, and laugh at the folly of thoſe who liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to uncommon reports. But the occurrences ſhe had lately been witneſs to, gave her ſtrong reaſons to believe in ſupernatural exiſtence. The craſh and groans in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe had herſelf heard diſtinctly, and was certain both her brother and Leonard muſt have ſeen ſomething more than common, to have uttered ſuch exclamations of ſurpriſe and horror. Her aunt's manuſcript gave a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of a light being ſeen in the weſt tower, not only by her father and his ſervant, but by more than one of the villagers. An interval from that time had now paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:035833_0178_10093E4DC217EB50"/>
of near one and twenty years; yet ſhe had again ſeen a light in the ſame building, which had moſt probably never been inhabited even when the late count Maſerini reſided in the abbey. Such ſtrange and myſterious events ſtaggered all the fortitude ſhe had derived from the leſſons of her parent, and both alarmed and terrified her. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, however, to keep the knowledge of the light to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the preſent, and watch again at the ſame hour, when ſhe might poſſibly make ſome further diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>With theſe reſolutions ſhe deſcended to the parlour. Her brother was already up, and the breakfaſt waited for her. In about two hours they were ready to walk to the hermit, and left the abbey accordingly. Father Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the entrance of his cell, and conducted them to the inner part, where he begged they would be ſeated. They diſcourſed on ſeveral ſubjects; Father Peter ſhowed himſelf to be a man of great underſtanding, and quick ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; theſe gifts of nature ſeemed alſo to have been cheriſhed by an excellent education. His manners were elegant and poliſhed, while his whole deportment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſpect and admiration. There was, however, a ſettled gloom which overſpread his countenance, that ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had a heavy ſorrow at heart, which he was unable to overcome. Alfred, at the latter part of their viſit, mentioned the terror which people in general ſuffered concerning Graſville Abbey.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis a misfortune from birth, my ſon," replied the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, "which is greatly increaſed by the errors of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation."</p>
                     <p>"Yet ſurely ſuch terrors are natural," ſaid Matilda; "and in every ſituation we ſhould be ſubject to their influence."</p>
                     <p>"True;" anſwered Father Peter; "yet they are greatly encouraged by tales of horror, and terrific recitals, which
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:035833_0179_10093E02C9AECA50"/>
curioſity prompts us to liſten to, and which ſo far win on our fancy, as to make us anxious after ſuch entertainment."</p>
                     <p>"Your obſervations, father, are juſt," ſaid Alfred; "yet there may, ſometimes, circumſtances happen to us of a ſtrange nature, that to all human probability would confirm the appearance of ſupernatural beings."</p>
                     <p>Here he looked at Leonard, whoſe countenance changed, while he ſeemed to ſhudder at the ideas his maſter's words had occaſioned. None, except Matilda, obſerved it; but ſhe had lately watched every look of both her brother and Leonard. Father Peter appeared alſo diſturbed: he heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated ſome time before he anſwered; at length, however, he gave a ſhort reply, and the converſation took another turn.</p>
                     <p>After a little time they took their leave, and again walked to the abbey. Alfred, when dinner was finiſhed, had a conference of ſome time with Leonard; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immediately after walked out. Matilda, with ſurpriſe, aſked where he was gone; Alfred anſwered her with ſome confuſion, that he had ſent him to try if he could, by any ſtratagem, find if there were letters directed to him at the poſt-houſe. This ſhe knew to be entirely evaſive: but ſhe ſaid no more; and her brother ſoon after retired to his chamber.</p>
                     <p>Agnes, the moment he was gone, began talking, as uſual, of the room that was next to that they were now in, and declared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he expected every inſtant ſome hobgoblin would ſtart through the large heavy folding doors before them. Matilda aſked if ſhe knew whether her brother or Leonard had examined the apartment.</p>
                     <p>"Oh yes, made<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"And, pray, did they ſee any thing particular?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035833_0180_10093E506D407130"/>
"Nothing then," anſwered Agnes: "but they did that dreadful night: for you muſt know, had the curioſity to liſten to their diſcourſe while they were ſearching the place; and though they ſpoke very low, I could juſt make out, mademoiſelle, they had ſeen a ghoſt."</p>
                     <p>"I am determined to have a view of this room," ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, walking to that end of the parlour.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! for heaven's ſake, mademoiſelle, do not enter for the world."</p>
                     <p>"Ridiculous!" replied Matilda, and immediately puſhed againſt the doors with all her ſtrength, when they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately flew open.</p>
                     <p>The apartment was ſpacious, and one of thoſe they had examined at their firſt coming to the abbey. The furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was in better order than moſt of the others; but, the ſhutters being cloſed, the only light came from an opening at the top. She walked entirely round, and could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no alteration whatever. Agnes ſtood at the door, and at intervals attempted to peep in, but directly ſhrunk back, and retired. Matilda, having ſatisfied herſelf, cloſed the doors, while Agnes impatiently inquired if ſhe had ſeen any thing extraordinary. Matilda ſmiled at the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which ſhe aſked the queſtion, and told her ſhe had nothing to fear. Agnes, however, was by no means diveſted of her terrors; and after the ſtrange occurrences that had already happened, and thoſe which followed, it is not to be wondered at that they greatly increaſed.</p>
                     <p>In about two hours, Alfred deſcended to the parlour, and ſhortly after Leonard returned: he brought ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with him; but they were carried to the chambers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and Matilda had no opportunity of knowing what they were. Supper-time arrived; when both Leonard and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035833_0181_10093E044FF5C8F0"/>
his maſter ſeemed, in ſome meaſure, to have regained their uſual ſpirits: yet Alfred was impatient to retire to reſt; at an early hour they therefore parted for the night. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda took up a book: Agnes, after being undreſſed, wiſhed her good repoſe, and was preſently in a profound ſleep.</p>
                     <p>Matilda now ſeated herſelf in the window, impatiently waiting the hour of midnight, yet dreading a repetition of the circumſtance ſhe had already ſeen. He brother and Leonard, ſhe could hear, continued in cloſe diſcourſe for ſome time; the purport of it, however, it was impoſſible for her to make out, as they ſpoke in a low tone of voice. At length the expected time arrived, and ſhe kept watching with a palpitating heart the caſement in the weſt tower.</p>
                     <p>The night was extremely gloomy; the moon at intervals gave a light; but heavy clouds continued frequently to eclipſe it, and thunder rolled at a diſtance, while flaſhes of ſtrong lightning darted from an illumined part of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which ſeemed to form a mountain of fire. Matilda kill kept her eye fixed on the tower; but no light appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except that from above, which fell on its grey decayed walls, overgrown with ivy, and ſlowly tumbling to the ground through the ravages of time.</p>
                     <p>She was juſt going to quit her ſituation when ſhe thought ſhe perceived ſomething move in the court below. A few minutes before, ſhe had heard, as ſhe ſuppoſed, her brother's chamber-door open ſoftly, and a ſtep cautiouſly deſcend the ſtair-caſe to the hall. At the time ſhe conceived it to be only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; but her ideas were now different. A ſtrong flaſh of lightning gave her an opportunity to diſcover a figure walk ſlowly with a dark lantern acroſs the court to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the outer gates. It was cloſely wrapped up; but by the height it ſeemed like Leonard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="unknown:035833_0182_10093E51F4161370"/>
He now diſappeared among ſome trees, but ſhe ſtill ſaw the light through the foliage. Matilda, more and more agitated, remained at the window. In about five minutes, the light again moved towards the abbey; and the moon at that moment ſuddenly appearing from a heavy cloud, ſhe could plainly perceive two men follow the perſon who held the lantern. Both, by their dreſs, ſeemed Italians: but their cloaks were entirely faſtened round them, and their hats flapped over their faces ſo as to conceal the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                     <p>Aſtoniſhed at ſuch an unexpected ſight, and ready to ſink with terror, ſhe knew not in what manner to act. Leonard might be a villain! She checked herſelf at ſo uncharitable a ſuppoſition; yet, why ſhould he leave his bed at ſuch an hour, and admit two ſtrangers into the abbey, where her brother had, in all probability, preſerved his life through the ſecrecy of his habitation.</p>
                     <p>This unaccountable adventure had ſo ſtrange and dreadful an appearance, that ſhe reſolved to appriſe him of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as ſhe had every reaſon to believe he was aſleep when Leonard left the chamber: at the moment, however, ſhe was going to execute this reſolution, ſhe heard the latter enter, and ſoftly accoſt Alfred in a low voice, ſaying, "They are come, ſir;" and immediately they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, as ſhe ſuppoſed, to the parlour.</p>

which ſhe bluſhed to encourage, at different intervals agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her mind. She reſolved, at all events, to watch their departure, which did not happen for nearly an hour and a half; when Leonard, with his lantern, again conducted them acroſs the court. Soon after Alfred and himſelf entered their chamber, and, as ſhe ſuppoſed, retired to reſt. Matilda, haraſſed out and perplexed with the ſcene ſhe had been witneſs to, undreſſed herſelf, and lay down on a ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pillow.</p>
                     <p>The conduct of her brother was ſo equivocal and ſecret, that ſhe was greatly at a loſs to aſſign even one ſingle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for his late behaviour, ſince that period when Leonard returned from his firſt journey to the market, and deſired to ſpeak with him alone. The intelligence he received that day was certainly the cauſe of his ſtrange manner of conduct ſince, let it be of what nature it would. Though ſhe had laughed at Agnes's fears concerning the apartment next the parlour, yet ſomething had been ſeen to cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm and terror: for the countenances both of Leonard and his maſter, which ſhe even then took notice of, confirmed her they had been greatly ſhocked.</p>

Having walked to Father Peter's cave, he received them at the entrance with his uſual cordiality, and ſet before them ſome fruits for refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>"I had them," ſaid the old man, "from a peaſant in the village, whom I often viſit, and have known for many years, but never could perſuade him to come near my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation: for being once frightened at paſſing Graſville Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, he has never dared to venture near it ſince, not even in the day time!"</p>
                     <p>All laughed at the man's ſimplicity, as they called it, yet were all conſcious they were a prey to ſimilar fears.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, father," ſaid Alfred, "I have heard ſo much talk of this abbey, that I intend to enter it myſelf, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy that curioſity which has been raiſed by the different ſtories I have heard concerning it."</p>
                     <p>The hermit's countenance changed at Alfred's words; and he in vain ſtrove to conceal that agitation which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his heart.</p>
                     <p>"By no means fulfil ſuch a reſolution, my ſon: the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt may be dangerous. I am an old man, and know more of that abbey than you do. You muſt promiſe you will give up all idea of it."</p>
                     <p>Alfred fixed his eyes on Father Peter; Leonard looked chagrined; Matilda liſtened with attention, and Agnes trembled with emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe me," ſaid Alfred, who was the firſt that broke ſilence: "but you forget yourſelf, father, and in a great degree contradict the uſual tenor of your diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>

Soon after, they took their leave, and returned to the abbey.</p>
                     <p>Father Peter's behaviour appeared now more ſtrange than ever; and Alfred determined not yet to truſt him with the hiſtory of his affairs. They took an early ſupper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired ſoon after.</p>

                     <p>IF, at the beginning of life, mankind in general were to be made acquainted with the misfortunes they muſt ſuffer in a ſeries of years, the greater number would welcome death, and willingly eſcape miſeries they would ſuppoſe themſelves unable to ſupport. But when the trials we are ſubject to appear one by one, and we, in regular gradation, get the better of each of them, the laſt diſtreſs gives us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to go through the ſucceeding one; and by that forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude we ſtruggle through the world, and thus arrive at a ſtate of calm ſerenity, in the decline of exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Matilda had ſuffered too much for want of reſt the two latter nights, to have any idea of again watching the weſt tower, or the unknown viſitors to the abbey; ſhe therefore immediately undreſſed, and was preſently in a profound ſleep.</p>
                     <p>

The next morning ſhe was much refreſhed, and, entering the parlour, ſhe once more, according to her wiſhes, found Leonard alone. She directly opened the ſubject of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſe, and now requeſted him to give that account which was ſo critically interrupted by her brother.</p>
                     <p>Leonard ſeemed prepared, and anſwered with firmneſs, that he hoped ſhe would not be offended, but he could not.</p>
                     <p>"Cannot, Leonard!" exclaimed Matilda.</p>
                     <p>"No, mademoiſelle, indeed I cannot; my maſter ſuſpected the queſtion when we were laſt together, and gave me the moſt poſitive orders to be ſilent with reſpect to every thing relative to that night."</p>
                     <p>Matilda, though poſſeſſed of the niceſt ſenſibility, and fineſt feelings, yet had a warmth in her temper ſomething ſimilar to her brother; and though not quite ſo quick to imagine an affront, ſhe was equally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in reſenting an inſult to her pride. Leonard had hardly ever ſeen her ſo hurt; he looked diſtreſſed, yet appeared in every reſpect firm and reſolved to keep his word. Matilda continued ſome moments in a haughty ſilence; but at length thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him:</p>
                     <p>"The cauſe of the ſlighting behaviour I have received ſince our reſidence here, I am at a loſs to divine, Leonard; and heaven only knows how I have deſerved it. Every queſtion I have aſked, though probably of no leſs importance to me than to my brother, has been anſwered with equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and reſerve; while the ſtrange behaviour of Alfred, and the melancholy continually fixed on your countenance, gives every reaſon for ſuſpicion and apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>"Theſe circumſtances, added to the ſeveral occurrences that I myſelf have lately been witneſs to in this deſolate abbey, make it to me a moſt diſguſting and unpleaſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035833_0187_10093E0EB7CFEEF0"/>
In ſhort, though I have been taught to deſpiſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, yet I have every reaſon to believe all is not right in the gloomy chambers of the weſt tower; while the words which I plainly heard you repeat on entering yonder room, confirm to me that you ſaw ſomething of a dreadful nature: and, continued Matilda in a voice of diſpleaſure, yet both firm and determined, theſe reaſons added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have made me reſolve to quit this place immediately and forever."</p>
                     <p>Had a th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Leave the abbey, mademoiſelle! leave the abbey! good heavens! you will not ſurely leave us!"</p>
                     <p>"Before two more days are paſt, you may depend upon it, Leonard; during which time I ſhall be able to conſider what method will be the moſt ſecret for my departure, on my brother's account; for, unleſs I am actually detained a priſoner here, I intend going to France, and becoming a nun in the convent of N*****, where my mother and aunt were both placed in the beginning of life."</p>
                     <p>"The Holy Lady protect us!" exclaimed Leonard. "Do not encourage theſe ideas; they will drive my poor maſter diſtracted."</p>
                     <p>"You muſt impart the intelligence to him, and requeſt he will contrive ſome method for my conveyance."</p>
                     <p>Leonard was again going to reply; but Agnes brought in the breakfaſt, and Alfred preſently entered. Directly after breakfaſt was over, Leonard requeſted to ſpeak with his maſter; and Matilda had no doubt concerning the ſubject of this conference.</p>
                     <p>When Agnes and Matilda were alone, the latter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned her reſolution of leaving the abbey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:035833_0188_10093E5CAD7C6CA8"/>
Agnes's ſurpriſe was not leſs than Leonard's, but of a very different kind: joy appeared in her countenance, and ſhe declared, of all things in the world, it was what ſhe moſt wiſhed for—"I can then ſtill attend you, mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, and yet leave this dreadful place."</p>
                     <p>"But will your wiſhes lead you to attend me to the place where I intend going?"</p>
                     <p>"Any where, mademoiſelle!" exclaimed Agnes, her eyes beaming with love and gratitude—"even to the end of the world, with pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſhed tears; ſhe was greatly affected with the honeſt ſimplicity and good heart of this girl.</p>
                     <p>"But I am going to the convent of N*****, in France, Agnes, and intend poſitively to take the veil immediately."</p>
                     <p>Agnes turned pale.</p>
                     <p>"To the convent of N*****, mademoiſelle! and take the veil! but I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ollow you there too."</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe burſt into a flood of tears; for in that caſe all hopes of a union with Oliver, whom ſhe ſtill loved, muſt have ended.</p>
                     <p>Matilda gueſſed her thoughts, and pitied her ſituation. She knew not how to proceed: the little money which they had brought over from England, and which, as was before related, was the laſt Alfred had to receive of his fortune, being now nearly half expended: and on this account it was that ſhe generouſly determined (ſhould it be poſſible to be done without diſcovering her brother) to make over to him all that ſhe was poſſeſſed of by her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death; as ſhe would, after once becoming a member of the holy community, be no more in want of money to ſupport her. At all events, however, ſhe reſolved, if it was not agreeable for Agnes to retire with her to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, to make her a handſome preſent, and, if in her
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035833_0189_10093E1044916348"/>
power, ſee her comfortably ſettled. This propoſal ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with; but to part with Matilda was nearly as diſtreſſing to the poor girl as to loſe Oliver forever; yet ſhe muſt conſent to one or the other. In vain ſhe ſtrove to perſuade Matilda, by every argument ſhe could think of, to give up the idea of going to a convent, and live retired in France: and little did ſhe ſuppoſe, while it was repelled with a ſteady fortitude, that Matilda had the ſame tie as herſelf to make a retreat from the world miſerable; yet, with the moſt elevated and noble ſentiments, ſhe ſacrificed her own happineſs for the ſake of a brother.</p>
                     <p>Agnes ſtill wavered, ſighed, and wept, but was unable to come to any reſolution.</p>
                     <p>After ſome time Alfred and Leonard entered the parlour: both appeared diſtreſſed, and the former requeſted to ſpeak with his ſiſter alone. They retired to a chamber above. He informed her, Leonard had been telling him of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to quit the abbey, and retire to the convent of N*****.</p>
                     <p>Matilda anſwered that the information was right, and that ſuch was poſitively her determination.</p>
                     <p>He entreated her not to take ſo raſh a ſtep, but well to conſider a monaſtic life, before ſhe entered into it.</p>
                     <p>That, ſhe ſaid, ſhe had already done; for the many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities ſhe had gone through ſince her mother's death, had ſickened her of the world, and—</p>
                     <p>"Hold, Matilda!" exclaimed Alfred: "is there not one perſon in this world, which you are ſo diſguſted with, whom you may think of with a ſigh of tenderneſs, and that ſigh bring a wiſh that you had never been immured within the walls of a convent?"</p>
                     <p>Matilda felt herſelf hurt at the the queſtion.</p>

"Let my ideas or remembrances be whatever they may, my reſolution is fixed; nor can my ſituation be worſe than that I am now involved in."</p>
                     <p>"Do you accuſe me of unkindneſs, Matilda?"</p>
                     <p>"In ſome reſpects I do. But this diſcourſe is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; let us conſider in what manner I ſhall eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring you."</p>
                     <p>"Surely you do not actually intend leaving us?"</p>
                     <p>"After what I have ſaid, do you ſuppoſe I jeſt?"</p>
                     <p>"You muſt not, cannot go," he exclaimed, raiſing his voice.</p>
                     <p>"And pray, ſir," anſwered Matilda, her pride piqued; "by what right will you detain me?"</p>
                     <p>He ſeemed chagrined.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, Matilda, you muſt think better of this affair. Give up the idea, and conſider it as romantic."</p>
                     <p>"Without I am detained by force," anſwered Matilda with firmneſs, "I am determined to leave this abbey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore—"</p>
                     <p>"Hold," ſaid Alfred, "and inform me for what reaſon you have thus ſuddenly taken ſo ſtrange a reſolution,"</p>
                     <p>"For various reaſons, all of which combined together ſhow that it is poſitively neceſſary for my own happineſs.

encouragement to the moſt horrid and diſmal ſuppoſitions. The innocent Agnes continually terrifies herſelf and me by thoſe fears which are certainly cauſed by the moſt powerful reaſons, and which prey the more on my ſpirits, by my being obliged to ſupport hers, and to talk lightly of thoſe ideas I feel myſelf with equal terror. But I will confeſs my intention was haſtened by Leonard's refuſal to give that information I required relative to your entrance into that room next the parlour on the dreadful night of the ſtorm. When I firſt requeſted the explanation, we were interrupted by you; and he now tells me, that, ſuſpecting the purport of our diſcourſe, you forbid him to anſwer the queſtion. Neither would you give any ſatisfactory reply during our converſation on the terrace, but left me to think the worſt in a ſtate of uncertainty. In ſhort, there is an arbitrary principle reigns through the whole tenor of your conduct, which I am reſolved no longer to put up with."</p>
                     <p>Here her countenance glowed with anger and contempt: ſhe was going to leave the chamber, when Alfred ſtopped her.</p>
                     <p>"Hear me in ſome meaſure vindicate myſelf," exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, "though I cannot at preſent ſatisfy your curioſity. In the firſt place, you complain of your reſidence in this abbey; but conſider for a moment, Matilda, and you will find that it was my exertion in the preſervation of your honour, and the puniſhment I gave the villain who dared to inſult you, that obliged me to fly hither, and ignobly conceal myſelf from purſuit, while double infamy was poured upon my name, and by helliſh contrivance I was proved a deſerter unknown to myſelf.

                     <p>He ſighed heavily; Matilda looked aſtoniſhed, and left the chamber.</p>
                     <p>"Generous girl!" he exclaimed, "could I but once ſee thee happy, and forget the object of my love, life would have no charms to detain me; and the world ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately know that Alfred Maſerini could laugh at its malice, and make tyranny bluſh at the exertion of its own power."</p>

                     <p>AGNES and Leonard were ſoon made acquainted with the agreement that had paſſed between the brother and the ſiſter; and it gave both of them pleaſure that the time of Matilda's departure was deferred. Agnes thought ſhe might poſſibly, in this interval, bring herſelf to follow ſo bright an example, and renounce the world for ever; and all were rather more cheerful than uſual at dinner. Alfred afterwards propoſed a walk to the hermit; but when they arrived at the cave, the place was deſerted; and they therefore ſuppoſed Father Peter was gone his round among the villagers. Having returned, Alfred read ſome poetry aloud, which amuſed them till near ſupper-time; and, ſoon after a light repaſt, they retired to their reſpective chambers.</p>
                     <p>Matilda determined to watch again for the ſtrangers and the light in the weſt tower. She accordingly took up a book, which occaſioned the ſame excuſe as before to the innocent and unſuſpecting Agnes, who was ſoon in a profound ſleep. The night was ſerene and beautiful: not a breeze of wind diſturbed the ſurrounding foliage: all was ſilent, tranquil, and ſolitary; while the heavens, covered with ſtars, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumined by a full moon, gave the eye a more clear view of the dark groves of cypreſs, and the heavy ruins of the weſt tower.</p>
                     <p>Matilda watched with a palpitating heart the upper caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till near midnight, when a ſtrong glare of light, as before, appeared: but in leſs than a minute all was again dark.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035833_0194_10093E66E3F7A440"/>
In a little time after, ſhe heard Leonard creep ſoftly out of his room, deſcend the ſtair-caſe, and croſs the court. In about five minutes he returned, accompanied by two other perſons, whoſe figures ſhe now ſaw more plainly; and ſhe judged them to be the ſame who paid the laſt viſit. Alfred joined them in the parlour. They did not remain in the abbey ſo long as at the former time; but Leonard, as before, conducted them to the outer gates.</p>
                     <p>Juſt as they got into the middle of the court, the light in the weſt tower again appeared; and it was immediately noticed by one of the ſtrangers, who ſeemed to utter an exclamation of ſupriſe. Both his companion and Leonard immediately looked up; and all ſeemed ſtruck with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment. The caſement had been illuminated about three minutes, when a figure advanced, and ſtood in the front of the window. Matilda ſhuddered, and thoſe below ſeemed greatly alarmed.</p>
                     <p>The form looked to be that of a man; but ſhe could not poſſibly make out either its dreſs or countenance. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued viſible but a very ſhort time, when it appeared to ſink down by degrees, till it was entirely loſt; and the light immediately vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>Leonard and the ſtrangers claſped their hands in ſign of wonder; the former attended them to the gates, and then returned to the abbey: but neither he nor Alfred re- entered their chamber till near half an hour after.</p>
                     <p>Matilda, fatigued, and terrified with what ſhe had ſeen, retired to her bed, but not to ſleep. Her mind wandered over ſuch ſtrange events; and the more ſhe thought of them, the more ſhe was perplexed. Myſtery ſeemed to follow myſtery, and every ſucceeding one appeared more horrid than the former.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:035833_0195_10093E19D20812D8"/>
The gloomy look of her chamber encouraged the moſt diſmal ideas; and her eyes, as if by impulſe, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fixed on the picture before mentioned, and which Matilda was ſo ſtruck with the firſt night ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> in the room. Directly oppoſite her bed was placed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> pier glaſs of uncommon ſize, and ſurrounded by a heavy gilt frame. This piece of furniture had lately been added to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it having before ſtood in one of the apartments below. A ſmall lighted taper was near it, and the dim, uncertain light which it gave, ſhowed but faintly the reflection of the objects in the glaſs. Matilda, unable to reſt, and tired with the continual ſight of the painting, turned her eyes towards the glaſs; it ſhowed the bed and the receſs on each ſide: but the back ground of the reflection was nearly dark. She was perfectly awake, and ſighed at thoſe ideas ſhe was unable to repreſs.</p>
                     <p>The ſigh was anſwered.</p>
                     <p>She trembled, thought it might be Agnes, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſhe was miſtaken. She heard it again: ſhe thought it certainly could not be fancy.</p>
                     <p>It was repeated a third time.</p>
                     <p>At that moment ſhe perceived a light through the glaſs, and the ſame figure ſhe had before ſeen in the weſt tower advance, bearing in the ſame manner a lamp.</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſaw no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ſcreamed, and cloſed her eyes. In about a minute ſhe opened them again; but the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had vaniſhed. Agnes, however, awoke, and requeſted to know if ſhe was ill; while her brother knocked at her door, and aſked the ſame queſtion. She anſwered both that ſhe was well, out had been dreaming: and it being a natural ſuppoſition that this might be the reaſon of her terror, no further inquiry was made. Matilda could not be compoſed:
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035833_0196_10093E69E39F6280"/>
and the more ſhe ſtrove to perſuade herſelf it was merely the effects of a diſturbed brain, the more her own ſenſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the contrary. By her fight of the figure in the glaſs, it ſeemed to come forward from the left hand ſide of her bed. There was no opening in the room for the admittance of any human being, except by the door of the chamber; and that was bolted on the inſide. She was entirely free from ſleep, nor had heard the leaſt noiſe ſince ſhe had firſt entered the apartment in the beginning of the night.</p>
                     <p>She determined to inform her brother of this circumſtance, the firſt opportunity on the following morning, as it was of too horrid a nature to be paſſed over in ſilence. She again ſtrove to reſt, but it was impoſſible; and, fearful of even lifting her head above the bed-clothes, ſhe ſuffered the moſt tormenting and terrific ſenſations.</p>
                     <p>Morning at length broke in upon the room, and the ſun with glowing ſplendour darted through the thick ſoliage of the trees, till with majeſtic grandeur he roſe above them, and ſeemed to change the face of nature to life and joy. Matilda hailed the morning with a hymn to that Supreme Deity who cauſed the change, and at whoſe nod the ſame darkneſs and horror could in a moment be returned. Agnes ſoon roſe. She perceived Matilda was unwell, and begged ſhe would not get up to breakfaſt: but the latter was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this would be of no ſervice to her, and ſhe accordingly, after ſome little time, joined them in the parlour. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> inquired if ſhe was ill; ſhe faintly anſwered, "No;" but her manner contradicted the reply. After breakfaſt ſhe requeſted to ſpeak with him alone.</p>
                     <p>Poor Agnes had every day more and more cauſe for won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and now declared to Leonard ſhe was afraid Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle was going <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:035833_0197_10093E1C98FA0330"/>
Matilda and Alfred aſcended to the chamber of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſhe related to him the events of the laſt night.</p>
                     <p>Her recital of them was ſo clear and perfect, and her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of delivery ſo ſteady and free from every appearance of a flighty imagination, that, however improbable the tale might ſeem, Alfred was ſtaggered at the anſwers ſhe gave to the arguments by which he attempted to perſuade her to think no more of it, and at laſt became a convert to her opinion: nor is it ſo much to be wondered at that he ſo readily acquieſced in a belief of the fact, ſince he himſelf had once been witneſs to a light in the weſt tower, and ſeen an object which made a great impreſſion on him on entering the room next the parlour, and had heard Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, the night before the preſent morning, relate that he had (as alſo thoſe that were with him) ſeen a light and figure in the ſame caſement of the tower.</p>
                     <p>Theſe circumſtances, with ſome others of a like nature, following each other in due order, were certainly in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> degree ſufficient reaſons for his belief of a fact which he otherwiſe would have laughed at and diſregarded.</p>
                     <p>After a pauſe of ſilence for a conſiderable time, during which the countenances of both brother and ſiſter were expreſſive of affliction, diſtreſs, and horror; Alfred declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an intention, which both alarmed and terrified Matilda, but which he ſeemed ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tinately bent on executing: it was, to watch himſelf for one night in the weſt tower.</p>
                     <p>"Leonard," ſaid he, "ſhall ſleep in my room as uſual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by no means acquaint Agnes with this reſolution."</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake, Alfred," anſwered Matilda, "do not admit ſuch a thought: I would ſooner ſuffer any thing than you ſhould expoſe yourſelf to ſuch a riſk."</p>
                     <p>Alfred ſmiled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:035833_0198_10093E6B69F5CA70"/>
"Why ſurely, Matilda," ſaid he, "we have nothing to fear from ſupernatural beings."</p>
                     <p>She ſtill, however, urged and entreated him to think no more of it. But he continued firm to his plan; and it was in vain his ſiſter uſed every perſuaſive argument ſhe could think of, to make him give up ſuch a dreadful deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                     <p>"Who knows," ſaid he, "Matilda, but one night may unravel myſteries that have been concealed for years? who knows but by the exertion of a little fortitude, by baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idle fears, and ſhowing ſome degree of ſpirit, we may defy our enemies, my conduct may be made clear to the world, and a ſeries of happy years be a reward for adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities at the beginning of life? what would I not ſuffer," exclaimed he, "for ſuch bleſſings and happineſs! O merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful father! if the injured ſpirit of my ſire walks in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted abbey, and ſeeks the preſence of his ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould I not ſtrive for the interview, though it might chill my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the time?"</p>
                     <p>"Go!" pronounced a voice, followed by a diſmal groan.</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſunk into a chair. Alfred held her arm, and trembled.</p>
                     <p>"In the name of our Holy Virgin," ſaid he, "anſwer me, who and what thou art."</p>
                     <p>"Go, go, go!" repeated the voice, three times; and then with another groan it ſeemed to aſcend and die away.</p>
                     <p>"Surely," ſaid Alfred, "heaven interferes in my behalf, and tells me to proceed! Now, Matilda, you can urge no objection,"</p>
                     <p>She ſighed deeply.</p>
                     <p>"But you are ill: we had better go down to the parlour immediately."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:035833_0199_10093E22641BD5E0"/>
"I am indeed," ſhe anſwered, "hardly able to ſtand."</p>
                     <p>Her brother partly carried her down the ſtairs, and placed her on a ſofa; ſhe directly fell into ſtrong hyſteric fits, which laſted a conſiderable time; every method was taken for her recovery; and they were greatly alarmed. At length, however, ſhe ſeemed more compoſed, and, after ſome hours, found herſelf much better, though extremely weak.</p>
                     <p>Leonard, who had hitherto been made acquainted with every extraordinary circumſtance, was now in his turn a wondering ſpectator; and Agnes, ſtill more diſtreſſed and terrified, declared it would be the happieſt moment of her life, when ſhe once found herſelf at ſome diſtance from ſo diſmal and horrid an abode. Alfred muſed in melancholy ſilence on the ſtrange voice he had heard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> nor had he now a ſingle doubt of a ſupernatural being haunting the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the abbey. "Surely," though he, "that room, where it is likely my father loſt his life, is the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place to be viſited by his diſturbed ſpirit. Yet, may not my ſenſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be ſo far overcome by ſeeing the departed ſhade of a parent whom I never knew, but who was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been baſely murdered, as to prevent my utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the critical moment of its, appearance?"</p>
                     <p>Matilda was ſilent and melancholy: ſhe conſidered it would now be ridiculous to ſtrive to prevent Alfred from watching in the weſt tower, ſince ſo ſtrange an occurrence had ſtrengthened that reſolution which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> had before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; yet fears for his ſafety haraſſed her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>magination, and almoſt threw her into a ſtate of inſanity.</p>
                     <p>Only one method ſhe could think of, that would in any degree alleviate her anxiety; which was, to propoſe his having Leonard to attend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035833_0200_10093E6F18B13A60"/>
ſhe ſhrunk with terror from the thought of ſleeping at ſuch a diſtance from any one but Agnes, and feared again ſhe might ſee the figure in her chamber. Her regard, however, for her brother made her reſolve to ſacrifice her own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and at leaſt make the propoſal to him.</p>
                     <p>After dinner they contrived to ſend Agnes into the hall for a few minutes; and Leonard was then made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the events of the morning, and with the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation his maſter had taken of watching himſelf that night in the tower.</p>
                     <p>Leonard turned pale.</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake, ſir," ſaid he, "do not attempt it!"</p>
                     <p>"But conſider," replied Alfred, "the words which the voice repeated."</p>
                     <p>Leonard could make no anſwer, but turned away with horror and ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"At all events," ſaid Alfred, "Agnes muſt not know of this affair, nor of my viſit to the deſerted chamber. We muſt therefore contrive to make every thing ready without her knowledge, and in ſuch a manner that I may firſt go into my own room, as if to retire to reſt, and after ſome little time ſteal to the weſt tower."</p>
                     <p>Matilda and Leonard ſhuddered at the idea of what might happen there; yet neither, after what had happened, could attempt, at leaſt they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>new it would be of no avail to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to perſuade him to relinquiſh his intention. Agnes now entered. Alfred and Leonard immediately aſcended to their chamber, and conveyed a table, with ſome books, wine, and proviſion, to the apartment before mentioned, where thoſe ſpots of blood were to be ſeen, which, in all human probability, was that of Alfred's father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:035833_0201_10093E2400E1E808"/>
Leonard alſo laid a wood ſire, and made the room as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Having done this, they returned to the parlour, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda ſoon found an opportunity to requeſt he would let Leonard remain with him the whole night; but her brother poſitively refuſed it, though he at laſt agreed Leonard ſhould accompany him to the tower, but then return direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Alfred propoſed a walk to the hermit; but Matilda appeared too ill to undertake it; they therefore poſtponed it till the next day. Supper-time at length arrived, and anxiety was marked on the features of all: Alfred was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by the thoughts of what he might be witneſs to in the ſhort ſpace of a few hours; and Matilda, alarmed for his welfare, and terrified at even entering her chamber, dreaded leſt the midnight hour ſhould again ſhow her the phantom. Leonard weighed in his mind the difference of their ſituation: when poſſeſſed of a tender parent, they knew no unhappineſs, except for the misfortunes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of others, which they were ever ready to pity and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Agnes was almoſt afraid to turn her head, for fear of ſeeing ſome hideous ſpectre.</p>
                     <p>All wiſhed to delay retiring to reſt, and they talked ſome time after ſupper on indifferent ſubjects, but with heavy hearts; till at length Alfred aroſe. They aſcended the great ſtair-caſe, and parted for the night.</p>

                     <p>Thus it was with Matilda; ſhe no longer doubted, and a dreadful certainly took place: ſhe did not now heſitate whether ſuch things might be, but ſhe fervently believed ſuch things were; and conſequently every trivial event ſtrengthened this imagination.</p>
                     <p>Agnes, as uſual, was ſoon in bed; but Matilda reſolved to watch the caſement of the tower. "My brother," thought ſhe, "will ſhortly be there; and if will be ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle comfort to ſee the dim light that proceeds from his lamp."</p>
                     <p>A book was her excuſe for not undreſſing, and Agnes in about a quarter of an hour was aſleep.</p>
                     <p>Alfred and Leonard remained in their chamber ſome time. It was near midnight when Matilda heard them leave it; her heart palpitated for their ſituation, and ſhe ſhrunk with horror from her own. Neither was now near! the ſhadow of the preceding night preſented itſelf to her
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035833_0203_10093E26BA5C1810"/>
fancy, and her blood was chilled at the very thought. Thunder rolled over the abbey, and pale flaſhes of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning darted on the mouldering ruins. Matilda could not yet diſcern a light; ſhe conceived they muſt be a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time aſcending, while her fears and anxiety made her forget that they had firſt to go down the great ſtairs, and afterwards up thoſe of the weſt tower.</p>
                     <p>At length a faint glimmering appeared, which was a kind of ſignal to her that they had entered the chamber.</p>
                     <p>The thunder became more awful, and awoke Agnes.</p>
                     <p>"Good heavens, mademoiſelle, are you up yet? What a dreadful night!"</p>
                     <p>"It is rather ſtormy," replied Matilda, ſtriving to be compoſed.</p>
                     <p>"Rather ſtormy, mademoiſelle! why the thunder is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and the lightning too is extremely bad: you had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter move from the window; it is very dangerous to ſtand ſo near it."</p>
                     <p>Matilda took her advice. The lightning became much worſe; ſhe ſat down by the ſide of the bed, and requeſted Agnes to compoſe herſelf to reſt.</p>
                     <p>"But are you not going to give up reading for the night?"</p>
                     <p>"I have juſt finiſhed the book," anſwered Matilda, "and then ſhall go to reſt."</p>
                     <p>There being now a little interval in the ſtorm, Agnes was ſoon in a ſlumber.</p>
                     <p>By this time ſhe expected Leonard would have returned to his chamber; but ſhe had not yet heard him enter it. The light ſtill continued in the caſement; but the ſtorm was ſo very violent as to prevent her being continually at the window.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:035833_0204_10093E767AB15848"/>
Near a quarter of an hour elapſed, and ſhe heard nothing of Leonard. Seated on the bed, ſhe dared not turn herſelf towards the glaſs, but kept her eyes fixed on the ground, terrified at the idea of even looking round the room. At laſt a noiſe, which ſeemed to proceed from the court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, made her riſe, and go the window. She could ſee no one, yet heard a kind of knocking, at the outer gates. Who or what it could be, ſhe was at a loſs to imagine; and, the noiſe increaſing, ſhe became more uneaſy and aſtoniſhed. She was equally unable alſo to account for Leonard's ſtay, and conceived ſomething very extraordinary muſt have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
                     <p>The noiſe now ceaſed for ſome little time, but afterwards became more clamorous; and at laſt, by the ſound, the gates ſeemed to burſt open. A thought ſtruck Matilda, that they might be diſcovered, and that the officers of juſtice were come for her brother. She trembled at the ſuppoſition, but ſtill remained at the caſement.</p>
                     <p>After a ſhort period, ſhe perceived four men armed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the abbey: two of them had lanterns, and the others followed directly after. Matilda was nearly diſtracted; ſhe knew not in what manner to act. Leonard might be returned, though ſhe had not heard him. She tapped at the door, but received no anſwer. She knocked louder: all was ſilent: ſhe entered the chamber, but it was entirely deſerted. Having liſtened at the top of the ſtair-caſe, and heard them enter the hall, from which they proceeded to the parlour, all fears of ſupernatural appearances vaniſhed from her mind, and the preſervation of Alfred employed every faculty. She determined to deſcend, and ſtrive to make out, unperceived, the occaſion of their viſit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:035833_0205_10093E2CC90E2D20"/>
But then, if Agnes ſhould awake, and find no one near, what would be her ſituation? Matilda heſitated a little, but at laſt reſolved to run the hazard for the ſake of her brother. She therefore took the lamp, and ſoftly ſtepped down to the hall, which having croſſed towards the door of the parlour, ſhe ſtopped, and through the crevice could ſee that they were all ſeated round the ſupper table, which had been left ſtanding in the ſame place, and on which was ſome wine: this they were making free with, and ſeemed in high mirth.</p>
                     <p>Ready to ſink with anxiety, ſhe ſupported herſelf againſt a column; and the door not being quite cloſed, ſhe had a view of each of their countenances, at different times, as they turned round to ſpeak to each other. By their dreſs and language ſhe found they were Italians.</p>
                     <p>"Puſh the bottle about!" cried one, who ſeemed to be a kind of ſuperior, and whoſe viſage was, if poſſible, fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer than thoſe of his comrades: "nobody loves good wine better than I do, particularly when it is got cheap.</p>
                     <p>Here was a loud laugh, and a boiſterous chorus of a ſong uſed by banditti. At laſt ſilence was in ſome meaſure reſtored; and one who ſat on the right ſide of him that ſpoke, reminded him not to make too free with the bottle, and forget the buſineſs they came upon.</p>
                     <p>"True! true! anſwered he: "I thank you for your caution, for faith there is great danger of it, as you ſay, when we are ſeated at ſuch a table as this. But now to buſineſs; come, in the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Here a loud clap of thunder rolled over the abbey; and ſhe was unable to diſtinguiſh what followed.</p>
                     <p>After ſome time ſhe heard the voice of the third.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:035833_0206_10093E79157AE2D8"/>
"It is very true," ſays he, "that might do well; but I have reaſon to think he is in the weſt tower to-night, by the light I ſaw in the caſement."</p>
                     <p>"Piſh!" anſwered the firſt, "that place is haunted; I have often ſeen a light in it, when not a ſoul inhabited the abbey."</p>
                     <p>Matilda trembled violently.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! that I know very well, ſignor: but by what—"</p>
                     <p>Here again the thunder interrupted the diſtracted liſtener, and ſhe loſt the remainder of the ſentence. At length all was once more ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Well, well," ſaid the firſt, "if that is the caſe, why we muſt directly make our road to the weſt tower: but the devil take me if I know which is the way to it."</p>
                     <p>"Nor I," exclaimed each of the others, riſing.</p>
                     <p>"Never mind," anſwered the firſt: "I'll warrant we will find it."</p>
                     <p>This was enough for Matilda;—ſhe heard no more, but immediately departed towards the ſtair-caſe that led to the tower, with an intent to acquaint her brother with the arrival of the unwelcome viſitors. Had ſhe been told, half an hour before, that ſhe could have had the courage to proceed alone at midnight to the weſt tower, ſhe would poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively have declared it would have been impoſſible: but now, though a great degree of terror was left, yet the chief part was obliterated in the idea of preſerving her brother's life.</p>
                     <p>She hurried acroſs the hall, but, in her agitation, miſtook the turning to the ſtairs, and found herſelf before the heavy grate-work gates of the chapel. She ſtopped a moment to fetch breath. While her eyes were vacantly fixed on the ruins of this ancient place of worſhip, a faint glimmering ſeemed to move on one ſide of the aiſles; and, in about a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035833_0207_10093E2E7AC113A0"/>
minute, a figure with a lamp glided along the body of the chapel. This brought Matilda, to a recollection of her ſituation; her tottering limbs almoſt refuſed to do their office: ſhe partly ſtaggered from the gates, and returned to find the opening to the ſtair-caſe. This ſhe fortunately found, and began to aſcend the narrow ſtone ſtairs; while every few minutes ſhe ſtopped, and thought ſhe heard a footſtep behind her; then looked back, but all was quiet, except the thunder, which ſtill continued with equal vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Matilda, faint and breathleſs, at length arrived at the firſt landing. Here ſhe halted, and ſeated herſelf for a moment under a caſement.</p>
                     <p>The lightning darted through into the oppoſite apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was that which contained the few implements of war, and martial inſtruments, and ſhowed the gloomy appearance of the room. One flaſh, greater than the reſt, illumined the whole ſpace; and, at the ſame inſtant, a figure ſtalked acroſs, and ſeemed to vaniſh at the further end. Matilda gave a faint ſhriek, and hurried up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the ſtairs; and, when arrived at the top, burſt into the fatal chamber of the weſt tower, and there perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her brother ſitting alone at the table, his hand on his ſword, his eyes fixed on a particular part of the room, with a wild look of horror and agony, while his whole frame ſhook with convulſive terror.</p>
                     <p>"Alfred!" exclaimed Matilda, ſinking on a chair.</p>
                     <p>He turned his eyes towards her, and ſtarted.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! who and what art thou, that appeareſt to me in the ſhape—"</p>
                     <p>Matilda fell into a fainting ſit. When ſhe recovered, ſhe found her brother ſtanding over her, and adminiſtering ſome wine and water. His haggard countenance met here
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035833_0208_10093E7AEE588468"/>
when ſhe opened her eyes, and with a look of diſtraction he aſked her what brought her there.</p>
                     <p>"Anxiety for your ſafety," anſwered ſhe; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately related to him, in as few words as poſſible, the ſcene ſhe had been witneſs to, concerning the men who were now in the abbey.</p>
                     <p>"Merciful father!" he exclaimed, "how much longer ſhall I be haraſſed with horror and misfortunes, which follow each other ſo quickly, that I am not able to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate myſelf from one, before it is ſucceeded by a greater, which ſeems at once to overwhelm me with ruin and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair? What am I ſaying?" continued he: "dare I to queſtion the Almighty, wretch that I am, and repine at thoſe adverſities he has ordained I ſhould experience?"</p>
                     <p>"Stand not here," ſaid Matilda, "but leave this part of the building. They will, I am afraid, begin to aſcend the ſtair-caſe before we can get down. Pray make haſte. If you can but evade them ſo as to attain the great ſtair-caſe, you may conceal yourſelf in ſome of the further apartments beyond our chambers, while they are ſearching here."</p>
                     <p>They now began to deſcend (Alfred having put out the lamp in the chamber) and fortunately found themſelves at the bottom, without any interruption, but heard ſome voices at the further end of the paſſage, next the chapel by the great gates. They ſtopped not to liſten, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ran up the principal ſtairs. At the top they diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Leonard.</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake, Leonard," exclaimed both brother and ſiſter, "where have you been?"</p>
                     <p>"Faith," returned Leonard, "that I can hardly tell; but, by ſome means or other, I turned wrong on the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe of the weſt tower when I left my maſter to come back to my chamber. It led me into a ſmall paſſage, and I
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035833_0209_100937D798068728"/>
there found ſome ſtone ſteps. Thinking that this was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an angle, and that it would lead me to the ſame ſpot as if I had continued right, I deſcended them, but ſoon ſound my error, and diſcovered myſelf among the ruins of the chapel. Theſe I croſſed, to read a ſtone which was erected to the memory of the late count."</p>
                     <p>This explained to Matilda the figure which ſhe had ſeen as ſhe was going to her brother; ſhe did not however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt him; and Leonard told them that he ſoon found his way to the hall, but had alſo heard ſtrange voices of perſons who ſeemed to be ſearching the abbey; on which account he had called Agnes, who had greatly alarmed herſelf and him when they found Matilda was abſent.</p>
                     <p>They were now joined by Agnes, who flew into the arms of her fair friend, who, her imagination had told her, was run away with by the ghoſts. The party now began to proceed towards the further chambers, Agnes ſupported by Leonard, and Matilda by her brother.</p>

                     <p>WITH ſolitary and ſilent ſteps they croſſed ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, till they came to the paſſage which was before deſcribed, and which led to the gloomy chamber that, it was ſuppoſed, had formerly contained a corpſe lying in ſtate. Matilda dreaded to enter it; ſhe well remembered the appearance of it, when with her brother ſhe examined thoſe rooms.</p>
                     <p>But there was now no alternative: it ended the ſuite, and therefore it was the moſt likely one to conceal them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="unknown:035833_0210_10093E7DB0FD5220"/>
After croſſing the paſſage they arrived at the folding doors: Matilda and Alfred were foremoſt; the latter puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them, and they flew open. The chamber was illuminated. All ſtarted back with aſtoniſhment and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Agnes faintly ſcreamed; and it was ſome minutes before they proceeded. At length, however, they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and perceived that the pieces of wax tapers in the black glaſſes, which they had before obſerved, were now lighted, and ſerved to ſhow the diſmal, terrific ſcene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them. In every other reſpect the apartment was exactly the ſame, nor could the trace of any foot-ſtep he diſcovered. Both were ſilent: their own reflections were ſufficient. Alfred had witneſſed ſo much in the abbey, that he found it impoſſible to turn off the ſubject with jeſt, or even reaſoning. Having ſeated his ſiſter and Agnes, he ſtood by them with his arms folded, and his eyes fixed on the floor; Leonard was in the ſame poſture, on the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>They had not remained in this ſituation above ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, when a loud clap of thunder rolled over the building. It was followed by a convulſive ſhock of nature, which ſeemed to take effect on the part where they ſtood; and at that moment the Corinthian capital of a large column, greatly decayed, fell to the ground with a moſt tremendous noiſe.</p>
                     <p>Both Matilda and Agnes were nearly inſenſible; Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard was ſtupefied with horror, and Alfred diſtracted. Some moments after, when the latter perceived ſomething raiſed above the ſhaft of the pillar, his curioſity led him to go near: he did ſo, and to his ſurpriſe found it was a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand, holding a length of ſilver chain, at the bottom of which was a gold and bloody key. He called his ſiſter, Agnes, and Leonard, to look at it, then claſped hold of it,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035833_0211_10093E36521ECF28"/>
and diſentangled the chain from the hand. A flaſh of lightning, and a clap of thunder, again called their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when, turning from the column, the figure and its lamp again ſtood before them, lifted up its arms in token of pleaſure, and vaniſhed through the floor from their ſight.</p>
                     <p>Agnes ſcreamed and fell into ſtrong hyſterics, while Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, ſupported by her brother, ſainted away.</p>
                     <p>It was near an hour before they recovered. The ſtorm had now in ſome meaſure abated: and Alfred, thinking he had heard during the latter part of the time a noiſe like the cloſing of the abbey gates, deſired Leonard to look firſt from the great ſtairs, and then proceed down, and ſearch the lower part of the building.</p>
                     <p>Leonard having left them, Alfred began to give as much conſolation as was in his power to Agnes and his ſiſter: but his words faultered, as he attempted to uſe arguments of comfort, while ideas of miſery and diſtreſs came too forcibly to admit the bright and cheering ray of hope. Leonard returned with the agreeable intelligence that the unwelcome viſitors had left the abbey. They therefore, after the lights were put out, made their way to their chambers, and retired; yet though their haraſſed minds received, in ſome degree, the oblivion of ſleep, it was of that kind which occaſioned tormenting and horrid flights of fancy.</p>
                     <p>Matilda appeared extremely ill at breakfaſt; Alfred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the key which in ſo wonderful a manner he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained poſſeſſion of. They were at a loſs to know to what it belonged, when Matilda recollected the cabinet in her chamber; and, according to the ſize, it ſeemed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that lock. They deferred, however, trying it, till another opportunity, as they intended viſiting Father
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035833_0212_10093E82B6FDB688"/>
Peter before dinner. They were ſoon equipped for their little journey, and proceeded for the cave.</p>
                     <p>Father Peter was ſeated at a table, in a melancholy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. On one ſide of him was his crucifix, and before him ſeveral papers, which he put away immediately as they entered.</p>
                     <p>Having teſtified great pleaſure at ſeeing them, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation became general, and they found that their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was right, concerning his being on a viſit to ſome peaſants, when they found him abſent from his habitation.</p>
                     <p>They had been in the cave about an hour, when Father Peter, while talking with unuſual cheerfulneſs, was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken ill, and fainted away in Alfred's arms.</p>
                     <p>Matilda and Agnes adminiſtered ſome cordials which they found near, while Leonard unbuttoned his veſt, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give him air; when they beheld ſuſpended on his breaſt an elegant miniature of a lady, ſet in gold, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with pearls. But how great was Alfred's aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to behold the exact reſemblance of lady Caroline Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne! No notice was, however, taken: for all except him were too much engaged to obſerve the likeneſs.</p>
                     <p>Father Peter by degrees recovered, and thanked them for their attention. He ſaid he was ſubject to ſuch ſits, and expected to pay the debt of nature, at the approach of each of them: "But oh! my God!" he exclaimed, "ſpare me a little longer, till a mighty work is effected! and then I die in peace."</p>
                     <p>They now took their leave, and returned to the abbey. Alfred mentioned his obſervation on the miniature, and it was the cauſe of reflections the moſt uncomfortable and diſtreſſing. The ſight of a picture which reſembled in ſo ſtriking a manner the countenance of a beloved object, brought to his memory ſcenes of happineſs he had once
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035833_0213_10093E37D8C4BA90"/>
hoped to have enjoyed, but which were now, to all human probability, for ever blaſted.</p>
                     <p>The charming lady Caroline he ſuppoſed to be hundreds of miles diſtant: and he conſidered it as by no means an improbable ſuppoſition that ſhe might now be in the arms of another. He informed his ſiſter and Leonard that he again intended to watch in the weſt tower that night; but determinedly refuſed to accept of even Leonard's attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the chamber, that he might be in readineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her and Agnes to the other part of the abbey, ſhould they again be diſturbed by the viſitors of the night before. After dinner, Leonard ſaid he was going to the public market: but Matilda knew this was the uſual excuſe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred adviſed his ſiſter to examine the cabinet after Agnes was aſleep: this was agreed on, and he delivered her the key.</p>
                     <p>Leonard returned in about two hours, and had a private conference with his maſter. Both ſeemed much pleaſed with ſome information they had received. Supper-time arrived; and after a ſhort repaſt they retired to their apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, in about half an hour after, took a lamp, ſoftly left his chamber, and proceeded to that of the weſt tower. Agnes was not aſleep ſo ſoon as uſual: ſhe talked of the horrors they had experienced, and trembled for fear of a repetition of them in her dreams. At length, however, ſhe fell under the influence of the heavy god; and Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da with a palpitating heart, applied the gold key to the cabinet, when, after a little difficulty, the folding doors flew open.</p>
                     <p>It was elegantly adorned with gilt Italian figures, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſize, in the habits of former times. The firſt three drawers which Matilda opened, contained coins of gold
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035833_0214_10093E8567E04850"/>
and ſilver to a great amount. The ſight of the treaſure though it for a moment elevated her, cauſed, after a little reflection, but a ſmall degree of pleaſure; it was none of their property, nor had they any proof to the right of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing it. The fourth and fifth drawers contained jewels, the moſt beautiful ſhe had ever ſeen, carefully preſerved in gold caſkets. The ſixth drawer was full of papers; ſome of which were letters that had paſſed between the old count Maſerini and his lady, in their youth, before their marriage; and ſeveral after, when the count was on buſineſs at the court of Spain. In one of theſe be mentioned his intention of purchaſing Graſville Abbey, and in the next his having done it, and taken poſſeſſion of the title to that eſtate. He concluded with ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

when ſhe beheld her father's name at the bottom! A ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den faintneſs ſeized her, and ſhe ſunk into an arm chair. A flood of tears, however, fortunately, gave relief, and ſhe found herſelf able to peruſe the manuſcript, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following words, and ſhowed plainly the diſtracted ſtate of mind the writer laboured under:</p>

                     <p>Theſe were the words of Matilda, as ſhe dropped the manuſcript from her hands, and burſt into a flood of tears.

                     <p>Having wept for a conſiderable time, ſhe found herſelf in ſome degree recovered.

                        </gap>s natural warmth of temper would not permit him to uſe diſcretion in his inquiries of Father Peter; and the ſtrange, myſterious behaviour of this man had prevented them from even truſting him with their ſituation. It was true the paper ſhe had found ſpoke well of him; but how eaſily might her poor father have been deceived by artful profeſſions of friendſhip to hide the lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing villany of his ſoul, and make his punctuality to the count's orders appear in leſs infamous and horrid colours. Now, ſhould this man be ſtill kept by D'Ollifont as a ſpy upon the abbey, her brother's impetuoſity might cauſe him to throw himſelf in Father Peter's power, without firſt knowing either his character or inclination to ſerve them.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was perfectly convinced theſe conſiderations were juſt, and wiſhed to procure herſelf an explanation from the hermit: but to viſit him alone, undiſcovered, was an expedient ſhe was entirely ignorant how to contrive any means to effect: yet it was actually neceſſary Father Peter ſhould be conſulted, and that immediately.</p>
                     <p>After ſome ſtudy a thought ſtruck her that ſhe might ſee him at night, after her brother, Leonard, and Agnes, had retired to reſt; but then ſhe ſhrunk from the idea of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cave at ſo late an hour. Second reflection, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeemed to tell her ſhe had nothing to fear; and that would be the only method ſhe could take to obtain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview without the knowledge of any other perſon. At length ſhe came to a determination to try her project the following night; and by the time this reſolution was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, day-light darted through the caſement of her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſeemed to enliven nature with its cheering rays.</p>
                     <p>She had not yet heard Alfred enter his room: but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe had looked towards the weſt tower, as ſhe had done ſeveral times in the courſe of the night, the light
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035833_0219_10093E42DB59FFB8"/>
ſeemed to continue in the ſame place. This trifling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation gave her ſome degree of comfort, as ſhe ſuppoſed every thing remained quiet.</p>
                     <p>Some little time after, ſhe heard Alfred open his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door, and ſpeak to Leonard. Matilda felt conſiderable happineſs at his ſafety, and, as ſhe was now perfectly ſatisfied in that reſpect, ſhe deſired Agnes, when ſhe aroſe, not to wait breakfaſt for her; as, having received but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſt during the night, ſhe intended now to compoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſleep.</p>
                     <p>She aroſe at a late hour, and found her brother, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, and Agnes, in the parlour. The former was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and though his countenance was extremely pale, yet ſhe thought ſhe could perceive an inward ſatisfaction and ſerenity ſhe had lately been ſeldom witneſs to.</p>
                     <p>Alfred ſoon requeſted to ſpeak with her alone, and, with conſiderable eagerneſs, aſked her if ſhe had found any thing of conſequence in the cabinet. Matilda acquainted him with every article, except the manuſcript; he ſeemed in ſome meaſure diſappointed, but ſhowed great pleaſure at the idea of the money.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was rather ſurpriſed. "That money," ſaid ſhe, "Alfred, we have no right to; nor do I know, in our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it would be of any material ſervice, were it our own."</p>
                     <p>"We muſt at all events make free with it, Matilda; I have the ſtrongeſt reaſon to ſuppoſe that it does belong to us; and beſides we are now in the greateſt want of it."</p>
                     <p>"How ſo?" replied his ſiſter, ſtill more aſtoniſhed. "You told me the other day we had enough to ſupport us for ſome time at leaſt."</p>
                     <p>"True," anſwered Alfred: "but I have now other uſes for wealth; in ſhort, Matilda, this night had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035833_0220_10093E8E05C52C40"/>
to me circumſtances of a moſt wonderful nature; and the horrid myſtery of this dreadful abbey is at length unravelled. Perhaps we may remain here a ſhort time longer: but I hope you will ſoon ſee theſe gloomy ſcenes of adverſity and ſorrow transformed to days and years of tranquillity, happineſs and comfort."</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſtood the image of amazement; and for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe thought her brother inſane; but the glow of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which overſpread his face confirmed that his words were true; and his features once more appeared the ſame, as when in former times ſhe had ſeen him, with his own hands, relieve the ſhivering, famiſhed, beggar, and, his countenance glowing with compaſſion and benevolence, watch the poor wretch recover vital warmth and ſtrength from the nouriſhment he had adminiſtered. Matilda catched the heart-felt joy; but on her it took a different effect, and ſhe burſt into tears. Nor was Agnes's joy leſs, when ſhe was informed of the good intelligence. She wept with pleaſure at the idea of leaving the abbey, and ſtill remaining with her dear young lady.</p>
                     <p>The good old Leonard too was ſeen to wipe his eyes, and heave a ſigh of ecſtacy, at this unexpected turn of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, however, would give no ſatisfactory anſwer to their inquiries concerning what he had ſeen in the weſt tower: he only told them that the abbey muſt be ſtill their habitation for a ſhort period; but the time would paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with far more comfort than it had hitherto done.</p>
                     <p>Dinner-time arrived: but the intelligence had cloyed every appetite; and it was removed almoſt without being taſted. Alfred, about half an hour after, left the abbey, and ſaid he ſhould return towards evening.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:035833_0221_10093E446376B470"/>
Matilda had now time to conſider whether, after what ſhe had heard, it would be proper to conceal the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript from her brother; and, though many reaſons promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to give it to him immediately, yet a little reflection told her that the ſame ill conſequence ſhe had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, might ariſe from it. He might not yet be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſufferings of his father, nor with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the hermit had of his diſtreſs and death. In ſhort, ſhe reſolved to act as ſhe had before determined, and pay Father Peter a viſit at midnight. But ſhe wiſhed not to leave Agnes without ſpeaking; an excuſe might ſerve, that ſhe had left ſome books in the parlour which ſhe wiſhed to look over, and which might take her ſome time to procure.</p>
                     <p>Alfred returned at the time he mentioned, and informed them he did not intend to watch in the tower that night. The evening was ſpent with ſome degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and at an early hour they retired to reſt. Agnes was ſoon aſleep, and Matilda read till near midnight. During that time ſhe often looked at the caſement of the weſt tower, but no light nor figure appeared. Having awaked Agnes, ſhe informed her ſhe was going to look for a book ſhe had left in the parlour. Agnes did not by any means like the idea of being left alone in the chamber; but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda reminded her that her brother and Leonard were within call, in the next room; but ſhe requeſted her to make no noiſe without there was actually a neceſſity. She waited a little time, and had the pleaſure to find Agnes aſleep before ſhe left the apartment.</p>
                     <p>Matilda took the lamp, and, having ſoftly deſcended the great ſtairs, proceeded through the hall, and from that to the firſt court, which ſoon, brought her to the outer one.</p>
                     <p>She now began to tremble and feel her ſituation. To be entirely alone at ſuch an hour of the night, was an idea
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035833_0222_10093E8F8C71B310"/>
in many reſpects terrific. The pale and half-obſcured moon gave but an imperfect light; and that light was often eclipſed by dark, heavy clouds, which ſeemed to riſe from the ſouth, and form a gloomy mountain of dark miſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the weſt; while vivid flaſhes of lightning darted from the hoizon, and illumined the gathered clouds on the ſouth with uncommon ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Matilda viewed the awful ſcene with emotion, and was ſeveral times going to turn back; but ſhe chid herſelf for want of fortitude, and attempted to laugh at thoſe fears which now almoſt prevented her from ſupporting herſelf.</p>
                     <p>She had, however, arrived nearly half way to the cave, when a ſound of human voices ſtruck her ear at ſome diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Matilda liſtened—thought it might only be a ſoft breeze which waved the thick groves of cypreſs that ſurrounded her. But ſhe heard it again, and was convinced ſhe was right: it ſeemed like a chorus, or the chanting of a fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hymn for the ſoul of a deceaſed perſon.</p>
                     <p>She ſtopped, and leaning againſt a broken pedeſtal which had formerly borne a ſtatue, liſtened with ſome degree of pleaſure to the ſolemn dirge. But the voices ſeemed now to approach much nearer; and ſhe perceived a glare of light at ſome diſtance above the foliage, which informed her the perſons whom ſhe had heard were near. Terror at being diſcovered, now overcame every other conſideration, and with eager eye ſhe ſcrutiniſed each ſide of the grove, to find a place of concealment. At length ſhe fortunately found a ſmall opening in one part, which, by putting back the boughs, with ſome little trouble, admitted and cloſed her from view. She now conceived herſelf to be ſafe from obſervation, though there was a part through which ſhe could plainly diſcover whatever paſſed on the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:035833_0223_10093E4A15F765D8"/>
Five minutes did not elapſe before a proceſſion of men entered the path, ſtill ſinging in the ſame ſolemn manner. A prieſt of holy orders proceeded firſt; but how greatly was ſhe aſtoniſhed to ſee him followed by about twelve men, who had every appearance of banditti in dreſs and figure! The firſt ſix carried torches; the other half follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, with ſlow and melancholy ſteps. Theſe were ſucceeded by ſix more, bearing a coffin on their ſhoulders, which was covered with a black velvet pall, and adorned with trophies.</p>
                     <p>Matilda could hardly ſuppoſe herſelf awake; yet by the pale moon every figure ſeemed perfect, and ſhe thought ſhe could, in the faces of the laſt four, diſcover the viſitors to the abbey on a former night. The whole company halted at the pedeſtal, when, to the amazement of Matilda, two of them removed a large ſtone, which formed the cap, and part of a Corinthian baſe. The pedeſtal then parted, and was let down, which diſcovered the entrance to a large vault. The funeral ſervice was then read by the prieſt, who walked firſt, after which the coffin was carried down by four of the bearers. Another dirge was then ſung, and the pedeſtal was cloſed, the cap, &amp;c. being replaced. The proceſſion having turned, proceeded back in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, till ſhe loſt ſight of them at the extremity of the grove.</p>
                     <p>Though elated at the idea of having eſcaped diſcovery, ſhe felt conſiderable awe at the ſolemn ſcene. In ſhort, the ſight of this midnight funeral, added to the ſtrange dreſſes of the mourners, impreſſed on her mind a degree of terror which ſhe was unable to overcome. Having left her ſecret place of retirement, ſhe paſſed haſtily the ſtrange ſepulchre, and, with burried and trembling ſteps, breathleſs with agitation, arrived a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035833_0224_10093E9434F71500"/>
at his midnight devotions. His aged, reverend figure was in the ſame poſture as when they firſt diſcovered him; and his crucifix, books, and hour-glaſs, as uſual, ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>

But while ſhe was contemplating his aged form, bent on the earth, his hands claſped, and eyes lifted towards heaven with a fervency of devotion ſhe had hardly ever obſerved, ideas ſtruck her that by no means contributed to inſpire that fortitude ſhe ſo much wiſhed at this critical hour to poſſeſs.</p>
                     <p>That very figure which ſhe now ſo much admired, nay almoſt revered and loved, might have been an aſſiſtant in taking away the life of her father!—and thoſe very hands which ſhe ſaw extended in the pious action of prayer, might have inflicted tortures on her parent!</p>
                     <p>"Horrid ideas!—uncharitable conſideration!" exclaimed a voice which ſeemed to paſs by her in a whiſper.</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſtarted at the rebuke: but ſhe had not even breathed her thoughts: ſhe was therefore certain it muſt be ſomething more than mortal. Heaven itſelf had chid her for the ſuppoſition.</p>
                     <p>Trembling at the thought, ſhe ſupported herſelf, againſt the ſide of the cave, and ſtood an object of diſtreſs and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. At length, being in ſome degree recovered, ſhe ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward, and gaſping with anxiety, appeared before the aſtoniſhed hermit. His ſurpriſe may be well conceived;

                        </gap> buſineſs at this unuſual hour. Matilda had now partly recovered her ſcattered ſenſes, and, with a dignity and fortitude of air peculiar to herſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted his pardon for diſturbing him at his devotions, and then begged him to liſten with attention to a few circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhe had to relate.</p>
                     <p>Father Peter looked at her with a piercing eye. Both being ſeated, and the hermit having trimmed his lamp, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda thus addreſſed him:</p>
                     <p>"Picture to yourſelf, father, a daughter, who never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the embrace of paternal love, but who was yet taught to revere the name of a parent, though her eyes were never bleſſed with one glance of rapture on his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                     <p>"Brought up with all the tenderneſs a fond mother can conceive for her fatherleſs children, their unprotected ſtate ſtill more endearing them to her maternal boſom, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> but little the loſs ſhe had ſuſtained, in the comfort and happineſs of this remaining tie of duty and parental affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now then," continued Matilda, burſting into tears, "change this ſcene of earthly bliſs, and obſerve her on the couch of ſickneſs, claſping the hand of her child with looks—Oh! merciful God! ſuch looks as I cannot deſcribe, nor you conceive."</p>
                     <p>She turned towards her aged auditor: the drops of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy trickled down his faded cheeks, while he begged her to be compoſed, and continue her narrative.</p>
                     <p>"Her countenance, raiſed towards heaven, brightened at the very thought of thoſe glorious realms; and a chriſtian's expectation beamed in her eye; yet when ſhe turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her daughter, tears would again burſt forth, and ſhe would claſp to her heaving breaſt the weeping child, as if
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035833_0226_10093E96CB97F4E0"/>
afraid to leave her in a world encircled with horrid guilt, and eternal deſtruction. She doubted not the goodneſs of her God; her faith was great, but yet her feelings could not be ſubdued. She died; and, if a good life procures a place of grace, wafted by heavenly angels, ſhe reached the boſom of a merciful Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>"Now, father, behold the clouds of adverſity gathering over the heads of her offspring; the brother petitions a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relation of his mother to receive a ſiſter to his care, for no pecuniary advantage, but to ſhield her from inſults to which her age and ſex, added to the unprotected ſtate ſhe was left in, every day ſubjected her. The only anſwer they obtain is a direct denial from an artful prieſt, who by his perfidious arguments had poiſoned his patron's mind againſt the childrer of a daughter whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forſaken when he had no adviſe but a bad heart.</p>
                     <p>"They leave their native country, to accept the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a diſtant relation in a foreign clime, where an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum was yet hoped to be gained for the female wanderer, while her brother fought againſt the enemies of his country. Arrived at the principal city of England, they are plunged into diſſipation, ſurrounded by temptation, and forſaken by thoſe who ſhould have protected them againſt oppreſſion. Picture to yourſelf a villain, a daſtardly villain, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the neglect ſhown to the female relation of his friend, and at a moment when he thought himſelf free from moleſtation employing even force to cruſh her to the earth, and blaſt her future days with ſhame and ſorrow never to be eraſed. Her brother, witneſs to the ſufferings and uſage of a ſiſter, who, he knew, had no other friend to guard her from a wretch unworthy to bear the image of his creator, ſeizes the villain, who attempts to take his life; but the raſh, though, excuſable, injured youth ſtrikes him ſo the

ground, weltering in his blood, and momentarily, expecting to pay that debt of nature, at the receival of which he had nothing to hope, but much to fear. They fly from the laws of England, return to their native land, ſhrinking from notice, fearful that the power of their oppreſſor may overtake them even there. Another heavy misfortune now ſurrounds them; through the curſed contrivance of their enemies, the young officer is proved a deſerter, by not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to an order which was ſent to him the night he left London, and of which conſequently he was entirely ignorant. By the death of him whom he had wounded, it is rendered impoſſible for him to clear himſelf of this ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. Concealed in a deſolate habitation, they diſcover the murder—ah! and the murderer, of their father."</p>
                     <p>Matilda turned towards the hermit. His colour changed, and he gazed at her with ſilent awe and aſtoniſhment.</p>
                     <p>She continued—"Yet a witneſs muſt be ſound to authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticate the horrid deed, and give juſtice to the children of the deceaſed."</p>
                     <p>"And is ſuch a perſon living?" aſked father Peter.</p>
                     <p>"He is," returned Matilda.—"Were you in his ſituation, would you not promote that juſtice which God and nature require? or would you ſtill ſcreen the wretch, and ſuffer the innocent victims of his cruelty to languiſh in diſtreſs and affliction?"</p>
                     <p>"Surely you cannot doubt my anſwer," ſaid the hermit. "I would even part with life itſelf to procure juſtice for the ſufferers you mention."</p>
                     <p>"There is no need of ſuch a ſacrifice," anſwered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda. "But now, father, I put your virtue to the trial. I come to demand reparation for the murder of a father, and that father the rightful heir of Orlando count Maſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:035833_0228_10093E9854A3E3C8"/>
Father Peter, though in a great degree aſtoniſhed, was not actually ſo ſurpriſed as might have been expected. He aſked an explanation.</p>
                     <p>"The account is brief. In ſhort, Percival Maſerini was a priſoner in yonder abbey: yon pitied him, yet were privy to the deed."</p>
                     <p>Father Peter ſeemed at a loſs to reply. At length he told her that at an early hour he would wait on her at the abbey.</p>
                     <p>"You know my reſidence then?" ſaid Matilda.</p>
                     <p>"Perfectly," anſwered he. "Believe me, you ſhall have no cauſe to repent this viſit; and give me leave to foretel that the brighteſt ſcenes of happineſs, with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's permiſſion, now await you."</p>
                     <p>"There is comfort in your words, father," anſwered Matilda: "heaven ſend they may prove true! But the clouds of adverſity have ſo long eclipſed the cheering rays of hope, that I hardly feel myſelf able to admit them to my breaſt."</p>
                     <p>Father Peter wiſhed to ſee Matilda to the abbey-gates: but ſhe poſitively refuſed his offer, and parted with him at the entrance of the cave.</p>
                     <p>The idea of the funeral again entered her imagination; and ſhe felt a kind of dread at paſſing the ſepulchre, which almoſt made her repent that ſhe had refuſed the good old man's attendance.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had arrived within a few yards of it, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a glare of light which ſeemed to ſpread around the part, and ſoon obſerved ſeveral torches, the ſame as ſhe had before ſeen, ſtuck in the ground: the pedeſtal was alſo parted, and laid on the earth.</p>
                     <p>Matilda's agitation and ſurpriſe was greater than before; and ſhe ſtopped unable to reſolve whether to paſs quickly
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035833_0229_10093EDEDCE57DD0"/>
by or remain where ſhe was. While in this ſtate of ſuſpenſe, ſhe ſaw two men aſcend from the vault, followed by a third whoſe figure excited in her ſtill greater aſtoniſhment. He was elegantly formed, and his clothes were entirely of the Engliſh faſhion, but ſeemed ſtrangely put on: his hair was diſhevelled, and his whole frame ſeemed greatly diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>After ſome little time they cloſed the pedeſtal, and, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the torches, took that path which immediately led to the abbey.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was again at a loſs in what manner to act; but followed them, though at a diſtance, with flow and cautious ſteps. At length ſhe traced them to the gates of the abbey. Here they halted; and Matilda, with a palpitating heart, ſtopped alſo to obſerve their motions.</p>
                     <p>They continued in converſation ſome little time, when, to her amazement, they opened the outer gates, and entered.</p>
                     <p>Matilda, ſtill more alarmed, proceeded on, and ventured to paſs into the firſt court: ſhe here perceived no one; but having entered the hall, ſhe thought ſhe heard voices in the parlour. Nor was her conjecture wrong: for having half aſcended the great ſtairs, ſhe liſtened for a moment, and heard a converſation carried on, though in a very low tone: ſhe however could plainly diſcover the ſpeech of Leonard and her brother; her fears therefore of a diſcovery being at an end, her curioſity did not prompt her to ſtay any longer, being much fatigued, and in want of reſt. She therefore directly proceeded to her chamber, and was happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"FATHER of light! Almighty God Supreme, who, with an all-ſeeing eye, ſurveyeſt the tranſactions of thy creatures here on earth, look down on one unworthy of thy goodneſs, though humbly ſoliciting thy aid—who craves thy ſupport to ſee thoſe myſteries explained, the elucida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which may ſtrike her ſoul with horror; but let thy heavenly aſſiſtance inſpire her with fortitude and reſignation, to liſten to the dictates of thy will!"</p>
                     <p>Such was the concluſion of Matilda's prayer, as ſhe retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her pillow.</p>
                     <p>She enjoyed a calm and ſerene repoſe till a late hour in the morning, and found herſelf much refreſhed. Having deſcended to the parlour, neither Leonard, Agnes, nor her brother, had breakfaſted.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry" ſaid ſhe, "to have made you wait: but this morning I have been uncommonly lazy."</p>
                     <p>"We have not waited for you alone," anſwered Alfred cheerfully: "there is another perſon our gueſt to-day. In ſhort, you no doubt recollect that, when you mentioned leaving the abbey, I told you a ſtranger would ſoon appear, to make you alter your reſolution. The time is now arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035833_0231_10093EE1B92132C8"/>
that my prophecy is to be fulfilled, and the myſterious behaviour I have been guilty of, I hope, in ſome meaſure excuſed. Look at thoſe folding doors, Matilda: the ſight of them has at a former time occaſioned ſenſations of the utmoſt terror: do not, therefore, expect the entrance of a ghoſt, but a being of fleſh and blood.—Come forth!" cried he.</p>
                     <p>Matilda expected to ſee the venerable figure of father Peter.</p>
                     <p>The doors haſtily flew open, when, inſtead of the aged ſage, an elegant young man ſprang forth, and caught her in his arms. Matilda ſtarted back, and inſtantly exclaimed, "Mr. Milverne!</p>
                     <p>"Not ſo," ſaid Alfred: "he does, I muſt confeſs, greatly reſemble that gentleman; but you now ſee before you Archibald lord Milverne."</p>
                     <p>"Do not believe him, charming miſs Maſerini," anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtranger. "I deny the title; let me only be known to you under the plain name of Milverne—happy appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under which I firſt became acquainted with the moſt charming of her ſex!"</p>
                     <p>Matilda was above the little arts of female coquetry, practiſed by the ſex in general; ſhe did not diſcourage either his lordſhip's hopes or addreſſes; and, after ſome little time ſpent in mutual inquiries, they ſeated themſelves at the breakfaſt-table.</p>
                     <p>Leonard and Agnes wiſhed to have taken their meal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, out of reſpect to lord Milverne; but his noble ſoul ſcorned the empty title he poſſeſſed, and conſidered it of no other conſequence than a more than uſual call upon him to act through life with honour and integrity, as an example to thoſe in a lower ſphere, who had never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the advantages of a good education, or the rudiments of virtue from honeſt and reſpectable parents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:035833_0232_10093E9C9AAA4B40"/>
He inſiſted that no unuſual ceremony ſhould be obſerved on his account; and his requeſt was complied with. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda received the pleaſing intelligence that count D'Olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font was yet living, and that the news they had received of his death was merely of his own contrivance, executed by his creatures in France; and that there was not a doubt but the cruel proceeding of proving Alfred Maſerini a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter, was alſo effected by ſchemes of villany from the ſame quarter.</p>
                     <p>Lord Milverne acquainted them that the laſt intelligence he received of the count, was, that he had been ſome little time at Paris, but that his popularity in that city was greatly decreaſed, on the diſcovery of an aſſaſſination he was proved to be the author of, and which he muſt certainly have ſuffered for, had he not been ſcreened by royal power.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall now," continued his lordſhip, "acquaint you with my adventures ſince you left England, till a certain event happened, which will cloſe my narrative, and give room for one to be related by my friend here" (pointing to Alfred) "who will then have an opportunity of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his own conduct ſo as entirely to obliterate every ſuſpicion of unkindneſs to a ſiſter who has ſhown the moſt noble heart and affection for her brother, in her forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and generous behaviour through his misfortune."</p>
                     <p>Here he bowed to Matilda.</p>
                     <p>"On the night of the maſquerade I had not long forced Mr. Maſerini into the coach, when a crowd of people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aſſemble, collected by the repeated cries of murder, from the count's ſervants, who kept me in hold. I was immediately delivered into the hands of the watchmen and two conſtables, who had by this time arrived, charged with having favoured the eſcape of the murderer. I was

directly taken to a watch-houſe near, but was ſoon admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to find bail for my appearance, when they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed who I was.</p>
                     <p>"The next morning I appeared before a magiſtrate: my perſon and name were ſoon recogniſed by that gentleman, who had been acquainted with my family. To him, and the perſons aſſembled, I related the whole affair, and made it clear that the ſecond piſtol was fired fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> defence, as the count firſt diſcharged his. In ſhort, D'Ollifont's conduct appeared in the moſt black and infamous colours, and I was honourably diſcharged. He continued for ſome time in a dangerous ſtate: at times he was inſane; and when thoſe fits came on, it was his deſire, in his lucid intervals, that no one ſhould attend him but his confidential ſervant and ſteward, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"The news of this ſhameful, ungenerous tranſaction of the count's was the general talk of the town; and moſt people allowed that puniſhment had fallen on the right perſon.</p>
                     <p>"As ſoon as I had ſettled ſome buſineſs of conſequence in London, I immediately ſet off for France, on my way towards Italy; two ſtrong reaſons urging me to take the journey—one to ſee a dying father, who I underſtood by letters laboured under a ſevere indiſpoſition which increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him daily;—the other, the hopes of finding ſome exiled friends, whoſe ſituation I greatly pitied and lamented.</p>
                     <p>"The firſt news I heard when I arrived at Paris, was the death of my parent, and that Mr. Maſerini was declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deſerter, for not attending to an order left at his lodgings the very night he departed from London. I made it my buſineſs to obtain an immediate audience with two of his majeſty's miniſters; and though I clearly explained the miſtake, was unable to procure any redreſs. It was
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035833_0234_10093EA086D26238"/>
an order (they ſaid) by the royal command, and could not be reſcinded.</p>
                     <p>"Finding it was in vain to take any more trouble at court, I proceeded directly towards the Alps, and ſtopped at the very houſe where lady Caroline Albourne had been ſaved from the fire, as I ſuppoſed by you. I immediately croſſed the mountains, and ſoon found myſelf in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I directly proceeded to the reſidence of my late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was now inhabited by a friend who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him hither, and his domeſtics.

This, however, I conſidered as the effect of the hurry and diſtreſs you were then in. An idea at laſt ſtruck me, that I had heard ſay Graſville Abbey was the reſidence of your anceſtors.

It grew dark; but I reſolved to ſee the external part before I ſtept: we at length entered the thick wood on the left ſide of the building. Its lofty towers began to appear above the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, dark foliage, and the riſing moon ſhone in full ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour on its grey, decayed walls. I ſtood ſtill for ſome
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035833_0235_10093EEA097F1F30"/>
time to admire the awful and beautiful ſcene before me: after which I reſolved to have a nearer view of the abbey. My ſervant now attempted to diſſuade me from my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution."</p>
                     <p>"My lord," ſaid he, 'we were told at the inn we laſt ſtopped at that this wood was infeſted by banditti:—for heaven's ſake do not venture farther.'</p>
                     <p>"I laughed at the poor fellow's fears, and conſidered the report as merely the conſequence of no perſon daring to go near the abbey. I therefore inſiſted on riding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and we proceeded into the very heart of the wood, when I began to be rather alarmed myſelf: for the moon being obſcured by heavy clouds, its intricacies became ſo great, that I could not find the path we had firſt followed.</p>
                     <p>"We had not continued in this ſituation above a quarter of an hour, when we perceived two men approach, whoſe appearance gave ſome reaſons for apprehenſion. They were armed, and we alſo had weapons of defence. At length they accoſted us; and by the manner of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, we found they were robbers. Having aſked a few frivolous queſtions, they began to uſe rough language, and told us we muſt go no further, for that we were their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. But our number being equal, I reſolved not tamely to ſubmit; and giving my man the hint, he engaged with one, while I undertook the other. Each of the party fired a piſtol, but not one fell; when one of the men whiſtled aloud, and in leſs than three minutes we were ſurrounded by a party of the banditti. Having diſarmed us, and taken all our money, they led us in a kind of triumph ſtill further into the wood, till we arrived at the opening of a large cave.</p>
                     <p>"The robbers having knocked at a heavy door almoſt concealed by trees, it was opened by a youth, ſeemingly
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035833_0236_10093EA555F7AC28"/>
not above fourteen, who conducted us, by the light of a lamp, down a ſteep deſcent, which gradually became wider, and terminated in a large ſpace partitioned into ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. In one of the largeſt a cloth was ſpread for ſupper, and an elderly man ſtood cooking of it in another room. 'Joſcelin,' ſaid the leader of the party, 'ſecure theſe priſoners; but mind that they are uſed well, and give them a hot ſupper.' 'Signor,' continued he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, 'your ſituation is not ſo bad as you may ſuppoſe: if you are not refractory, we ſhall be moderate.' Joſcelin conducted us to the further part of the cave, and placed us in a ſmall but clean chamber, in which was a good bed. Felix, my ſervant, now began to rub his hands with pleaſure, and ſtrove to communicate that comfort to me which he derived from the idea of having a good lodging and ſupper, inſtead of a ſpeedy death. But my diſtreſs was not ſo eaſily to be alleviated. I was now confined, I knew not for how long, from the ſight of all I held moſt dear;" (His lordſhip here looked moſt tenderly at Matilda) "and I conſidered that death itſelf would have been more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come than ſuch an untimely delay. I could, however, blame nothing but my own raſhneſs, and conſequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſupport my miſchance with as much philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>"Supper was brought us, and, although I had no appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, I taſted of it: But Felix took care to make up for my deficiency in point of eating.</p>
                     <p>"I had but little ſleep that night, and roſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very unwell. Breakfaſt was brought us early; and while I was expecting what would be the iſſue of this ſtrange treatment from men whoſe behaviour I expected to find quite different, our attendant, after a few hems, thus addreſſed us.</p>

"As you are two perſons whoſe courage and manners I much admire, I ſhall entirely deviate from the regular rules of our ſociety, and even put myſelf in your power, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting you with circumſtances, which were it known I related, death muſt be my reward.'</p>
                     <p>"Having thanked him as well as my ſurpriſe would let me, he continued:</p>
                     <p>"One moon has nearly paſſed, ſince we loſt two brothers of our order, which accordingly now wants that number to make it complete. It is our uſual cuſtom, after ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, to ſeize on the firſt travellers who fall in our way; and that lot has happened to you; and you are in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence now treated in our cuſtomary manner, which I am ſure you have no reaſon to complain of. An offer is always made to the perſons thus taken, to accept the vacant places of our ſociety, and live with us after the uſual method of the brotherhood. You will both of you ſhortly receive ſuch propoſals: and though no compulſion may appear in them, yet, mark me, certain death is the conſequence of a refuſal. We never chuſe to enter any one actually againſt his will, as treachery may be the reſult of ſuch a choice. If it is therefore found that your inclinations are not agreeable to our wiſhes, you are both certain to fall victims. Do not diſcover the information I have given you of our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as in that caſe I muſt, as I before told you, become a ſacrifice to my good-will to you. Be cautious, therefore; maturely deliberate on your ſituation; profit by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I have communicated; nor idly throw away your lives, when you have it in your power to preſerve them.'</p>
                     <p>"Picture to yourſelves my ſituation, after having heard the information of the friendly robber; forced, as I may ſay, either to follow a life of depredation and villany, or fall a ſacrifice to a ſet of wretches, who, I had now every

reaſon to ſuppoſe, were deſtitute of even the common feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of humanity. I had hardly time for this reflection, before the captain of the banditti entered, and preſented me with the propoſals, the contents of which I knew too well; and, having deſired me to peruſe them, left us alone, yet not without mentioning that he ſhould call again in the evening to receive our anſwers to the offers which we ſhould find ſet before us.</p>
                     <p>"I was unable to read the deteſted paper; but after ſome little time Felix rehearſed it aloud, and I liſtened with attention. It declared that we ſhould ſhare equally in the profits ariſing from adventures, though every one muſt take his ſhare in the danger, and pay implicit obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the captain or leader of the company.</p>
                     <p>"Never," I exclaimed, "will I ſubmit to the infamous meaſures of this ſhameful crew; inſtantaneous death is far preferable to the languiſhing life of miſery I muſt here endure, fruſtrated in all thoſe ſchemes of happineſs I had planned to enjoy within a few weeks.'</p>
                     <p>"Alas! ſir,' anſwered Felix, 'I have always been taught, that diſappointments are for our good: and if we really conſider them as the acts of a Supreme Being, how can they be bad? Why ſhould we then throw away our lives, and yield them up to men whom we deſpiſe, when we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by retaining them, recover our liberties, with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I muſt confeſs, the argument of the poor humble Felix brought a bluſh into the face of his maſter. 'That man,' thought I, 'without the advantages of a refined or liberal education, can give inſtruction to me, who have had every advantage in point of learning; as well as an example, to teach me fortitude, philoſophy, and reſignation to the divine will.' His words made ſuch an impreſſion on
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035833_0239_10093EEE21DBA210"/>
my diſordered imagination, that I reſolved at once to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the terms of the banditti, in ſuch a manner as ſhould give them no room to doubt of my attachment to their cauſe; as in this caſe more opportunities might offer, to releaſe us from ſo horrid a confinement. The captain at night again viſited us: and both Felix and myſelf teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the greateſt happineſs to accept of the offer; and the better to give reaſons for our readineſs to comply, we gave him to underſtand we were men of deſperate character, who knew no way of living, but by the aid of the riches of others: 'and for thoſe purpoſes,' ſaid I, 'we take it by turns to act as ſervant, and through this means have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed many ſchemes productive of profit, which at ſome other time I will relate to you.' Garbardo (for that was the leader's name) ſeemed highly pleaſed with our willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the account we gave him of our characters; in ſhort, he determined that we ſhould be entered into the order that very evening. Accordingly, the whole party were called to aſſemble; and, after undergoing the uſual forms, we received the dreſs and arms of the two deceaſed robbers; we were then congratulated, under the feigned names we had given them, as brothers of the ſociety.</p>
                     <p>"We ſoon found the good effects of conforming to their will with a ſeeming degree of pleaſure; for they ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed from their uſual methods, as to permit us to ſleep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. One rule, however, they ſtrictly adhered to; for we were not ſuffered to go out of the cave together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion, and were given to underſtand that he who remained behind was a kind of hoſtage for the other.</p>
                     <p>"It was a general cuſtom for three to go together to purchaſe proviſion, which was procured from a man who kept a kind of ſhop on the ſkirts of the wood. He was well acquainted with the gang, and proved grateful for their
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035833_0240_10093EA9AE845B10"/>
cuſtom, by providing them with the beſt food, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſituation an entire ſecret. The place was hardly ever intruded upon by any but the banditti: ſo retired was the ſpot where it ſtood.</p>
                     <p>"It came to Felix's turn to go firſt to the victualling booth; nothing, however, offered, to improve the liberty of leaving the cave; and he was accompanied by two ſtaunch friends to the ſociety. Nor did my journey prove more ſucceſsful; and I returned in ſome meaſure in deſpair of ever finding means to eſcape.</p>
                     <p>"Felix was again my comforter, and inſpired me with hopes that at another time we might meet with more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate circumſtances, which might enable us to obtain a releaſe from theſe heavy chains of ſlavery.</p>
                     <p>"The next day when Felix walked to the wood, he returned with a pleaſure in his countenance, which, I could plainly perceive, ſhowed he had met with ſome pleaſant adventure; nor was my conjecture wrong: for when I eagerly inquired of him, the firſt opportunity, if he had any good news, he informed me, to my great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was no other than that he had ſeen Leonard at the place where he had been. 'Nor did either of us,' continued Felix, 'fooliſhly diſcover our joy at meeting one another, as you might have ſuppoſed; but he, ſeeing in what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I was, acted with the greateſt caution. I, however, found means to whiſper to him, unſeen, that on ſuch a day he would ſee you at the ſame place.' This relation, though for the moment it inſpired me with a kind of joy, yet was but a poor preface to any ideas of liberty. I determined, however, to make the moſt of it; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, during the interval of time, I wrote, in a letter, a detail of the circumſtances that had involved me in a ſituation of which I gave the deſcription. This I ſealed
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035833_0241_10093EF239A13C20"/>
up, and put in my pocket, ready to ſlip into Leonard's hand, when I ſaw him.</p>
                     <p>"I viſited, as uſual, the place, attended by two men, and, in one corner of the ſhop, ſaw Leonard, as I expected. I found means to convey the paper unperceived into his hand, and thus returned with ſome degree of comfort to the cave.</p>
                     <p>"I muſt now," continued his lordſhip, "give up my narrative, and reſign, as I before informed you, the taſk to Mr. Maſerini."</p>

                     <p>TO lord Milverne's concluding words Alfred replied—"I own, my lord, I feel conſiderable pleaſure in undertaking the taſk you have impoſed on me, as I ſhall now have an opportunity of explaining to Matilda my reaſons for that myſterious behaviour which carried in it a ſtrong reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to unkindneſs, though I had her intereſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in view.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall therefore begin from the firſt appearance of that gloom and uneaſineſs which ſeemed almoſt to cruſh every pleaſing quality, and give a kind of moroſe turn to my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and manners, doubtleſs diſguſting.</p>
                     <p>"It was, I believe, the ſecond day after our arrival at the abbey, that Leonard was diſpatched to procure proviſion from the public market, and ſet off accordingly. At his return, you, no doubt, recollect, he deſired to ſpeak with me alone. The ſubject he had to communicate, was, his having ſeen Felix at the place where he had ſtopped which
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035833_0242_10093EAC54C63108"/>
was (as he deſcribed it) extremely retired, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuited well his purpoſe on that account. He gave a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the perſons who were with him, and of the dreſſes they wore, which confirmed them in my opinion to be banditti.</p>
                     <p>"What to make of this adventure, I knew not, and was ſtill more aſtoniſhed when Leonard informed me Felix had whiſpered in his ear, that, if he attended at the place the next day but one, he would ſee his maſter there. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, as you may ſuppoſe, cauſed in me the greateſt alarm for the fate of Mr. Milverne. By the accounts I had heard before of the banditti in theſe parts, I conjectured he was confined by them, as he really was. To the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſenſation which this information gave me before, the next moment was added another cauſe of horror, amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, I may ſay, diſtreſs. The caſement in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber above ſtands oppoſite my bed; as I lay upon it, I could plainly perceive part of the weſt lower, nor had I retired above an hour, before I obſerved a ſtrong light in one of the windows; and awaking Leonard, he plainly ſaw it as well as myſelf. I determined, however to mention no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this circumſtance, or that relative to Mr. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne; and he had my orders accordingly.</p>
                     <p>"Can you, Matilda, blame me for this ſecreſy? I well knew the ſituation of your heart, and was certain the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of either of theſe circumſtances muſt have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably heightened that anxiety and miſery which you then laboured under. This may account for my melancholy the next day. The uneaſineſs you no doubt obſerved, when you propoſed being of the party to ſearch the rooms in the weſt tower, and alſo on our conference together afterwards, when we conſulted how we ſhould act concerning Mr. Milverne, We alſo, after having retired to our chamber,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035833_0243_10093EF5C6A5CC28"/>
ſpent the beſt part of the night in converſation on that, and the light we had ſeen."</p>
                     <p>Matilda well recollected that night, which was the ſame when ſhe liſtened at her brother's chamber door, and was ſo alarmed at the incoherent ſentences ſhe heard. She forbore, however, to interrupt her brother.</p>
                     <p>"We alſo watched again for the light, and ſaw it; when, who can expreſs our aſtoniſhment at plainly perceiving a figure paſs backwards and forwards, which at laſt ſeemed to vaniſh with it?</p>
                     <p>"Leonard, according to the appointment he had received from Felix, ſet off again for the market, as we informed you, to procure wine, the bottles we had before being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken while he was gone. You queſtioned me on the ſtrange alteration in my ſpirits and behaviour, and wiſhed much to be acquainted with the cauſe of the change; which infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I refuſed, though I told you I had reaſons for the greateſt uneaſineſs.</p>
                     <p>"Leonard returned, and (as you no doubt well recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) with the news of count D'Ollifont's death, and the ſearch that was making after me, both in France and Italy. Leonard then aſked to ſpeak with me alone; he informed me he had really ſeen Mr. Milverne and two other perſons, all dreſſed in the ſame manner as the former ones, and that Mr. Milverne, had ſlipped a letter into his hand unperceived. This he gave to me, and I eagerly opened and read it. All my fears for Mr. Milverne were realiſed; and I four <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> his ſituation, by his own deſcription, to be juſt what I expected. In ſhort, this intelligence, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to what I had ſeen the night before—the idea of the count's death, and my own ſituation—drove me almoſt to diſtraction, as my behaviour plainly ſhowed. I drank freely at ſupper; and you muſt remember my frantic expreſſions,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035833_0244_10093EB026275198"/>
occaſioned by the fumes of wine, and a diſtreſſed ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                     <p>"We heard a groan from thoſe folding doors: I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ran to them: Leonard was unable to hold me back, but followed me. I puſhed them open, and ſaw, by the means of a flaſh of lightning, a figure, of a deadly pale, ſtand in the centre of the apartment. The ſight of it was but momentary; for all again being dark, except from the lights in this room, it ſeemed to vaniſh at the further end. Leonard, who was cloſe to me, likewiſe ſaw the ſame; and it was this which occaſioned thoſe exclamations of horror, which we thought your inſenſibility had prevented you from hearing.</p>
                     <p>"I found myſelf, however, greatly miſtaken, when Leonard informed me, the next day but one, that you had queſtioned him on the ſubject. I now told him, if you made any further inquiries, to ſay that I had given him poſitive orders to be ſilent on the topic. Lord Milverne had mentioned in his letter, that, through a fortunate and unforeſeen cirumſtance, Felix would be again at the ſame place the next day: he alſo hinted he had faint hopes of gaining over two of the banditti to his intereſt.</p>
                     <p>"Accordingly the following day, in the afternoon, the time appointed, Leonard ſet off, and found Felix, as he expected, with two others. They exchanged notes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being perceived; but Leonard could obſerve the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſhop, and the two men, by their looks, ſeemed to wonder at ſeeing him juſt at the time of their arrival. I had ordered him to read the letter before he returned to the abbey, that if it was neceſſary to procure any articles more than we had got, he might purchaſe them, and bring them with him: he did ſo, and they were carried uno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to my chamber. I was ſurpriſed to find a dark lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035833_0245_10093EF74EFB7300"/>
ſome wine, and eatables. The letter, however, which he gave me, ſoon explained this: his lordſhip informed me in it, that he had brought over two of the men entirely to his wiſhes, who had led that way of life but a ſhort time, and who entered into it as the only means to avoid ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Being informed by him, it was in his power to make them comfortable for life, could they aid his eſcape, they had both ſworn to ſerve him to the utmoſt of their power. He added, that one of theſe men and Felix would be at the abbey gates a little before midnight; Felix being, for the firſt time, ſuffered to go out in ſearch of adventures with this man. The meaning of this viſit was, to conſult on the moſt likely ſcheme of eſcaping from the robbers, as too frequent attendance at the market might excite their ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion.</p>
                     <p>"I muſt own I was not by any means pleaſed with this plan: I conſidered that theſe two men might act in this manner merely to fathom the inclinations of their new brother; and, in that caſe, our reſidence would be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the villains alſo. There was now, however, no alternative; and Leonard attended at the outſide gates exactly at the time."</p>
                     <p>Matilda here well recollected the ſurpriſe and terror ſhe had ſuffered at ſeeing them enter the court, while ſhe was watching for the light in the weſt tower.</p>
                     <p>"He having conducted them to the parlour, I deſcended; and we began a conſultation on the moſt probable means of effecting lord Milverne's eſcape from the banditti. Nothing that was propoſed ſeemed to carry with it hopes of ſucceſs owing to the vigilance of the robbers, who, as was before obſerved, detained one as a hoſtage for the return of the other. In ſhort, we were not able to come to any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and our little party broke up without having agreed
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035833_0246_10093EB1AD4EBD58"/>
on any plan whatever. Leonard again conducted them out of the abbey, and we retired to our beds.</p>
                     <p>"The following day but one, you queſtioned Leonard again; and, according to my orders, he gave no ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory anſwer, but was greatly ſupriſed to hear your deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of leaving the abbey. This he communicated to me; and you, no doubt, well remember our converſation on the ſubject, which ended with your conſenting to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a fortnight longer: and, if the myſteries were not explained in that interval, you were immediately to repair to the convent of N**** in France. I mentioned the appearance of another perſon, to make you alter your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, hoping by that time to have invented ſome contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for the releaſe of lord Milverne.</p>
                     <p>"Leonard had, during this time, brought me word that the ſame viſit would be repeated at the abbey again at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. They were punctual at the hour; and he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly conducted them to the parlour, where I again at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p>"The only method that could now be thought of, was by the application of an herb, which, if taken to a certain quantity, would oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This idea was ſuggeſted by Uloff, the robber who accompanied Felix. He obſerved the root might be eaſily procured, and that, by the help of a little art, and this properly applied, the robbers might be led to believe lord Milverne dead; which would at once effect his eſcape; for it was a general rule among the banditti, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one another immediately in a vault which ſtood near their cave—from which he might with eaſe extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the coffins never being faſtened down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:035833_0247_10093EFBD49BF0A0"/>
"Strange as this thought was, there ſeemed no other more likely to ſucceed; and I found that his lordſhip had agreed to carry this plan into execution, provided it met with our approbation, and Leonard could procure the herb.</p>
                     <p>"As Leonard was conducting them acroſs the court when leaving the abbey, the figure again appeared in the weſt tower; which greatly aſtoniſhed them all.</p>
                     <p>"The next morning you informed me of the human form and lamp which you had ſeen reflected in the glaſs that ſtood in your chamber. This account, added to the ſtrange voice which we both heard, made me reſolve to watch in the weſt tower; which I accordingly did.</p>
                     <p>"The ſame night, Felix and three others of the banditti (they having brought over one more to their intereſt) came to the abbey, unknown to either Leonard or me, to ſee if we had got the herb, as they were in hopes the next day to have a good opportunity of carrying their ſcheme into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. They knocked at the outer gate, then burſt it open, and proceeded directly to the parlour. Theſe were the perſons whom we miſtook for the officers of juſtice, as their arrival was entirely unexpected, and neither Leonard nor myſelf had a ſight of them. Their intentions, therefore, proved fruitleſs; and they left the abbey, unable to find us.</p>
                     <p>"The next day Leonard attended at the place of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, and found Felix, who communicated to him their adventures the night before; and, having given him the herb, Leonard underſtood they intended yeſterday for the trial of its effect.</p>
                     <p>"This was accordingly done; and by the effects of it, and the help of Felix and his aſſiſtants, his lordſhip was ſhown to the whole of the banditti, as a corpſe. A coffin was therefore prepared, and in the evening he was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035833_0248_10093EB4925AD270"/>
to the pedeſtal, and buried with the uſual ceremony; one of the robbers being habited like a monk."</p>
                     <p>The myſtery of the ſtrange funeral which Matilda ſaw was now entirely elucidated.—Her brother continued—</p>
                     <p>"After the interment, the company returned to the cave; but Felix and one of the robbers were fixed on to go in ſearch of adventures. They immediately, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the vault, and conducted lord Milverne here; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which both joined their comrades as uſual. But his lordſhip means to go to-day to a principal magiſtrate ſome few miles from hence, and give an account of theſe depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dators on the public. The whole of them will conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſeized: when Felix and the three converts to their cauſe will be ſelected from the banditti, and the remainder left to take the due courſe of the law."</p>
                     <p>Thus Alfred Maſerini ended his narrative. But, though Matilda had heard many circumſtances of a ſtrange nature explained, which had cauſed her conſiderable uneaſineſs, yet nothing had been ſaid to clear up, in a ſatisfactory manner, thoſe aſtoniſhing events which ſeemed in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to confirm the report of the abbey being haunted.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ideas had not croſſed her mind but a few minutes, before Alfred informed her that there was yet another tale to be related by one whom he expected every moment: "And I am certain," continued he, "that his ſtory will clear away every miſt of doubtful horror concerning this building, and obliterate every ſuperſtitious thought, by a clear elucidation of the myſteries that encompaſs it."</p>
                     <p>In about a quarter of an hour the folding doors again opened, and Father Peter ſtood before them. Agnes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, and even Leonard and lord Milverne, were aſtoniſhed how he could enter from that part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:035833_0249_10093EFE73AEE560"/>
"According to my promiſe laſt night," ſaid the hermit, addreſſing himſelf to Matilda, "I now, as you perceive, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you here, fair lady."</p>
                     <p>Alfred's countenance was now transformed to the gaze of ſurpriſe. "I find," ſaid he ſmiling to his ſiſter, "we have alſo to expect explanations from you, Matilda."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed," anſwered ſhe, "the taſk is ſoon performed."</p>
                     <p>She then related to them her finding the manuſcript, and her journey on that account to Father Peter's cave, with the reaſons for not giving it her brother the next morning.</p>
                     <p>Alfred's and the hermit's countenances glowed with pleaſure at the mention of ſuch a paper having been found.</p>
                     <p>"No doubt," exclaimed the latter, "this will be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal proof againſt the murderer of your father."</p>
                     <p>Matilda immediately produced it, and it was read by lord Milverne aloud. It is impoſſible to deſcribe the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Alfred Maſerini, as he liſtened to the diſtracted words of his wretched parent: ſuffice it to ſay, they were equal to his ſiſter's at her firſt peruſal of the parchment.</p>
                     <p>The party being in ſome meaſure compoſed, Father Peter was requeſted by Alfred to relate thoſe circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Graſville Abbey, which had for years occaſioned the moſt horrid reports to be ſpread, and worked with terrific ſenſations on the feelings even of thoſe whoſe good ſenſe had before taught them to deſpiſe every ſuperſtitious idea.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall, by your leave," anſwered the old man, "begin from the moſt early period of my life, and proceed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually through every event; which will all tend to now, that, however ſtrange the ways of Providence may appear to mortal eyes, yet in a due courſe of time they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <head>THE HERMIT'S TALE.</head>
                     <p>"BORN to a ſplendid fortune, and brought up in all the elegance of an Italian noble, I attained my nineteenth year. My father, the baron Sampieno, was adviſed to ſend me to Madrid, not only to finiſh a particular part of my education, but for change of air, my health being in that ſtate which gave them ſerious alarm.</p>
                     <p>"At the ſeminary to which I was ſent, another young Italian, of my own age, was alſo placed by his friends. His name was D'Ollifont: and our manners being greatly alike, gay, volatile, and diſſipated, it was not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, that a conſiderable intimacy took place between us:—in ſhort, we plunged together into every folly and vice which that gay and voluptuous city offered to our view; and, neither of us being under the ſtrict rules ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the general ſcholars, we had greater opportunities to follow every wild inclination, and gratify every wiſh we could form.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:035833_0251_10093F0123B87090"/>
"The conſequence of our raſh behaviour was, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the governor to each of our parents, which gave them the greateſt alarm and uneaſineſs—A conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able decreaſe was, in conſequence, made in our allowances, and a ſevere reprimand ſent us, for conduct which threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſome degree, to bring diſgrace on our family. The reproof, though to both exceedingly mortifying, was not ſo diſtreſſing to us as the curtailment of our ſalaries, which would prevent our appearing among the extravagant ſociety we had become acquainted with, as we muſt be ridiculed by thoſe who had more to expend in the luxuries of the place.</p>
                     <p>"As I was ſitting, the day after I had received this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from Italy, meditating on my uncomfortable ſituation, D'Ollifont entered, and told me of his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſimilar intelligence.</p>
                     <p>"Do not give way to deſpair,' ſaid he; 'but let us take ſome method to overcome the misfortune.'</p>
                     <p>"I at firſt conceived he intended to write conciliatory letters of repentance; and, I muſt own, my proud ſoul did not altogether approve ſuch a manner of proceeding; I therefore remained ſilent. But he ſoon convinced me I had miſtaken his ideas, by informing me, in plain terms, he intended to commence gambler, and perſuading me to follow the ſame courſe. 'I have not a doubt,' he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, 'but I ſhall amply make amends for what I have loſt in my quarterly allowance.'</p>
                     <p>"If I diſliked the idea of making conceſſion, how much more did I abhor the thought of entering into ſo mean and deſpicable a profeſſion as D'Ollifont had propoſed! I was, indeed, greatly ſhocked to find that he had ſuch intentions.—I expoſtulated with him, on the diſgrace, the infamy, of ſuch a character, and attempted, to the utmoſt of my
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035833_0252_10093EBAE8CE51D0"/>
ability, to paint in their true colours the mean and pitiful ſhifts they were obliged to have recourſe to on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I was, however, diſappointed in my endeavours to alarm his pride, and make him give up ſo diſgraceful a determination. In ſhort, we parted in enmity.</p>
                     <p>"He ſoon after began this direct courſe to deſtruction, and in a little time became connected with a gang who were well known for the defrauds of which they had been guilty. Neceſſity, for the ſake of my own reputation, now obliged me to ſhun one whoſe principles and morals were univerſally known and condemned. The ſacrifice was greater than I expected; but at length, with ſome reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I got the better of my feelings, and enjoyed conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable happineſs in the thought of the danger I had eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>"My diſpoſition became now more ſettled, and my manners entirely changed, from the wild career of youth to the more thoughtful deportment of manhood. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this alteration was a thorough reconciliation with my friends, and a greater ſupply of money than I had ever received before.</p>
                     <p>"It is from this only that I can account for the deadly hate which took poſſeſſion of D'Ollifont, againſt one whom he had at a former period called his friend, and who ſtill would have done any thing in his power to have reclaimed him from ſo contemptible a mode of living—which it might now be properly called; his father having died, and left him but a ſmall legacy: the bulk of his fortune he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of to a diſtant relation.</p>
                     <p>"Not long after this event, I had the misfortune to loſe my parent, and, by his death, found myſelf in poſſeſſion of his title, and the whole of his property, which amounted to a conſiderable ſum—there being no other children, and his wife having died when I was very young.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="unknown:035833_0253_10093F02A9FDE890"/>
"My affections had for ſome time been fixed on a lovely object, who had reſided with her mother, near the academy where I was placed Beauty was her leaſt ornament; an amiable diſpoſition, added to an excellent underſtanding, made her, in my eyes, an object worthy to be the wife of a man even in a higher ſituation than myſelf, though ſhe had no fortune.</p>
                     <p>"After an interval of a few months from my father's death, I had the exquiſite happineſs to receive my charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Caſſandra as my own. Spain was her native country; and, being unwilling to quit it, I reſolved to acquieſce with her deſire of ſettling there, as I had now no particular friends or relations in Italy. Seventeen years were ſpent in a round of happineſs, which no mortal could enjoy in a greater degree than myſelf. One girl and two boys were the fruits of our conſtant love; both of the latter died when infants, and the care of the education of the former was mine and my Caſſandra's chief employment. I need not tell you how we loved her—your own ideas muſt paint to you that affection which poſſeſſed our breaſts for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining pledge of our felicity—when we ſaw in her every grace, and every virtue which could adorn a female. Alas! thoſe ſcenes of bliſs were not to laſt for ever, but after this period were ſoon to be changed for miſery, anguiſh, and a ſeries of years clouded with glooms of ſorrow and adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never to be eraſed."</p>
                     <p>The hermit ſhed a few tears at the recollection, and was under the neceſſity of pauſing for ſome minutes, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"I had never ſeen D'Ollifont from ſome little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my marriage till the time I am ſpeaking of. An inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of near eighteen years had elapſed: but yet his features were well known to me, though the greateſt alteration was
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035833_0254_10093EBC6D0CF198"/>
viſible in his whole perſon. I now beheld him in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtreſs, having, as he ſaid, been obliged to fly from that part of Spain, where he had remained for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time in the utmoſt diſgrace, and in a ſtate little better than ſtarving. He related to me how truly he repented of the vicious life he had led, and that his only wiſh was now to procure, in ſome way, an honeſt ſubſiſtence by his own induſtry. I immediately offered him my houſe, as an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum for the preſent, which he thankfully received, and lived with us after the manner of my own family. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time he behaved in a moſt pleaſing and inſinuative manner to all; and there was not even one in the family but greatly reſpected and admired D'Ollifont.</p>
                     <p>"I rejoiced much in the reformation that had been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in him, and determined to ſpare no expenſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the procurement of an office for him, on the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments of which he might live comfortable and happy.</p>
                     <p>"Circumſtances continued in this ſituation for ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time; nor had any place become vacant, which I thought worthy to preſent to him: he, however, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in my houſe, and every day gained more general eſteem.</p>
                     <p>"One evening, having walked in my garden rather later than uſual, I cut acroſs an unfrequented path to my houſe: on one ſide of it was a thick grove of trees, the foliage of which entirely prevented any thing from being ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. It was a ſpot ſeldom intruded upon, inſomuch that in ſome parts it was nearly impaſſable. I had got about the middle of this place, when I heard D'Ollifont's voice mention with vehemence the name of my daughter. Though rather ſurpriſed at his manner, yet it awakened in me no ſuſpicion; and I was juſt going to hail him, when words of a dreadful nature caught my ear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="unknown:035833_0255_10093F0569B19D50"/>
"This night,' ſaid he to the perſon who was with him (a man of infamous character, and who had formerly been his ſervant) 'muſt ſhe be ſecured.—You are ſure you well know the place?'</p>
                     <p>"Oh!' returned the other, 'let me alone for that!—and, egad! you have found out an excellent ſpot; for, were the lady Lucretia's cries to be as loud as the town-bell, the devil take me if any one can hear her but thoſe who are with you! You will excuſe me though, ſignor: but I think your manner of proceeding is ridiculous: why not marry her? for then, ſome time or other, you may ſtand a chance to come in for ſome of the baron's money.'</p>
                     <p>"Curſes on himſelf and money!' exclaimed the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain: 'I could have plundered him of that long ago; but the loſs of it, as I told you before, would not make him half miſerable enough: it is revenge I thirſt for, not gain; nor have I ſo long played the hypocrite with him, but to invent ſome ſcheme that may at once blaſt his happineſs. My hatred commenced againſt him when he ſhrunk from the propoſals I made, and turned ſage moraliſt: but it has, if poſſible, increaſed tenfold ſince I have ſeen him flouriſh for years in proſperity and honour, while I am doomed to live on the narrow limits of a ſmall income. You may ſay he acts nobly now, and he has it in his power to be of conſiderable ſervice to me; but my proud ſoul is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burſt every hour I am looked at as a dependent on his bounty; and I am continually become more anxious to work his downfal.'</p>
                     <p>"I heard no more, but trembled with the emotions of horror and paſſion. A wretch, whom I had ſheltered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my roof with the trueſt friendſhip—to plan the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my child, was too much—I unfortunately had a loaded piſtol in my belt; and, having torn away the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035833_0256_10093EBF71845C70"/>
boughs which parted us, I ſtood before the aſtoniſhed rop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</p>
                     <p>"He trembled, and turned pale, as did Eburne, who was with him; but the recollection of the former ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, to invent one of the moſt damnable contrivances man could be the author of.</p>
                     <p>"Villain!' I exclaimed, and held the piſtol to his breaſt, 'doſt thou not deſerve to receive death at the hands of one whom, having the greateſt obligations to him, thou wouldſt cruſh to the earth and, fiend-like, grin at the miſery thou hadſt brought upon himſelf and family?'</p>
                     <p>"During the time I uttered theſe words, a ſervant from the houſe appeared in ſight, though not near enough to hear what paſſed.</p>
                     <p>"I mean not,' I continued, ſeeing him ſhrink from me, 'to aſſaſſinate you. Doubtleſs, you have weapons, ſtand, therefore, and defend yourſelf.'</p>
                     <p>"I have none,' he cried: 'my life is in your power.'</p>
                     <p>"Daſtardly wretch!' exclaimed I.</p>
                     <p>"At that moment the ſervant came up: he was ſent from the houſe to ſeek me.—Unfortunately, the laſt few words of D'Ollifont, with my anſwer, was the only part of the converſation he heard. When, how was I aſtoniſhed, to hear D'Ollifont exclaim, 'I will die ſoon than commit ſuch a defraud!' at the ſame inſtant producing a forged note on the bank of Venice. 'Here is a man' (ſaid he to the ſervant, pointing to Eburne) 'who can witneſs that your maſter juſt now threatened my life, unleſs I conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a partner with him in paſſing theſe falſe notes.'</p>
                     <p>"It is difficult to ſay which ſtood the greateſt ſtatue of ſurpriſe and horror, the ſervant or myſelf; and it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had I not been prevented by him, I ſhould have taken away my own life.</p>

"Being at length more compoſed, I reproached D'Olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font in the bittereſt terms for his perfidy, and walked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to my houſe; but had not entered it above an hour before I found myſelf arreſted on his accuſation, and was that night, though all my friends interfered, dragged from my wife and child, to experience the miſeries of a gaol.</p>
                     <p>"Picture to yourſelf my ſituation: the night was ſpent in diſtracted ravings, and the morning brought a viſit from my Caſſandra and her daughter, which in ſome meaſure reſtored my ſcattered ſenſes; but it was only to experience pangs the moſt poignant and ſevere.</p>
                     <p>"D'Ollifont, and the wretch who was with him, ſwore to my having ſtopped the former in the private walk of my own garden, when by himſelf; Eburne being then at ſome diſtance, though near enough to obſerve all that paſſed: that firſt, with fair words, I ſtrove to perſuade him to be an accomplice with myſelf in a forgery on the bank of Venice, and gave him a falſe bill, informing him that I had many more of the ſame ſort; but that, finding him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obſtinate in his refuſal, I had proceeded to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and, placing a piſtol to his breaſt, threatened to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of life, ſhould he refuſe; that my intentions were fruſtrated by Eburne, who, hearing theſe words, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately came forward.</p>
                     <p>"My own ſervant was examined, and confeſſed, that when at ſome diſtance, he ſaw me hold a piſtol to D'Olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font's breaſt; and, at his arrival at the ſpot, heard him ſay he was unarmed; and that I only anſwered, 'Daſtardly wretch!'</p>
                     <p>"It was now the general conjecture that this affair would touch my life; at all events I was doomed to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic trial. It was in vain I pleaded my own tale, and the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035833_0258_10093EC38FC1FF20"/>
reaſons for my behaviour: to every one, except thoſe to whom I was very well known, it carried in it ſomething romantic that D'Ollifont ſhould wiſh to debauch my daughter, which was ſure to end in his ruin, without even one chance to be benefited by the crime.</p>
                     <p>"During the interval between my impriſonment and the day of trial, D'Ollifont was ſent for to his relation, the count Maſerini, in Italy, whoſe health was in ſuch a ſtate that his life was even deſpaired of, owing to the falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his children's death. He returned, however, at the time my trial was expected to be brought on, the poſſeſſor of his uncle's eſtates and wealth.</p>
                     <p>"In the time of his abſence from Spain, a number of falſe bills, the ſame as D'Ollifont had produced, were found, by the information of one of my own ſervants, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a ſmall cheſt, near a ſpot I uſed much to frequent in my garden: this freſh proof, which I had every reaſon to ſuppoſe to be planned by ſome ſcheme in which the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain Eburne was concerned, and who, I have no doubt, bribed my ſervant, added greatly to the horrid accuſation againſt me. I had, therefore, entirely made up my mind to expect no mercy, and reſolved to prepare myſelf in that manner which would give me a degree of fortitude in my laſt moments, that ſhould impreſs every one with ſome ideas of my innocence.</p>
                     <p>"The night preceding the awful day which was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide my fate, my priſon-doors flew open, and count D'Olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font ſtood before me. He ſtarted back ſome ſteps, at my wretched appearance; and a convulſive trembling ſhowed that his conſcience touched him to the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>"I fixed my eyes on him with a look which ſeemed to add to his confuſion, and was going to upbraid him, when he interrupted me. 'Hold!' he cried: 'I have even a
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035833_0259_10093F0C03BCF478"/>
greater power over you than you ſuppoſe. Laſt night your daughter attempted to plunge a poignard in my breaſt; and there is little doubt that a ſimilar ſentence to that which paſſes death upon you, will do the ſame by Lucretia.'</p>
                     <p>"I heard no more, but fainted before him. The keeper of the priſon was called, and after ſome little time I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. We were again left alone.</p>
                     <p>"D'Ollifont now told me there was yet one way to ſave both myſelf and child. The conditions he propoſed were for me to go to Italy, and by a ſacred oath promiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſome ſervices he ſhould have occaſion for. 'And I.' he continued, 'will ſwear, in the ſame manner, that your family ſhall go with you, and your fortune in every reſpect be ſecured.'</p>
                     <p>"Was it true that my daughter had made an attempt upon his life, I was certain the laws of Spain muſt condemn her to death. Had my own exiſtence been only at ſtake, it is probable I ſhould have ſcorned the villain's offer; knowing my Caſſandra and her child were provided for by money I had placed in the hands of a friend, ſo as to keep them above the frowns of fortune, in point of pecuniary concerns. But the idea of my Lucretia being cut off by an ignominious death, occaſioned moſt probably by love for me, in her revenge againſt my bittereſt enemy, cut me to the ſoul; and almoſt any alternative would have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to ſave her. I demanded, however, the nature of thoſe ſervices, conceiving it might be ſome crime he dared not to undertake himſelf, and therefore had pitched on me to be the perpetrator of the deed.</p>
                     <p>"He ſwore, by the moſt ſacred oath, that my conjectures were ill founded. Still my ſoul revolted at the idea of ſubmitting to the villain in ſo deſpicable a manner, which would in the general opinion give teſtimony of my guilt.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035833_0260_10093EC76E5999C0"/>
I refuſed the offer, and he left the apartment in a rage. The next object which preſented itſelf was my wife in a ſtate of diſtraction; my child—my Lucretia—was in the ſame priſon, and ſure to fall a victim to her raſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>"My ſituation was little ſhort of madneſs: I raved, but it was uſeleſs, and could not ſave her. Yet a way had been ſhown me to preſerve her; and I had refuſed it. The keeper was called; I ſent him to D'Ollifont; the wretch appeared, and received, with a contemptuous ſmile, my acquieſcence to his propoſals."</p>

                     <p>"THE proceedings, againſt me and Lucretia," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the hermit, "were now immediately ſtopped. I took the oath required: no one was found to appear againſt us on the day of trial: and the ſame night I embraced my wife and daughter in my own houſe.</p>
                     <p>"But my joy at the event was conſiderably damped by the general behaviour of my acquaintance, who ſeemed to ſhun both myſelf and family: in ſhort, it was plain the method I had taken to evade public inveſtigation, was in ſome degree known; and, as I had before conceived, it was, in the common opinion, a confirmation of my conſcious guilt. This, at leaſt, reconciled me to one circumſtance, which I was bound to perform—that of leaving Spain immediately.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! this country (where I had ſpent years of felicity—where I had been univerſally reſpected and eſteemed by
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035833_0261_10093F0D8B316EC8"/>
every rank of people) was now become hateful to me; ſince almoſt every countenance ſeemed to look towards me with a gloomy eye of ſuſpicion, even where I had before been welcomed, whenever I appeared, with ſmiles of friendſhip and confidence. My God! what were my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations! Senſible of my own innocence, ten thouſand deaths (could I myſelf alone have ſuffered) would have been leſs torturing to me than the preſent ignominy. But when I ſaw Lucretia bow to a young lady in the ſtreet where we lived, as ſhe penſively ſat in the window between myſelf and wife, and ſaw the ſalute contemptuouſly ſmiled at, and paſſed without being returned (while ſhe and her mother would burſt into tears, and move from the ſpot)—then would I utter to myſelf—'Better, had I ſeen my child executed with me, in the view of a gazing multitude, declaring my innocence, than thus to be doomed to ſhrink under the wounds of blaſted fame and ſuppoſed infamy.'</p>
                     <p>"My affairs were very ſoon ſettled; and, with my wife and daughter (attended by one man and a woman-ſervant) I ſet out for Genoa, where, according to appointment, I was to meet the author of all my miſeries. Our journey was neceſſarily ſlow, on account of the ill health of my Caſſandra, who had ſuffered ſo ſevere a ſhock from our late misfortunes, that I was under the greateſt alarm for her life.</p>
                     <p>"After ſome little time we arrived at the place of our temporary deſtination, and applying to a perſon to whom I had a recommendation, he informed me count D'Ollifont had been waiting for me two days, and that I might ſee him that night ar a certain place to which he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me. 'It is not publicly known,' ſaid he, 'that he is in this country; conſequently ſecreſy is required.'</p>

"At my return to the inn I found my wife had been taken more violently ill than uſual, inſomuch that Lucretia had ſent for a phyſician, who had juſt entered the houſe. I aſked his opinion on leaving the chamber: he declared her diſorder to be a total decline, but did not then appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any danger. Towards the latter part of the day ſhe grew better: but I reſolved not to mention my intended viſit; and I contrived an excuſe, therefore, for my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the hour I had fixed.</p>
                     <p>"It was ſome time after the cloſe of the evening, and nearly dark, when I met the man whom I had before ſeen in the morning. He told me to follow him. I rather heſitated. 'You have no reaſon for alarm,' ſaid he, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving me attentively.</p>
                     <p>"I had a brace of piſtols in my pocket; and, after a few moments of conſideration, did as he deſired.</p>
                     <p>"He firſt led me down a paſſage of conſiderable length, at the bottom of which he halted. Having produced a large key, he opened a ſmall door, which diſcovered a gloomy Gothic hall, lighted by a lamp, which was ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the top. It was ſupported by heavy Tuſcan co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns; and, in different niches, were placed in order ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſuits of armour. At the further end was a flight of ſteps, on the top of which were a heavy pair of folding doors, arched over in the antique ſtyle above, and ſecured in front by a grate-work of iron.</p>
                     <p>"My guide, when he got to the centre of this place, ſeemed to fall back a few paces, as if thoughtful; and then, holding up the lantern he had in his hand, looked me full in the face. This behaviour I did not by any means like: it had the appearance of aſſaſſination, and the gloom of the hall encouraged the idea. I immediately
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035833_0263_10093F144B535290"/>
drew one of my piſtols from my pocket. 'No treachery!' I exclaimed; 'or, by heavens, you die!'</p>
                     <p>"He ſeemed diſconcerted. 'By all that's ſacred, I mean none; but only wiſhed to be certain I was right in the perſon I am conducting.'</p>
                     <p>"'Tis well!' I anſwered: 'proceed.'</p>
                     <p>"He did ſo and led me up the ſteps; then, taking from his pocket another key, he applied it to the lock of the iron grating. It required great exertions to turn it; but it at length yielded to the force, and divided in the middle, The door now only remained.</p>
                     <p>"Put up your piſtol, ſignor:' ſaid he: 'you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear.'</p>
                     <p>"This requeſt I poſitively refuſed. He then blew a ſmall horn, which he had in his belt; when the folding doors immediately flew open, and two blacks with drawn fabres ſtood before us.</p>
                     <p>"A voice from the inner part now uttered—'Admit.' They directly drew back, and we paſſed through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. The doors inſtantly cloſed, with ſome noiſe; and the blacks reſumed their ſtation before them.</p>
                     <p>"My guide walked forward, and I followed with the piſtol ſtill in my hand.</p>
                     <p>"It was a ſpacious apartment, though gloomy; and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up with ſome degree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the middle was a long table, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with green cloth; and on it were ſpread various pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, pens, ink, and a few books. A company of perſons were ſeated round it, of about twelve or thirteen, and one at the head of the table ſeemed a kind of preſident in the aſſembly. Their cloaks were all muffled round them; and a black feather, which each wore in his hat, hung over

their faces, and added to the ſolemnity of their dark, leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened viſages. He at the head, I however obſerved, wore a white one.</p>

for many miles, have encouraged ideas, from the gloomy appearance and Gothic ſtructure of this ancient pile, that it is haunted; and it is actually neceſſary, for the preſervation of the furniture, papers, and other valuables, of conſiderable amount, that theſe ſuſpicions ſhould be kept alive; which will more effectually prevent intruſion or robbery than any other method we can put into execution; the peaſants of that part being a wild, untractable kind of people, and little better than general depredators on the public.</p>
                     <p>"You perhaps may wonder why we do not remove theſe articles; but my uncle's will particularly requeſts every individual atom that was at his death, in the abbey, ſhould remain there, and only be taken from it as my neceſſity may require.

The ſervice that I have to requeſt from you is, the performance of ſome trifling ceremony, with a lamp, in the external part of the building, at night, either by paſſing the caſements with it in your hand, or fixing it for ſhort periods of time at the different windows.

For your better convenience, there is a cave on one ſide of the wood which ſurrounds the abbey, that is never intruded upon, nor indeed hardly known by any one in the place:—you may go to it of an evening; and from thence proceed, through a ſubterraneous paſſage, to the building. If, after two years' conſtant performance of theſe injunctions, no interruption is perceived, you will not then be confined to the uſual ceremony; but yet it is requeſted that a continual watch ſhall be kept upon it; and, as I before obſerved, if intruded on, even fifty years to come, and both of us living, every means is to be uſed in the above-mentioned manner, to terrify all viſitors to a removal.'</p>
                     <p>"I muſt confeſs, this requeſt, ſtrange as it was, ſeemed far more agreeable to me than what I expected; and I conceived that, were there any villany lurking under it, I might diſcover the ſource, and, without going from my oath, be of conſiderable ſervice to the injured; and, one time or other, have it in my power to retaliate on D'Olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font.

She knew me (though ſhe had been inſenſible for nearly an hour) and exclaimed, 'My huſband, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty aid thee!' Then, turning her eyes towards her daughter, ſhe ſeemed inwardly to ſupplicate heaven in her behalf; and, heaving a ſoft ſigh, expired in my arms. Lucretia fainted, and was ſupported by Stella, who had juſt brought the draught, while I remained loſt for ſome time in gloomy ſorrow and ſtupidity.</p>
                     <p>"At length, turning to the phyſician, I deſired to know why he had flattered me with hopes that ſhe might live for a length of time. He only anſwered by ſhaking his head, and ſaying the diſorder had come to a criſis ſooner than he expected. He left the inn, and I (having ordered my daughter to be put to bed, and committed the care of the funeral to my confidential ſervant Jaſper) retired to my own room, overwhelmed with the moſt poignant grief.</p>
                     <p>"It is impoſſible to deſcribe the anguiſh ſuffered by myſelf and child on this mournful event: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore draw a veil over the ſcene, a recollection of which is even now almoſt too much for me."</p>
                     <p>The hermit here was conſtrained to make a pauſe of ſome few minutes, while he paid a tributary tear to the memory of ſo beloved a wife.</p>
                     <p>"Suffice it to ſay," continued he, "in the courſe of a week ſhe was interred near the place where we then reſided, and I tore myſelf from the ſpot after a few days, with the two ſervants, and my now only remaining comfort, my dear Lucretia.</p>
                     <p>"After a long day's journey, a prey to the deepeſt melancholy, we arrived at Montferrat, and ſtopped at a

tolerably-built cottage; the owner of which, fortunately, had an inclination, and alſo convenience, to accommodate us with board and lodging for ſome weeks. The ſituation ſuited me for the preſent, as it was extremely retired.</p>

                     <p>"We were both punctual; and, as I was ſtill fearful of treachery from ſo vile a character, both myſelf and ſervant were armed. He was alone: his figure, which I could now more fully obſerve, was noble and majeſtic; his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance very handſome, though there was a fierceneſs in his eyes, added to the turn of his dark brows, which made it in ſome reſpects terrific.</p>

From hence we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, by a trap artfully jointed to the floor, a number of ſteps, at the bottom of which was an arched ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our paſſage, entirely dark: our guide, however, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a lamp, by which he lighted another place againſt the wall.

At the top we entered a ſmall ſubterraneous room, in which was a ſtool, a table, ſome eatables and wine; with a bed, which ſhowed (though empty now) it was daily occupied. Our guide preſſed againſt a ſpring, in a manner which he particularly explained; and, by a kind of mechaniſm, aided by clock-work placed at the further part of the apartment, a ſquare of about five feet of the cieling above gradually fell within two feet of the floor on which we ſtood: this I jumped upon, and, by a ſecond preſſure of the foot on a certain part, it roſe in the ſame manner that it fell, and cloſed with equal nicety; by which means I found myſelf in that room oppoſite to the one we are now in.</p>

                     <p>"WE were all ſurpriſed at the noiſe: at length ſignor Ranolpho (which I now found was the name of our guide) ſaid he ſuppoſed it proceeded from the curioſity of ſome travellers who were paſſing that way.—I cannot ſay I was by any means well ſatisfied with this conjecture; but I made no anſwer.</p>
                     <p>"After having received many inſtructions from him, concerning the different pieces of mechaniſm contrived in this building, I remarked, with a look of ſome aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was to me amazing, count D'Ollifont ſhould have put himſelf to ſuch expenſe and trouble, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of the civil power, under juſt claims, might have anſwered the purpoſes he wiſhed to accompliſh.</p>
                     <p>"Ranolpho ſeemed confuſed: after a pauſe he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'Your obſervation is juſt; but were the application made to the ſuperior power of Italy, the curioſity of the peaſantry would be ſtill more conſiderably heightened; and I have doubts whether the vigilance of the moſt ſcrutini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing perſons could protect this place from their invaſion. It alſo would gain count D'Ollifont a bad name, which might, through their ignorance, occaſion ſuſpicions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks the moſt injurious to his character. Beſides,' he continued, 'the chief part of theſe articles of machinery were erected many years back, when this ſtructure was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by the monks, they made uſe of them to terrify perſons of different ſentiments in religious points to their own way of thinking, whom the chance of war had made their priſoners, and who accordingly were confined in their own abbey. By theſe arts, the victims of their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035833_0273_10093F210A6DDC60"/>
were taught to believe the holy fathers worked mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by their faith.'</p>
                     <p>"There was a kind of equivocation in this ſpeech, which I by no means liked, though I forbore to make any reply. What he ſaid, however, concerning ſeveral of the traps, &amp;c. being formed at a diſtant period of time, I found to be true, by the general appearance of the age of the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; though there was not a doubt but they had lately been repaired and put in order.</p>
                     <p>"After a little time we all left the abbey, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the cave, where it was ſettled that I ſhould meet Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio at that ſpot, and at the ſame hour, the following night. Ranolpho ſaid he ſhould leave Montferrat the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make the beſt of his way immediately after D'Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifont to Spain.</p>
                     <p>"We then parted. Jaſper and myſelf ſoon arrived at the cottage, after ſome converſation on the ſtrange events we had witneſſed.</p>
                     <p>"I acquainted Lucretia with every circumſtance relative to the abbey; and, though ſhe expreſſed a conſiderable anxiety for my ſafety, yet, like myſelf, ſhe was happy to find the requeſt of D'Ollifont was no worſe. I, however, made her ſtill more eaſy, by aſſuring her I never intended to viſit the building, unaccompanied by Jaſper.</p>
                     <p>"In leſs than a month I hired a houſe, very little diſtant from the cottage: it was not large, though neat and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; and, there being only my daughter and myſelf, a few domeſtics were ſufficient to form our houſehold. I did not, however, intend to live by any means private or retired, though my own wiſhes prompted me to it. I trembled for the health of my child: it had been on the decline ever ſince the commencement of our misfortunes; and the poignant grief ſhe ſuffered for the loſs of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035833_0274_10093F683B51F960"/>
now ſeemed ſettled to a deep melancholy, which I dreaded to obſerve, and which my own health and ſpirits, I conceived, helped to increaſe.</p>
                     <p>"It was for theſe reaſons, therefore, that I puniſhed myſelf, in receiving and paying viſits to perſons of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſome miles round; and I could perceive, in ſome degree, it contributed to leſſen that weight of oppreſſion which ſeemed to lie ſo heavy on her ſoul.</p>
                     <p>"A month had not elapſed after my removal to my new dwelling, before a confuſed report was ſpread that Percival Maſerini and his ſiſter were yet living, and in Italy.</p>
                     <p>"This intelligence ſeemed, in ſome reſpects, to unravel a part of the myſterious manner and requeſt of D'Ollifont: but I muſt own, the elucidations I pictured to myſelf were by no means favourable to him; and dark ſchemes of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany ſeemed to unfold themſelves to my view. But ſtill I could do nothing; I was bound by my oath; and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions were of no avail. I and Jaſper viſited the abbey eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night; and, on thoſe occaſions, I made every ſearch that was poſſible, to find a clue to D'Ollifont's conduct, which I ſuppoſed might be concealed in ſome part of the building: my endeavours, however, proved unſucceſsful Enuchio ſtill continued near the place: and I could not but ſuſpect that he was a kind of watch upon my conduct. His very looks ſeemed to indicate the blackeſt thoughts; and his manners confirmed the idea.</p>
                     <p>"About this period, among the many foreigners who frequented my villa as they paſſed through Montferrat, was lord Albourne, a young Engliſhman of rank and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortune."</p>
                     <p>Matilda and Alfred ſtarted at the name; but they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to interrupt the hermit, who accordingly proceeded—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="unknown:035833_0275_10093F55CA54F178"/>
"His manner pleaſed both myſelf and daughter; in ſhort, there was a kind of noble ſincerity in his diſpoſition, which on a little further acquaintance charmed me.—I muſt allow I felt a conſiderable happineſs, on obſerving a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affection take place between my Lucretia and this noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—His character, I underſtood from correſpondents whom I could depend upon in England, was unblemiſhed; and I knew I could beſtow on my child a fortune worthy of ſuch a huſband. Suffice it to ſay, he declared his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ſhe, above the little arts of female coquetry, confeſſed ſhe loved him. But ſtill there were ſome obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the marriage. Lord Albourne had not yet been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my misfortunes, or with Lucretia's attempt on D'Ollifont's life. To Lucretia there was alſo another impediment: ſhe muſt part with me for ſome time; his lordſhip had promiſed, after ſettling his affairs in England, he would return with her, and conſent to remain in Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat during my life time. But it would, at leaſt, take twelve months to tranſact theſe affairs. Theſe twelve months' abſence ſeemed to her a century, and darkened every proſpect of felicity ſhe might have hoped to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. At length, however, theſe obſtacles were overcome; lord Albourne was, by me, informed of the ſufferings I had undergone, and of Lucretia's impetuoſity, in attempting to aſſaſſinate the author of my misfortunes. His lordſhip ſympathiſed with me in my diſtreſſes, and admired the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic love of my child, though he was ſorry ſhe had thrown herſelf into the power of ſuch a wretch.</p>
                     <p>"The latter objection was at length over-ruled by him and, I may ſay, conſiderably leſſened by D'Ollifont, from whom at this period I received a letter in terms of the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friendſhip, and breathing, in ſome degree, a regret for the anguiſh he had cauſed. The contents of it informed
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035833_0276_10093F6AD1104170"/>
me, that (it having been hinted to him that my health was in a precarious ſtate, and that travelling would, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, prove of infinite ſervice) he would undertake that ſome one ſhould perform my part in the abbey, if I choſe to take a journey for two months to re-eſtabliſh my conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. D'Ollifont's character was now too well known to me for me to conceive one favourable trait in his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; otherwiſe, this deception might have paſſed for an act of kindneſs and repentance. I ſtrangely ſuſpected ſome ſoul deeds were to be executed in my abſence, and at firſt reſolved not to accept the offer: but, at length, overcome by the tears of Lucretia, and the perſuaſions of lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne, I conſented to accompany them to France, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to return at leaſt a fortnight before the limited time.</p>
                     <p>"My ſituation was critical; I dared not communicate my ſuſpicions to any one, except Jaſper: my oath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade it. My ſurpriſe, however, was conſiderably increaſed by finding that Percival Maſerini and his ſiſter were actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Italy; and that the former, by the authority of the king of Sardinia, had ſent to Spain, to demand the keys of Graſville Abbey from count D'Ollifont, that the building might be ſearched, to find if another will could be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the late count Maſerini, in favour of his children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his nephew.</p>
                     <p>"An idea now ſtruck me, which I conſidered would at once give me an opportunity of diſcovering the dark machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of D'Ollifont reſpecting the abbey, though abſent from Montferrat.</p>
                     <p>"I therefore wrote a ſhort anſwer to his letter, ſaying I ſhould accept the vacation he offered me. At the ſame time I determined to leave Jaſper at my houſe, concealed, that they might ſuppoſe he was alſo with me. I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

could depend on his fidelity, courage, and underſtanding. To him, therefore, I related the forebodings of my own mind, and gave him inſtructions accordingly, with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caution, that, ſhould he find any one was confined there, or any treacherous ſchemes whatever going forward, he ſhould immediately write to me, and (on the receipt of this token) I ſhould come poſt, and incognito, to my villa.</p>
                     <p>"Lord Albourne and Lucretia were ſhortly united, after an acquaintance of only ſix months; and, as ſoon as the ceremony was performed, we ſet off for France. Our journey was pleaſant; and if ever I enjoyed one gleam of comfort after my misfortunes in Spain, and the loſs of my Caſſandra, it was in this ſhort period. A gloom, however, ſtill hung over the countenance of Lucretia; the idea of leaving me proved a continual drawback on her felicity; and the diſtreſſing day was ſomewhat haſtened by a letter from Jaſper, requeſting me to return immediately.</p>
                     <p>"That fortitude, however, which I conceived I ſhould exert when I parted with the only prop of my exiſtence, failed me entirely at the afflicting moment; and (inſtead of being able to ſupport her through the trial) I found I in a great meaſure added to her grief, by the pangs I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered myſelf, which were too acute to be concealed. Lord Albourne ſeemed to ſhare the ſorrows of us both; and (after ſhedding tears on my head) he removed his wife from my arms, that inſenſibly held her to my breaſt, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her, in a fainting fit, to the carriage, which with cruel, ſwiftneſs ſoon bore her from my ſight.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! every beam of pleaſure ſeemed now vaniſhed, and the melancholy proſpects of my mind received another tint of darkneſs, horror, and miſery. But a few months back, I had been the happieſt of mortals—the father of a lovely, amiable child, the huſband of an angelic wife,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035833_0278_10093F6D6635C0E8"/>
the poſſeſſor of an unblemiſhed reputation: now was I an exile, though in my native country; bereft of wife, child, and even reputation, in the eyes of the world; labouring under a ſtigma of ſhattered fame, never to be recovered.</p>
                     <p>"Tormented with thoſe ideas, I ſet out on my return to Italy; but, unfortunately, was detained, through many incidents on the road, for near three days. I, immediately on my arrival at my villa, had a private conference with Jaſper.</p>
                     <p>"His countenance ſhowed he had much to tell, and that of a dreadful nature. He informed me that, after my departure, he kept himſelf as ſecret as poſſible, according to my orders, and only went out by night, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf at a place near the cave. The ſecond time of his watching, he perceived Enuchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and three others, whom he did not by any means like, cautiouſly enter it about midnight, and, ſome time after, he ſaw a light paſs one of the caſements in the weſt tower of the abbey; but though he remained at the ſame place till near day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, he never ſaw them return. He attended again the next evening at an early hour, but ſaw no one go that way, though a light and the figure of a man moved ſeveral times, in the courſe of three, hours, before the different windows. He therefore concluded that thoſe whom he had ſeen the night before had taken up their habitation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the abbey. He ſtill, however, continued to keep a watchful eye on the building.</p>
                     <p>"On the eighth day ſome confuſion was experienced among the peaſantry. A ſignor Balvolio, a phyſician, with officers of juſtice, and a ſervant of Percival Maſerini ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Montferrat, to ſearch for him. He had the night before, according to the ſervant's account, entered the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, while the man waited for him without; who fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035833_0279_10093F2951104558"/>
ſleep, and did not awake till morning: he then entered to look after his maſter, but his exertions proved fruitleſs; he was no where to be found. His footſteps were traced to an apartment in the weſt tower; where alſo a picture, which he wore next his heart, was found, the ribbon of which ſeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orn by force; but from this room no other ſigns of him could be traced.</p>
                     <p>"Jaſper was equally aſtoniſhed and alarmed at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. He had omitted to attend at the uſual place the night before, having been extremely ill; he, however, contrived to be among thoſe who entered with the ſtrangers to ſearch the building, and with them examined that very apartment of the weſt tower, where with me he had oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times performed the uſual ceremonies with the lamp. He then, with the reſt, left the abbey, and heard it agreed on, between the phyſician and officers, that the doors and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gates ſhould be left unlocked.</p>
                     <p>"On his return home he directly ſent off a letter to me, acquainting me with theſe proceedings; but, unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I had, the day before the arrival of it at the place it was directed to, ſet off for another part of France; and Jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, after ſome time, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he mortification to receive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unopened.</p>
                     <p>"In this interval he was, however, by no means idle, and he determined, let the hazard be what it would, to go over the abbey himſelf at midnight. He at the ſame time reſolved to enter from the principal gates, being aware, did he attempt to paſs the ſecret paſſage, there was hardly a doubt but he ſhould be interrupted.</p>
                     <p>"This ſcheme he carried into execution, and proceeded, well armed, with a dark lantern, to the hall. He had not remained, in an obſcure part of it, above five minutes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Enuchio and two others came forth from that apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035833_0280_10093F71594EBE98"/>
which proved they muſt have been in the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous chamber, and conſequently had aſcended by means of the trap. Theſe men had, all three, lamps, and ſhortly after they were followed by a figure of noble mien, muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled up in his cloak, and his hat, in which was a white feather, flapped over his eyes. But how was Jaſper aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, when, by the light of one of their lamps, which glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his countenance, he diſcovered the features of D'Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifont!</p>
                     <p>"Being now more fully convinced that the moſt horrid treachery and villany was going forward, though every moment in danger of being diſcovered, he perſiſted in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them at ſome little diſtance. They proceeded ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the iron gate that leads to the ruins of a once magnificent place of worſhip, and walked to the centre, on which part ſtands a tomb to the memory of a monk, who in former times was a ſuperior of this abbey.</p>
                     <p>"One of the men having put down a ſmall baſket, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered lightly over with a cloth, which ſeemed to contain ſome proviſion, they all four entered the tomb. But it was impoſſible for Jaſper to follow them here alſo; as the ſize would hardly have admitted five perſons to keep far enough apart in it to prevent diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>"He heard a kind of noiſe which plainly told they were opening a large trap, and it ſeemed to require the exertions, of three of them. He heard D'Ollifont ſpeak: 'Take down the proviſions; I will remain here. Leave the baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and ſay nothing.' Jaſper ſuppoſed they did ſo; for, after ſome little time, he heard them replace the trap; and they paſſed by him as they returned to the apartment from whence they came.</p>
                     <p>"He immediately, by the ſame method he had entered, quitted the abbey, ſhocked at what he had been witneſs to
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035833_0281_10093F2B5F326F58"/>
and entirely at a loſs in what manner to act. He knew himſelf to be entangled by a promiſe of ſecreſy, ſimilar to that of mine, on which terms only I had been ſuffered to make him my confidant; but yet he was certain, as well as myſelf, that it did not prevent our aid or aſſiſtance to any one diſtreſſed or confined in the building; or our exertions to fruſtrate any plans of wickedneſs or cruelty which the count might form, provided we did not diſcover thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which we were involved relative to the light, &amp;c. Our ſituations were both extremely delicate; and though we would have riſked our lives in the ſervice of the unfortunate, yet we could not but recollect with horror the forfeiture incurred by the breach of an awful oath.</p>

                     <p>"JASPER at length fixed on a ſcheme, which effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed his wiſhes to ſerve the unfortunate, by the courage and ingenuity he diſplayed in the execution of it. He determined to let the much injured Percival Maſerini know (if ſuch a perſon there was in the abbey—a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which he had little if any doubt) that there was one who was acquainted with his unhappy ſituation, and pitied him—nay, would run all hazards to aſſiſt him to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, if he could contrive any ſtratagem that carried in it the leaſt proſpect of ſucceſs. Words to this purpoſe he wrote on a ſheet of paper, at the ſame time mentioning he would attend in the tomb the next night, at an early hour, before the uſual attendance of D'Ollifont and his aſſiſtants;
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035833_0282_10093F742A82B890"/>
a feeble hope inducing him to think they might converſe together, though with difficulty.</p>
                     <p>"A ſudden idea now ſtruck him, which had nearly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled his preſent determination. Why not immediately apply to the civil power, whom he could at once lead to the place of confinement; and, by proof, cruſh D'Ollifont and the wretches concerned? The pen dropped from his hand: he roſe with joy at the thought. Heſitation and reflection again ſtopped him: he knew not how I would have acted in this caſe. Strong as were his ſuſpicions, they were as yet but ſuſpicions. Should he make them publicly known, and, at this criſis, ſhould they fail, (which, though entirely improbable, was not actually an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) it was uncertain in what ſtate he might involve both himſelf and me. But this might, at leaſt, be done at the laſt extremity, and in two days more he expected I ſhould return.</p>
                     <p>"In ſhort, he proceeded as he had before intended, and accordingly finiſhed his note—not without, however, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, at the latter part, hints of the diſagreeable ties that entangled him with D'Ollifont. Another conſideration now interrupted him: he wiſhed to ſign a name, but not either his own or mine; that, in caſe the letter ſhould be diſcovered, it might not, at the firſt inſtant, be apparent who was the author of it. After ſome little time he wrote at the bottom, 'Father Peter,' that it might be ſuppoſed to be ſome holy man, who, diſdaining the idle talk relative to the abbey, had made it a place for his meditations, and had conſequently diſcovered what was going forward.</p>
                     <p>"Jaſper, at night, attended at a particular ſpot in the chapel. In a ſhort time he heard them enter, but could not perceive D'Ollifont. One of them, whom he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed the night before, he now diſcovered to be Eburne.—
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035833_0283_10093F2F145E2068"/>
They immediately walked to the tomb, and followed each other in; the baſket, as on the former night, was ſlightly covered with a cloth, and put down on the outſide of the door, while they removed the trap. Jaſper now ſaw the opportunity he wiſhed to make uſe of; and, while they were buſily employed, he advanced, turned the cloth on one ſide from the top of the baſket, thruſt the paper down among the proviſion, and replaced the covering as he found it. In leſs than a minute after he had returned to his hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, one of them came forth, and took it away: he ſoon after heard the trap cloſed; and, again paſſing him, they returned, as he ſuppoſed, to the ſubterraneous room, while he left the abbey, elated, in ſome degree, with the ſucceſs of his ſcheme.</p>
                     <p>"The next night arrived; and Jaſper, with another let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, repaired, as ſoon as it was dark, to the chapel, with a palpitating heart for the iſſue of his undertaking. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the tomb, put his mouth to the trap, which, with ſome trouble, he found; then called ſeveral times, but received no anſwer: he repeated the name of Maſerini ſtill louder, till he was afraid he had diſcovered himſelf to D'Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifont's party. Soon after, he thought he heard a kind of groaning from below; but it was indiſtinct and faint: in ſhort, he was now certain the cell was ſo low, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to exchange words with any one beneath. His diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, however, did not abate his perſeverance; and he now waited to place his note, in which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the regret he felt at not being able to hear him; and, after begging him to ſupport himſelf with fortitude, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his intending, if every ſcheme failed, to apply to the magiſtracy of the place.</p>
                     <p>"The men, as uſual, approached; but D'Ollifont was again abſent. One of them carried the baſket: unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035833_0284_10093F75B01D71A0"/>
he did not place it before the door, but took it with him into the tomb; in conſequence of which, Jaſper was unable to ſend the paper he had got ready. After they left the chapel, he departed from the abbey, overwhelmed with chagrin and diſtreſs at the failure of his enterpriſe. The next morning brought the letter which he had wrote to me, back again, with information that no ſuch perſon could be found at the place where it was directed. He immediately diſpatched another, which found me at B***.</p>
                     <p>"One more night he reſolved to try if Fortune would favour him; and he determined, ſhould ſhe not, to run all hazards, and apply for juſtice the following day.</p>
                     <p>"He was juſt going to leave the houſe, when he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three men lurking about it, as if watching it; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore waited ſome little time before he ſet off. About half an hour after, he perceived they were gone; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly walked towards the abbey. He had but juſt arrived at one of the ſolitary avenues leading to the principal gate, when the ſame three men, as he ſuppoſed. ruſhed from behind ſome thick foliage of cedar, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his money. They, however, waited for no anſwer, but knocked him down: they then rifled his pockets; and, after giving him ſeveral blows on the head, and ſtabs with a dagger in the ſide and breaſt, left him, doubtleſs with an idea that he was dead.</p>
                     <p>"In this ſtate he continued till morning, when he in ſome degree recovered his ſenſes, though unable to move, and almoſt to ſpeak. His ſituation was dreadful: there was little chance of any one paſſing that way, it being ſo near the abbey; and he ſeemed to be in ſuch a ſtate that he could not poſſibly ſurvive many hours.</p>
                     <p>"Providentially, however, after a conſiderable length of time, a peaſant ventured into the path, after a ſtrayed
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035833_0285_10093F31A6DC41E8"/>
mule; he at firſt attemped to run at the ſight of Jaſper's figure, conceiving him to be ſomething ſupernatural; but his feeble voice ſoon convinced the man, who ſtood at a little diſtance, that he was a mortal. He immediately came up to him; but the exertion he had uſed in ſtriving to make him hear, had now rendered him ſpeechleſs. The poor fellow, who ſaw and pitied him, directly ran for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man to help; and they carried him between them to the peaſant's cottage. After ſome little time he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſed, and they ſent to the ſervants at the villa, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the accident.</p>
                     <p>"Proper aſſiſtance was procured: in about eight hours he recovered his ſpeech; but yet the phyſician gave no hopes of his life. In the courſe of four days his wounds appeared more favourable, and his fever conſiderably abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet ſtill he continued delirious at intervals. In the courſe of ſix more days, he recovered his ſenſes entirely, and was pronounced out of danger. He now ſat up ſome hours every day, and ſeemed to gain ſtrength as faſt as could be wiſhed; and the following week, which was the time of my return, he left his chamber, though extremely low.</p>
                     <p>"In this ſtate I found him, and heard from him the events which had happened in my abſence. I leave you to judge of my feelings and my ſituation. There was not a doubt, in my opinion, but that the villains who robbed and ſo cruelly uſed Jaſper, were ſome of D'Ollifont's gang, who knew of his intruſion in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> the abbey, and determined to keep him away for ſome time, if not to murder him. I therefore reſolved, however hazardous it might be, to go to the abbey that night, though Jaſper was unable to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me: this reſolution, I muſt own, was raſh: but I
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035833_0286_10093F7877CC2248"/>
thought not on the danger; my paſſions were worked up to the higheſt pitch.</p>
                     <p>"Soon after it was dark, I repaired to the cave; nothing was altered ſince my laſt viſit. I proceeded along the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous paſſage: all was ſilent, and gloomy. In the ſame manner I aſcended to the room; not an article ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be moved. I roſe from the trap to theſe apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I could hear nor ſee nothing; every thing ſeemed to ſhow not a ſoul had entered it ſince myſelf: I, at length, even began to conceive doubts whether Jaſper's tale did not proceed from a diſordered imagination. I walked ſlowly to the gates of the chapel; and, ſtopping a few moments, ſhuddered involuntarily at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> own ideas. The horridly deſolate aſpect of every thing around me encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the diſmal train of thoughts that ſtruck on my mind. I ſhook off this weakneſs, and walked directly to the tomb; where I was ſoon convinced of the truth of Jaſper's report, by finding the trap, which anſwered every deſcription he had given me. I was, however, incapable to lift it up, and having fully ſatisfied myſelf that the place was now clear, returned home.</p>
                     <p>"The next day, I acquainted Jaſper with my viſit; and we both conceived there was not a ſhadow of doubt but the unfortunate Percival Maſerini had been made away with, during the illneſs of Jaſper.</p>
                     <p>"In the courſe of a week Jaſper was able to attend me to the abbey, and we proceeded together to the tomb. We both exerted our ſtrength, and ſoon opened the trap, which diſcovered a flight of narrow ſtone ſteps, by which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to a conſiderable depth, and at the bottom entered a ſmall ſquare cell, arched over at top. This place was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely clear, nor could any ſigns of murder be diſcovered, till Jaſper (as we were leaving of it) by chance ſtumbled
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035833_0287_10093F338A647620"/>
over a dagger, clotted with blood, partly dried, and in ſome few places begun to ruſt. This I reſolved ſhould for the preſent remain where it was; and, after we had performed the ceremony with the lamp in the weſt tower (according to my oath, which I ſtrictly adhered to) we returned, ſhocked at our efforts being fruſtrated, relative to diſcovering the manner in which Percival Maſerini had been treated.</p>
                     <p>"For about a month I was undetermined in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures on theſe circumſtances, and conſiderations in what manner to act. Every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"My reſolution to this purpoſe had not been fixed above a day, when the poor fellow was taken ill with a relapſe of the fever that had before been cauſed by his wounds; and one of theſe wounds which he received on the breaſt, and which he had taken leſs account of than the reſt, now ſhowed ſigns of mortification. Advice from every part near was ſent for; but their conſultations proved of no avail; for, in leſs than a week, I ſaw him breathe his laſt, in a ſtate of inſanity.</p>
                     <p>"Every idea of bringing D'Ollifont to juſtice now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and the death of this faithful ſervant preyed on my ſpirits (which, though bad at the time of my leaving Spain, had gradually grown worſe ever ſince) inſomuch that, at this period, it almoſt affected my ſenſes at certain times. Still it was a kind of melancholy madneſs, which was of ſhort duration in its intervals; and, conſequently, could not be diſcovered, but by the few perſons who were continually with me; and they took no notice of it, as they apprehended no ill conſequences from it on my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which was neither frantic nor outrageous</p>

"Seven months elapſed under theſe circumſtances; during which time I received two letters from my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who informed me of the tenderneſs and affection of her huſband, of his ſettling his affairs as ſoon as poſſible, to return with her to me in Italy (a period ſhe moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely longed for) though ſhe ſuppoſed it would be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, on account of an addition to their party, in the perſon of a near relation to myſelf.</p>
                     <p>"This intelligence, at two different times, gave me the moſt ſincere pleaſure and happineſs. Like a poor ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked mariner, I looked forward through a gloomy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a little glimpſe of returning comfort. Alas! that glimpſe was ſoon extinguiſhed; and I arrived at the criſis of my misfortunes. At the end of near five months' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation after the laſt letter I had received, another came from his lordſhip, who, in the moſt ſoothing manner, (though himſelf, by the appearance of his writing, nearly diſtracted) informed me of the death of my Lucretia, in child-birth; the infant, which was a girl, having ſurvived.</p>

                     <p>"ALFRED, lord Milverne, and Matilda, venerated the grief of the hermit too much to interrupt his ſorrow, which, after a few minutes' indulgence, he overcame, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his narrative.</p>
                     <p>"This intelligence, as I before obſerved, brought me to the very criſis of my misfortunes; and the delirious fits I laboured under became more frequent, though not more violent. My ideas were tinctured with a kind of miſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy, which every day increaſed, and ſerved to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage horrid thoughts that had never before gained the leaſt aſcendancy over me: and the reſult of what I felt was a wiſh (though I ſhrunk from it with affright) to put an end to my own exiſtence. But the gloom of my mind becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each day more terrible, worked up every evil influence with double ſtrength. Pernicious arguments floated in my brain; they ſeemed to ſay I could not do wrong in ridding myſelf of a burdenſome life. In ſhort, in leſs than three months, I came to the dreadful determination of drinking poiſon.</p>
                     <p>"I had ſeen no company whatever ſince the laſt news from England, but a reverend father belonging to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring monaſtery, with whom I ſpent ſome hours when perfectly collected; but I had, for the laſt month before I took this reſolution, ſeldom even ſeen him. My heated imagination prompted me to aſk him to dine with me the very day I reſolved to commit the crime. In my victuals at that meal, I intended to mix a quantity of the poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous drug I had already procured. It is neceſſary, however,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035833_0290_10093F7F9618A1A8"/>
to inform you, that, at this period, I was partly inſane, though poſſeſſed in ſome degree of recollection.</p>
                     <p>"The day arrived; and Father Phineas, by appointment, waited on me. We began dinner, and (I even now trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the idea) before it was finiſhed, I executed the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful project, and took, with a ſeeming calmneſs, the tinctured food. I immediately turned our diſcourſe on the ſubject of religion; knowing I had only a few hours to live, I wiſhed to be ſatisfied in ſome points which my diſordered intellects had latterly made me doubt.</p>
                     <p>"The good man anſwered my queſtions with ſolemnity and truth. In the courſe of his obſervations, he treated on ſuicide: I involuntarily ſhuddered. With a ſteady firmneſs, which I ſhall never forget, he ſpoke on the horrid act, and the eternal puniſhment that awaited it. I turned pale; my lips trembled with convulſive terror at the idea of what I had done, and drops of perſpiration fell from my face. Father Phineas obſerved theſe emotions, and inquired if I was ill. The greateſt alarm prevailed over his features; he gueſſed the cauſe; but delicacy forbade him to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, for fear his conjectures ſhould be wrong. After a few moments I burſt into an agony of tears, and confeſſed myſelf guilty of the deed, that would (as he had clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained) produce everlaſting deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>"He hardly heard the confeſſion, but darted like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the room. In leſs than ten minutes he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a medicine which he had procured at a relation's of his, who reſided near. I immediately took it; but there was great doubt whether it would take the wiſhed for effect, as I had ſwallowed the poiſon ſome time. The ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I ſuffered, in doubtful ſuſpenſe and horror for half an hour, could not be balanced by all my griefs put together; momentarily expecting diſſolution with no hope of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hereafter.</p>

"At length I brought from my ſtomach the dreadful poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: the operation was violent; and, when over, I found myſelf unable to ſtand; the ſervants were therefore inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Father Phineas, that I had ſuddenly been taken ill. I was accordingly conveyed to my bed; nor was any one ever acquainted with the real nature of the caſe, he having made an excuſe even in procuring the medicine.</p>
                     <p>"In the morning, after ſome hours' ſleep, I found the good man at my bed-ſide; his manner was now ſevere, and I received from him a ſharp though affecting rebuke; when, after having joined with me in a thankſgiving for my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, he departed and I remained alone the remainder of the day.</p>
                     <p>"An inclination which I had before imbibed at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, now aſſailed me with redoubled force; it was a wiſh to retire entirely from the world, and live ſecluded and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, in the cave which led to Graſville Abbey: by this I ſhould at once gratify my own deſire and (if poſſible) more ſtrictly adhere to my oath, which I now more and more, as my health became impaired, conſidered as a duty to my God.</p>
                     <p>"The next day I communicated the thought to father Phineas, who at firſt attempted to diſſuade me from it, but at laſt agreed that it was a reſolution in ſome degree neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as a penance for the crime I had been guilty of. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that no one, except himſelf, ſhould know of my retirement; and between us the following ſcheme was therefore contrived.</p>
                     <p>"I gave it out among my houſehold, that I intended to travel again to France, on account of my health; and, if I found the climate agree with me, might perhaps continue there ſome years, or entirely ſettle for the remainder of my life. My domeſtics were therefore ordered away of aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

At different times of the night he had conveyed for me various utenſils and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to form the neceſſary articles of life, to the cave: he likewiſe procured the dreſs, &amp;c. of a hermit; and I took poſſeſſion of my now abode, giving the whole amount that my villa and furniture ſold for, to father Phineas, to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in charitable uſes, beſides a very handſome preſent for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"My ſudden departure, and the melancholy ſtate I had ſo long been in, was talked of for ſome time, after which I was partly forgotten, and ſeldom mentioned.</p>

                     <p>"Whether he believed the account, I know not: but it is certain he might have been convinced to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, had he taken the trouble to ſend and make inquiries in that city. But, conceiving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſuppoſe, that there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alarms enough concerning the abbey, to keep it free from intruſion, and that the principal perſon to contend with him was, by his diabolical arts, no more; knowing that, even if it was ſearched, no material proofs could be brought againſt him, he thought my death rather a releaſe than a misfortune, on account of the thorough knowledge I had of his character.</p>
                     <p>"But, as if Providence favoured his villany, I could not bring me to diſregard the oath I had taken, ſo that his wiſhes ſtill continued to be fulfilled. You may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035833_0293_10093F3BB31B5408"/>
wonder at my ſtrict adherence to it: but you muſt conſider my ſituation; every trifle ſwelled in my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had now nothing to relax it; and my ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of religion, in reſpect to repenting of the crime I had been guilty of in an attempt to take away my own life, every day became more violent; inſomuch that my horror and miſery increaſed, inſtead of leſſening, the more I thought of its fatal tendency.</p>
                     <p>"The good father conſtantly viſited me during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his life, and regularly brought me food; but he has now been dead twelve years. After that period I was neceſſitated to go to the public market, and upon this account took the name of Father Peter, recollecting the ſignature which Jaſper put to the letter he ſent to Percival Maſerini. Time, and the diſguiſe I was in, totally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from being know. I have, ſince my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the town, received viſits from ſome of the peaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who have been more courageous and more curious than their companions.</p>
                     <p>"I had now but one wiſh to be gratified, which was, to ſee lord Albourne and his child, if living.

Father Phineas had tranſmitted all my money to a very reſpectable relation of his in France, an eminent banker, under a feigned name; and with this gentleman was alſo placed my will, wherein I had bequeathed the whole of my

fortune to lord Albourne and his child, if living, if not, to be divided equally among ſix convents in France, and a conſiderable ſum to be given to the poor.</p>
                     <p>"Lord Albourne, his child, and the recollection of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every one that had been dear to me, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vaniſhed from my mind, in the ſpace of ten years. Wholly abſorbed in an enthuſiaſtic mode of living, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came indifferent to every thing in the world, and obtained a ſerenity to which I had before been a ſtranger. I kept a conſtant watch upon the abbey, though I did not enter it for ſometimes ſix months together: yet at theſe times I could ſee no one had intruded there ſince my laſt viſit.</p>
                     <p>"I remained in this ſtate for near twenty years, when, the ſecond night, as I ſuppoſe, that you were at the abbey, walking rather later than uſual, meditating on the events of my paſt life, which ſeemed like a fleeting dream to my imagination, my reverie was ſuddenly interrupted by a glare of light from one of the windows on the eaſt ſide of the building. I ſtopped involuntarily; and a kind of horror, I had long been a ſtranger to, crept through every vein. I ſtood ſome minutes, as if fixed to the earth: but, knowing I could do nothing then, I made the beſt of my way to the cave, though unable to ſleep the remainder of the night, from the ideas that tormented me.</p>
                     <p>"In the morning I roſe, haraſſed and diſtreſſed. I firſt determined, if poſſible, to ſeek out who and what the inhabitants were, as I could more eaſily find out the beſt methods to terrify them from it, according to my oath, which I ſtill reſolved ſtrictly to adhere to. I went through the ſubterraneous paſſage to the room, and from thence aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to the apartment above, the next to this, in which you were all four aſſembled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="unknown:035833_0295_10093F3EC60978A0"/>
"I could not perceive the features of any perſon, but found you had taken up your reſidence here only two nights. I determined to begin my operations without heſitation, and accordingly, the latter part of the evening of the ſame day, repaired to the weſt tower, and at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, in one of the caſements, exhibited the lamp. This ceremony I performed the next night, and paſſed the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in a manner which I was certain muſt cauſe alarm, if I was ſeen. Having done this, I returned to my cave, with ſcarcely a doubt but I had frightened the viſitors from their abode.</p>
                     <p>"I found myſelf, however, miſtaken; for the next morning, in the ſubterraneous room, I heard voices, but did not then aſcend to the upper apartment. I attended rather earlier than uſual at night, and found you had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to reſt, but were at ſupper. I placed my lamp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and waited above, though unable to obſerve any one, the folding doors being quite cloſed.</p>
                     <p>"The night was ſtormy, (you no doubt, well recollect it) and I afterwards regretted the uneaſineſs I had cauſed the female part of the company. The behaviour of Mr. Maſerini appeared ſtrange and boiſterous: in ſhort, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conjectured he had been drinking freely. The conception was, I believe, right; and I muſt confeſs, at that time, it gave me no high opinion of his character. In conſequence of this idea, I did what I ſhould otherwiſe, perhaps, have omitted.</p>
                     <p>"On my firſt entrance, I heard him call for lights. His ſiſter in vain perſuaded him to retire to reſt; he ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral bumpers of wine after each other, with the avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of a madman: at length he called a name which ſtruck me almoſt ſenſeleſs. I uttered an exclamation of horror, which was drowned by a very loud clap of thunder that
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035833_0296_10093F866B11F0A0"/>
burſt over the abbey at that time. My flighty imagination, wounded by a degree of returning inſanity, urged me to think that the name of my daughter was mentioned to hurt my feelings; and this vague thought ſpurred me to terrify the author of it with more than uſual inclination. The armour that had been thrown down by Jaſper at the time we were viewing the abbey with ſignor Ranolpho, had been gathered together, and placed in the ſubterraneous room. I deſcended, and ſoon heard him drink to the 'old ghoſt that inhabited the abbey;' upon which I directly puſhed againſt the pile with all my force: it fell to the ground, and, as it did before, made a moſt violent craſh.</p>
                     <p>"I immediately aſcended to hear what emotions it had cauſed. I heard all in confuſion: every one ſeemed by the noiſe to have removed from their ſeats; upon which I immediately placed myſelf upon the trap, ready to ſink on a ſudden, if required.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Maſerini uttered the name of his father—I groaned.</p>
                     <p>"He heard it, and declared he would find from whence it came: but ſome one ſeemed to hold him. I repeated the groan.</p>
                     <p>"Two perſons approached the folding doors; they flew open: I ſtopped juſt time enough to be ſeen, and then vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>"Thus ended a night, no doubt, to you, of the greateſt horror and diſtreſs—to me of the keeneſt anguiſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; which, weighing on my mind, prevented the refreſhment of ſleep: in ſhort, the next day I was unable to leave my bed, or take any account of the abbey.</p>
                     <p>"The following morning, as I was at my prayers, you all entered on me rather ſuddenly. I, as uſual, prayed for the forgiveneſs of the ſin I had been guilty of, in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to deprive myſelf of exiſtence. I had an uncommon
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035833_0297_10093F42809EA160"/>
oppreſſion on my ſpirits; and tears, which I could not ſtifle, flowed at the recollection of events in the early part of life. I turned my head, and obſerved four perſons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled round, two of whom bore ſo ſtrong a reſemblance to the picture of the late count Orlando Maſerini, that, weak with indiſpoſition, and overcome by my own ideas, I fell ſenſeleſs on the floor. Even on my recovery from this fit, I did not, I believe, rightly recover my ſcattered ſenſes. You took your leave, and promiſed to viſit me the next day.</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſed you were inhabitants of the abbey, and had but little doubt of your near relationſhip to the family of Maſerini. My very ſoul ſeemed to cling to you: but my oath again came to my imagination, and I dreaded even the very thought of breaking it. I conſidered, if I could but adhere to that, and ſtill be of ſervice to you, I might yet die with ſome degree of happineſs. At night, as uſual, I diſplayed the light in the weſt tower, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my cave.</p>
                     <p>"According to promiſe, you were with me in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We diſcourſed on ſeveral ſubjects: Mr. Maſerini mentioned Graſville Abbey: I found myſelf confuſed, and thought I could alſo perceive ſymptoms of embarraſſment and terror in the countenances of all. Indiſpoſition again prevented me from attending with the light in the weſt tower at night. In the afternoon of the next day you viſited me again, and, no doubt, well remember our converſation.</p>
                     <p>"I adviſed you not to enter the abbey. Mr. Maſerini anſwered me rather warmly, and I found myſelf hurt: he immediately apologiſed, and we parted. I was again, at night, neceſſitated to defer the ceremony of the light, by an unexpected event, which I ſhall hereafter make known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="unknown:035833_0298_10093F8A66346928"/>
"The next day you viſited my cave; but I was abſent on the buſineſs of the preceding evening. At midnight, however, I diſplayed the light in the weſt tower, and could plainly perceive ſome one move with a lantern in the court below. Suppoſing by this that you were none of you then retired to reſt, I conceived, that, in a little time, I might venture through the apartment where you ſlept" (turning to Matilda) "to one which I have diſtinguiſhed by the name of the ſtate-chamber, which contains the beavers, feathers, &amp;c. and which was formerly hung with black, to receive the corpſe of Orlando count Maſerini, for the ſhort interval of time before he was interred.</p>
                     <p>"There is a door artfully concealed on one ſide of Miſs Maſerini's bed, which cannot poſſibly be diſcovered, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the tapeſtry that covers it: this opening leads to a private paſſage that communicates immediately with the ſtairs of the weſt tower; for I wiſhed to get to the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, without appearing on the ground-floor of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, where I naturally conceived you all were. This door I ſoftly uncloſed. I thought I heard a ſigh, and my own feelings prompted me to anſwer it twice: yet I ventured further, till I ſuppoſed the reflection of my figure with the lamp was ſeen in a large pier glaſs directly oppoſite to where I ſtood. I heard a violent ſhriek, and haſtily retired.</p>
                     <p>"I knew the key of the cabinet in this room was placed by myſelf on the remains of a decayed column in the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber. I had fixed the ſilver chain, which was hung to it, to a marble hand, which I found by chance among the broken ornaments that lay about the different apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the cap of the pillar, however, entirely concealed it from view. I had examined this cabinet, and knew there was money, jewels, &amp;c. in it, but never ſaw the manuſcript. The only account I can give for its being concealed there
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035833_0299_10093F455D8288F0"/>
is, that it muſt have been found by one of the aſſaſſins in the abbey, who (not knowing the contents, by its being wrote, perhaps, in a different language from his own) careleſsly placed it in an obſcure drawer of the cabinet; and was prevented, probably, from robbing the other parts of it, by the dread of count D'Ollifont's reſentment, or from haſte in not examining any further than where he placed the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Suffice it to ſay, that, after Jaſper's death, I found the key of it in the weſt tower; and, taking only a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial view of what it contained, fixed it in the manner and place I have before mentioned. I wiſhed to put you in poſſeſſion of it, that without violating my oath, I might in ſome reſpects aſſiſt you. It was for this purpoſe I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtate-chamber, with an intention of moving it into Mr. Maſerini's room. Being fully convinced that all were retired to reſt, I left the abbey, determining to put this ſcheme in execution the next morning.</p>
                     <p>"I accordingly attended at an early hour, and walked directly to the concealed door; when, ſtopping a moment, to liſten, I heard Mr. Maſerini and his ſiſter in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and found he reſolved to watch in the weſt tower that night. I, at a particular part of his obſervations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him, by pronouncing three times, with an ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic voice, 'Go!' to the inexpreſſible horror of both.</p>
                     <p>"A thought now entered my imagination, that I might bring every thing relative to the abbey partly to a criſis, and ſtill adhere to the vow I had made. I reſolved to let the key of the cabinet remain in the ſame place, and at night appear to Mr. Maſerini, in the apartment of the weſt tower: conceiving that if his reſolution failed him in point of ſeizing me and diſcovering the deception, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> means to lead him to the ſtate-chamber, and there diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to him the key. This, though at firſt it may ſeen
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035833_0300_10093F8CF8B9F900"/>
equivocal, I was certain would in no degree infringe on the general tendency of my oath.</p>
                     <p>"I entered the abbey at midnight, but ſtopped at leaſt an hour in the lower rooms of the tower, before I made my appearance in the upper one. At length, however, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to it, by means of one of the ſame ſort of traps which are contrived in the upper part of the building.</p>
                     <p>"I ſtood before him about a minute; but hearing ſome one on the ſtair-caſe, immediately, by the ſame means, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from his ſight.</p>
                     <p>"My ſcheme, in ſome meaſure, being fruſtrated, I made the beſt of my way to the ſtate-chamber, through the private paſſage I have before mentioned: wiſhing to regain the key of the cabinet, I wanted more light than my lamp, and accordingly lighted thoſe tapers that were placed in the different glaſſes. I had no ſooner done this, than I heard ſome footſteps approach the door: I immediately concealed myſelf behind the column that contained what I have before mentioned. The voices, I found, were thoſe of the inhabitants of the abbey. The night was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtormy; and a kind of ſhock, ſimilar to that of an earthquake, ſeemed to take effect on the room where we ſtood. I availed myſelf of this circumſtance, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately puſhed the cap of the column down, which directly diſcovered the marble hand, and key ſuſpended from it. Mr. Maſerini by theſe means procured it. I then came forward and ſtood on the trap, claſped my hands with ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy, and deſcended through the floor.</p>
                     <p>"The next morning you all viſited me: I was looking over ſome papers, of infinite conſequence to your welfare; but it was not then a time for diſcovery. I was, if you recollect, ſuddenly taken ill, with a kind of fit I have for years been ſubject to: I prayed that my life might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035833_0301_10093F46E4832718"/>
till a mighty work was effected, which was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure juſtice for the murder of Percival Maſerini, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore his children to their rights.</p>
                     <p>"I had no doubt but Mr. Maſerini would again watch in the weſt tower that night; and I accordingly appeared there in the ſame manner as before. His behaviour anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my purpoſe; he ſeized me, and diſcovered my perſon: ſecreſy, in my ideas, was now at an end: an explanation took place: I, however, put off a regular detail of events till another period, but gave him hopes of once more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored to the world and happineſs, in a manner that would at once wipe off every ſtigma that had ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed his character.</p>
                     <p>"He viſited me the next afternoon, but did not ſtop long, and only received from me further proofs that I had power and will to ſerve him. I received another viſit from miſs Maſerini alone, at midnight. My ſurpriſe may well be conceived: the interview was occaſioned by her finding of the manuſcript. I promiſed to wait on her in the morning, and explain every circumſtance, as far as I was capable. This promiſe I have now fulfilled, by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every principal event of my paſt life, which has been chequered with ſcenes of happineſs contraſted with thoſe of the moſt poignant miſery and diſtreſs."</p>
                     <p>Thus ended the hermit's tale, who, for an act of the greateſt generoſity to a villain, fell under the laſh of the ſevereſt misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>A total inconſiſtency of conduct, however, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved through the latter part of his life, occaſioned, moſt probably, by a nervous conſtitution, entirely broken by adverſity; for it was certainly ſtrange that a man of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened underſtanding, and refined education, ſhould ſo cloſely adhere to an oath, tyrannically (as it may be ſaid)

                     <p>THE miſt of doubtful horror, which had ſo long brooded over the apartments of Graſville Abbey, was now totally diſperſed, and the gloom of ſuperſtitious weakneſs diſpelled by the bright ray of truth and reaſon. The inhabitants, in ſome degree, wondered at the fears that had aſſailed them; and could not, even for a moment, reflect on them, but with a mixture of contempt and vexation at their want of fortitude to withſtand the ſhock of mere viſionary terrors.</p>
                     <p>The baron Sampieno received the united thanks of the whole company for his recital; Matilda and Agnes drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a tear at the misfortunes of the venerable orator. A ſenſation, however, they had long been ſtrangers to, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and comfort, ran through the whole aſſembly. Every myſtery, every ſupernatural idea, was elucidated to their ſatisfaction, and at once relieved them from that load of anxiety and diſtreſs they had ſo long encouraged by gloomy
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035833_0303_10093F49D1DC28A8"/>
apprehenſions. In the courſe of the converſation, Matilda alſo underſtood that the anſwer ſhe ſuppoſed to be given to her thoughts the night before, as ſhe entered the cave, was nothing more than an involuntary exclamation of the hermit's which (by the conſtruction of the place) echoed to the part where ſhe ſtood, in a kind of whiſper.</p>
                     <p>After having taken ſome refreſhments, lord Milverne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his intention of ſetting off to the reſidence of the magiſtrate, as the critical ſituation of Felix demanded that the banditti ſhould be immediately apprehended. It was reſolved that Leonard ſhould attend him, as, in ſome parts of the information, he might be uſeful. They accordingly departed, and were not expected to return till the evening, as they would be neceſſitated to accompany the guards to the ſpot, and afterwards be preſent at the examination.</p>
                     <p>The baron now began, to Alfred and his ſiſter, another narrative, which, though ſhorter, gave them nearly as much ſurpriſe and pleaſure as the former.</p>
                     <p>One night, which he mentioned, neglecting to ſhow the light in the weſt tower, he was, at an early hour, called by a voice that he had ſomewhere heard, and which ſeemed to come from the outer part of the cave. He immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the ſpot, and perceived a man whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he directly knew: he was a peaſant that had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſited him, but who had latterly not ſo often atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, on account of the indiſpoſition of a relation. The man's features carried in them the utmoſt horror and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright, occaſioned by three cauſes: firſt, his relation was dying, as he ſuppoſed; ſecondly, though he had often called upon the hermit by day-light, he had never before ventured near his habitation after dark, on account of the path leading directly to the abbey, conſequently was under conſiderable alarm; and, thirdly, that alarm was heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035833_0304_10093F911907CA88"/>
beyond meaſure, by ſeeing a light in one of the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that building, which occaſioned his calling on the hermit's name, being unable to proceed any further.</p>
                     <p>With breathleſs agitation the poor fellow related what he had ſeen, and then requeſted Father Peter would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to his cot, as he was woefully afraid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lay heavy on the mind of the ſick man that was there, who had expreſſed a wiſh to ſee a confeſſor: none, however, being there to be found, he thought of Father Peter, and had even ventured, at that hour, to procure him.</p>
                     <p>The baron, after ſome heſitation, conſented to go with him; and they accordingly walked to this man's home, where he was conducted to a room, in which, on a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, bed, lay an emaciated figure extended, and ſeemingly in the laſt ſtate of conſumption. His face was of a deadly paleneſs; his cheeks, ſunk to the very bone, were covered with a ſhrivelled ſkin; while thoſe parts of his eyes which had once been white were turned to a kind of pale yellow: his noſe and mouth, which had been no bad features, now appeared predominant ones, owing to the thinneſs of his face; while in his whole perſon was painted anguiſh and remorſe in the extreme, and a gloom at intervals, which ſhowed all joy, all hope, had forſaken his ſoul. What were the ſenſations of the baron, when this change, great as it was, did not prevent him from recogniſing the wretch Eburne! Ah! and what were the ſenſations of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, when he beheld and recollected, under the garb of a hermit, the much-injured baron Sampieno! He ſhrieked aloud, and hid his face below the bed-clothes. The cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were aſtoniſhed: the baron deſired they would leave the room; which they accordingly did.</p>
                     <p>After a few minutes, hearing every thing quiet, the wretched man raiſed himſelf; but the delirious fit he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

laboured under for ſome days before, now returned with violence. His black ſhaggy hair, diſcompoſed by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts he had made to hide from his ſight the figure before him, gave a double horror to his ghaſtly looks, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in them every appearance of inſanity. He raved, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the names of count Maſerini and his children—then the baron Sampieno—wept, and, clenching his hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſunk on the bed, exhauſted and fatigued. The ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron well knew it was uſeleſs to attempt to ſpeak while this fit of a guilty conſcience remained: he was therefore a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpectator of the ſcence, and greatly affected.</p>
                     <p>After the violent ravings of Eburne had ceaſed, he lay panting on the bed, with his eyes fixed on a vacant part of the chamber. The baron conceived this would be a good opportunity to addreſs him: he therefore drew near the bed; but Eburne again ſhrunk from him, and put out his hand, as if ſtruck with horror at his approach. The good man ſpoke in the mildeſt terms, and begged he would be compoſed: again the languiſhing eyes of the culprit were raiſed towards the venerable comforter; and again he ſhrunk back, as if the figure brought to his mind ideas that rent his very ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Two hours elapſed, during which time the baron ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him on ſeveral topics relative to religion; and his diſordered intellects gradually became more connected and regular, though he, almoſt every five minutes, gave a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive ſhudder, and a loud ſigh of anguiſh and regret.</p>
                     <p>At length the baron promiſed to call on him the next day, and left the chamber. He deſired the cottager not to diſturb his relation; but, at day-break, to ſend for the moſt eminent phyſician they could procure; and he would make up to them the expenſe. With many thanks, they promiſed to do as he deſired. He accordingly left the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035833_0306_10093F93CD718B28"/>
and, it being conſiderably paſt the time of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the tower, immediately on his return to to the cave, retired to reſt.</p>
                     <p>The remainder of the night was ſpent in a train of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy reflections on this ſtrange accident. The ſight of this man brought to his mind thoſe ſcenes of felicity and happineſs which he and his diabolical maſter had forever blaſted: yet, after the ſtate in which he had beheld the miſerable wretch, pity, in oppoſition to thoſe reflections, entered his boſom; and thoſe very ſcenes, as they more confirmed his wickedneſs, ſeemed to draw from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent heart of the baron greater concern and ſorrow for his dreadful ſituation. It was neceſſary, however, if Eburne ſurvived till morning (which ſeemed rather doubtful) that he ſhould be got into as compoſed a ſtate as poſſible, and that by perſuaſion (if perſuaſion ſhould be found neceſſary) he ſhould do what juſtice he could to the offspring of that family which he moſt probably had aided to deſtroy. The baron conſidered that he might be acquainted with the whole of D'Ollifont's tranſactions; if, therefore, he could he brought to give an explanation of them, his words might be taken down in writing; and ſuch a confeſſion (if it could be proved by reſpectable witneſſes who could anſwer for his being in a ſtate of ſanity) would nearly tend to anſwer every wiſhed-for purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Such were the baron's thoughts; and at an early hour he repaired to the cottage. A phyſician of ſome eminence was already arrived: he gave but little hopes of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, but ſaid he might probably ſurvive a few days. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne had enjoyed conſiderable ſleep for ſome hours, and ſeemed perfectly calm. The phyſician departed, after promiſing to call again in the evening.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:035833_0307_10093F4F2CAEEB48"/>
The baron now took the man who belonged to the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, on one ſide, and requeſted to know what relation E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne was to him. The man anſwered, he was a couſin of his wife's; they had always underſtood he led a very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life; nor had any acquaintance been kept up between them for many years, till about ſix months paſt, when he came to their cottage, very much diſtreſſed in mind, and labouring under every ſymptom of a decline. He fully confeſſed to them that he had been a moſt abandoned cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and claimed their pity. The cottager and his wife accordingly admitted him into their houſe; but, as his health gradually grew worſe, his melancholy increaſed. He, however, made his will, and left them the whole of the little property he was poſſeſſed of.</p>
                     <p>"Laſt night," continued the man, "he was ſuddenly taken much worſe than we had ever before ſeen him (though he has at times been deranged in his intellects for ſome days paſt) and begged I would bring him a confeſſor: I accordingly ſet off for Father Leolin; but I found he was ſome miles from Montferrat. I then thought your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would anſwer the ſame purpoſe."</p>
                     <p>The baron deſired the cottager to go into the chamber of the ſick man, and mildly inform him that Father Peter had called to ſee him; that he would give him no uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather comfort and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>The man did as he was deſired, and in about five mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes returned. "Eburne," ſaid, he, "is perfectly ſenſible, and wiſhes to ſee you: but I am ſure there is ſomething ſtrange about him; for, when I only mentioned your name, he ſtarted, as if afraid of being murdered."</p>
                     <p>The baron entered the room alone. Eburne again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſively ſhook at the ſight of him; but, being addreſſed by the mild and condoling voice of the viſitor, he ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035833_0308_10093F9666EA2498"/>
as to look on him, and liſten to what he ſaid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violent emotions.</p>
                     <p>The baron, after an hour's converſation with him, which ſeemed entirely to compoſe his mind, conceived he might venture on a topic it was before impoſſible for him to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the murder of Percival Maſerini, and alſo of thoſe doubts, relative to the count his father. He opened the ſubject with ſuch caution and mildneſs, that, though the remembrance might be ſeen to work in every feature of Eburne's face, he did not fall into any fits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanity, but continued perfectly collected during the whole of the interrogation.</p>
                     <p>At the cloſe of it, he heaved a ſigh of the moſt acute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and horror, and in ſome meaſure relieved his burſting ſoul by a flood of tears. At length he recovered ſo far as to ſpeak, and declared that Orlando count Maſerini was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; and that Percival Maſerini, his ſon, was aſſaſſinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Graſville Abbey, after having been kept there a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſome little time: "and however," ſaid he, "I may break the oath I have taken, I can no longer conceal the murderer: it was my late maſter, the count D'Ollifont. But," continued the unhappy man, "I am equally culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with him. I was privy to both tranſactions, and to every plot of villany he was concerned in, particularly that by which you were ſo great a ſufferer. Oh, my God!" he exclaimed, claſping his hands in agony, "thou only knoweſt what are my ſufferings. It is thou only canſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the pangs which drive me to madneſs."</p>
                     <p>He was near fainting: but the baron adminiſtered a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, which ſoon recovered him. He now informed Eburne that there was one eſſential way of atoning for his guilt; and that was to do juſtice to the deſcendants of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for this purpoſe it was neceſſary, as his wife was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:035833_0309_10093F51C6493120"/>
that a paper ſhould be drawn up, declaring the facts relative to both murders, which in a court of juſtice would be certain to cruſh the wretch that was the cauſe of them, and give to the children of the injured thoſe poſſeſſions they had ſo long unlawfully been deprived of. Eburne gladly and immediately conſented to the propoſal, and the more particularly ſo, when it was explained to him that the breaking of an oath in ſuch a caſe could not be deemed an act of wickedneſs, or be diſapproved of by the Supreme. The baron then drew up a paper containing all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which were related to him by Eburne, before Father Leolin, who was now arrived, and acquainted with the affair.</p>
                     <p>In the evening the phyſician arrived; and before him and the cottager, Eburne ſigned the paper; declaring it on oath to be the truth of every tranſaction it contained. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne ſeemed conſiderably better, and after ſome little time the whole company departed; the baron taking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the paper, which was the ſame he was looking over when viſited by the inhabitants of the abbey.</p>
                     <p>The confeſſion it held forth was partly as follows:—That he was taken into the ſervice of D'Ollifont when very young, ſhortly after that gentleman commenced gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler in Spain. He was ſoon diſtinguiſhed as his confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſervant, and aſſiſted him in moſt of his defrauds—that they led that kind of life till his maſter's character was well known in thoſe parts, where he reſided for ſome time—that they were neceſſitated to fly to the place where the baron Sampieno and his family reſided, and, knowing his riches, determined, if poſſible, to make him a dupe to their artifice; inſinuating himſelf into the baron's family, though he bore a deadly hatred to that nobleman: This hatred he reſolved to gratify by a diabolical ſcheme of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035833_0310_10093F9AA289E370"/>
and villany. He determined to take away by force Lucretia, the baron's only daughter; and, by ruining her honour, to make a public diſgrace and ignominy fall upon her father, which he knew would more effectually blaſt his happineſs than any pecuniary fraud he could invent. This ſcheme was fruſtrated by the baron's over-hearing a converſation which he and his maſter had on that ſubject; but which gave riſe to another opportunity for D'Ollifont to execute a ſecond fiend-like contrivance, which tended to the ſame horrid purpoſe, and which, if poſſible, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the former one in ingenuity and contrivance.</p>
                     <p>The manner and iſſue of this horrid plot againſt the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron was related by himſelf, and the ſucceſs of it anſwered but too well.</p>
                     <p>Eburne confeſſed in the teſtimony, that he was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who found means to bury ſome of the falſe notes in the baron's garden, and who, by D'Ollifont's orders, brib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of his ſervants to their intereſt. He attended his maſter to Italy, where the old count Maſerini was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed, on account of a report which had been ſpread concerning his children, who had been ſome time in France. He had been informed that Percival, his ſon, had contrived to rob the convent of N***** of a young lady of family and diſtinction, and that both, with his ſiſter, had fled.—This report ſeemed the more to be credited, as an interval of ſome time had paſſed ſince the count had heard from them.</p>
                     <p>The old gentleman was extremely ill on the arrival of his nephew, but teſtified great pleaſure at ſeeing him, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never heard of his miſconduct. He ſlowly recovered; and D'Ollifont was diſpatched to procure ſome further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of his children. It was during this journey that he made Eburne acquainted with his intentions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035833_0311_10093F228FED7BF0"/>
him large rewards if he ſucceeded. They returned to the abbey with a feigned letter, which gave information that Percival Maſerini and his ſiſter were no more; that the former fell by the hand of an officer who was going to ſecure them, and that the latter, in a fit of inſanity, had poiſoned herſelf. The letter concluded with ſaying that lady Clementina was confined in the Baſtile, on a ſuſpicion of having murdered her ſiſter, who was found dead in her bed the morning after the elopement from the convent.</p>
                     <p>The grief of the count was exceſſive, and brought on a relapſe of his former diſorder; and this, added to a ſlow poiſon, which Eburne, procured, and which D'Ollifont mixed with every ſmall quantity of food he partook of, put an end to his exiſtence, without any ſigns of murder being committed. The count made a will about two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, in which he bequeathed the whole of his eſtates and property, except a few legacies, to his nephew. Eburne, by his maſter's order, gave it out the abbey was haunted, and, the better to make this believed, D'Ollifont himſelf left it ſuddenly in the night, after the funeral of his uncle. He returned immediately to Spain, and left or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that nothing ſhould be moved from the abbey.</p>
                     <p>Eburne, however, was left behind, though it was ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the country that the abbey was entirely free from inhabitants. He each night ſhowed the light in the weſt tower, and ſecretly employed three mechanics to put the traps and machinery in order. Theſe works he ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and finding one of theſe men, whoſe name was Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio, fit for his purpoſe, retained him, by D'Ollifont's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to reſide in the ſubterraneous chamber, and ſhow the light, while Eburne departed for Spain, to come forward on the trial of baron Sampieno.</p>
                     <p>Eburne alſo confeſſed that the paſſage which formed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the abbey and the cave, the traps, &amp;c.
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:035833_0312_10093F9D5081A5A0"/>
were found out by himſelf, and the ſecrets conveyed directly to his maſter, from whom he received a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſent.</p>
                     <p>The paper next contained an account of the terms to which the baron conſented, to ſave the life of himſelf and daughter, which the reader has before been acquainted with; alſo an account of D'Ollifont's entering into a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of depredators while in Italy, whoſe birth and ſituation in life were all above the common rank, and whoſe defrauds were carried to the moſt conſiderable amount on people of rank. It was at one of their places of rendezvous, at Genoa, where the baron was introduced to D'Ollifont, at the time he took his oath. After that conference, the latter depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Spain; but Eburne ſtill remained concealed, as his agent in Montferrat, a watch upon the baron, and every circumſtance which concerned the abbey. He ſent him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that Percival Maſerini was actually arrived though, by D'Ollifont's orders, ſeveral men were placed on the roads to aſſaſſinate him.</p>
                     <p>Immediately that the keys were delivered in Spain, he ſet off from that country, and ſecretly arrived at Montferrat, where he kept concealed in the ſubterraneous room, with Eburne, Enuchio, and three men whom he had hired. It has before been mentioned that the baron was abſent many miles; which anſwered every wiſh of D'Ollifont: but he did not know that Jaſper was left behind. The reſolution of this party was, to ſeize Percival Maſerini and his ſervant, ſhould they ſearch the abbey alone; which it was rather expected they would. Enuchio and the three men were diſpatched in the day time, about three miles round the ſpot, each taking different roads, and met at the cave at an appointed hour at dark.</p>
                     <p>It was about the fifth night, when, after one of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, Enuchio brought word that Percival Maſerini,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035833_0313_10093F58D82D8788"/>
whom he perſonally knew, with his ſervant, had juſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at an inn for ſome refreſhment; and, by their manner, he judged they were coming to the abbey, as they did not ſeem inclined to ſtop, as it was now late.</p>
                     <p>Every thing, therefore, was prepared; Enuchio and two of the men were planted in the weſt tower. Eburne and another man were concealed in the hall; and the count himſelf waited the iſſue of the ſcheme, in the tomb, in which the unhappy victim was to be ſhut up. He entered the abbey, agreeably to their expectations, even unattend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſervant; and croſſed the hall without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Eburne being now certain he was within their power, he and his companion joined the count, while the unfortunate Percival aſcended to the weſt tower.</p>
                     <p>On his entrance, he was immediately ſeized by the ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: in the ſtruggle, a picture of his wife was torn by force from his boſom, with a part of the ribbon; and ſeveral drops of blood, proceeding from a blow which he received in the face, ſtained the floor: theſe were diſcovered by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, his man, when he made a ſearch after his maſter in the morning; and alſo by ſignor Balvolio, the officers of juſtice, and other perſons who attended the abbey for the ſame purpoſe afterwards. Percival Maſerini was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to the cell deſcribed by the baron, and diſcovered by Jaſper; and a ſhort allowance of food was given him each night.</p>
                     <p>A few days after, Jaſper was diſcovered to be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in Montferrat; and it was determined he ſhould be made away with, or at leaſt ſo far hurt as to prevent any interruption from him. Eburne and two of the men aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted him in one of the private avenues leading to the front gates, and left him for dead.</p>
                     <p>The next night it was reſolved between Eburne and his maſter, that a period ſhould be put to the life of their
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035833_0314_10093F9ED96DE728"/>
wretched priſoner, for fear of the baron's return. D'Olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font, however, did not wiſh any one of the men to be privy to the actual commitment of the murder: Enuchio and the others were therefore diſcharged with large preſents, and, by his deſire, departed to Spain: there they were ſeized, through the agency of an alguaſil with whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, put a-board a ſhip of war, and fell in the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
                     <p>At midnight D'Ollifont, with his own hand, ſtubbed his couſin Percival Maſerini; Eburne being unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate this laſt deed of darkneſs, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Here Eburne received a conſiderable ſum from D'Olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font, and remained in his ſervice about ſix months: when he was one night ſuddenly ſeized, and carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

and haraſſed by a guilty conſcience. He was often tempted, in defiance of the oath he had taken, to impeach his late maſter; but the doubt how ſuch an accuſation might be received from him, againſt one who was every day growing more popular in Paris, prevented this act of juſtice. He reſided in England ſome years, as ſervant to a private gentleman; but was again neceſſitated to fly, on being informed that D'Ollifont was there likewiſe, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power and inclination he had to rid the world of one who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THE baron further informed them that Eburne in the courſe of two days ſo far recovered at to be able to ſit up for ſome hours; but, after his confeſſion, he ſeemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch an impatience for his diſſolution, as indicated his mind was in ſome degree diſordered; and, on the third
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:035833_0316_10093FA437F21520"/>
morning after, he was diſcovered hanging by a cord, which he had found means to procure from a part of his bed, and fixed to a hook in the ceiling; thus adding another crime to the many that he had already committed, by an act of ſuicide.</p>
                     <p>The concluſion of this man's life held forth a ſtriking leſſon of villany and cruelty; his deſtroying of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence which he had every reaſon to ſuppoſe had nearly run its courſe, confirmed at once how much he ſuffered from the horrors of a guilty conſcience, and the effects of a truly vicious mind.</p>
                     <p>As there was now no doubt but the abbey, with all the poſſeſſions and eſtates belonging to it, was the ſole and lawful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ight of Alfred and his ſiſter, no ſcruples of honour could prevent them from making uſe of the money and other valuables that were in the cabinet: but as the baron conſidered that the whole buſineſs muſt go under a regular courſe of inſpection before the government, and count D'Ollifont be brought in the face of his country to anſwer for thoſe crimes which could now be partly proved againſt him (though the facts did not actually amount to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration) they conceived it would be better to let every article remain in the ſame place.</p>
                     <p>The baron inſiſted on their receiving from him ſupplies neceſſary for their preſent demands. It was, he ſaid, his intention, if poſſible, publicly to clear that part of his character, which had for ſo many years remained under the aſperſions of a villain; and bring his accuſations againſt D'Ollifont on the foundation of Eburne's manuſcript, which explained events relative to that affair with as much accuracy as it did the circumſtances reſpecting count Maſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini and his children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="unknown:035833_0317_10093F5D0A81BE38"/>
The baron wrote to his banker in Paris, who was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of his property, for remittances; giving him notice, at the ſame time, that he ſhould ſhortly appear in perſon, to demand the whole of his fortune. The old gentleman conſented to the entreaties of Alfred and his ſiſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the abbey, as they could eaſily have a bed made up for him in a chamber next to Alfred's.</p>
                     <p>In the latter part of the day, lord Milverne returned with Leonard and Felix: his lordſhip informed them that the banditti were taken, the men who had aſſiſted him were ſingled out, releaſed, and received from him a handſome reward, while the others were reſerved for a public trial. Lord Milverne had ſpoken to the magiſtrate (whoſe polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was extreme) concerning Alfred Maſerini's affairs; he appointed to ſee him, with his lordſhip, the next morning, and promiſed to take every method in his power, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for them their juſt and lawful right.</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip was much ſurpriſed and pleaſed to hear the account of Eburne, and the manuſcript they had got in their poſſeſſion. He congratulated them on the hopes of a very ſpeedy end to their misfortunes: nor was the baron leſs pleaſed to hear that his ſon-in-law lord Albourne, and the daughter of his one beloved Lucretia, were both known to Alfred and Matilda. Pleaſure beamed in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

The happy party aſſembled at breakfaſt at an early hour the next morning; after which they employed themſelves in taking a regular ſurvey of the abbey; and the baron ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them thoſe pieces of mechaniſm it contained, which now fully accounted for the ſtrange things they had been witneſs to. They alſo deſcended to the ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous room, and from thence walked to the cave, from which all the articles that the baron wiſhed to preſerve, were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the abbey by Leonard and Felix.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, lord Milverne and the baron now ſet off for the magiſtrate, attended by Leonard. Matilda and Agnes dined alone: and though the latter would ſometimes ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the gothic ſtructure of the room, it was with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of pleaſure and confidence, which confirmed how well ſhe was ſatisfied that every fear ſhe had before encouraged was groundleſs.</p>
                     <p>"I am now, mademoiſelle," ſaid ſhe to Matilda, "hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py indeed; and I may truly ſay that this happineſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by ſeeing all around me ſo: in ſhort, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could add to my preſent felicity, but...." Here ſhe ſtammered; the bluſh of true innocence glowed on her cheek, and heightened that pleaſing ſimplicity which grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every feature.</p>
                     <p>Matilda gueſſed the cauſe of this embarraſſment, and archly reminded her of Oliver.</p>
                     <p>The poor girl burſt into tears—</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, mademoiſelle, though I own I love Oliver, yet even the preſence of my poor mother, however ſhe may in ſome reſpects have treated me, would add to my preſent joy."</p>
                     <p>Matilda was ſtruck with her gratitude, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:035833_0319_10093F5F9DFA3990"/>
"Both your wiſhes, Agnes," ſaid ſhe, "ſhall, if in my power, be gratified. Your mother ſhall be reconciled to your marriage with Oliver, by my making him a preſent that ſhall give him importance enough to gain her good will."</p>
                     <p>"A thouſand bleſſings on you, mademoiſelle! I know not how to thank you, unleſs you will look on theſe tears as in ſome degree an acknowledgment for your goodneſs."</p>
                     <p>Felix now entered the room to take away the dinner things; which put an end to the converſation.</p>
                     <p>The latter part of the day, Alfred and his friends return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They brought with them two Italian women ſervants. One of the lower apartments was fixed for their kitchen, and they ſlept in a ſmall room next to Matilda's chamber. The magiſtrate had given them every hope of a ſpeedy iſſue to their cauſe. By their orders he was the next day to ſend off an arreſt againſt count D'Ollifont, to detain his perſon wherever found, on three ſeveral charges—firſt, for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his uncle the count Orlando Maſerini—ſecond, for the murder of his couſin Percival Maſerini and unlawfully detaining the property of his heirs to his own uſe.</p>
                     <p>The third charge was in the name of the baron Sampie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, for falſe accuſations, and defamation of character.</p>
                     <p>The magiſtrate informed them that the count's power in France was no more: he had offended the royal party by an attempt to aſſaſſinate one of their claſs, and in ſhort was in every reſpect no more than a priſoner in the country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid to leave it, though by no means wiſhing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there.</p>
                     <p>This gentleman's politeneſs was extreme: he offered the ſervices of himſelf and lady to introduce them into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, under their proper names; which was now in many reſpects abſolutely neceſſary. The next day was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035833_0320_10093FA8A0139FC8"/>
for Matilda to viſit them. The fore part of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning the baron propoſed a walk to the cottage of Eburne's relations, as he conceived both Alfred and Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ſhould be made known to them, as well as to the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and father Leolin. They accordingly viſited thoſe perſons; and all of them declared their readineſs to come forward in their behalf.</p>
                     <p>After this walk they ſet off for ſignor Salvarino's, the magiſtrate's. Agnes, however, declined the invitation to attend them, as it was her intention to ſee ſome things put in order by the ſervants, neceſſary for the reception of a large party, which Alfred had reſolved to entertain before he left the abbey.</p>
                     <p>They were received by ſignor Salvarino and his lady with the utmoſt politeneſs; ſome of the principal perſons of the place were aſſembled, purpoſely to be introduced to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and the young recluſes; and all teſtified their joy that the right heirs of the Maſerini family were now likely to be reſtored to the poſſeſſions of their anceſtors. Alfred was informed that diſpatches againſt D'Ollifont were already ſent off, and a regular proceſs in their behalf commenced againſt him. In the evening they attended a public place of entertainment, and received conſiderable applauſe from the audience; for their ſtory had already ſpread through the principal part of Montferrat.</p>
                     <p>The following day was fixed on by ſignor Salvarino, the baron, and Alfred, for the ſettlement of ſome neceſſary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances relative to the ſuit in hand. He waited on them at the abbey, and was taken all over it. Every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance was explained to him; and he ſhowed the greateſt aſtoniſhment at what he ſaw. The remainder of the day was dedicated cloſely to buſineſs. Lord Milverne was abſent on ſome of his own affairs. In the evening ſignor
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035833_0321_10093F63B238FEA0"/>
Salvarino took his leave, with an invitation to himſelf and lady, with moſt of the perſons who were preſent at his houſe, to ſpend the next day at the abbey. The whole party accordingly met at the dinner hour: they ſurveyed the building, and received an elucidation to every myſtery. Agnes undertook to manage the entertainment; and it was conducted in a manner that did her infinite credit.</p>
                     <p>They now began to make preparations for leaving Italy, as their preſence would ſhortly be abſolutely neceſſary in France. It was agreed that lord Milverne ſhould croſs over from that country to England, as he had ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns to ſettle; and, at the ſame time, make inquiries if lord Albourne and his daughter were in London, as they all conceived it probable he might return immediately after the accident of the fire at the inn. Signor Salvarino procured them an elderly man and woman to look after the abbey, and reſide there in their abſence; and in the courſe of a fortnight they ſet off on their journey, with the two Italian ſervants whom they had hired.</p>
                     <p>Before their departure the baron received the ſum he had wrote for from his banker, with a polite invitation to his houſe on their arrival at Paris. They had alſo information that the arreſt was executed againſt count D'Ollifont, and that he was now a priſoner in his own houſe.</p>
                     <p>They travelled ſlowly, and arrived in France without any particular accident. They engaged handſome apartments. Lord Milverne remained with them but three days, and then tore himſelf from the happy party; not, however, without obtaining a promiſe from Matilda, to become his immediately on his return. They alſo underſtood that D'Ollifont had been confined to his bed ſome time, and had totally loſt the royal favour. Since his arreſt he had often ſhown fits of inſanity; and it was doubted by the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035833_0322_10093FABB91C3D40"/>
phyſician whether he would ſurvive to take his trial. Signor Salvarino had given them letters of introduction to many perſons of faſhion and diſtinction in France; and thoſe, added to their being known before, procured them admittance to the firſt parties.</p>
                     <p>Before their arrival, they were informed that the charge againſt Alfred was reſcinded, even previous to the arreſt againſt D'Ollifont. They viſited the baron's banker, who introduced them to the whole of his friends.</p>
                     <p>They had been in Paris about a week, when they one evening attended the theatre: in leaving of it, as they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through one of the paſſages, a gentleman before them, ſeemingly intoxicated in a ſmall degree, was addreſſing himſelf to a young lady rather againſt her will, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally he appeared to be known to her. She had an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly lady with her: they were, however, before Alfred and the baron; conſequently, their faces could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                     <p>His importunities at length ſeemed to become exceeding diſagreeable, and his remarks carried in them ſome impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. Alfred advanced, and declared the lady ſhould not by inſulted! The gentleman turned round, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with the utmoſt ſurpriſe, "Mr. Maſerini!" no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> was Alfred's aſtoniſhment leſs to behold Henry Peviquil. The young lady turned pale at the name of Maſerini, and ſat down on a ſeat near; which gave Alfred an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to recogniſe lady Caroline Albourne, and the baron the picture of his departed wife and daughter, in the perſon of his grandchild.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, diſengaging himſelf from the levity of Peviquil ran to her aſſiſtance: but, before he could catch her in his arms, ſhe had fainted in thoſe of the lady who was with her, and who was totally unknown to both Alfred and his ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="unknown:035833_0323_10093F66B5A809C8"/>
The baron and Matilda now advanced. The former claſped the hand of the inanimate yet beautiful form, with ecſtaſy; but that ecſtaſy cauſed a tear to flow at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of her mother. A conſiderable crowd of perſons were now aſſembled round: a gentleman, who ſtood by, invited them into a room in the interior part of the theatre; which offer they gladly accepted. Henry Peviquil, eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wine, yet haggard with diſſipation, attempted to follow: but Alfred politely requeſted he would deſiſt: this he at laſt agreed to; but requeſted his addreſs, that he might call and congratulate him on his return to France.—They accordingly exchanged cards, and he directly left the place.</p>
                     <p>Matilda privately entreated the baron that he would not diſcover himſelf to lady Caroline that night, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent alarm had ſo greatly overcome her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Alfred hung over the charming invalid with a mixture of joy and concern. Her countenance was much altered ſince he had laſt ſeen her: though her beauty was not greatly diminiſhed, yet it was of that delicate and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind which plainly told ſhe had ſuffered the moſt heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt and poignant uneaſineſs. He knew, from Caroline Albourne's ſincere and artleſs conduct, that ſhe once loved him; but he alſo knew his character had ſuffered the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhock in the opinion of her father. She might now be the wife of another! The thought no ſooner darted on his brain, than its effects might be obſerved in every feature. Lady Caroline recovered, and looked round with ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe on the little party near her. She claſped the offered hand of Matilda with pleaſure: and her eyes ſpoke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Alfred, more than ſhe dared to utter.</p>
                     <p>She had accompanied her father, after the accident of the fire, into Italy; but remained there a very ſhort time.
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:035833_0324_10093FAD4FCD74B8"/>
They then returned to France, as his lordſhip conceived the climate to agree with his conſtitution, which ſtill ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the decline. The elderly lady, who was with her, had reſided in France all her life, and was a diſtant relation of lord Albourne's, at whoſe houſe his lordſhip now reſided with his daughter. They had heard of Alfred's arrival at Paris, with the information that the charge againſt him was withdrawn, and another of a very high and criminal nature brought by him againſt D'Ollifont. But lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne was now by no means ſatisfied with that part of his character which he had formerly been a witneſs to, in point of gambling: nor did he give his daughter the leaſt hopes of a favourable alteration in his ſentiments towards the young Frenchman. Alfred wiſhed them to permit him to attend them home; but this was abſolutely refuſed, as they had their viſitors and two ſervants in waiting.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, therefore, had only the conſolation of finding that ſhe was ſtill unmarried, and declaring, as he handed her to the carriage, that in a very ſhort time the whole of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct would, he hoped, be explained to lord Albourne ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily, and himſelf made the happieſt of men, by being permitted to ſolicit of her that, the very thought of which had ſupported him through every misfortune.</p>
                     <p>The baron requeſted of the old lady his lordſhip's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, having buſineſs, as he informed her, of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him the following day; and, after a rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed farewell, the whole company parted with ſtill more confuſed ideas.</p>

                     <p>SENSATIONS of pleaſure oft-times produce a train of reflections that bring with them the recollection of paſt ſcenes of happineſs, and preſent to us former objects in which our very ſoul appeared entwined in one common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and the parting of which ſeems almoſt to ſeparate ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>So it was with the baron Sampieno, at the ſight of lady Caroline. He felt that enthuſiaſtic glow of rapture which ſwells the veins of a parent at the recovery of a long-loſt and beloved child; but reflection ſoon whiſpered that ſhe was neither that beloved daughter nor wife whoſe figure ſtill floated in his brain. Every feature, every look of each of them, ſhone forth in the beautiful repreſentative he had ſeen; and the idea of what they were followed, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up thoſe trivial ſcenes of endearment, which opened wounds that for a time had been healed by the balm of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious frenzy.</p>
                     <p>Immediately on his return home, he apologiſed to Alfred and Matilda, hurried to his chamber, and gave vent to thoſe paſſions he had ſtruggled to conceal. The baron was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a degree of fortitude by no means inconſiderable: he had courage and reſolution, a refined education and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and a noble heart. Yet there was a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional weakneſs, a ſomething in his diſpoſition, which, by
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035833_0326_100937DB92B8D4D8"/>
the generality of mankind, might be called a womaniſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but by others would be looked upon as one of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of human nature. The regret, however, for the loſs of his wife and daughter, did not leſſen the tie which drew him towards his grandchild: he ſuffered that which can only be conceived by a perſon in a ſimilar ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Alfred and his ſiſter met him the next morning at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. His countenance was ſerene, yet melancholy: ſtill, however, they could perceive he anticipated the pleaſure of claſping lady Caroline to his heart, and once more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his much beloved ſon-in-law.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, though he might wiſh to accompany him, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately refuſed the invitation; but the baron requeſted that Matilda would go with them.</p>
                     <p>At rather an early hour, they were introduced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Boſivi's ſervant to the breakfaſt-room, in which were ſeated that lady, lord Albourne, and his daughter. Lady Caroline was at her harp, and his lordſhip liſtening to her harmony, while he took his chocolate. All three roſe at the entrance of the viſitors, and madame Boſivi introduced the baron as the gentleman whom ſhe had mentioned to his lordſhip the night before.</p>
                     <p>Lord Albourne bowed; and, though he ſeemed rather ſtruck with the countenance, did not recogniſe the perſon: he, however, advanced, and took the hand of Matilda.</p>
                     <p>"Believe me, miſs Maſerini," ſaid he, however, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this viſit may be, the pleaſure I receive from it is unlimited; and I am ſure Caroline will join with me in thanks for the honour you confer on us."</p>
                     <p>Matilda bowed, and returned a ſuitable anſwer to this polite compliment.</p>
                     <p>During a ſhort interval the baron's eyes were fixed, firſt on lord Albourne, and then on his daughter; while ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035833_0327_10093FD36843FBC0"/>
Boſivi, who was the moſt diſengaged of the party, thought ſhe could perceive a likeneſs between the picture of the late lady Albourne that hung over the fire-place, and the ſtranger before her.</p>
                     <p>Each being ſeated, lord Albourne, turning to the baron, requeſted to know his buſineſs; and while this requeſt was made, as he more earneſtly obſerved the features of the perſon to whom he was ſpeaking, they ſeemed to make ſome impreſſion on his memory; and a ſomething appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to croſs his mind, that occaſioned conſiderable emotion.</p>
                     <p>The baron heſitated: a kind of ſympathy worked upon both; and, while Matilda trembled with anxiety, lady Caroline and madame Boſivi looked at each other with the utmoſt ſurpriſe. The baron at length ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>"I will not ſo much wrong your lordſhip as even ſo ſuppoſe you have forgot ſome ſcenes at an early period of life; the tendency, and I may ſay, happineſs of which have, no doubt, ſtamped on your recollection ſome objects to whom you were then nearly allied, and in whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune you were much intereſted: but I am far from being ſurpriſed that my face does not call theſe circumſtances to your recollection, when I conſider the alteration that time and miſery have made in my perſon."</p>
                     <p>Lord Albourne heard no more: he claſped the offered hand of the baron with an ardour that bordered on mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, as he lifted his eyes towards heaven, he heaved a heart-felt ſigh, which, in ſome degree, relieved the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Lady Caroline and madame Boſivi ſtill remained ſilent ſpectators of this affecting ſcene; though, with Matilda, they were rather alarmed at the ſituation of his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>The baron received lord Albourne in his arms with a pleaſure that partook of paternal love. They were both
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:035833_0328_10093FB3A95FB878"/>
unable to ſpeak: his lordſhip took the hand of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and preſented her to her grandfather. Another affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene now took place, and the baron almoſt ſuppoſed he claſped the figure of his Lucretia.</p>
                     <p>After ſome time he gave them a brief account of his life ſince that period which he termed the criſis of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes—his parting with his daughter.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of this relation he oft-times had occaſion to mention Alfred, at whoſe name his lordſhip looked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and lady Caroline with anxiety.</p>
                     <p>Though lord Albourne found him ſo much prejudiced in his favour, he could not forget events he had been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to, which left behind them traits very injurious to his general character. In the courſe of their converſation they found that his lordſhip had never received any letter from the baron; but had for anſwer to inquiries which he ſent to Italy, that he was no more; nor could he ever gain any further information. To procure, however, ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his father-in-law, was one reaſon, though known only to himſelf, that induced him to lengthen his journey into Italy; but, on his arrival there, finding his health worſe, he left it rather precipitately. During the ſhort ſtay he made, he uſed every means in his power to find out ſome one who was acquainted with affairs relative to the death of the baron: but all proved ineffectual; for he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he left his villa ſuddenly, and ſettled in France, where he died. His lordſhip now gave up every thought of ſearching any further, and himſelf departed for Paris.</p>
                     <p>As a minute inveſtigation concerning Alfred's conduct could not very well be entered into before a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the baron agreed to lord Albourne's invitation to ſup that evening with him; and, after many congratulations on both ſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, they parted; not, however, without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035833_0329_10093FDA9799E690"/>
from Matilda to ſpend the next day with them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred was informed of the proceedings of this viſit, and was ſomewhat ſurpriſed and hurt at lord Albourne's doubts reſpecting his character being ſo difficult to be obliterated; but a moment's reflection ſoon ended his aſtoniſhment; he knew his lordſhip had more than once ſeen him deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in play with men notoriouſly known as profeſſed gamblers, and in every reſpect a diſgrace to ſociety. The little pique he had at firſt conceived now vaniſhed, and he admired that particularity he had before condemned. The baron attended his lordſhip at an early hour; while Alfred and his ſiſter ſpent the evening among a private party of friends.</p>
                     <p>The baron, on his return, mentioned that he had removed every objection lord Albourne had entertained againſt Alfred Maſerini, and that he had brought him an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to accompany Matilda and himſelf the next day, to dine with his lordſhip. With heart-felt joy he returned the old gentleman a thouſand thanks, who now declared he muſt ſhift for himſelf, relative to any other wiſh he had to gratify through the reconciliation.</p>
                     <p>The next day Alfred had the felicity to be received with the cordiality of ſincere friendſhip by lord Albourne, the utmoſt politeneſs by madame Boſivi, and in a manner that anſwered his moſt ſanguine expectations by lady Caroline.</p>
                     <p>They parted at rather a late hour, with an appointment for lord Albourne, madame Boſivi, and lady Caroline, to ſpend the next day but one with the baron, and, as he was pleaſed to term them, his adopted children. Alfred obtained permiſſion to call at madame Boſivi's the next morning, to inquire after their health, and, as lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne laughingly added, to ſigh away an hour with Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="unknown:035833_0330_10093FB6F9963000"/>
They found, on their return home, Henry Peviquil's card, which mentioned he ſhould call on them the next day. Tireſome as his company might be to them, common po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs dictated they ſhould receive him. At a late hour the figure of the once elegant and handſome Henry Peviquil knocked at their door, worn out in conſtitution, though, according to years, hardly in the prime of life. He was only the ſhadow of what he formely was; and his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in point of dreſs, indicated that his pecuniary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were by no means affluent; yet ſtill he was gay to a folly, and cheerful almoſt to madneſs: in ſhort, he was a profeſſed gambler, and a noted debauchee; account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Engliſhman of the firſt <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The poor innocent girl whom his curſed arts had taught to love him, entangled like the defenceleſs fly in the web of a ſpider, falls a ſacrifice to the enſnarer. Mark the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his enterpriſe: the miſerable object finds herſelf betrayed by the man whom her guiltleſs heart taught her to ſuppoſe as generous as he was inſinuating; the <hi>delicacy of virtuous women</hi> forces them to diſcard the child of affliction, and victim of unmanly cruelty; while the author of her diſgrace receives double ſplendour from the deed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035833_0331_10093FDD9E7122F8"/>
coming public, and is cheriſhed by that ſociety, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by thoſe comforts, from which he has hurled her for ever. Shameful prejudice! Though a national cuſtom, it is a diſgrace to its followers, and ſtands the criterion of a narrow mind, and unfeeling ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Henry Peviquil, as was before mentioned in the former part of this little hiſtory, did not, when he found Matilda forſaken by her friends (at leaſt by thoſe who ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves ſuch) behave to her in a manner altogether conſiſtent with rectitude or politeneſs; and his manners at laſt became rude and inſulting. He once had the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity to make propoſals which gave her the moſt ſerious alarms while ſhe remained in his power. The ſcene was entirely changed; the diſtreſſed orphan of the Maſerini family, deſpiſed by his mother, contemptuouſly treated by his ſiſter, forgot by his father, and inſulted by himſelf, was now poſſeſſed or in every reſpect likely to be poſſeſſed of rank, fortune, and friends. Even the aſſurance of Henry Peviquil, now quite ſober, could not overcome a little embarraſſment as he addreſſed them; he, however, ſoon got the better of this vulgar failing.</p>
                     <p>For fear, however, that the ſpirit or honour of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed gentleman ſhould be called in queſtion for thus ſeeking to recommence an acquaintance he formerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and with perſons who received his offers of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with that coolneſs which could not prompt him to go on with the purſuit, it will be neceſſary to inform the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he had intereſt in view: beſides gratifying his pride, to claſs them among other perſons of diſtinction whom he could familiarly nod at in public places of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, or chat with at the rout of a woman of faſhion, he was actuated by another motive, more powerful by far; he knew Alfred had loved play; he was himſelf a perfect
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035833_0332_10093FB883B54F70"/>
maſter of the art, and was well acquainted with the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful infatuation that encircles the votaries to that way of deſtruction; therefore, whatever he might have heard rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his having entirely given up the gaming-table, he conceived to be merely fabulous, and only raiſed either to introduce him to lord Albourne's eſteem, or to be of ſervice in the intended trial. Now Henry Peviquil knew, if he could but once more draw him among thoſe ſcenes he had formerly frequented, he would prove a very fit perſon to become a dupe to his artifices; and this was the more to be deſired, as he had juſt entered into a party ſomething ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to that in which D'Ollifont had been engaged, and into which the baron Sampi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MATILDA now propoſed a viſit which ſhe had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation ever ſince their arrival in France, which was to the mother of Agnes. She li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed ſome diſtance from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Accordingly the fair fugitive and herſelf ſet off the next day, attended by one ſervant; while the baron and Alfred were engaged to dine with lord Albourne. They that morning received a letter from lord Milverne, which mentioned his having made every inquiry relative to his lordſhip and lady Caroline, but that all his endeavours proved uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>Alfred had, however, diſpatched a letter to inform him of their unexpected diſcovery, and his own happineſs; which he ſuppoſed would have come to his hands before the date of his from England.</p>
                     <p>Agnes and Matilda purſued their journey, and, after a day's quick travelling, found themſelves at the place of their deſtination. The heart of the former throbbed with various emotions: love, fear, joy, and doubt, alternately poſſeſſed her boſom; while the effects might clearly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in her countenance. The ſervant knocked at the door, and a young girl, whom Agnes did not know, opened it. She inſtantly exclaimed, "My mother is dead!"</p>
                     <p>Unable to proceed further, ſhe nearly fainted. Matilda, with as much compoſure as ſhe could aſſume, aſked if the perſon who inhabited that cottage ſome months paſt, was living.</p>
                     <p>The girl anſwered, "Yes, and within."</p>
                     <p>Agnes claſped her hands in ecſtaſy. Matilda firſt alighted, and entered. A middle-aged woman was ſeated
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035833_0334_10093FBB9A632468"/>
knitting: ſhe aroſe at the entrance of the ſtranger, and ſeemed rather confuſed.</p>
                     <p>"You had," ſaid Matilda, "a daughter?"</p>
                     <p>She changed colour, and could hardly articulate "Yes." "And you loſt her?"</p>
                     <p>She with ſtill greater difficulty repeated the ſame anſwer.</p>
                     <p>The converſation proceeded no further: Agnes ruſhed into the room, and was inſtantly in the arms of her mother.</p>
                     <p>Tears relieved them both, and the latter then requeſted to know by what act of providence ſhe was thus bleſſed beyond expreſſion. Matilda related to her moſt of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that had happened to her daughter ſince ſhe left the cottage, and concluded with an inquiry after M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Le Selet.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion confuſed her greatly; and, after a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe replied, ſhe had ſeen him but once ſince her daughter left her; but had heard he was dead.</p>
                     <p>Matilda now turned the diſcourſe relative to her behaviour to that gentleman and her child. Her words carried in them a ſevere rebuke to the imprudent mother, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be perfectly convinced of her error, and declared ſhe had not enjoyed one moment of felicity ſince her daughter's elopement, torn as ſhe was with remorſe for her cruel conduct towards her.</p>
                     <p>Oliver, they underſtood, was well, and lived only for Agnes. He was ſent for; and their meeting can only be conceived—not deſcribed.—Matilda experienced the moſt heart-felt pleaſure in ſettling every point with the old lady relative to their marriage, and rewarding this faithful and truly innocent girl with the beſt gift ſhe could beſtow on her, a good huſband. She gave Oliver an invitation to return with Agnes to Paris (who was to ſtay with her mother a few days) when they ſhould be united, and he
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035833_0335_10093FE26E7D0040"/>
receive with his bride a portion ſufficient to put them into a way of life that with induſtry would procure them every neceſſary and comfort they could wiſh to poſſeſs.</p>
                     <p>Matilda remained at the cottage that night; the next day returned alone, and joined Alfred and the baron at madame Boſivi's in the evening, where they were engaged to ſupper. Here ſhe was informed that it had been reported the whole day that D'Ollifont was no more: it was not, however, by any means confirmed.</p>
                     <p>On their entering their lodgings they were told by the ſervant that a ſtrange gentleman had called, who parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly wiſhed to ſee Mr. Maſerini, or the baron. In vain they endeavoured to imagine who it could be; their efforts were fruitleſs, and they retired unſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>They had juſt ſet down to breakfaſt the next morning, when they were informed the ſame gentleman requeſted to be admitted. He was accordingly introduced; but he was entirely unknown to them all. His dreſs was plain; yet there was much of the gentleman in his manner, and he ſeemed to be in the decline of life. They politely aſked to know his buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>"My buſineſs," he anſwered, "is rather of a ſtrange nature; and the character I come under, will, I doubt, give you no very good opinion of my honour or integrity."</p>
                     <p>Alfred, Matilda, and the baron, were aſtoniſhed.</p>
                     <p>"I am, continued the viſitor, "the ſteward of count D'Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifont."</p>
                     <p>They were ſtill more ſurpriſed.</p>
                     <p>"I perceive your countenances change," ſaid he. "But ſuſpend your exclamations for a moment, while I inform you, not now of the murderer or uſurper of another's right, but the dying guilty wretch, who waits, with all the horrors of a hell before him, to receive the awful change that plunges him into eternity."</p>

They were in ſome degree affected, and he was requeſted to be ſeated.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" he cried, "I am not without my ſhare of miſery, which fell on all that came within his deſtroying power. My name is calumniated for ever: by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude I am called the confidant of a fiend whom I deteſt as much as they, but whoſe infernal ſnares beguiled my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting ſoul, and hurled me to deſtruction. Yet I now come to fulfil his laſt requeſt. Before his eyes are cloſed for ever, he wiſhes to behold, what I ſhould ſuppoſe would blaſt his very ſight—the baron Sampieno, Mr. Maſerini, and his ſiſter."</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to conceive the amazement of all three.</p>
                     <p>"The count," he continued, "four days ago made his will, in which he reſigns all right to the eſtates of his late uncle; and, in ſome degree, to make what poor reparation is in his power, he has bequeathed the whole of his fortune, except ſome ſmall annuities in charity, to be equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the baron and the two ſurviving heirs of the Maſerini family. The amount of this property is nearly ſixty thouſand pounds. No ſcruples need prevent your receiving it, ſince it has not been accumulated by the frauds he has been guilty of, but by the favour he was once in at the court of France."</p>
                     <p>He begged to know their determination; for, if they conſented to the wiſhes of the dying man, he would himſelf conduct them at any hour of the day they choſe to appoint. It required ſome little time to reſolve; but at length com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the ſufferings of the criminal D'Ollifont overcame every other argument againſt the viſit, and they fixed three o'clock that day.</p>

They conſidered that at all events there could be no danger whatever in this requeſt, as officers of juſtice reſided in the houſe. They, however, determined to take two of their own ſervants. The perſon whom they had juſt ſeen, was, they had no doubt, Rabourn, whom they had heard lord Milverne mention in no very favourable manner; but they had found, ſince their reſidence in Paris, that his character had been cleared by D'Ollifont's own confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>At three o'clock Rabourn arrived, and all four ſet off in the baron's carriage, attended by two men, to the count's manſion. Their ride was ſhort, as he lived at no great diſtance from their own reſidence.—During the time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they underſtood by the ſteward that he was much worſe than in the fore part of the day, and that he left him in ſtrong convulſions; he therefore conceived (as the ſight of him might be too great a ſhock to miſs Maſerini's feelings) that ſhe had better not enter his chamber, unleſs he ſhould ſo far recover as to mention again a wiſh to ſee her. This was ſettled, and they preſently ſtopped at the houſe.</p>
                     <p>They were conducted through a ſuperb hall into an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant apartment: the ſervants were deſired to follow, and remained here with them, while Rabourn went into the ſick man's chamber, which was the next room. He retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and informed them his convulſions were gone off, but he was afraid he was ſpeechleſs; though he ſeemed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to look as if he wiſhed to know whether they were come. Matilda begged to remain where ſhe was, unleſs he ſhould, by ſigns or words, expreſs a deſire to ſee her.</p>
                     <p>The ſteward led the way; Alfred and the baron follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through a pair of folding doors, to an elegant bed-room, beautifully furniſhed in the richeſt taſte. At the further end was the count's bed, of crimſon ſatin, with gold trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings. Two phyſicians, two nurſes, a confeſſor, and three
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:035833_0338_10093FC321D40CA8"/>
ſervants, ſtood round, and, at intervals, adminiſtered cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials to their patient. The curtains were pulled on one ſide; and, extended on the bed, lay the wretched man, ſurrounded with elegance, clothed in the fineſt linen, and reclined on a matraſs of down. But what were the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the paltry elegances, that ſurrounded him? Could the ſtructure of the room, the beauty of the furniture, the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the canopy under which he lay, or the downy ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his bed, give to him that comfort, that conſolation or fortitude, which the awful criſis required?</p>
                     <p>Alas! no; every moment did the trembling victim of guilt and ambition expect to ſee the gilded ſcene of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pride vaniſh into darkneſs, and that darkneſs open to him he knew not what—but which it was hell to him only to conceive.</p>
                     <p>Alfred and the baron advanced ſlowly. D'Ollifont's eyes turned upon them: a kind of cold ſhivering ſeized him, and drops of perſpiration appeared on his forehead, which one of the nurſes dried off with a muſlin handkerchief.</p>
                     <p>During the courſe of his diabolical exiſtence, many were the ſighs he had wrung from the widow, the fatherleſs, and the unprotected; yet the damp muſlin that received theſe guilty drops of horror and remorſe of conſcience, might be ſaid in ſome meaſure to atone for the innocent tears he had drawn from female diſtreſs. Who could tell his pangs, the inward workings of his ſoul? Who could tell the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive terror that ſhook every limb? Who could tell his ſecret thoughts that blaſted every hope?</p>
                     <p>His ſenſes failed him the moment the viſitors appeared. His convulſions returned with double force, and a fourth ſervant was obliged to be called in, to aſſiſt the others in holding him. He raved on the names of Maſerini and Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieno; then, ſpent with exertion, bit his under lip with
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035833_0339_10093FEA34C4A2F0"/>
ſuch violence that blood flowed abundantly from his mouth.</p>
                     <p>His ravings again returned. By a ſudden ſnatch he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged himſelf from hold; and, with a kind of exultation in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Such was the end of the moſt tyrannical, cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled villain—a diſgrace to the world, a ſcourge to his fellow-creatures, and a curſe to himſelf. Ambition was the bait that beguiled him: and that ambition did but mock him when he lay a disfigured corpſe under the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an elegant canopy.</p>
                     <p>Alfred, the baron, and Rabourne, withdrew to the next apartment, all greatly ſhocked. They were informed that Matilda was in one of the lower rooms; the cries of the dying D'Ollifont were too much for her.</p>
                     <p>The news of the count's death was no ſooner told than the whole houſe was in conſiderable confuſion, and the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron requeſted to know who was to have the management of his affairs. The ſteward informed them, the will mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſhould be jointly executed by Mr. Maſerini and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He aſſured them every thing was left in ſo exact a manner that it would occaſion them very little trouble.—The count, before their arrival, had confeſſed every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance relative to the murders, which would, without any trial, put them at once into poſſeſſion of their right.</p>
                     <p>Rabourn produced the will, and it contained every thing he had mentioned. After having inveſted him with po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give all neceſſary orders relative to the funeral and other matters, they departed to their lodgings.</p>
                     <p>The diſagreeable ſcene they had juſt witneſſed, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid by the ſight of lord Milverne, who received Alfred's letter the very day he ſent off his own, and followed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediately.</p>
                     <p>

He congratulated them on the fortunate concluſion of their affairs, though he declared he was malicious enough to wiſh theſe events had happened after his alliance with Matilda, that he might have been able to have proved to the world the diſintereſtedneſs of his love.</p>
                     <p>That evening he accompanied them to madame Boſivi's. Lord Albourne received him as an old friend, lady Caroline, as an acquaintance whom ſhe had much eſteem for, and madame Boſivi, with the utmoſt politeneſs.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to conceive a more happy party than the perſons who then ſat down to ſupper. The recollection of their paſt misfortunes endeared to them their preſent felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and they all agreed that a life tinctured with adverſity, receives that glow of happineſs which an inſipid medium never produces.</p>

                     <p>THAT virtue and vice are their own rewards, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb generally allowed; it is certainly founded on truth, and exemplified in almoſt every occurrence of life.</p>
                     <p>It requires but little obſervation, to perceive that the comforts, even the ſuperfluities of the world, procured by means not conſiſtent with the moral government of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, loſe the chief part of thoſe allurements which tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poſſeſſor to gain them by illicit tranſactions. The man who partakes of a ſcanty, hard-earned meal by his own induſtry, enjoys more than he who eats of the ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repaſt, at the expenſe of a fellow-creature's miſery and oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>This poſition was proved in D'Ollifont, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſufferers by his villany, the baron, Alfred, and his ſiſter: by accounts they now heard from Rabourn, the count underwent far more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the ſevereſt laſh of adverſity: for he was tortured by a guilty conſcience, and haunted by phantoms of a diſturbed and diſordered brain.</p>
                     <p>His funeral was conducted by the ſteward, who in the will was left a ſmall but decent competency; and to it Alfred, his ſiſter, and the baron, added a conſiderable ſum. The legacies were many of them overpaid, by their joint conſent, to thoſe who were in want of it. In a very ſhort time all the affairs were properly ſettled, and the children of the Maſerini family became poſſeſſed of all their right, by a ſhort though regular proceſs in law. Agnes and Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returned at the time appointed; the latter was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the baron, and Alfred (now count Maſerini) and received from them no inconſiderable marks of favour.</p>
                     <p>Matilda conceived it would be proper Agnes's mother ſhould be ſent for, to be preſent at her daughter's marriage, which was conſummated about a fortnight after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Paris. She returned the count and his ſiſter a thouſand thanks, and received from both a handſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It was now determined, Oliver and his wife ſhould ſet off for Graſville Abbey. Count Maſerini intended to have it put in repair, and fixed upon him as a proper perſon to ſuperintend them, as he had been originally brought up in that line; for Leonard, who was ſtill there, was too much advanced in years to take the care upon himſelf. It was, however, left entirely to their own inclination, and they both gladly accepted the offer.</p>
                     <p>It was about a week after their departure, when the count Maſerini and lady Caroline Albourne, lord Milverne and Matilda, were on one day united. Lord Albourne and the baron ſighed at the altar, and could hardly ſtifle a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> he had for ever loſt, when deprived of the affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate tie of parental tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>Both the count and lord Milverne now ſaw themſelves poſſeſſed of every happineſs they could even form a wiſh to have procured: this thought, as it croſſed the mind of the former, by a rain of ideas incident to it, brought to his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination that moment, when, with the ſword of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted father, he was going to put an end to his exiſtence in a ſit of phrenſy and deſpair. He bluſhed at the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an event which he now almoſt ſhuddered to think of; it held forth to him a ſtriking leſſon againſt a want of fortitude, and a raſh unmanly precipitation.</p>
                     <p>They remained at Paris but a week after the marriage, and then ſet off for England, as it was their invention to ſpend in London the remainder of the winter ſeaſon (which was now juſt commenced) return to France about June, and the latter end of the year proceed to Graſville Abbey, which would by that time be ready for their reception.</p>
                     <p>Their arrival in this metropolis was immediately known in the faſhionable world; and one of the firſt parties that received the general whiſper, was that of lady Peviquil. They had ſlept in their houſe in Berkley-ſquare but one night, when the next morning their breakfaſt table was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with cards of invitation and congratulations from different quarters, and among them one from ſir Anthony and his lady.</p>

Moſt of the perſons whoſe names they mentioned, called in the courſe of the morning, and formed a complete groupe or levee; the chief part of which had ſhunned them with adverſe eyes in the chilling part of their misfortunes, but who now courted their acquaintance with a ſycophantic earneſtneſs, when they found them encircled by the warm rays of proſperity and affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

All theſe were received with a very cool and diſtant civility, and among them was lady Peviquil, who, with the true deceitful ſimper of a courtier, deſcended from an elegant equipage, and, forcing her way through a crowd of the great world to the upper end of the drawing-room, in the moſt whining tone of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs declared herſelf "happy beyond expreſſion at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them returned to England." Her compliments were received as thoſe of a perſon whom they had never before ſeen; and her ladyſhip had the mortification to return with her pride extremely hurt at the reception ſhe received.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpent the allotted time in London with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happineſs and felicity, their time equally divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſelect friends and public places of amuſement, they returned to Paris, and the hours floated, away here in the ſame round of enjoyment.

                     <p>At their return to Graſville Abbey they found all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs finiſhed entirely to their liking; and though the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was by no means robbed of its gothic elegance in the external part, yet it was made far more convenient and comfortable in the internal: the chapel was handſomely fitted up, and a tomb erected to the memory of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

mother and aunt. They found the good old Leonard in perfect health; and his happineſs at ſeeing them was extreme.</p>
                     <p>The count received a promiſe from lord Milverne and his ſiſter that they would ſpend three months in every year with them at the abbey. It was ſettled the baron and lord Albourne ſhould do the ſame; Paris agreed with them both far better than Italy; and they determined to live together the remainder of their lives.</p>
                     <p>The manſion of D'Ollifont was fixed on for their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and madame Boſivi conſented to take the care of their houſehold upon herſelf. No great diſtance from it lord Milverne bought an elegant chateau, which both himſelf and Matilda determined to make their general reſidence; though his lordſhip made her promiſe to ſpend ſome little time every two years in England.</p>
                     <p>Both lord Milverne and the count had the felicity, about twelve months after their marriage, to claſp to their boſoms, under the tender title of father, a blooming infant; the former a girl, the latter a boy. The families were ſeldom divided; for, when lord Milverne and his lady, with the baron and lord Albourne, had ſpent the allotted time with the count, both he and the counteſs, after a very ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, returned the viſit at Paris.</p>
                     <p>Agnes and Oliver, as ſoon as the repairs were entirely finiſhed at Graſville Abbey, returned to lord and lady Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne at Paris; the latter was made ſteward and principal overſeer of the chateau, while his wife was the favourite and friendly attendant of Matilda.</p>
                     <p>Leonard remained at Graſville Abbey; and, being too much advanced in years to take upon himſelf the office of ſuperintendant, lived in it with a ſervant to attend him, received a handſome income from the count, and an annual preſent from lady Milverne.</p>

The principal perſons of this little hiſtory enjoyed their preſent happineſs, by a recollection of former ſcenes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, which taught them to feel for the unfortunate, and at the ſame time gave them the higheſt gratification, by being enabled to alleviate their diſtreſſes.</p>
                     <p>Sir Anthony and lady Peviquil continued their round of faſhionable folly, till age impeded their courſe, and caſt an inſipidity on thoſe ſcenes which had conſtituted the chief pleaſure of their lives. No relief opened itſelf to their view; diſſipation had been their whole ſtudy; and, when that failed, their exiſtence became a burthen.</p>
                     <p>Void of all fortitude, diſguſted with each other, and the world in general, they ſunk into their grave much about the ſame time, and with the ſame horrors before them; leaving behind but juſt property enough to pay their debts, and bury them in the pompous manner they had ordered.</p>
                     <p>Henry Peviquil continued his run of gambling in France for near four years, when he became ſo notorious in that country as to be obliged to quit it for England. From his father, however, he could get no aſſiſtance; and, after a period of eight years, during which time he ſubſiſted by common ſwindling, he was taken up for a highway robbery, received ſentence of death, but took the king's mercy by accepting tranſportation, and died on the voyage.</p>
                     <p>His ſiſter lived with the Italian marquis before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for about two years; when ſhe eloped with his valet de chambre into Switzerland, where he uſed her exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ill; and, for an attempt on his life, ſhe was obliged to fly to a remote part of the country, was ſuddenly taken ill, and died in her twenty-eighth year.</p>
                     <p>Oliver and Agnes led a life of the utmoſt ſerenity and comfort: they had ſeveral children, which proved a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to their increaſing years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The good old Leonard enjoyed but a few years of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he however lived to ſpend ſome time with every bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he could wiſh, and to ſee all thoſe ſcenes realiſed that his moſt ſanguine ideas could have formed.</p>
                     <p>Lord Albourne died about twelve years after his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters's marriage; the baron felt moſt ſeverely his loſs; in ſhort, this might be ſaid to be the firſt event that occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any conſiderable damp on the happineſs of the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. The chief part of his lordſhip's fortune was left to his daughter, and a conſiderable legacy to lord and lady Milverne.</p>
                     <p>The baron Sampieno, after lord Albourne's death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided with lord Milverne, as madame Boſivi died of an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy a few months before his lordſhip. He lived to a very advanced age, bleſſed with years of happineſs, that might be ſaid in a great meaſure to repay him for former misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. He left the whole of his fortune between the count and lord Milverne.</p>
                     <p>The count and counteſs of Maſerini, with lord and lady Milverne, enjoyed a long ſeries of happineſs and felicity. They had each ſeveral children, and lived to ſee them prove an ornament to their rank and the community at large. Time heightened their bleſſings, and their declining years were like a ſetting ſun, which gathers freſh ſplendour as it gradually vaniſhes from our ſight.</p>
