            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<q>I have ease and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the extent of my wishes, and can form de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of nothing but what my father's indulgence would procure: and I ask nothing of Heaven but the good old man's life. The perfect sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his life, and the benevolence of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, make him a refuge to all in distress, to the widow and fatherless: The people load him with blessings and prayers when ever he goes abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he never does but to reconcile his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or to right the injur'd and oppressed; the rest of his hours are entirely devoted to his private devotions, and to books, which are his perpetual entertainment.</q>

            <p>He was religiously inclin'd, as he said himself, when about ten years old, and never from that time neglected prayer; and as far as he knew his own heart, had sincerely endeavour'd to keep a good conscience; and he dy'd as he had liv'd <hi>April</hi> 18. 1719. full of that blessed calm and peace

of mind and humble confidence in the mercy of God, through a Redeemer (for there was his trust) which a long course of active virtue, and constant lively devotion, join'd with the most generous and exalted ideas of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, free from all mixtures of a gloomy, sullen superstition, may be expected to produce: For he was not of those who confine that infinite benignity which loves to diffuse itself abroad, unrestrain'd in its salutary influences by every thing else but the wilful opposition of reasonable and free beings, to the methods used for their recovery and happiness. And this it was that help'd, no less than a happy natural temper, to make him so chearful a christian. A worthy and intimate friend of his, and witness to the heroic and christian manner in which he finish'd life, observes, that he settled his affairs, and took leave of the world with the same freedom and composure, as if he had been setting out on a journey; was peculiarly careful that the widows and orphans, with whose concerns he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, might not be injur'd after he was gone; convers'd, tho' under great bodily disorders, with those that came to see him, who were not a few, in the easiest, freest manner; spent his time in praising and blessing God, and praying to him, and giving good counsel to those about him; shew'd an uncommon sweetness and patience in his behaviour; and was exceeding thankful to those who did the least thing for him, tho' they ow'd him a great deal more.

            <p>I have been the larger in this account of Mr. <hi>Singer,</hi> not only in justice to so deserving a character, but because of the singular veneration which the person who is the chief subject of these papers, had for it; which was such that she fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pleads her relation to it, and, as it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> glories in it, in her private devotions.

'Twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible there should be a drowsy soul where Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> was present; he animated the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, every one was awake, and every one pleas'd. He had a penetration, and quickness of thought, hardly to be imagin'd, so as upon just glancing over an author, to see to the bottom of his senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. None of the politer kinds of learning were neglected by him. He was a good judge in poetry, and had it in his power to have been himself an eminent poet; for he had actually the most essential parts belonging to that character, the <hi>vivid fire,</hi> the <hi>rich vein,</hi> the <hi>copious diction</hi>; but, as poetry was not his predominant inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his genius had not all the polishing which art and constant practise might have added to nature. History was his favourite study, for which his talents of a vast memory, before taken notice of, and an exquisite judgment, for one of his years, peculiarly qualified him.</p>
            <p>He had form'd a design to compile the lives of all the illustrious persons in antiquity, omitted by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and for this purpose read the ancient historians with great care. This design he in part

executed. Eight lives were publish'd since his decease, by way of supplement to that admired Biographer; in which, tho' so young a guide, he strikes out his way like one well acquainted with the dark and intricate paths of antiquity. The style is perfectly easy, yet concise and nervous, the reflections just, and such as might be expected from a lover of truth and mankind; and the facts interesting in themselves, or made so by the skill used in relating them. There's a preface by the reverend and learned Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> writ after the usual manner of that agreeable and lively author, with great spirit and elegance, and worthy of the excellent person for whose memory he expresses so high an esteem. <hi>He must be insensible to true merit</hi> (saith the ingenious prefacer) <hi>and to all just regards to the public good, that can look over these valuable remains, without finding in himself a due respect and esteem rais'd for the author, and his own heart in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s exalted merit and amiable qualities could not fail to inspire the most generous and lasting passion. Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> knew how to value that treasure of wit, softness and virtue, which the divine providence had given to his arms in the most lovely of women, and made it his study to repay the felicity with which she crown'd his life. The esteem and tenderness he had for her is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible, and possession seemed scarce to have abated the fondness and admiration of the lover. 'Twas some considerable time after his marriage, that he wrote to her a very tender ode, under the name of <hi>Delia,</hi> full of the warmest sentiments of connubial friendship and affection; in which the following lines may appear remarkable, as it pleased heaven to dispose events in a manner so agreeable to the wishes expressed in them.</p>

            <p>As Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> had not a robust natural consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, so an intense application to study beyond what the delicacy of his frame would bear, might, perhaps, contribute to that ill-state of health, which allayed the happiness of his marriage life, during the greater part of it. In the latter end of the year 1714, his weakness encreased, and he appeared to labour under all the symptoms of a consumption. This fatal distemper, after it had confined him some months, cut off the fairest hopes of his doing great honour and service to his country, and put a period to his life, <hi>May</hi> 13, 1715, when he was but just past the twenty-eighth-year
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006232_0031_102817105DB10F18"/>
of his age. He died at <hi>Hampstead,</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> where he had resided some time for the benefit of the air; and was buried in the vault belonging to his family, in the coemetery in <hi>Bunhill fields</hi>; where on his tomb are only mark'd his name, and the date of his birth and death. But an inscription of greater pomp is rendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary by the honour Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> did his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in the Elegy she wrote on his death, which is deservedly ranked among the most admirable of her poetical works.</p>
            <p>The exquisite grief and affliction Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> felt for his loss, is described with such beautiful and unaffected eloquence in the poem I have just men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and several of the letters inserted in the following collection, that I shall only add on this subject, that she continued to the last moments of her life to express the highest veneration and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his memory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a particular regard and esteem for his relations, several of whom she honour'd with a long and most intimate friendship. 'Twas also but a short time before her death, she shewed how incapable she was of forgetting him, by shedding fresh tears on occasion of the mention of his name.</p>
            <p>'Twas only out of regard to Mr. <hi>Rowe,</hi> that with his society she was willing to bear <hi>London</hi> during the winter season; and as soon after his decease as her affairs would permit, she indulged her unconquerable inclinations to solitude, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring to <hi>Frome</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of which place the greater part of her estate lay. When she forsook the town, she determined to return to it no more, but to conceal the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006232_0032_102817E2A9055F90"/>
of her life in an absolute retirement; yet on some few occasions she thought it her duty to violate this resolution. In compliance with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate requests of the honourable Mrs. <hi>Thynne,</hi> she pass'd some months with her at <hi>London,</hi> after the death of her daughter the Lady <hi>Brooke</hi>; and on the melancholy occasion of the decease of Mrs. <hi>Thynne</hi> herself, she could not dispute the commands of the Countess of <hi>Hertford,</hi> who earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desired her to reside some time with her at <hi>Marlborough,</hi> to soften, by her conversation and friendship, the severe affliction of the loss of so excellent a mother: And I think, once or twice more, the power this last illustrious Lady had over Mrs. <hi>Rowe,</hi> drew her, by an obliging kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to spend a few months with her at some of the Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi>'s seats in the country. Yet even on these occasions she never quitted her retreat without very sincere regret; and always returned to it again as soon as ever she could, with decency, disengage herself from the importunity of her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friends.</p>
            <p>'Twas in this recess that she composed the most celebrated of her works, <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>is</hi> (as the ingenious author of the preface expresses it) <hi>to impress the notion of the soul's immortality, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all virtue and religion, with their temporal and eternal good consequences, must fall to the ground; and to make the mind familiar with the thoughts of our future existence, and contract, as it were, an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abitual persuasion of it, by writings built on that foundation, and addressed to the affections and imagination.</hi> It may also be added, that the design both of <hi>these,</hi> and the <hi>Letters Moral and Entertaining,</hi> is, by ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious examples of the most generous benevolence and heroic virtue, to allure the reader to the practice of every thing that ennobles human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and benefits the world; and by just and lively images of the sharp remorse and real misery that attend the false and unworthy satisfactions of vice, to warn the young and unthinking from being seduced by the enchanting name of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to inevitable ruin; the piety of which design is the more worthy of the highest panegyrics, as it is so uncommon. The greater part of the poets of our country have apparently employed all their wit and art to disguise the native deformity of vice, and strew flowers on the paths to perdition. But this excellent lady (as was observed of an <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Cowley.</hi>
               </note> eminent genius of the last age) <hi>possessed so much strength and firmness of mind, and such a perfect natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goodness, as could not be perverted by the largeness of her wit, and was proof against the art of poetry it self.</hi> The elegant <hi>Letters</hi> which gave occasion to remark this distinction in Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s character as a polite writer, are not only chaste and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006232_0034_102816C634C4C230"/>
but greatly subservient to the interest of heaven, and evidently designed, by representing virtue in all her genuine beauty, to recommend her to the choice and admiration of mankind.</p>
            <p>In the year 1736, the importunity of some of Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s acquaintance, who had seen the <hi>History of Joseph</hi> in manuscript, prevailed on her (though not without real reluctance) to suffer it to be made public. She wrote this piece in her younger years, and when first printed, had carried it on no farther than the marriage of the hero of the poem; but at the request of her friends (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of an <note n="‡" place="bottom">The Countess of <hi>Hertford.</hi>
               </note> illustrious lady, to whom she could scarce refuse any thing) that the relation might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Joseph</hi>'s discovery of himself to his brethren; she added two other books, the composing of which, I am inform'd, was no more than the labour of three or four days. This additional part, which was her last work, was published but a few weeks before her death.</p>
            <p>This grand event, to prepare for which she had made so much the business of her life, befel her, according to her wish, in her beloved recess. She was favoured with an uncommon strength of constitution, and had pass'd a long series of year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with scarce any indisposition severe enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine her to her bed. But about half a year before her decease, she was attacked with a distemper, which seemed to herself as well as others, attende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to meet death, as usual; yet when, by devout contemplations on the atonement and mediation of our blessed Redeemer, she had fortified herself against that fear and diffidence, from which the most exalted piety does not always secure in such an awful hour, she experienced such divine satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and transport, that she said, with tears of joy, <hi>she knew not that she had ever felt the like in all her life</hi>; and she repeated, on this occasion, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s verses, entitled, <hi>The Dying Christian to his Soul,</hi> with an air of such intense pleasure, as evidenced that she really felt all the elevated sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of pious ecstasy and triumph, which breathe in that exquisite piece of sacred poetry. After this threatning illness, Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> recovered her usual good state of health; and tho' at the time of her decease she was pretty far advanced in age, yet her exact temperance, and the calmness of her mind, undisturb'd with uneasy cares and passions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> encouraged her friends to flatter themselves with a much longer enjoyment of so valuable a life, than it pleased heaven to allow them. <note n="*" place="bottom">

In the evening of it, at about eight of the clock, she conversed with a friend with all her wonted vivacity, and not without laughter; after which she retired to her chamber. At about ten, her servant hearing some noise in her mistress's

She had the immediate assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a physician and surgeon, but all the means used were without success; and after having given one groan, she expired a few minutes before two of the clock, on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, <hi>Feb.</hi> 20, 1736-7. Her disease was judg'd to be an apoplexy. A pious <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>My present experience confirms me in this truth; the powers of nature are drooping, the vital spark grows languid and faint; while my affection for my surviving friends was never more warm, my concern for their happiness was never more ardent and sincere.</p>

Yet (if I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to give my opinion) they shew so much strength of genius, and true poetic fire, as will easily atone for any slight inaccuracies, which the severity of malignant criticism may be able to discover.</p>

For she did not set so high a value on her works, as to employ much labour in finishing them with the utmost accuracy; and she wrote verses thro' inclination, and rather as an amusement, than as a study and profession, to excel in which she should make the business of her life.</p>

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:006232_0047_10281728D42F9270"/>Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> was not a regular beauty, yet she possessed a large measure of the charms of her sex. She was of a moderate stature, her hair of a fine auburn colour, and her eyes of a darkish grey, inclining to blue, and full of fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Her complexion was very fair, and a natural rosy blush glowed in her cheeks. She spoke gracefully, and her voice was exceeding sweet and harmonious, and perfectly suited to that gentle language which always flowed from her lips. But the softness and benevolence of her aspect is beyond all description: It inspired irresistible love, yet not without some mixture of that awe and veneration which distinguish'd sense and virtue, apparent in the countenance, are wont to create.</p>
            <p>Her acquaintance with the great, had taught her all the accomplishments of good breeding, and complacency of behaviour; and without formality or affectation, she practised, in a distant solitude, all the address and politeness of a court; but she learned no more than the real elegancies of grandeur. She was very remote from extravagance in habit, and seemed to have perfectly subdued the love of the vain shew of life; in which she may be thought to discover an elevation of soul superior to the natural inclinations of her sex, and great strength of virtue in resisting the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the age in which she lived. The labours of the toilette consumed very little of her time: She justly despised the arts of dress and ornament, and endeavoured to infuse the same contempt of them into all her acquaintance; yet without falling into the other extreme of indecent negligence.</p>
            <p>The love of solitude, which seems almost in

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nificence and charity; or, in composing those works with which she has obliged the public, which, as they inspire the noblest sentiments of benevolence and piety, may be of the most lasting and extensive benefit to mankind.</p>
            <p>It has been imputed to persons of recluse and ascetic lives, that though their austere virtue may preserve them from sensual indulgencies, against which they are wont to express the utmost severity; yet they are too frequently apt to sooth themselves in pride, ill-nature, censoriousness, and the like hateful dispositions of the mind. The lustre of Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s character was not sullied by so great a blemish. She was as exemplary for every social and good-natur'd virtue, as for the exact sanctity of her manners; and justly thought the sins to which the soul is tempted by its union with the body, attended with less degrees of guilt than those other
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006232_0050_102816E8AFB2FBB8"/>
               <hi>vices of a graver sort,</hi> which she believed, debased human nature into a nearer resemblance to that most evil and malevolent spirit, who is represented, in the sacred writings, as perfectly opposite to the benignity of the supreme Being.</p>
            <p>She had the happiest command over her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and maintained a constant calmness of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and sweetness of disposition, that could not be ruffled with adverse accidents, nor soured by the approach of old age it self. It has been question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether she was ever angry in her whole life, at least with regard to those little misfortunes, and displeasing incidents, that occur in common life, which, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> really of a trivial nature, frequently prove too strong temptations to indecencies of passion; she was only wont to turn these into subjects of mirth, and agreeable raillery. And as persons are apt to be least on their guard against excesses of this kind towards inferiors and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestics, it ought to be observed, that her servant who lived with her near twenty years, scarce ever discovered in her misteris, any tendency to anger towards herself, or any warmth of resentment against others, except in the cause of heaven, against great impiety, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> strictly regulated her conduct by this solemn vow, and could hardly think any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion would justify the reporting what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the reputation of another. <hi>I can appeal to you</hi> (says she, in a letter to a lady who had been long and intimately acquainted with her) <hi>if you ever knew me make an envious, or an ill-natur'd reflection on any person upon earth.

            <p>She was as unacquainted with envy, as if it had been impossible for so base a passion to enter into the human mind; and was always forward to do justice to every fine writer, and illustrious character of the age. She exceedingly loved to praise, and never failed to observe and applaud every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of merit in those with whom she was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; but over-looked all their frailties with more than even the usual partiality of friendship. Yet, tho' she could have wished to have made no other use of speech than to commend worth and

virtue, on some occasions a sense of duty compelled her to reprove; but the seeming severity of this virtue, was tempered by the softest arts of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and goodness. In proof of which, it may not be improper to add the following instance of the honest artifices she used to disguise her admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions. She has been frequently observed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend persons of distinguish'd eminence for one kind of moral worth, before some of her friends, who were deficient in that particular virtue, in hopes they might be struck with the beauty of the example, which she proposed to their imitation, in a manner so little apt to give offence.</p>
            <p>She had few equals in her excellent turn for conversation. Her wit was inexhaustible, and she expressed her thoughts in the most beautiful and flowing eloquence; and as these uncommon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages were accompanied with an easy goodness, and unaffected openness of behaviour, she infinitely charm'd all who knew her. A peculiar elevation of understanding, made her despise those trifles which usually dwell on the lips of the fair sex, and she would always have chosen to talk on important and instructive themes; yet, least constant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of a serious kind should prove distastef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l and wearisome, she sometimes entertained her friends on more gay and indifferent subjects. But as soon as it could be done without the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of affectation, she returned to her favourite topics, on which she exerted all her exquisite talents, to recommend the most exact morality and sublime piety; so that it seemed impossible to be in her company without growing wiser and better, or to leave it without regret.</p>

any thing that might tend to her own honour: Nor can I, during the long intimacy with which she favoured me, remember one expression of vanity, or sense of her own worth, that might seem to stain her humility. She never dictated to others, nor arrogated any respect and deference to her own sentiments; but in conversing with persons of parts and abilities, far beneath her own, seemed to study to make the superiority of her genius easy to them, by the most obliging good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and condescention of behaviour.

She would have esteemed the diversions of the <hi>English</hi> theatre (especially those of the tragic kind) capable of affording the most noble and rational pleasure, if she could have believed them innocent; but so few of them appeared to her inoffensive to virtue, that she thought fit to abstain from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The native grandeur of her soul, preserved her from a fondness for any kind of luxury, judging it much beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a being possess'd of reason, and born for immortality. She was always pleased with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she found on her table; and neither the nature of her food, nor the manner of dressing it, gave her any uneasiness: For if in either of these respects it was not perfectly agreeable, it only afforded her a subject of wit and pleasantry, instead of occasioning any disgust, or serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment.

She could not be persuaded to publish her works by subscription, or even to accept the advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terms offered by the bookseller, if she would permit her scattered pieces to be collected and published together. She wrote no dedications to the great, and the name of no minister of state is to be found in her works. She never saw a court; and if she has mentioned, with honour, some of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006232_0058_102816F2A2E02578"/>
the princes under whose reigns she lived, 'twas only from a sincere veneration for the fauiors of liberty (which inestimable blessing she highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued) and without the least expectation of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, beyond the pleasure of discovering her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to those, who appeared to her, public bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to their country. The high esteem she expressed for some of her friends of distinguished rank, was equally free from the suspicion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested views; for as she gained nothing by their friendship but the happiness of their conversation, and an acquaintance with their virtues; the praises she gave them, ought, in justice, to be looked on as the incense due to merit. The love of money she thought the most sordid and ignoble of passions, and frequently lamented its general prevalence over the human mind. She did not know her own estates from others, till some motives of prudence obliged her to inform herself, when she appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended she was soon to leave them; and was so far from that rigor in exacting her due, which approaches to inhumanity, that her neglect of her interest may rather be censured as excessive: She let her estates beneath their intrinsic value, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the considerable advance of the rents since her decease; and was so gentle to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in this manner quitted the estate upon receiving some just menaces without her knowledge, 'tis more than probable that her excess of goodness would have always prevented her from having recourse to rigorous methods to eject him, and compel him to do her justice.

the true author, and this performance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be universally admired, she still continued to avoid owning it, as far as was consistent with a strict regard to truth: She even declined the honour due to her ashes and memory after death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when she selected from her manuscript volume of devotions some exercises of piety, with a view to their publication after her decease, she studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously omitted those parts that would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her unexampled charity, and other virtues which conciliate the esteem and veneration of the world: Nor could any thing, perhaps, but the suddenness of her death, have prevented her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the flames the book I have just men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which has so often assisted me in my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do justice to her character. And as she entrusted the care of her posthumous pieces to one, who (she could not be insensible) had never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a thought of being an author, and whose incurable want of health must render him peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unfit to compose any thing for public view<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is the highest probability, that 'twas her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that this collection of her remains should be communicated to the world without any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her life and character; which, thro' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme humility, she judged unworthy the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and imitation of posterity.

            </p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> was exemplary for every relative duty. Filial piety was a remarkable part of her character. She loved the best of fathers, as she ought, and repaid his uncommon care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness by all just returns of duty and affection. She has been heard to say, <hi>That she could die rather than displease him</hi>; and the anguish she felt at see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in pain in his last sickness was so great, that it occasioned some kind of convulsion, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order from which she was wholly free in every other part of her life.</p>
            <p>When she was entred into a marriage state, the highest esteem and most tender affection ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in all her conduct to Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi>; and by the most gentle and obliging manners, and the exercise of every social and good-natur'd virtue, she confirmed the empire she had gained over his heart. She complied with his inclinations in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral instances, to which she was naturally averse; and made it her study to soften the anxieties, and heighten a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l the satisfactions of his life. Her capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for superior things did not tempt her to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the less honourable cares which the laws of decency impose on the softer sex in the connubial relation: Much less was she led by a sense of her own merit to assume any thing to herself incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with that duty and submission which the precepts of Christian piety so strictly enjoin. Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> had some mixture of natural warmth in his temper, of which he had not always a perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. If at any time this broke out into some little excesses of anger, it never awaked any passion
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:006232_0063_1028174A2A24CD98"/>
of the like kind in Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>; but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, she always remained mistress of herself, and studied by the gentlest language and most soothing endearments, to restore Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s mind to that calmness which reason approves. And she equally endeavoured, in every other instance, by the softest arts of persuasion, and in a manner remote from all airs of superiority, to lead Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that perfection of virtue, to which she herself aspired with the truest Christian zeal. During his long illness, she scarce ever stirred from him a moment, and alleviated his severe affliction by performing, with inconceivable tenderness and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>duity, all the offices of compassion suited to that melancholy season. She partook his sleepless nights, and never quitted his bed, unless to serve him, or watch by him. And as she could scarce be persuaded to forsake even his breathless clay, so she consecrated her future years to his memory, by honouring his ashes with resolutions of perpetual widowhood, which with more than female con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy she inviolably maintained. Her conduct, in this last instance, on the review of it after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of several years, afforded her great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; for she thus expresses herself in a letter intended, after her own decease, to be delivered to Mrs. <hi>Marrow,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that lady had survived her: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever such distinguished sense and merit could claim, I have endeavoured to pay my much-lov'd husband's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. I reflect with pleasure on my conduct on this occasion; not only from a principle of justice and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to him, but from a conscious sense of honour and love of a virtuous reputation after death.— But if the soul, in a separate state, should be insensible of human

censure or applause, yet there is a disinterested homage due to the sacred name of virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She mourned over the death of her husband and father, with all that becoming tenderness and sensibility which ought to touch every humane and generous heart, at the loss of the dearest persons on earth; yet her submission to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of divine providence was exemplary, and she never presumed to breathe any indecent mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs against the will of heaven, which is ever just and good; or behaved, in this hour of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in a manner unsuitable to that eminent piety which appeared in every other part of her life.</p>
            <p>She was a gentle and kind mistress; treating her servants with great condescension and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and almost with the affability of a friend and equal. She caused due care to be taken of them when they were ill; and did not think it misbecame her to sit by the bed of a sick servant to read to her books of piety. Her great huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity would not suffer her to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e offended with light faults; and as she never dismissed any one from her family, so, I think, none of her servants ever left her, but with a view to the changing their condition by marriage. She knew when she was well served, and reposed so much trust in those whose fidelity she had experienced, that it might seem to verge towards excess; yet, even such great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence was hardly more than was due to that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who was with Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> at the time of her death; whose long and faithful duty to her mistress, and remarkable sorrow for her loss, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be mentioned with honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:006232_0065_102817A81996CBE8"/>She was a warm and generous friend, just, if not partial, to the merit of those whom she loved, and most gentle and candid to their errors. She was always forward to do them good offices; but in a distinguish'd manner she studied, with infinite art and zeal, to insinuate the love of virtue into all her acquaintance, and to promote their most important interest, by inciting them to the practice of every thing that would recommend them to higher degrees of the divine favour. This she proposed as the best end of friendship.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> was not entirely free from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of malice, that she might not be without opportunity to exercise the divine virtue of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness; yet one could scarce have learned from her discourse that she had an enemy; for she was not wont to complain of any indecent conduct or injuries done to herself: So that it was apparent, such things made light impressions on her mind; or that she had endeavoured to efface them with the happiest success.</p>

Her zeal to do generous actions is inexpressible; it broke out on all possible occasions; and there was not, I believe, one of her friends in any rank of life, who did not experience her beneficent disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by receiving from her presents of books, pictures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if not gifts of higher value.</p>
            <p>Her charities were so great (if we consider the mediocrity of her fortune) that they can scarce be parallel'd, except in the histories of better times, when Christianity had all its due power over the hearts of those who professed it: They were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed only limited by the utmost extent of her power; for she devoted the whole of her income, besides what was barely sufficient for the necessities of life, to the relief of the indigent and distressed. This her manuscript acquaints us with in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vow; which, as it evidences a heart glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with the love of God and mankind, is worthy of the highest praise; but as this solemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment involved Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> in some perplexities, it seems peculiarly fit to add, that her example ought not to influence pious minds thus to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <q>I consecrate half of my yearly income to charitable uses. And tho', by this, according to human appearances, I have reduced myself to some necessity, I cast all my care on that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God to whom I am devoted, and to whose truth I subscribe with my hand. I attest his faithfulness, and bring in my testimony to the veracity of his word; I set to my seal, that God is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and oh! by the God of truth, I swear to perform this, and beyond this.

            <p>Misery and indigence were a sufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to her compassionate regard and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; yet she shewed a distinguish'd readiness to alleviate the afflictions of persons of merit and virtue: And one who had the best opportunities of making this observation, assures me, that she never knew any such apply to Mrs. <hi>Rowe,</hi> without success, when she had it in her power to relieve their wants.

These were the generous tears of virtue, and not any feminine weakness; for she was rarely observ'd to weep at afflictions that befel herself.

And when she met in the streets with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of promising countenances, who were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unknown to her, if upon enquiry, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that thro' the poverty of their parents they were not put to school, she added them to the number of those who were taught at her own expence. She condescended, herself, to instruct them in the plain and necessary principles and duties of religion; and the grief she felt when any of them did not answer the hopes she had entertained, was equal to the great satisfaction she received, when it appeared that her care and bounty had been well-placed. She was also a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributor to a charitable institution of this kind at <hi>Frome</hi> of a more public nature; though, according to the general custom of such schools, all who were educated in it were compelled to worship God in that one particular form, from which she herself took the liberty to dissent. But Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> was not corrupted by this example of contracted goodness, which can scarce be reconciled to that universal benevolence the gospel enjoins: Her charities were not confined to those of her own party or sentiments, but bestowed on indigent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of almost all the sects into which Christianity is divided; and even those whose religious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

With regard to those whose circumstances were such, that the accepting alms might have put their modesty to some pain, she studied to spare their blushes while she softened their adversity. When one such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her acquaintance was in some distress, she contrived to lose at play a sum of money sufficient to supply the necessity of the case. This was, perhaps, the only time she touched a ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the poor she seemed a ministring angel: Her goodness prevented their requests; and smiles, gentle language, and the warmest expressions of good-will, always accompanied her actions of mercy. The distressed were encouraged to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close all their wants, by the kindest assurances of relief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and she treated them with the sweetness

and easy goodness of a friend, rather than the superiority of a benefactor; nor was she enclined to take offence at the appearance of ingratitude in her dependants. When she chanced to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear some unthankful poor, entertained at her servant's table, murmur at their food, though she had fed on the same herself, she only put this gentle construction on their behaviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That they expected something better than ordinary from her table.</hi> And she was so far from resenting this indecent delicacy of appetite, that she did not, even at that time, omit the alms she usually gave when any indigent persons were entertained at her house.</p>
            <p>'Tis astonishing how the moderate estate Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> was possessed of, could supply such various and expensive benefactions; and her own sense of this once broke out to an intimate friend; <hi>I am surpriz'd,</hi> said she to her, <hi>how it is possible my estate should answer all these things! and yet I never want money.</hi> This she only spoke to giver honour to the divine blessing, which, as she was wont to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with great piety, apparently protected her from losses, and prospered all her affairs. 'Twould be extreme injustice, to interpret her expressions of gratitude to the goodness of providence in a different manner; for her great care to conceal her charities from the observation of mortals, gives the highest evidence that no love of human applause tainted the purity of her benevolent dispositions. Indeed, her modesty and aversion to the appearance of shew and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ostentation, caused her to cast such a veil of secrecy over all her beneficent actions, that I fear many of them, highly worthy to be known and imitated by posterity, must remain
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006232_0073_102817B5556134A0"/>
concealed from the world till <hi>that day</hi> when they shall be rewarded in the fight of the whole universe, by that almighty Judge who was alone witness to them.</p>
            <p>Such an assemblage of virtues as united in Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s character, could only be the offspring of piety. This divine principle discovered itself very early in her mind; and since Mr. <hi>Grove</hi> wrote the former part of these memoirs, I have received fresh evidence to confirm his observation, that 'tis not improbable the first dawnings of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son guided her to acknowledge and adore the author of her being, and commence that uniform and exemplary course of obedience to his laws, which, by the assistance of heaven, she maintained in every part of her life.</p>
            <p>Her writings give a faithful picture of her soul. Her profound humility, and supreme affection to God; her faith in his promises, and dependance on his providence; her zeal for his glory, and love to the holiness of his laws, appear in the strongest light in her works; and particularly in her <hi>Devotions,</hi> published since her death by the reverend Dr. <hi>Watts.</hi> But as it would too much swell these memoirs to transcribe her sentiments on these heads, I shall only relate the means she made use of to cultivate these excellent dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions; with the addition of some passages from her manuscripts, that have not yet been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the public.</p>
            <p>She devoted herself to the service of heaven in a solemn covenant <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

just sentiments, she employed those parts of the day in which she believed the powers of the mind most free and active, as seasons of holy retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But (as far as I could judge) her devotions were rather frequent, than protracted to such an undue length, as might tend to distract the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and fatigue and exhaust the spirits.</p>
            <p>She had an high veneration and love to the Lord's-day, which (excepting offices of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and compassion) she wholly consecrated to piety and devotion. No slight indisposition, or any severity of weather, prevented her constant attendance on public worship, at which her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and reverent behaviour shewed the utmost composure and elevation of soul. She also, in imitation of our blessed Saviour's example of doing good on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> sanctified the Lord's day, by entertaining a set of poor people at her house, and by an abundant distribution of charity.

Let me remember the vows of God, and at my return to the world, let me commit my ways to thee. Let me be absolutely resign'd to thy providence, nor once distrust thy goodness and fidelity. Let me be careful for nothing, but with prayer and supplication make my wants known to thee. Let the most awful sense of thy presence dwell on my heart, and always keep me in a serious disposition. Let me be merciful and just in my actions, calm and regular in my thoughts: And oh! do thou set a watch on my mouth, and keep the door of my lips. Let me speak evil of no man; let me advance the reputation of the virtuous, and never be silent in the praise of merit. Let my tongue speak the language of my heart, and be guided by exact truth and perfect sincerity. Let me open my hands wide to the wants of the poor, in full confidence that my heavenly Father will supply mine; and that the high possessor of heaven and earth will not fail to restore, in the hour of my distress, what I have parted with for his sake.</p>

For some time before her death she scarce read any thing but these sacred books, and practical treatises on religious subjects. She was also wont to assist her improvement in virtue and she Christian life, by frequent meditations on the blessedness of a future state, the perfections of God, particularly his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodness and Mercy in the redemption of the world by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>; and on other important parts of religion, which appeared best suited to promote devout and holy dispositions.

            <p>Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> seemed born for the practice of sublime and ascetic piety, 'twas the supreme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of her life; yet her own words assure us, that she did not set too high a value on strong emotions of the passions, and religious fervors; nor was tempted by the love of devotion to prefer it to social virtue. For the thus expresses herself in a letter to a noble friend, <hi>I have wrote no pious meditations of late.

I lay a much greater stress on this part of religion that regards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than I do on any height of devotion, as necessary as I think it, to reconcile the mind to death.</hi> She affected no kind of singularity or appearance of severity, nor presumed to censure those who came not up to that strictness to which she obliged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

others to whom, on account of their difference of tempers, and deeper engagements in the business of the world, they might be inexpedient, that she did not recommend, or I think, so much as mention them to her most intimate friends; but, on the contrary, studied concealment so much, that 'tis only from her manuscripts, and the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of her servant (from whom they could not be hid) that I have arrived at the knowledge of the greater part of them, since her death.</p>
            <p>She possessed a large measure of that serenity and chearfulness of temper, which seem naturally to flow from conscious virtue, and the hopes of the divine favour. This happy disposition of mind, which is more than once recommended in the sacred writings, and is so great an ornament to sincere piety, continued with Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> to her last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and was never interrupted by any of those fantastic disorders that so often cloud the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the softer sex; so that (excepting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of sorrow, occasioned by her devout and compassionate dispositions, and just affliction for the loss of Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Singer.</hi>) Her whole life seemed not only a constant calm, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual sun-shine, and every hour of it sparkled with good humour, and inoffensive gaiety.</p>
            <p>As it may seem improper to relate the sentiments of a lady who was not vers'd in controversial divinity, or the erudition of the schools, on subjects that have divided the learned and religious world; I will only take the liberty to say, that she openly avowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what appeared to her to be truth, and defended it with warmth; yet the sweetness of her disposition made her incapable of the impious rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

of those, who, without mercy, pronounce a sentence of damnation on all who dissent from them in abstruse and disputable points: But she expressed herself as if it was less necessary to guard against the contrary extreme. For she says, in one of her letters, <hi>My charity is very large, and from this catholic spirit I have often canonized some libertine or atheist for a great saint.</hi> Her love of piety was not confined to those of her own party in religion; and it ought to be related as an exemplary instance of Christian moderation, that she continued all the latter part of her life in constant communion with some who differed from her in articles which she thought of great importance; though she was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently solicited to an opposite conduct by persons of a more narrow spirit; and could not escape censure for her adherence to the charity of the gospel. And as her zeal did in no part of her life degenerate into religious fury, so, towards the close of it, her gentle and charitable dispositions increased, and she seemed to be visibly ripening into the temper of that blessed region to which she was soon to be removed.</p>
            <p>Her friendships were founded on virtue, but not a perfect agreement in those lesser matters which divide us as Christians and <hi>Englishmen</hi>; in which she shewed a generous mind, elevated above the mean principles of party and bigo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <l>The muse a tribute to thy mem'ry pays:</l>
               <l>Thy loss to no one private grief confin'd,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Oft did intrigue its guilty arts unite,</l>
               <l>To blacken the records of female wit;</l>
               <l>The tuneful song lost ev'ry modest grace,</l>
               <l>And lawless freedoms triumph'd in their place.</l>
               <l>The muse, for vices not her own accus'd,</l>
               <l>With blushes view'd her sacred gifts abus'd:</l>
               <l>Those gifts for nobler purposes design'd,</l>
               <l>To raise the thoughts, and moralize the mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <l>When to the vocal grove, or winding stream,</l>

               <l>Transported echoes bore the sounds along,</l>
               <l>And all creation list'ned to the song.</l>
               <l>Bold as when raptur'd seraphs strike the lyre,</l>
               <l>Chaste as the vestal's consecrated fire,</l>
               <l>Soft as the balmy airs that gently play,</l>
