            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is judged proper to acquaint you, that the enſuing Sheets were convey'd to the Preſs, thro' a Channel whoſe original Source is concealed from our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. You will find the Author did not intend it for Publick View, for indeed there are ſuch evident Marks of a Diſhabille, and ſuch a careleſs Negligence of Dreſs, that tho' it may be allowed to pay a <hi>Morning Viſit</hi> to an intimate Friend, it was not dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Writer <hi>to entertain Company,</hi> but ſtole by a <hi>private Way, unſhav'd and unſhifted,</hi> to the <hi>Cloſet</hi> of his Friend. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Death</hi> of its Author, or his Friend, or by <hi>what other fortuitous Turns,</hi> it at length arrived to the Preſs, and now preſents itſelf to publick Obſervation, we cannot inform you; but that the Author is
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005772_0003_1026E0D9ED4A3918"/>ignorant of its Publication, as we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of him or her, and that <hi>no diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Breach of Confidence</hi> has been made, there are many concurring Circumſtances to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us of.</p>
            <p>Let it therefore be conſidered (tho' the Preſs now gives it a publick Relation) <hi>as really a private Entertainment</hi> in its Deſign, originally given behind the Curtain of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intimate Friendſhip; but <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>ſome other</hi> Incidents have drawn up that Curtain, and exhibited to <hi>publick Light</hi> this <hi>private Scene</hi> of Friendly Intercourſe; <hi>where</hi> the Mind gives a Vent to its Feelings, without any ſtudious elaborate Preparation; <hi>where</hi> the Sentiments flow like <hi>a natural Caſcade,</hi> rudely beautiful, tho' not regularly charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with more native Impetuoſity than methodical H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mony.</p>
            <p>It is nevertheleſs apprehended, tho' theſe REFLECTIONS were deſigned only for <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Entertainment and Uſe,</hi> the Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them may yield Pleaſure and Utility to the younger Part of each Sex; and may, perhaps, tend to diſcountenance the falſe, unnatural, and inſolent Ridicule, that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:005772_0004_1026E0DDD64176C8"/>endeavours to beſpatter and affront the <hi>Conjugal Tie; which</hi> is, and has ever been, the ſacred Cement of all Societies; and <hi>which</hi> has had the Approval and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the beſt and wiſeſt Minds in all Ages: The Common-place Witticiſms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this amiable and deſirable Union, are indeed ſuch low, wretched Stuff, as to be with Indignation excluded from all polite Converſations.</p>
            <p>The Author of the following <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> endeavours to lay <hi>a practicable Plan,</hi> by the Execution of which, the matrimonial State may produce ſuch a Crop of Felicity, as to make it highly worthy the Purſuit of every reaſonable and virtuous Mind. Had he wrote for publick View, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have appeared in a more full and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Dreſs, — but that has already been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologized for. We ſhall only therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our Opinion, that his Plan carries Reaſon and Conviction with it; and might perhaps more fully have done ſo, had he conſider'd his Subject by Way of <hi>Contraſt,</hi> as forcibly as he has in the Abſtract: For whoever has obſerv'd the declining Days of
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:005772_0005_1026E0E1A517DD68"/>Old Batchelors in general, may ſee their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected, unrelative State in Society, tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to their Graves in a gloomy Solitude, or, at beſt, only attended by a few artful rapacious Vultures, who impatiently wait for their <hi>Pray.</hi> No tender affectionate Companion, of ſimilar Mind and Manners, whoſe <hi>conſtant</hi> Sunſhine of Love, warm'd the Spring and Summer of his Days, and now with an <hi>unalterable</hi> Friendſhip and Fellow-feeling, accompanies him Arm-in-Arm thro' the dreary Wilds of his Winter, with the Guard of a Son or Sons, whoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial Piety and manly Vigour, is ever ready to protect him from the Inſolence of others, or to defend him from thoſe Calamities to which our feeble Age expoſes us; ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a prattling Offspring fondly careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their hoary Grandſire, and blooming a Proſpect of future Honour and Virtue. What exquiſite Senſations this Patriarchal Breaſt muſt feel! What heavenly Raptures his Soul muſt glow with! MATRIMONY may, upon our Author's Plan, acquaint us with them. — But theſe divine Supports are as
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:005772_0006_1026E0E36F944C40"/>little to be expected by an <hi>Old Batchelor,</hi> as in our Power to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>Our Author's <hi>Reflections</hi> may furthermore convince the Fair Sex, <hi>that</hi> tho' Fortune may buy them a mercenary Tyrant; tho' Beauty may provoke their Ruin, or attract ſome Fop or Coxcomb; yet. <hi>Good Senſe,</hi> and <hi>real</hi> Merit only, will touch the <hi>Heart</hi> of, and maintain their <hi>Influence</hi> over, Men of true Worth and Knowledge: <hi>That</hi> the Charms of Judgment, Diſcretion and good Temper, are the only <hi>laſting</hi> Foundations upon which matrimonial Felicity can be built: <hi>That</hi> the Cultivation of their Minds is abſolutely neceſſary to the Production of their Happineſs; <hi>that</hi> Love will ſoon ſtarve without Friendſhip; and finally, <hi>that</hi> the Standard of human Felicity in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

            <p>YOU may remember many ſprightly Things were ſaid againſt that Scene of Life; ſome very plauſible Ones.</p>
            <p>IT was alledged, on the one Hand, that the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Women, in general, muſt naturally give them a ſtrong Biaſs to <hi>Diſſembling</hi> and <hi>Affectation,</hi> the Turn of Thinking, which, for the moſt Part, they <hi>early</hi> imbibe; the too much <hi>Attention,</hi> and <hi>Artifice</hi> they are taught to beſtow on their <hi>Perſons;</hi> the trifling, and often ill-judged Accompliſhments, by which their Ambition is excited, and in which, for the moſt Part, they ſo ſtudiouſly endeavour to excel.</p>
            <p>BY this Method of Management they are poliſhed to a <hi>ſuperficial Luſtre,</hi> dazle our Sight, and work up our Paſſions. But, for that End, the <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Culture of their <hi>Minds</hi> is groſly neglected; <hi>true</hi> good Senſe, and <hi>ſound</hi> Judgment; the ineſtimable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a <hi>generous,</hi> an <hi>open,</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> Mind, are but little conſidered in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>BUT, Gentlemen, I wou'd beg Leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that tho' the common Education of young Ladies is chiefly extended no father than to <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi> and <hi>exterior</hi> Accompliſhments; and that their Behaviour is rather owing to a Sort of mechanical Influence, than to Sentiments from Reaſon and Judgment; that <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Reflection</hi> are too much neglected by them, or ill regulated; that their Taſte of <hi>real Worth</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> in Men and Things, is thereby render'd very defective, and often ſhows itſelf to be mighty ridiculous; that their Paſſions are rather kept under Reſtraint by the common Rules of Decorum, than by any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Conviction of a <hi>real beautiful,</hi> and <hi>deformed</hi> in Characters, independant on <hi>who ſees,</hi> or <hi>who knows;</hi> that they aim more to catch the Eyes, than penetrate the Heart, to blow up the Paſſions, than to ſecure the Underſtandings of their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; that Eſteem and Friendſhip are more remote from their Attention, than frothy Compliments and foppiſh Rant.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, I conceive, Gentlemen, where the Diſpoſitions of a young Lady are not of a bad Turn by Nature, whatever little Weeds may be ſprung or ſpringing up from the unhappy Influence of her Education, are to be cleared; her Mind and Temper ſtill ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch Cultivation by a ſkilful Addreſs, as to render her very worthy Eſteem and Friendſhip to a Man of Senſe, worthy his Choice, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for Life.</p>
               <p>I am perſuaded no one in this Company will
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005772_0012_10270B8886361E50"/>aſſert, Women are by Nature conſtituted incapable of Friendſhip, or any ſocial Charms which our Sex poſſeſſes. Every Perſon here is better verſed in Hiſtory and human Nature.</p>
               <p>WHAT then ſhould obſtruct their ſhining in ſo exalted a Light?—Why Education, the trifling and narrow Extent of Thinking which that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoms them to, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT in young Minds, for of ſuch only I ſpeak, where there are common, docile and pliable, Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, Is it an inſuperable Taſk to raiſe in them an Ambition for good Senſe, and a judicious Taſte? There are many Paſſions to work upon, which a <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> Hand may manage to his Purpoſe; there are the Seeds of Reflection, and tho' they may lie under Rubbiſh, 'tis to be cleared away; they may be ſown in good Ground, and by mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Times and Seaſons, and dealing tenderly with them, they will bring forth a Crop of happy and uſeful Reflections.</p>
               <p>BUT ſuffer me, Gentlemen, to go yet farther. Allowing what we have ſaid on the Education of young Ladies to be all true; do not our Sex too often compleat what that has begun? do we not in general flatter them with a Heap of bombaſt Stuff, and then laugh at them for ſeeming pleaſed with it? Do we not blow up their Vanity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, with Notions of that Merit to which they have no juſt Title? And gloſs over their ſilly Airs and Follies with falſe Applauſe, and Epithets of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation? Do we not generally converſe with them in a Language of Rhodomontade and Nonſenſe?</p>
               <p>How then, is it poſſible for them to improve; How to diſcern <hi>real</hi> from <hi>falſe</hi> Excellence, who
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005772_0013_10270B8A7351EC98"/>ſeldom hear a Word of Senſe, and leſs of Truth? 'Tis this Sort of Treatment young Ladies meet with in common Life, and too much of this Kind we carry with us when we make our matrimonial Addreſſes; to which, and our ſubſequent Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences after Marriage, I cannot but aſcribe the many juſt Satires that are thrown out againſt it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>'BUT wou'd we'—Here the Diſcourſe was interrupted by a Circumſtance which I doubt not you well remember.</p>
            <p>HAD the Gentleman proceeded, your Opinion might poſſibly have been determined, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me an Attempt, for which I fear I am not ſufficiently qualified.—However I will not add to the Trouble of your Peruſal any further Apologies, which are in general the Effects more of Vanity than Modeſty.</p>
            <p>I am then of that Gentleman's Opinion, whoſe Diſcourſe was broke in upon:</p>
            <p>THAT unhappy Matches are often occaſioned by meer <hi>mercenary Views</hi> in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>both</hi> of the Parties; or by the <hi>headſtrong</hi> Motives of <hi>ill conducted Paſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT by a <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> Proceeding, in our Addreſſes to a young Lady of a good natural Temper, a probable Foundation may be laid for making her an agreeable Companion, a ſteady Friend, and a good Wife.</p>
            <p>AND that after Marriage, by continuing in the Road of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> we may erect a Superſtructure of as much <hi>real Felicity,</hi> and as refined an Enjoyment of Life, to its lateſt Period, as any other Scheme can juſtly lay claim to.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you my deliberate Thoughts on theſe four Particulars; the <hi>firſt, ſecond</hi> and <hi>third,</hi> will be

               <p>THAT <hi>Luxury,</hi> and an expenſive Manner of Life, is not leſs the Attention than the Ambition of moſt People in their ſeveral Claſſes; and that ſuch a Turn of Mind muſt naturally and neceſſarily carry with it a violent and inſatiable Thirſt for Riches; to any Perſon of Obſervation and Reflection, is as obvious, on the one Hand, as 'tis conſequential on the other.</p>
               <p>'Tis as certain, that a Paſſion ſo prevalent, will, of Courſe, weigh down and ſtifle every noble, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and diſintereſted Sentiment.</p>

And what are they exchanged
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005772_0016_10270B94F8AF2390"/>for? Why, to make a Glare in the Eyes of the little and great Vulgar; to be hurried thro' Scenes of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and treacherous Ceremony; to raiſe Envy in the weak and ſilly Part of the World, Pity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in the Wiſe and Judicious.</p>
               <p>AND what are the Conſequences to the Parties themſelves? Why, at beft a <hi>cold, flat,</hi> and <hi>inſipid</hi> Intercourſe; void of the exquiſite Reliſh of a ſincere Eſteem, and the divine Pleaſures of a reaſonable and honourable Friendſhip.—But more frequently the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of their <hi>intereſted</hi> Views, in one or both appears undiſguiſed, is ſucceeded by Contempt and Diſdain, and throws ſuch a Fire of Contention and Uneaſineſs between them, as gives too juſt a Cauſe for that direful Simile, <hi>a Hell upon Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF the Happineſs of a married Life does, as it moſt certainly <hi>muſt,</hi> ariſe from an <hi>unfeigned Eſteem,</hi> and <hi>ſincere Friendſhip</hi> for each other; how is it poſſible for ſuch <hi>godlike Effects</hi> of flow from ſuch <hi>diabolical Cauſes,</hi> as <hi>avaricious, mercenary,</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Views?

               <p>To conclude, 'tis a Truth of the plaineſt Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that <hi>Slaves to Fortune,</hi> or the Gratification of their own ſelfiſh Paſſions, who center their Views in Life within themſelves, independant on the Foel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others, are <hi>incapable</hi> of a ſincere and ſteady
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005772_0017_10270B99A8C1DE50"/>Friendſhip; nor can their Hearts <hi>glow</hi> with the <hi>warm Benevolence</hi> of a <hi>tender Affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DOES it not then very evidently appear, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages which are made on the meer Motives of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, will naturally turn out, inſipid, unhappy, and <hi>fatal</hi> Situations.</p>
               <p>IF there can be found any Inſtances to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they muſt be owing to a happy Chance; thoſe who in ſo important an Engagement will truſt to a <hi>Fors Fortuna</hi> for their Happineſs, are not worth reaſoning with. 'Tis true, we cannot arrive to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in human Contingencies, but when Reaſon, and the greateſt Degree of Probability are againſt us, 'tis Madneſs, 'tis egregious Folly, to act in Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to them.</p>
               <p>IT muſt not be inferred from the foregoing, that Prudence and Diſcretion with Regard to Fortune are to be baniſh'd from our Conſideration. That wou'd be an Extream, on the other Hand, equally, or more ſubverſive of our Happineſs.</p>
               <p>To talk of a Competence, is, in Effect, ſaying Nothing at all; what may be ſo to one Man, is not ſo to another. But this is certain: The nearer we bring our Deſires of Living, and our Reliſhes of Pleaſure, to the Neceſſities of our Nature, the more eaſy and certain will our Happineſs be: And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Splendor and Magnificence, are more <hi>imaginary</hi> than <hi>real</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> Ingredients to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Felicity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How much,</hi> or <hi>how little</hi> or Fortune will content us, depends chiefly on our own Way of Thinking. Be this as it will, it ſhould ſeem very proper before all Marriages, for both Parties to know <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>fairly,</hi> what they have to <hi>expect</hi> on this Head, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005772_0018_10270B9DE1709F88"/>ſeriouſly to conſider with themſelves, whether it will be ſufficient ſo far to anſwer their Deſires, as to prevent future Murmurings and Anxieties, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently allow them to enjoy Life as they intend. All <hi>Deceit</hi> herein ſhould be <hi>carefully avoided,</hi> we may otherwiſe impoſe on our ſelves, and ruin all our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Felicity.</p>

               <p>AN amorous Complexion, a lively Imagination, and a generous Temper, are ſo apt to be charm'd with an agreeable Perſon, the inſinuating Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of Muſick and Dancing, <hi>un bon Grace,</hi> and a <hi>Gaietè de Coeur,</hi> that it is inſtantly tranſported, ſighs, languiſhes, dies for Poſſeſſion.

               <p>WELL, they are married, and have taken their Full of Love.

               </p>
               <p>IN ſerious Truth how can it be otherwiſe?</p>
               <p>PASSIONS are extreamly tranſient and unſteady, and <hi>Love,</hi> with no other Support, will ever be ſhort liv'd and fleeting. 'Tis a <hi>Fire</hi> that is <hi>ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,</hi> and where there is no ſolid Eſteem and well cemented Friendſhip to <hi>blow it up,</hi> it rarely <hi>lights</hi>

               <p>BESIDES, in Marriages of this Kind, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Time</hi> nor <hi>Coolneſs</hi> ſufficient, for fixing an Eſteem and Friendſhip; and therefore the very <hi>Foundations</hi> for its <hi>laſting</hi> Happineſs are wanting.

Alas how uncertain is that! and ſo many Probabilities on the contrary Side, that none ſurely but the moſt daring and <hi>inconſiderate</hi> People would run the Riſque.</p>
               <p>WHAT has been obſerved ſeems to point out, that a <hi>blind,</hi> a ſudden and <hi>intoxicating</hi> Paſſion, has a natural Tendency, under its own Direction, to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <hi>unhappy Marriages,</hi> and produce Scenes of <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>

Endeavour as much as poſſible, to ſtifle all thoſe paſſionate and amorous Emotions, that wou'd <hi>cloud</hi> and <hi>bribe</hi> our Judgments. Let us <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> reflect, that Engagements of this Kind, are of the <hi>greateſt</hi> Moment and Import to our future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Life. That Courtſhip brings on Marriage, and that makes all the Peace and Welfare of our Lives dependant on the Behaviour and Diſpoſitions of another; a Matter of the <hi>utmoſt</hi> Conſequence, and of which we cannot well think too long or too much. Let not therefore our <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Paſſions</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us, to barter away all that is truly valuable in our Exiſtence for <hi>their</hi> Gratification.</p>

SOME Women have infinite Art, being early bred to diſguiſe and diſſemble; yet by a ſkilful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Calmneſs, and Impartiality, we may form a Judgment of their Characters in the main: Which we ſhould endeavour to do, and compare them fairly with our own; ſee how they will <hi>correſpond:</hi> Be nationally convinced of a <hi>Similitude</hi> in our Ways of Thinking, a <hi>Harmony</hi> in our Minds and Tempers, before we venture to change the Name of Miſtreſs into that of Wife.</p>
               <p>THUS let us deliberate, thus let us proceed, and thus arm our ſelves with Reaſon and Reflection in this great Affair. Leſt by too much <hi>Warmth</hi> and <hi>Precipitancy,</hi> we draw thoſe Miſeries on our ſelves, which Repentance will neither aſſuage or remove.</p>
               <p>HAVING now drove the <hi>mercenary Herd</hi> to their native Mines, and made evident their Unfitneſs for breathing the pure and generous Air of matrimonial Felicity; left the <hi>Inamoratoes</hi> to float in their Fool's Paradiſe with Novels and Romances; let us endeavour to fix our ſelves on the <hi>true Baſis</hi> of conjugal Happineſs, and ſee if we can hit upon the Path wherein an agreeable Companion, a ſteady Friend, and a good Wife, may be found.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had no Art been uſed for their Concealment, they might have cauſed little or no Concern.</p>
               <p>NOTHING to a generous Mind is more ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than any Sort of <hi>Impoſition</hi> from a Friend.</p>
               <p>LOVE and Friendſhip are of ſo nice and <hi>dilicate</hi> a Texture, that <hi>Diſingenuity</hi> in the ſmalleſt Matters ſhould be avoided.</p>
               <p>THESE Remarks may appear but of little Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to People of a coarſe and uponliſhed Taſte, but I am perſuaded they will have their Weight with thoſe of a contrary Turn.</p>

For my own Part, I wou'd, if any thing, be rather <hi>leſs</hi> careful and exact in my perſonal Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>before</hi> than <hi>after</hi> Marriage, becauſe the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of <hi>raiſing</hi> an Affection, is not ſo great, as that of <hi>preſerving</hi> it; as every little perſonal Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment may be ſerviceable in the former Caſe, ſo it undoubtedly will in the latter.—But the Care of our Perſons, will come under a more particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in my ſecond Letter; and tho' 'tis ſeldom neglected <hi>before,</hi> yet 'tis often ſo notoriouſly <hi>after</hi> Marriage, that I believe many unhappy Ones are cauſed by it.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER it be as to the Spruceneſs and Decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Perſons,</hi> I muſt affirm it a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Folly, and Impoſition highly culpable, to maſk our <hi>Tempers,</hi> and appear what we really are not; to exhibit a <hi>forged Draught</hi> of our Minds and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in order to win the Affections.</p>
               <p>I am really at a Loſs to judge, whether the Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity or Iniquity of ſuch a Scheme be the greateſt.</p>
               <p>Is this Courſhip? Is this laying a Foundation for our future Happineſs? Monſtrous! But this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, too often the Caſe with both Sexes. 'Tis really amazing how People can be ſo <hi>prepoſterouſly</hi> wicked, in a Correſpondence of the moſt <hi>ſacred</hi> and tender Kind, in the Conſequences of which, all the future Happineſs of their Lives may depend. How <hi>ſtupid,</hi> thus to ſtudy out own Ruin, by the infamous Deception of One, we chooſe for the Partner of our Joys and our Cares, the Companion of our Days and our Night! How <hi>ſhocking</hi> to ſet out with Fraud, and proceed with Deceit in ſuch ſolemn Engagements! How <hi>ſhallow</hi> is the Cunning of ſuch inconſiderate Minds! Muſt not all the Pleaſures of Marriage be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005772_0024_10270BB106C58D10"/>unanimous and inſeparable? Do they not flow from <hi>real</hi> and <hi>unaffected</hi> Lovelineſs? Can we think the Cheat will lie long concealed in a Society ſo intimate? When Time and Eperience unmaſks our <hi>aſſumed</hi> Appearances, ſhows us in our <hi>native Colours,</hi> and <hi>expoſes</hi> that Reality we have ſo incuſtriouſly laboured to <hi>cover;</hi> can we expect Love and Eſteem from any One whom we have ſo <hi>ſhamefully over-reached</hi> and enſnared? Surely <hi>no.</hi> On the contrary we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail on our ſelves, <hi>certain</hi> Indignation, and <hi>laſting</hi> Contempt.</p>
               <p>—WE have raiſed and ſupported an Affection by <hi>falſe Appearance;</hi> when thoſe are ſeen thro', as moſt certainly they will be, what Title have we to Love or Friendſhip? NONE, and conſequently no Proſpect of ſocial Happineſs</p>
               <p>LET us, my Friend, on the contrary, obſerve a <hi>religious Sincerity,</hi> appear in our <hi>native Characters,</hi> undiſguiſed and unaffected. If under thoſe we gain Eſteem and Friendſhip, our Proſpects of maintaining them, are as ſecure, as our own Minds and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be laſting.—Let us be <hi>outwardly,</hi> what we really are <hi>within,</hi> and appear in ſuch a Character as we ſtedfaſtly diſign to continue.

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Let our Manner of converſing with a Miſtreſs be void of <hi>fulſome Flattery,</hi> and the ridiculous Bombaſt of Novels and Romances.</head>
               <p>IT was an Objection, you may remember, made againſt Matrimony; that the Education of young Ladies, gave ſuch a trifling turn to their Tempers, and Manner of Thinking, as rendred them unfit for the rational Pleaſures of Society and Converſation.</p>
               <p>ALLOWING this to be true, and in general but too true it really is, how prejudicial and fatal muſt <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> be to ſuch? And how completely muſt that Foppiſh <hi>Rant,</hi> called <hi>Gallantry,</hi> poiſon their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and tend to deſtroy the Poſſibility of inſpiring them with Sentiments of Reaſon and good Senſe.</p>
               <p>BY ſuch a Proceeding, a Man naturally forms a young Creature, for a <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>inſipid Companion;</hi> and if by that Means, he finds Matrimony to be an irkſome and diſagreeable Scence, what Wonder, and where does the Blame lye?</p>
               <p>NOTHING more naturally carries us beyond our ſelves, and puffs us up with an over-rating Opinion of our own Merit; ſwells every Appearance of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; ſo ſtrongly intrenches our Frailties and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections, that Reaſon and Reflection are too much enervated to diſlodge them; nothing more effectually ſpoils our Tempers, and corrupts our Judgments,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005772_0026_10270BB79B41B110"/>than FLATTERY: It renders us poſitive in our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and impatient of Contradiction.</p>
               <p>THEN that Hodge-Podge of Nonſenſe, which many call <hi>Making Love,</hi> is uſing a Woman to ſuch intemperate and frothy Sallies of Fancy, ſuch roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and unmeaning Impreſſions; that ſober Thought, and plain good Senſe, are foreign to her Taſte; and an Entertainment, to which being not uſed, ſhe has no <hi>Goût</hi> or Reliſh.</p>
               <p>WHAT an agreeable and pretty Sort of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, what a comfortable Wife do we hereby contrive for our ſelves? And how ingeniouſly do we thus labour to make her a poſitive and empty, a conceited and fantaſtical Simpleton? thus modelled, we ſoon come to deſpiſe her, and curſe our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>BUT ſome ſay this is the moſt certain and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Way to gain the Affections of a young Lady, and that a Man would make but a dull and heavy Figure in their Eyes without it, and find his Attacks very unſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>THIS may be true with ſome, and 'tis no leſs a Mark of <hi>Merit,</hi> than a Point of great <hi>good Fortune,</hi> to meet with Inſenſibility from them.—</p>
               <p>But 'tis far from being ſo with all; there are young Ladies, and many, with whom I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Man would find himſelf more acceptable and ſucceſsful by a contrary Method: And to ſuch only ſhould every Man apply himſelf, for the valuable and laſting Felicities of a Conjugal Life.</p>
               <p>IF we allow a Man may make a more ſpeedy Conqueſt by Fuſtian and Flattery, yet whoever, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, reflects on the Conſequences, ſhould be convinced, that it muſt be fatal to the future Repoſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005772_0027_10270BB937B34318"/>and Tranquility of his Life.—Let Coxcombs boaſt of ſuch Triumphs, but Men of Senſe will ever deſpiſe and ſhun them.</p>

               <p>HEREBY we have great Probability, and well grounded Expectations of ſecuring to our ſelves an agreeable and entertaining Companion.</p>
               <p>BY ſeaſonably introducing into Converſation uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects on human Life and Characters; by making ſolid and practical Reflections thereon, and engaging the Attention by a polite, and eaſy and lively Manner; we ſhall correct and ſtrengthen the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, enlarge the Faculties of the Mind, and raiſe the Soul to a free and generous Way of Thinking; drive out and extirpate, that childiſh, that little narrow-ſpirited Way of Thinking, that mean and injudicious Diſtruſt; thoſe low and pitiful Artifices, and that lurking Sort of Cunning, which is too much the Characteriſtick of many Women, is the Deteſtation of every great Mind, and the Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all ingenuous Spirits.</p>

THERE is no Friendſhip or Confidence to be had with ſuch <hi>dirty, tricking, low Minds;</hi> they are an utter Privation to all ſocial Happineſs, and when carried into a married Life, are inſuperable Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to its Welfare.</p>
               <p>MANY proper Opportunities may likewiſe be found, for recommending the Peruſal of elegant and improving Books, which by a good Choice and a judicious Taſte, will have a very beneficial Effect on the Mind and Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>BUT in all this, great Delicacy and a good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very eſſential; to diſtinguiſh nicely and to manage with Diſcretion, are highly neceſſary. We ſhould be careful to cover our good Intentions with ſo engaging an Artifice, as by no Means to ſhock the Paſſions; render every Thing as a Matter rather of Choice and Taſte than Preſcription.</p>
               <p>YOU will not, I am perſuaded, ſo greatly miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend my Meaning, under theſe Reflections, as to imagine I am pleading up for what is commonly underſtood by a <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>bookiſh Character</hi> in a young Lady; ſuch a One as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> paints out, a

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I am far from deſigning any ſuch ridiculous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. Nothing in Nature is, I think, more odious and contemptible than a <hi>female Pedant,</hi> a formal, a conceited and affected Wit; whoſe Brain is loaded with a Heap of indigeſted Stuff, and is eternally throwing up her confuſed Nonſenſe, in hard Words ill pronounced, jumbled Quotations miſapplyed, and a Jargon of Commo. Places; in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005772_0029_10270BBD6FE52390"/>order to let you know ſhe is a Woman of Reading; whereby ſhe convinces you, ſhe has taken a great deal of Pains to render herſelf a Fool of the firſt Claſs, and of the moſt irreclaimable Kind.</p>
               <p>—THE Barking of a Lap-dog is not more grating to the Ear, than the Gibberiſh of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Clacks; and the Chatter of a Parrot infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more entertaining. In ſhort, ſuch Women are the Mountebanks of their own, the Dread and Contempt of our Sex.</p>
               <p>BUT muſt theſe jingling Pretenders to Wit and Senſe, exclude us from the delightful Harmony, the amiable Converſation of a modeſt and unaffected Fair One, in whom a good Underſtanding is joined with a good Mind.</p>
               <p>How engaging are the Graces of ſuch a Character! How inſinuating are its Charms! How impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly does it win on the Mind! What a Flow of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sentiments, it diffuſes thro' the Heart! Calms each rougher Paſſion, and ſwells the Breaſt with thoſe exquiſite Emotions that rife above all Deſcription.</p>
               <p>THUS to imitate, and if poſſible to equal this Character it is, that I wou'd have Converſation and Books rend. And I cannot but think, if thus adapted and directed, they wou'd have a great Efficacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>
               <p>How great a Proſpect, and what reaſonable Hopes of Happineſs, there muſt be with ſuch a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, requires ſurely no Arguments to prove.</p>
               <p>BUT the Truth is, we are either actuated by other Motives than a Regard to and Deſire of ſocial Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or that we are hurried thro' Courtſhip, by an intemperate and unthinking Warmth: Hereby our Converſation is rendred either Deſigning or Ridiculous.</p>

NOR is it leſs neceſſary to inſpire our Miſtreſs with the Sentiments of a rational Eſteem, of a ſtedfaſt and generous Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>IT has been already obſerved, that LOVE conſidered meerly as a Paſſion, will naturally have but a ſhort Duration; like all other Paſſions 'tis changeable, tranſient and accidental. But Friendſhip and Eſteem are derived from Principles of Reaſon and Thought, and when once truly fixed in the Mind, are laſting Securities of an Attachment to our Perſons and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; participate with, and refine all our Joys; ſimpathize with, and blunt the Edge of every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Occurrence.—In vain ſhould I endeavour to make an Elogium on true <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> in any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure equal to its ſublime and exalted Value: There is no Good in Life comparable to it; neither are any, or all of its other Enjoyments worth deſiring without it. 'Tis the Crown to all our Felicities; the Glory, and I think, the Perfection of our Natures. Life's a Wilderneſs without a Friend, and all its gilded Scenes but barren and taſteleſs.</p>
               <p>HERE have I a copious Subject, to reflect on the many falſe Friendſhips there are in the World!— How few real and ſincere ones!—How much talk'd of, how little meant, and leſs underſtood! No <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous</hi> and <hi>diſintereſted</hi> Feelings of Mind, (the Eſſence of Friendſhip) can poſſibly diſplay themſelves, whilſt <hi>mercenary</hi> Views, and <hi>ſelfiſh Deſigns</hi> the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Action.—But this is a Digreſſion.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER it be in <hi>common Life,</hi> there cannot certainly be any ſteady or laſting Happineſs in a <hi>married One,</hi> where a mutual Eſteem and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, of the ſtrongeſt and nobleſt Kind, does not ſubſiſt. Let it therefore be the ſacred Buſineſs of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005772_0031_10270BC3F29D2B28"/>our Courtſhip to cultivate One, and on no Account engage our ſelves in Wedlock without it.</p>
               <p>I know of no Method, more likely to promote and ſecure it, than by being prepoſſeſſed with it our ſelves.</p>
               <p>THERE is a Sort of attractive Force in ſimilar Minds, as there is in Matter.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Great Minds by Inſtinct to each other turn,</l>
                  <l>Demand Alliance, and in Friendſhip burn.</l>
                  <bibl>Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Campaign.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>'TIS a common Saying, that <hi>Love begets Love;</hi> that is not always true. But where there is any Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Minds, <hi>Sentiments of Friendſhip, will beget Friendſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us then take every Opportunity of teſtifying our Eſteem and Friendſhip: Court the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Principles of Thought, and conciliate them to our own.</p>
               <p>HEREBY we ſhall as it were enter into the Soul, and take Poſſeſſion of all its Powers; this ſhould be the Ground-work of Love, this will be a vital Principal to that, and make our Concord as laſting as our Minds are unchangeable.</p>
               <p>THIS Subject ſhould be often that of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and we ſhoul particularly endeavour to fix <hi>right</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> Notions concerning it. To inſpire a certain Greatneſs of Mind, that <hi>ſcorns</hi> the <hi>leaſt Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> or <hi>Treachery;</hi> which no Diſtreſs can poſſibly ſhake, and which no Proſperity can ever relax. We ſhould endeavour to <hi>fire the Soul</hi> (if you will allow me the Expreſſion) with a Sort of <hi>heroick Enthuſiaſm,</hi> that no <hi>Decoys</hi> of Pleaſure, no <hi>Terrors</hi> of Pain,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005772_0032_10270BC6B3685AC8"/>ſhould ever be capable of extinguiſhing, and rather to dare <hi>Matrydom</hi> than <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THUS ſhould we fortify the Principles of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in her we chooſe for a Wife, and, by every poſſible Method in our Power, fix the Root <hi>deep</hi> in her Soul. For unleſs both Minds <hi>burn</hi> with this <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>eſſential Flame,</hi> our Happineſs in Marriage will have but a weak Baſis, and a very ſlender Tye; every little Flurry of Humour, every little Blaſt of Adverſity, will go near to overſet the Bark of our Felicity: We ſhall at beſt toſs about without a Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and without a Compaſs.</p>
               <p>BUT a fix'd Principle of Friendſhip will ſteady and ſecure us, and we ſhall glide o'er the Waves of Life, with Serenity and Confidence; prepared for Rocks and Quickſands, with unſhaken Courage, and an equal Mind.—Thus chearful, happy, and reſigned, ſteer a virtuous and invariable Courſe of Affection, 'till the Port of Mortality puts an End to our Voyage, having already anticipated that Heaven in each other's Love and Friendſhip, which we then go more fully to poſſeſs.</p>

               <p>NOR, on Examination, do I perceive any Thing in my Scheme too refined, or any ways impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, to a Man that unites in himſelf a <hi>good Head</hi> with a <hi>good Heart;</hi> a Character, under which an improving and grateful Experience has teſtified you to my Acquaintance and Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>VICIOUS Minds and coarſe Underſtandings, might, perhaps, laugh at theſe Things as chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and too fine ſpun for Practice. Whatever your Opinion may be, I reſt aſſured, that neither Goodneſs of Judgment, nor Delicacy of Taſte will be wanting to direct it.</p>
               <p>YOU will conſider it as the private Teſtimony of one Friend, to the Requeſt of another. The Privacy and Indulgence therefore of a friendly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, will ſecure me from any of thoſe ſevere or ill-natured Criticiſms, to which publick Writers are always expoſed. My Vanity does as little prompt me to ſeek <hi>Fame</hi> in that way, as my Capacity unfits me for it.</p>
               <p>BE this Declaration ſufficient.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, that in my preſent Way of thinking, whenever I am inclined to pay my Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to any Lady, it will be very much in the Way I have mentioned: I ſay, in ſome ſuch Manner.</p>

               <p>You may perhaps think me guilty of an Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the foregoing Reflections, in having ſaid nothing with regard to the <hi>Conſent of Parents.</hi> I ſhall therefore deliver you my Opinion in relation thereto as conciſely as poſſible.</p>
               <p>THAT there is a certain <hi>Authority</hi> lodged in Parents over their Children, and in conſequence thereof, a certain <hi>Obedience</hi> due from Children to their Parents, are Truths derived from Nature, and founded in Reaſon, and have had the Concurrence of all Ages and all Nations.</p>
               <p>Hiſtory gives us Inſtances of this Obedience paid to Parents, in ſome of the moſt illuſtrious Characters of Antiquity; and even in reſpect of Marriage, as you may remember in the Life of CYRUS the Great.</p>
               <p>WE have likewiſe many paſt and living Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, where the Authority of Parents over their Children in Marriages, has been moſt tyrannically and fatally exerted.</p>
               <p>WITHOUT entering into a Train of Reaſoning, I may venture to take it for granted;</p>
               <p>THAT no parental Authority, that is <hi>repugnant</hi> to the Dictates of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> or (which is the ſame Thing) the <hi>moral Happineſs</hi> of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is any ways binding on Children.</p>
               <p>To marry without a <hi>Union of Minds,</hi> a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Affections, a mutual Eſteem and Friendſhip for each other, is contrary to Reaſon and Virtue, the Moral Happineſs of our Natures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005772_0035_10270BCFA4F5DA60"/>
IT follows therefore that no parental Authority, thus to make ourſelves unhappy by marrying, is any ways binding on Children.</p>
               <p>To marry with a Union of Minds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being therefore agreeable to Reaſon and Virtue, and the Moral Happineſs of our Natures; 'tis evident that Parents have no Authority, founded in Truth or Nature, to hinder their Children from ſo doing.</p>
               <p>THO' theſe Propoſitions, and the Inferences drawn from them, are, I believe, juſt and true; yet Children ſhould undoubtedly be <hi>extreamly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in thwarting the Wills of their Parents: Should be <hi>very careful,</hi> that their <hi>Paſſions</hi> do not <hi>blind,</hi> or their <hi>Caprice miſlead</hi> them: Should with great Calmneſs and Impartiality reaſon with themſelves: Appeal to their Parents, with great Deference and Humility: Conſult with ſome wiſe and unbiaſſed Friend: Deſire their Interpoſition. In ſhort, do every Thing in their Power to convince and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade; and nothing but a manifeſt and conſcious Violation of Reaſon and their real Happineſs, ſhould force them to oppoſe or diſobey the Will of their Parents; eſpecially to ſuch as have ever behaved kindly, carefully and friendly to them: They have the <hi>greateſt Authority</hi> over Children, that one Mortal <hi>can have</hi> over another.</p>
               <p>How far it may be our <hi>Intereſt</hi> to obey or not, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Conſideration. What has been ſaid on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of mercenary Views, may ſerve to determine us.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. I. Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> in Marriage, are often Matters of Diſpute in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; but more frequently the Cauſes of Animoſity and Uneaſineſs to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelves.</head>
               <p>THE Cuſtoms of different Nations have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and the Sentiments of many People do carry theſe Points <hi>much too high,</hi> and with a Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as unreaſonable as unjuſtifiable.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER <hi>tyrannick</hi> and <hi>arbitrary Power</hi> the Laws of a Country may give a Man over his Wife, or ſhould they do the reverſe, there is no ſuch Kind of Dominion derived from <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MARRIAGE, in my Senſe of it, is a certain voluntary and mutual Contract between the Sexes, the End or Deſign of which is, or ſhould be, their joint Happineſs.</p>
               <p>'Tis therefore abſurd and ridiculous to ſuppoſe or conclude, that either Party do thereby conſent or bind themſelves over to an <hi>imperious</hi> or <hi>tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT follows therefore that Marriage, does neither by the Laws of Nature or Reaſon, give either Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a tyrannick and arbitrary Power over the other; and that the Exerciſe of ſuch a Power, is contrary to the Will and Happineſs of any rational Being;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005772_0038_10270BD7A032E798"/>and muſt in conſequence render a matrimonial Life uncomfortable and miſerable.</p>
               <p>To me there ſeems no other Standard of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than REASON and PRUDENCE; in which I am ſupported by the learned and judicious Mr. <hi>Woolaſton,</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rel. of Nat. Delin. Page 159.</note> who ſays, <q>I would have them live ſo far upon the Level, as (according to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Leſſon) to be governed <hi>both</hi> by <hi>Reaſon.</hi> If the Man's Reaſon be the ſtronger, his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Experience greater, (as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed to be) the Woman will be obliged on that Score to pay a Deference, and ſubmit to him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS certainly is to put the Affair on a right Footing.</p>
               <p>Now the foregoing Obſervations on Courtſhip preſuppoſe, and indeed plainly determine, a ſuperior Degree of Knowledge and Underſtanding in the Man: Conſequently derives to him that Deference and Submiſſion which is aſſigned by Mr. <hi>Woolaſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>REALLY <hi>Nature</hi> and the Circumſtances of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life, ſeem to deſign for Man that Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to inveſt him with a directing Power in the more difficult and important Affairs of Life.</p>
               <p>WHERE this ſuperior Capacity is not fixt in the Man, and that incumbent Subordination made a Rule of Conduct by the Woman, I ſhould greatly miſtruſt the Happineſs of their Condition. It muſt certainly break in upon our Scheme of Felicity, which ſuppoſes the former, and prepares the moſt probable Means for the latter, by fixing a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Eſteem in the Woman, for the Mind and Underſtanding of the Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:005772_0039_10270BD939D870F0"/>
THIS will naturally give a Veneration for his Sentiments, and a perſuaſive Force to his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For where we eſteem, and know we are eſteemed. we are eaſily won and prone to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> eſpecially where we have a good Opinion, and a Sort of Reverence for the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and good Senſe of the Perſon who calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and kindly Reaſons with us, and who we are convinced, makes our Welfare his ſupream and ruling Concern; this, by my Scheme, the Female muſt of courſe be conſcious to before Marriage, and will be ſo after, if we continue in the ſame Road of friendly and affectionate Behaviour to her; if we are tender in oppoſing her Inclinations; if we reaſon with Delicacy, Coolneſs and Temper, ſupported by a Solidity and Strength of Judgment.</p>
               <p>ALL this is no leſs the <hi>Duty,</hi> than the <hi>Prudence</hi> of a married Man.</p>
               <p>IF on the contrary, he is puſſed up with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and ridiculous Notions of his Prerogative; fond of ſhowing and exerting on every little Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a formal and magiſterial Authority, to which <hi>little Minds</hi> are very ſubject: No wonder then, if Contention and Animoſity are often their matrimonial Entertainment.</p>
               <p>A Man of Senſe and Breeding, will be as it were ſuperior, without ſeeming to know it; and ſupport his Influence with ſo great a Delicacy, that his Wife ſhall ever ſeem to be his Equal, make uſe of a thouſand polite Methods even to elevate her Character. What an amiable and engaging Scene muſt ſuch a Couple exhibit! How <hi>firm</hi> their <hi>Union!</hi> and how <hi>harmonious</hi> their Lives!</p>
               <p>BUT how often where Courtſhip has been ill
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005772_0040_10270BDBD96E3930"/>managed, and Marriage worſe directed, do we ſee the <hi>Reverſe</hi> of that <hi>lovely Scene?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHAT <hi>Embroils</hi> about <hi>Trifles!</hi> What <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>ſhocking</hi> Expreſſions to each other! What <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> and <hi>ſilly</hi> Diſputes about Prerogatives! till they are in ſuch a Ferment, as to be ready to cuff each other. In ſhort, for want of Delicacy, Judgment and Temper, 'tis the conſtant Struggle of their Lives, to try, as the vulgar Proverb has it, <hi>who ſhall wear the Breeches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude: Let us, who aim at being <hi>truly Happy</hi> in Marriage, take the proper Steps in our Courtſhip for convincing the Lady, that we are beſt capable of directing and judging in the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Concerns of Life; and after Marriage, uſe the proper Methods to aſcertain that Privilege.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> All litigious <hi>Wranglings,</hi> and capricious <hi>Contentions,</hi> ſhould be carefully avoided.</head>
               <p>A LITTLE Obſervation and Reflection on the common Scenes of Matrimony, may ſupply us with many Inſtances, to ſhow how much theſe trivial Jarrings ſpoil the Harmony, and interrupt the Felicities of it.</p>
               <p>WHAT Fermentations and Heats often ariſe from breaking of China, diſordering a Room, Dinner not being ready at a preciſe Hour, and a Thouſand other ſuch impertinent <hi>Bagatelles.</hi> I ſhould alſo deſire all the Train of fretful Aſpirations, as <hi>Pſhaw, Pho,</hi> &amp;c. to be diſcarded. Give up Trifles, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005772_0041_10270BDD6F3CBE30"/>not carry our Diſputes on them too far.—It would be endleſs to enumerate theſe inſignificant Fopperies of Contention; my Meaning may be eaſily conceived from the few I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>BUT trifling as theſe Things may be in themſelves, 'tis too notorious, they often occaſion ſuch <hi>Feuds</hi> and feveriſh <hi>Animoſities</hi> amongſt married People, as frequently give a <hi>bitter Tincture</hi> to, and diſcompoſe many Hours of their Lives; and are ſometimes of ſo bad a Conſequence, as to inflame their Minds with ſuch <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Diſtaſte,</hi> that <hi>irreparable</hi> Breaches are thereby opened.</p>
               <p>THE reproving each other before Company, and <hi>ſparring</hi> as it were together, is mighty wrong, and very unpolite; it irritates themſelves, and makes their Company very uneaſy.</p>
               <p>THESE Sort of matrimonial Squabbles, put one in Mind of a little venomous Infect they have in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> like a Gnat, who, when they bite, create a great Itching, which if much ſcratched, raiſes an Inflammation ſo malignant, that a Leg has been loſt by it, and ſometimes, Mortifications enſue, that have been attended with Death.</p>
               <p>THUS it often fares with theſe little Tumors in Matrimony: if we ſcratch and work them up with <hi>Wranglings</hi> and <hi>Capriciouſneſs,</hi> they may come to that <hi>Malignancy,</hi> as to cut off many of our Pleaſures, and at laſt give a <hi>mortal Wound</hi> to our Felicity.</p>
               <p>LET us therefore determine to ſhun theſe whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Follies, and guard our ſelves with Prudence and Temper, ſo as not to be ſurprized or unhinged by them; follow Mr. <hi>Pope's</hi> Advice on another Subject.

               <p>AMONGST thoſe who have a real Eſteem and Friendſhip for one another, there will, ſtrictly ſpeaking, be no Separation of Pleaſures: For tho' one Party does not actually ſhare in the other's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet they will in Effect do it by the Force of Benevolence, and be pleaſed, becauſe the other is ſo, whether they reliſh the particular Cauſe or not.</p>

               <p>THERE is a certain <hi>Parity</hi> and <hi>Decorum</hi> to be preſerved in our moſt retired Pleaſures.

               <p>TO a Man of any Delicacy, and even moderate Neatneſs, nothing certainly is more odious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, than a <hi>ſlatternly</hi> and <hi>uncleanly Woman:</hi> 'Tis enough to quell his ſtrongeſt Paſſions, and damp every fond and tender Emotion: 'Tis vaſtly more ſo in a Wife, than a Stranger, (for as to <hi>meer Perſon,</hi> the Keenneſs of Inclination is (I ſuppoſe) general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſs, <hi>after</hi> than <hi>before</hi> full Poſſeſſion) Therefore a <hi>ſlovenly</hi> and <hi>unfragrant One,</hi> in a Wife, muſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally run a great Riſque of weakning, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing Deſire. Beſides 'tis an Inſult upon a Man's Taſte, an Affront to his Senſes, and bullying him to his Noſe.</p>
               <p>THIS Negligence and Dirtineſs of Perſon, (if we expect or deſire a Man to love us at the ſame Time) is taxing him with the Want of his Senſes, with the Taſte and Appetite of a Hog, whoſe Joy is Filth.</p>
               <p>LET us ſurvey the Morning Dreſs of ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>DOWN Stairs they come, pulling up their ungar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, dirty Stockings—Slip-ſhod, with naked Heels peeping out—No Stays or other decent Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but all <hi>Flip Flop</hi>—A Sort of a Clout thrown about the Neck, without Form or Decency—A tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, diſcoloured Mob, or Night Cap, half on, and half off, with the frowſy Hair, hanging in ſweaty Ringlets, ſtaring like <hi>Meduſa</hi> with her Serpents—Shrugging up her Petticoats, that are ſweeping the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005772_0048_10270BF23784A968"/>Ground, and ſcarce ty'd on,—Hands unwaſhed—Teeth furr'd—and Eyes cruſted:—But I beg your Pardon, I'll go no farther with this ſluttiſh Picture, which I am afraid has already turned your Stomach. If the <hi>Copy,</hi> and but an Imperfect one it is, be ſo ſhocking to us, what think you muſt the <hi>Original</hi> be to the poor Wretch her Huſband, who, perhaps, for ſome Hours every Day in the Week, has the comfortable Sight and Odour of this Tatterdemalion. God help his Stomach! This is the real Pourtrait of many married Women, and the piteous Caſe of many a poor Soul of a Huſband; unleſs when happily ſome Stranger is expected, then Madam takes care to appear clean, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by convinces her Huſband, ſhe is more anxious to pleaſe a Stranger than the Man who has choſen her as his Companion for Life.</p>
               <p>EXCUSE my Prolixity and Warmth on this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury Article: I know your Temper, and my own correſponds with it. I am convinced this want of Decency and Cleanlineſs, is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Source of many Peoples Unhappineſs in Marriage.</p>
               <p>A conſtant Care and Study to preſerve the <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of Dreſs and Perſon, muſt be of great Service to ſupport Love and Eſteem in Wedlock.</p>
               <p>I don't hereby intend or mean Foppery or Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but that Neatneſs and Cleanlineſs, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is nor ought to be aſhamed of ſeeing or being ſeen by any Body.</p>
               <p>A Wife that is deſirous of maintaining herſelf in the Affections of a Man of Senſe and Spirit, ſhould take as much Care of the Neatneſs of her
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005772_0049_10270BF409551190"/>Perſon, as if ſhe was to be every Day a Bride; and whoever neglects this Conduct, muſt blame themſelves, if their Huſbands grow cool and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; for it has a natural Tendency to make a Man ſo. It debaſes the Character of a Wife, and renders her cheap and unlovely.</p>
               <p>SUFFER me yet to detain you with ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from Dean SWIFT's Poem, intitled, <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Chloe;</hi> whoſe judicious and ſprightly Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will in ſome Meaſure make you Amends for the Heavineſs of mine.

                     <l>Authorities both old and recent,</l>

                     <l>It hardly holds the Honey Moon:</l>
                     <l>For if they keep not what they caught,</l>
                     <l>It is entirely their own Fault;</l>
                     <l>They take Poſſeſſion of the Crown,</l>
                     <l>And then throw all their Weapons down.</l>
                     <l>Though by the Politicians Scheme,</l>
                     <l>Whoe'er arrives at Pow'r ſupream,</l>

               <p>To conclude, let us at all Times avoid every Thing that is really uncomely; and let not our Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities run into the Extreams of a vulgar Rudeneſs and an unpolite Behaviour: Be as far removed from a ſtiff Formality, as an irregular Looſeneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>

               <p>MARRIAGE, or an Union of the Sexes, tho' it be in it ſelf one of the ſmalleſt Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, is the original Fountain from whence the greateſt and moſt extenſive Governments have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their Beings.</p>
               <p>'TIS a monarchical one, having REASON for its Legiſlator and Prince: An Authority more noble and ſublime than any other State can boaſt of.</p>
               <p>THIS Maxim, which reaches all Governments and Societies, is not leſs relative to the matrimonial One; to wit, <hi>That the Good of the Whole is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005772_0051_10270BFAB4DA2E90"/>by a Harmony and Correſpondence of its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts to their reſpective Ends and Relations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM this Compariſon many demonſtrative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments might be drawn, to illuſtrate and enforce what has been advanced in the firſt Section of this Letter.</p>
               <p>THAT as Prince <hi>Reaſon</hi> (to carry on the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude) muſt act by a Sort of Vicegerency or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and that Honour, by the Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and for the Good of the Whole, ought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to fall on the moſt capable and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, which by our Scheme the Man will be—All Rebellion againſt this Vicegerent, whilſt he acts in the Character of his Prince <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is extreamly wrong and undutiful; has a fatal Tendency to ſubvert the Tranquility and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the matrimonial State:—But we will leave theſe Politicks, and come to the Subject in hand.</p>
               <p>WE juſt now obſerved, that the Well-being of Marriage, as of all other Societies, aroſe from a Harmony and Correſpondence of its ſeveral Parts to their reſpective Ends and Relations.</p>
               <p>THIS fundamental Truth has been hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered chiefly as it relates to the <hi>internal Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the Conjugates: We ſhall now apply it to thoſe practical ones which ariſe from the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Fortune,</hi> and what is called <hi>Houſewifery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT Part of Management which belongs to the preſerving our Intereſt, or improving our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, uſually falls, and very properly, on the Man. And 'tis unqueſtionably incumbent on him, if he be a Man of Eſtate, and independant on any Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to regulate his Equipage, his private and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005772_0052_10270BFD57E6D5E0"/>Expences, according to the Income of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and 'tis certainly a Point of Prudence not to live <hi>quite up</hi> to <hi>that;</hi> but to lay up a Fund, to which he may have recourſe in any of thoſe adverſe Occurrences to which the moſt exalted Stations are liable, as alſo to provide for younger Children which he has, or may have. He ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide too much in Stewards or Agents, but inſpect his Property ſo much at leaſt, as to be able to judge of their Conduct—He ſhould not be indolently content with the formal Delivery of Accounts, but examine them, know why and wherefore he pays, and for what he is paid.</p>
               <p>How fatal the contrary to all this has been to many Gentlemen of Fortune, and their Families, is ſo unhappily atteſted by many tragical Examples, as ſhould, I think, be prevailing Arguments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force what has been ſaid.</p>
               <p>IF our Fortunes are thrown out in any Schemes of Baſineſs for Improvement, our Expences and Manner of Living ſhould be proportionable to our Fund and Proſpects of Succeſs: And as the latter moſt commonly depend on Attention and Prudence, we ſhould conſtantly govern our ſelves by them to the beſt of our Abilities. Avoid being engaged in any ſuch precarious Schemes as by being abortive may utterly ruin us. As the Merchants ſay, we ſhould not venture all on one Bottom, ſo as that the common Accidents of Winds and Weather may totally ſink our Fortune. All our Engagements ſhould be preceded by Fore-thought and Diſcretion: And in very important Ones 'twou'd be but juſt and prudent to inform and conſult a Wiſe, whoſe intimate Concern therein does, I think demand it;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005772_0053_10270C00F510F9E8"/>the may be capable of giving us Advice that may be very ſerviceable; it will at leaſt prepare her to bear, with us, any unfortunate Conſequences that may attend us; and that is a very good Reaſon for her being informed.</p>
               <p>To conclude, No ridiculous Vanity or fooliſh Ambition ſhould ſuffer the Huſband or Wife, in their Dreſs, Furniture, or whole way of Life, to exceed their Income or Fortune.</p>
               <p>Their Appearance and Expences, ſhould neither degenerate into <hi>Sordidneſs,</hi> nor run into a <hi>wild Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT particular Part of Management called Houſewifery, belongs to the Woman, and we ſhall compriſe it under theſe three Diviſions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>A PRUDENT FRUGALITY,</item>
                  <item>NEATNESS,</item>
                  <item>AND A HARMONIOUS OECONOMY.</item>
               </list>
               <p>SHE ſhould obſerve in the firſt Place a <hi>prudent Frugality</hi>—</p>
               <p>BY our former Doctrine a Wife will have a general Notion of her Huſband's Circumſtances; ſhe ſhould therefore in thoſe Affairs which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Inſpection and Management, be ſo govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſaid Circumſtances, as to regulate her Houſhold Expences by that juſt Proportion which his Fortune will afford.</p>
               <p>AND as on the one Hand <hi>Diſcretion</hi> muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her from running into any <hi>laviſh Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances,</hi> ſo on the other ſhould a <hi>generous Temper</hi> make her <hi>ſcorn</hi> any Thing that is <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>pitiful.</hi> 'Tis the happy and judicious <hi>Medium</hi> between theſe <hi>two Extremes,</hi> that conſtitutes a <hi>prudent Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,</hi> and the true Excellency of Houſewifery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:005772_0054_10270C05BA18F0A8"/>
'Tis one of the moſt amiable Lights a Wife can ſhow her ſelf in to publick Obſervation. It throws a Glory round her, which is not leſs to be reverenced than admired; does Honour to her Huſband, and renders the Entertainment of her Gueſts elegant and pleaſing. For as an <hi>imprudent Oſtentation</hi> gives Pain and Ridicule; ſo any thing <hi>meanly penurious,</hi> raiſes Indignation and Contempt.</p>
               <p>WOMEN often want Judgment to direct, and Souls to execute this ſkilful and lovely Medium of <hi>prudent Frugality,</hi> and thereby are either profuſe or ſcandalouſly narrow.</p>
               <p>'TIS therefore a Leſſon highly neceſſary for them to learn; that all <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> of <hi>exceeding</hi> their Circumſtances in this Part of Houſewifery, is very <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and with all People of good Senſe creates <hi>Pity</hi> for their <hi>filly Extravagance,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of their <hi>weak Underſtandings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND, on the other Hand, that every thing which is <hi>niggardly</hi> and <hi>ſtingy,</hi> or <hi>beneath</hi> what may <hi>juſtly</hi> be afforded, is the Mark of a <hi>little, grovelling, dirty Soul,</hi> and expoſes us to the Jeſts and Laughter of all Obſervers—The next Thing is</p>
               <p>NEATNESS AND CLEANLINESS.</p>
               <p>How neceſſary this is to the Comfort and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Life, and how <hi>deteſtable</hi> a <hi>ſluttiſh, naſty Management,</hi> muſt be, are Things ſo very obvious, that little need be ſaid to enforce it. But I muſt juſt mention one or two Faults in the Execution of this Part of Houſewifery, which many Women are guilty of, and that I wou'd have avioded in our Scheme.</p>
               <p>The one is the <hi>ill timing</hi> of <hi>Cleanlineſs,</hi> and the carrying it to ſuch <hi>Extreams,</hi> that a Man's Houſe
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005772_0055_10270C0755E28A00"/>is made an uneaſy, and almoſt <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> Habitation to him. Some Women have ſuch amphibious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that one would think they choſe to be half of their Lives in Water; there's ſuch a Clatter of Pails and Bruſhes, ſuch Inundations in every Room, that a Man can't find a dry Place for the Sole of his Foot; ſo that what ſhould tend to make a Man's Houſe an agreeable and wholeſome Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becomes ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>unpleaſant,</hi> that the <hi>Deſire</hi> of <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> drives him out of it. And theſe Overflowings of Neatneſs are often ſo <hi>ill timed,</hi> that a Man's Buſineſs is interrupted, and his Meals made uncomfortable by 'em. Theſe <hi>Fiſh-wives</hi> have generally a great Fund of ill Nature, or a ſmall one of good Senſe.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Fault is that <hi>Bigotry</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> for Neatneſs, which makes a Woman fretful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy at every accidental or unavoidable Speck of Dirt, or the leaſt Diſordering of her Furniture: You muſt rub your Shoes till the Bottoms of your Feet are almoſt ſore, before you are permitted to enter a Room. Then ſo many nonſenſical Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and impertinent Queſtions are propos'd, that one might enter a Garriſon Town in War-time with-leſs ado. Such as, <hi>Pray don't meddle with that,</hi> and <hi>Pray don't put this out of its Place,</hi> that one would think there was a Spell on all the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, or a Man was going to run away with Part of it.</p>
               <p>THESE are all <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>childiſh Extreams:</hi> A prudent Houſewife ſhould ſo <hi>time</hi> her Neatneſs and Cleanlineſs, that it may be as little inconvenient and troubleſome to a Man as poſſible, and ſupport it with a graceful Eaſe, and a good-natured Sort
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005772_0056_10270C0C15148BA0"/>of Indifference: The contrary has more of the <hi>Servant-Maid</hi> than the <hi>well bred Woman</hi> in it, and generally accompanies a <hi>low</hi> and <hi>mean Education.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE third Thing in the Character of a good Houſewifes, is A HARMONIOUS OECONOMY.</p>
               <p>By which is meant, the maintaining <hi>Order, Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquility,</hi> in her Houſe; avoiding all noiſy and turbulent Scolding, for which many pretended Houſewifes are greatly blameable, make their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, their own, and their Servant's Lives, uneaſy.</p>
               <p>MANY Ladies are apt to miſtake this <hi>buſtling</hi> and <hi>vociferous</hi> Turn for <hi>good Management;</hi> 'tis a great Miſtake, and rather ſhows a <hi>Want Skill</hi> and <hi>Temper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHERE the Miſtreſs of a Family underſtands her Buſineſs, carries her Authority with <hi>Reſolution,</hi> and at the ſame time with <hi>good Nature</hi> and <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> Servants will naturally be obedient and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent.</p>
               <p>BUT where Ignorance is joined with a tyrannick and inſolent Temper, there are generally Blunders and Remiſſneſs in Servants, Hatred of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, a conſtant <hi>Din</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> between them. A Man had better live in a Paper-Mill, or a Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman's Stall, than in ſuch a Houſe.</p>
               <p>THESE Scenes are mighty unpleaſant, very ſhocking, and highly prejudicial to the Tranquility of a married Life; are ſure Signs of a brutal Temper, and a very vulgar Education.</p>
               <p>WHEREAS a Woman of Judgment, an <hi>even Mind,</hi> and a polite Taſte, will be <hi>obeyed</hi> and <hi>beloved</hi> by her Servants: All Things will go on <hi>ſmooth</hi> and <hi>quiet:</hi> Her Government will be <hi>mild, calm</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005772_0057_10270C10B88C0F18"/>
                  <hi>harmonious:</hi> Her Houſe the Habitation of <hi>Peace, Joy</hi> and <hi>Contentment!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS a Truth, I believe, with very few Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that <hi>a good Miſtreſs makes good Servants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PEOPLE of that Claſs are not without Gratitude, and a Senſe of Merit.</p>
               <p>WHERE Women are ever complaining of <hi>their Servants,</hi> it carries a ſtrong Suſpicion of <hi>their own</hi> Capacities and Temper.</p>
               <p>WHEN a Miſtreſs of a Houſe is giving Orders to Servants, or talking to them, 'tis often done in ſuch an <hi>imperious, bawling</hi> Manner, that ſhe is heard from every Corner. This is very unpolite, and ſhows a <hi>little Mind,</hi> ſo <hi>ſwelled</hi> with Power, that 'tis unable to ſupport it with Decency and Temper.</p>
               <p>THESE Cattle are ſuch domeſtick Evils, that one had better live in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Dram-Cellar, than with their horrid Clangor.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, a Miſtreſs of a Family ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on her Adminiſtration in a <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>pacifick Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and if ſhe has any Diſputes with her Servants, conceal them from the Ears of a Huſband and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as much as poſſible: Have every Thing done quietly, and in order.</p>
               <p>IF Servants won't be thus governed, <hi>diſcard</hi> them <hi>at once,</hi> and not ſuffer her own and her Huſband's Peace to be deſtroyed by their Incorrigibleneſs.</p>
               <p>THIS will make Home comfortable and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; whereas the Want of this <hi>harmonious Oeconomy</hi> ſours the Temper of a Woman, drives a Man out of his own Houſe, makes Home his Averſion, and deſtroys that Serenity which is ſo very eſſential to the Felicity of all Society.</p>
               <p>

AND now let us ſtop and ſurvey a Wife thus <hi>wiſely</hi> and <hi>diſcreetly</hi> filling her Sphere of Action.</p>
               <p>WHAT <hi>Veneration!</hi> What <hi>Praiſe!</hi> What <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Eſteem,</hi> can ſufficiently equal her <hi>Merit!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Character of a Wife, can ſcarcely ſhine in a more exalted Point of Light, nor do a more publick Honour to herſelf and her Huſband. Whoever poſſeſſes ſuch a One, <hi>Joy</hi> will <hi>ſparkle</hi> in his Eye, and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> fill his Breaſt.</p>
               <p>CAN the <hi>flaſhy</hi> and <hi>ſuperficial Glare</hi> of Dreſs and Equipage, give a Title to ſuch <hi>ſolid Excellence</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial Worth?</hi> Poſitively NOT. The twinkling Luſtre of a Chryſtal, may as well equal the auguſt Splendor of a royal Diamond.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, each Party thus ſupporting their reſpective Adminiſtration with Prudence and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, will fix a Crown of Triumph on their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be a laſting Cement to their Tranquility and Happineſs.</p>
               <p>AND now my Friend, your Taſk of Patience is drawing to a Concluſion.</p>
               <p>CONFORMABLE to your Requeſt, I have thrown before you my private Sentiments on the Subject of that Afternoon's Debate, which, you ſay, threw you into a Sort of Scepticiſm.—Whether my rough Thoughts may in any wiſe tend to determine your Opinion, I know not. If they give you any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, to atone for the Trouble of Reading them, I ſhall be well pleaſed.—But if neither one nor the other, you muſt blame your Influence over me for their Impertinence.</p>
               <p>FOR my own Part, I confeſs, to think it <hi>poſſible</hi> for a Man of <hi>Senſe,</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> to find
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005772_0059_10270C169C6E9468"/>Woman, in whoſe Society he may lay as probable a Foundation for the Enjoyment and Happineſs of his Life by Marriage, and to ſuperſtruct as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Proſpect of continuing his Felicity in that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as any other Scheme of Life can lay claim to.</p>
               <p>'TIS a Truth as univerſally experienced as owned, that no State of Life is exempt from the Alternatives of Pleaſure and Pain, the bitter and ſweet; and that a Perfection of Happineſs is not the Lot of Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>IF this be the Caſe with human Life in general, and its proper Character, MARRIAGE is not leſs worth your Choice, becauſe it may have, or has, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and Alloys.—</p>
               <p>IF thoſe Inconveniencies and Alloys are neceſſarily greater, (without a proportionable Superiority of Pleaſures) in a conjugal than a ſingle Life, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is undoubtedly to be preferred.—But I believe <hi>they</hi> cannot be proved <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ſo, only <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially.</hi>—Well, the Queſtion then is, Whether theſe <hi>circumſtantial</hi> Impediments, which are, or may be, alledged againſt the Choice of a married Life, cannot, by a <hi>proper Conduct, in</hi> the <hi>Time</hi> of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and <hi>after,</hi> be removed.</p>
               <p>'TIS thought they may; and the Deſign of theſe Papers is to propoſe <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>by what Methods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND we conceive, the Obſervations made, and the Methods propoſed, may be effectual, and are not impracticable, to put the married State not only on an Equality of probable Happineſs with a ſingle One, but to give it a Proſpect of ſuperior Felicity.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER <hi>unſkilfully</hi> this Argument may have been handled by me, and of how little Advantage
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005772_0060_10270C1DF950E9A0"/>ſoever my <hi>weak Attempts</hi> may have been to ſerve it; the Truth of the Propoſtions remain <hi>in Force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FIRST. <hi>That unhappy Matches are often occaſion'd by meer mercenary Views, in one or both of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Or by the head-ſtrong Motives of ill-conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, <hi>That by a prudent and judicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in our Addreſſes to a young Lady of a good natural Temper, we may lay a very good Foundation for making her an agreeable Companion, a ſteady Friend, and a good Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND Thirdly, <hi>That after Marriage, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in the Road of Prudence and Judgment, we may make the nuptial State as happy as we can promiſe our ſelves from any other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, Sir, whenever I am inclined for a <hi>matrimonial Voyage,</hi> I ſhall endeavour thus to <hi>ſteer my Courſe,</hi> and if I cannot <hi>gain the Port</hi> by this Manner of Courtſhip and Conduct, I will reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my preſent Condition.</p>
               <p>IF, on the other Hand, I ſhould <hi>thereby</hi> gain the Inclinations and Conſent of a Lady, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſupport my Happineſs in ſome ſuch Manner as I have herein intimated.</p>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Hurry and Impertinence of receiving and Paying Viſits on Account of your Marriage, being now over, you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to enter into a Courſe of Life, where you will want much Advice to divert you from falling into many Errors, Fopperies, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to which your Sex is ſubject. I have always borne an entire Friendſhip to your Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the Perſon they have choſen for your Huſband, hath been, for ſome Years paſt, my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Favourite; I have long wiſh'd you might come together, becauſe I hoped, that from the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005772_0062_10270C25E5C56B18"/>Goodneſs of your Diſpoſition, and by following the Counſel of wife Friends, you might, in Time, make your ſelf worthy of him. Your Parents were ſo far in the Right that they did not produce you much into the World, whereby you avoided many wrong Steps which others have taken, and have fewer ill Impreſſions to be removed: But they fail'd, as it is generally the Caſe, in too much neglecting to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate your Mind; without which it is impoſſible to acquire or preſerve the Friendſhip and Eſteem of a wife Man, who ſoon grows weary of acting the Lover, and treating his Wife like a Miſtreſs, but wants a reaſonable Companion, and a true Friend, through every Stage of his Life. It muſt be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Buſineſs to qualify yourſelf for thoſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; wherein I will not fail to be your Director, as long as I ſhall think you deſerve, it, by letting you know how you are to act, and what you are to avoid.</p>
            <p>AND beware of deſpiſing or neglecting my Inſtructions, whereon will depend not only your making a good Figure in the World, but your own real Happineſs, as well as that of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ought to be the deareſt to you.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore deſire you, in the firſt Place, to be very ſlow in changing the <hi>modeſt Behaviour</hi> of a <hi>Virgin:</hi> It is uſual in young Wives, before they have been many Weeks marry'd, to aſſume a bold forward Look and Manner of talking, as if they intended to ſignify in all Companies, that they were no longer Girls, and conſequently that their whole Demeanor, before they got a Huſband, was all but a Countenance and Conſtraint upon their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whereas, I ſuppoſe, if the Votes of wiſe Men were gather'd, a very great Majority would
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005772_0063_10270C278128D830"/>be in Favour of thoſe Ladies, who, after they were enter'd into that State, rather choſe to double their Portion of Modeſty and Reſervedneſs.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe warn you ſtrictly againſt the leaſt Degree of <hi>Fondneſs</hi> to your Huſband before any Witneſs whatſoever, even before your neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the very Maids of your Chamber. This Proceeding is ſo exceeding odious and diſguſtful to all who have either good Breeding or good Senſe, that they aſſign two very unamiable Reaſons for it; the one is groſs Hypocrify, and the other has too bad a Name to mention. If there is any Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to be made, your Huſband is the loweſt Perſon in Company, either at Home or Abroad, and every Gentleman preſent has a better Claim to all Marks of Civility and Diſtinction from you. Conceal your Eſteem and Love in your own Breaſt, and reſerve your kind Looks and Language for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Hours, which are ſo many in the Four and Twenty, that they will afford time to employ a Paſſion as exalted as any that was ever deſcrib'd in a <hi>French</hi> Romance.</p>
            <p>UPON this Head, I ſhould likewiſe adviſe you to differ in Practice from thoſe Ladies who affect Abundance of <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> while their Huſbands are abroad; ſtart with every Knock at the Door, and ring the Bell inceſſantly for the Servants to let in their Maſter; will not eat a Bit at Dinner or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per if the Huſband happens to ſtay out; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him at his Return with ſuch a Medley of Chiding and Kindneſs, and catechiſing him where he has been, that a Shrew from <hi>Billingſgate</hi> would be a more eaſy and eligible Companion.</p>
            <p>OF the ſame Leaven are thoſe Wives, who when
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005772_0064_10270C2A55055900"/>their Huſbands are gone a Journey, muſt have a Letter every Poſt, upon pain of Fits and Hiſtericks; and a Day muſt be fix'd for their Return Home, without the leaſt Allowance for Buſineſs, or Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Accidents, or Weather: Upon which, I can only ſay, that in my Obſervation, thoſe Ladies who are apt to make the greateſt Clutter on ſuch Occaſions, would liberally have paid a Meſſenger for bringing them News, that their Huſbands had broken their Necks on the Road.</p>
            <p>You will perhaps be offended, when I adviſe you to abate a little of that violent Paſſion for <hi>fine Cloaths,</hi> ſo predominant in your Sex. It is a little hard, that ours, for whoſe Sake you wear them, are not admitted to be of your Council. I may venture to aſſure you, that we will make an Abatement at any Time of four Pounds a Yard in a Brocade, if the Ladies will but allow a ſuitable Addition of Care in the <hi>Cleanlineſs</hi> and Sweetneſs of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For the ſatyrical Part of Mankind will needs believe, that it is not impoſſible to be very fine and very filthy; and that the Capacities of a Lady are ſometimes apt to fall ſhort in cultivating Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Finery together. I ſhall only add, upon ſo tender a Subject, what a pleaſant Gentleman ſaid concerning a ſilly Woman of Quality; that nothing could make her ſupportable but cutting off her Head, for his Ears were offended by her Tongue, and his Noſe by her Hair and Teeth.</p>
            <p>I am wholly at a loſs how to adviſe you in the Choice of <hi>Company,</hi> which, however, is a Point of as great Importance as any in your Life. If your general Acquaintance be among Ladies who are your Equals or Superiors, provided they have nothing of
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005772_0065_10270C30D5AC85E0"/>what is commonly called an ill Reputation, you think you are ſafe; and this, in the Stile of the World, will paſs for good Company. Whereas I am afraid it will be hard for you to pick out one Female Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in this Town, from whom you will not be in manifeſt Danger of contracting ſome Foppery, Affectation, Vanity, Folly, or Vice. Your only ſafe Way of converſing with them is, by a firm Reſolution to proceed in your Practice and Behaviour directly contrary to whatever they ſhall ſay or do: And this I take to be a good general Rule, with very few Exceptions. For Inſtance, In the Doctrines they uſually deliver to young mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd Women for managing their Huſbands; their ſeveral Accounts of their own Conduct in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to recommend it to your Imitation; the Reflections they make upon others of their Sex for acting differently; their Directions how to come off with Victory upon any Diſpute or Quarrel you may have with your Huſband; the Arts by which you may diſcover and practiſe upon his weak Side; when to work by Flattery and Inſinuation, when to melt him with Tears, and when to engage with a high Hand. In theſe, and a Thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſes, it will be prudent to retain as many of their Lectures in your Memory as you can, and then determine to act in full Oppoſition to them all.</p>
            <p>I hope your Huſband will interpoſe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to limit you in the Trade of <hi>Viſiting;</hi> half a dozen Fools are in all Conſcience as many as you ſhould require; and it will be ſufficient for you to ſee them twice a Year: For I think the Faſhion does not exact, that Viſits ſhould be paid to Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:005772_0066_10270C326C8AB9A8"/>
I adviſe that your Company at Home ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Men, rather than Women. To ſay the Truth I never yet knew a tolerable Woman to be fond of her own Sex. I confeſs, when both are mix'd and well choſen, and put their beſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties forward, there may be an Intercourſe of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and Good-will, which, with the Addition of ſome Degree of Senſe, can make Converſation or any Amuſement agreeable. But a Knot of Ladies got together by themſelves, is a very School of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence and Detraction, and it is well if thoſe be the worſt.</p>
            <p>LET your Men-acquaintance be of your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Choice, and not recommended to you by any She-companions; becauſe they will certaintly fix a Coxcomb upon you, and it will coſt you ſome Time and Pains before you can arrive at the Knowledge of diſtinguiſhing ſuch a one from a Man of Senſe.</p>
            <p>NEVER take a <hi>favourite Waiting-Maid</hi> into your Cabinet-Council, to entertain you with Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of thoſe Ladies whom ſhe hath formerly ſerv'd, of their Diverſions and their Dreſſes; to inſinuate how great a Fortune you brought, and how little you are allow'd to ſquander; to appeal to her from your Huſband, and to be determined by her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe you are ſure it will be always for you; to receive and diſcard Servants by her Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or Diſlike; to engage you, by her Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, into Miſunderſtandings with your beſt Friends; to repreſent all Things in falſe Colours, and to be the common Emiſſary of Scandal.</p>
            <p>BUT the grand Affair of your Life will be to gain and preſerve the Friendſhip and Eſteem of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:005772_0067_10270C3559A932D8"/>your <hi>Huſband.</hi> Your are married to a Man of good Education and Learning, of an excellent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and an exact Taſte. It is true, and it is happy for you, that theſe Qualities in him are adorn'd with great Modeſty, a moſt amiable Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper, and an unuſual Diſpoſition to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and Virtue; But neither Good-nature nor Virtue will ſuffer him to eſteem you againſt his Judgment; and although he is not capable of uſing you ill, yet you will in Time grow a Thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and perhaps contemptible; unleſs you can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Loſs of Youth and Beauty with more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Qualities. Your have very few Years to be young and handſome in the Eyes of the World; and as few Months to be ſo in the Eyes of a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who is not a fool; for I hope you do not ſtil dream of Charms and Raptures, which Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ever did, and ever will, put a ſadden End to Beſides, your's was a Match of Prudence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good-liking, without any Mixture of that ridiculous Paſſion, which has no Being but in Play-Books and Romances.</p>
            <p>You muſt therefore uſe all Endeavours to attain to ſome Degree of thoſe Accompliſhments which your Huſband moſt values in other People, and for which he is moſt valued himſelf. You muſt improve your Mind, by cloſely purſuing ſuch a Method of Study as I ſhall direct or approve of You muſt get a Collection of Hiſtory and Travels, which I will recommend to you, and ſpend ſome Hours every Day in reading them, and making Extracts from them, if your Memory be weak. You muſt invite Perſons of Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to an Acquaintance with, you, by whoſe
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005772_0068_10270C380BE8D400"/>Converſation you may learn to correct your Taſte and Judgment; and when you can bring yourſelf to comprehend and reliſh the good Senſe of others, you will arrive in time to think rightly your ſelf, and to become a reaſonable and agreeable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. This muſt produce in your Huſband a true rational Love and Eſteem for you, which old Age will not diminiſh. He will have regard for your Judgment and Opinion in Matters of the greateſt Weight; you will be able to entertain each other without a third Perſon to relieve you by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe. The Endowments of your Mind will even make your Perſon more agreeable to him; and when you are alone, your Time will not lie heavy upon your Hands for want of ſome trifling Amuſement.</p>
            <p>As little Reſpect as I have for the Generality of your Sex, it hath ſometimes moved me with Pity, to ſee the Lady of the Houſe forced to withdraw immediately after Dinner, and this in Families where there is not much Drinking; as if it were an eſtabliſhed Maxim, that Women are uncapable of all Converſation. In a Room where both Sexes meet, if the Men are diſcourſing upon any general Subject, the Ladies never think it their Buſineſs to partake in what paſſes, but in a ſeparate Club enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain each other with the Price and Choice of Lace, and Silk, and what Dreſſes they liked or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd at the Church or the Play-houſe. And when you are among yourſelves, how naturally, after the firſt Complements, do you apply your Hands to each others Lappets and Rufles, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua's, as if the whole Buſineſs of your Lives, and the publick Concern of the World, depended upon
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005772_0069_10270C3AAF13AE78"/>the Cut or Colour of your Dreſſes. As Divines ſay, that ſome People take more Pains to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, than it would coſt them to be ſaved; ſo your Sex employs more Thought, Memory and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to be Fools, than would ſerve to make them wiſe and uſeful. When I reflect on this, I cannot conceive you to be human Creatures, but a Sort of Species hardly a Degree above a Monkey; who has more diverting Tricks than any of you, is an Animal leſs miſchievous and expenſive, might in time be a tolerable Critick in Velvet and Brocade, and, for ought I know, would equally become them.</p>
            <p>I would have you look upon Finery as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Folly, as all great Ladies did, whom I have ever known: I do not deſire you to be out of the Faſhion, but to be the laſt and leaſt in it. I expect that your Dreſs ſhall be one Degree lower than your Fortune can afford; and in your own Heart I would wiſh you to be an utter Contemner of all Diſtinctions which a finer Petticoat can give you; becauſe it will neither make you richer, handſomer, younger, better natur'd, more virtuous, or wiſe, than if it hung upon a Peg.</p>
            <p>IF you are in Company with Men of Learning, tho' they happen to diſcourſe of Arts and Sciences out of your Compaſs, yet you will gather more Advantage by liſt'ning to them, than from all the Nonſenſe and Frippery of your own Sex; but if they be Men of Breeding as well as Learning, they will ſeldom engage in any Converſation where you ought not to be a Hearer, and in time have your Part. If they talk of the Manners and Cuſtoms of the ſeveral Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> of Travels into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005772_0070_10270C3D6B4EDA60"/>Nations, of the State of their own Country, or of the great Men and Actions of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> if they give their Judgment upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Writers, either in Verſe or Proſe, or of the Nature and Limits of Virtue and Vice, it is a Shame for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady not to reliſh ſuch Diſcourſes, not to improve by them, and endeavour, by Reading and Information, to have her Share in thoſe Entertainments, rather than turn aſide, as it is the uſual Cuſtom, and conſult with the Woman who ſits next her, about a new Cargo of Fans.</p>
            <p>IT is a little hard, that not one Gentleman's Daughter in a Thouſand ſhould be brought to read or underſtand her own natural Tongue, or be Judge of the eaſieſt Books that are written in it; as any One may find, who can have the Patience to hear them, when they are dispos'd to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle a Play or a Novel, where the leaſt Word out of the common Road if ſure to diſconcert them. It is no Wonder, when they are not ſo much as taught to ſpell in their Childhood, nor can ever attain to it in their whole Lives. I adviſe you therefore to read aloud, more or leſs, every Day to your Huſband it he will permit you, or to any other Friend, (but not a Female One) who is able to ſet you right; and as for Spelling, you may compaſs it in time, by making Collections from the Books you read.</p>
            <p>I know very well that thoſe who are commonly called learned Women, have loſt all Manner of Credit by their impertment Talkativeneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of themſelves; but there is an eaſy Remedy for this, if you once conſider, that after all the the Pains you may be at, you never can arrive, in
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005772_0071_10270C43D5FC95F8"/>Point of Learning, to the Perfection of a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy. The Reading I would adviſe you to, is only for Improvement of your own good Senſe, which will never fail of being mended by Diſcretion. It is a wrong. Method, and ill Choice of Books, that makes thoſe learned Ladies juſt ſo much worſe for what they have read. And therefore it ſhall be my Care to direct you better, a Taſk for which I take my ſelf to be not ill qualify'd; becauſe I have ſpent more time, and have had more Opportunities than many others, to obſerve and diſcover from what Sources the various Follies of Women are deriv'd.</p>
            <p>PRAY obſerve how inſignificant Things are the common Race of Ladies, when they have paſſed their Youth and Beauty; how contemptible they appear to the Men, and yet more contemptible to the younger Part of their own Sex; and have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief bat in paſſing their Afternoons in Viſits, where they are never acceptable; and their Evenings at Cards among each other; while the former Part of the Day is ſpent in Spleen and Envy, or in vain Endeavours to repair by Art and Dreſs the Ruins of Time. Whereas I have known Ladies at Sixty, to whom all the polite Part of the Court and Town paid their Addreſſes, without any farther View than that of enjoying the Pleaſure of their Converſation.</p>
            <p>I am ignorant of any one Quality that is amiable in a Man, which is not equally ſo in a Woman: I do not except even Modeſty and Gentleneſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nor do I know one Vice or Folly which is not equally deteſtable in both. There is indeed one Infirmity which ſeems to be generally allow'd you, I mean that of <hi>Cowardice:</hi> Yet there ſhould
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:005772_0072_1026E07DF0B02450"/>ſeem to be ſomething very capricious, that when Women profeſs their Admiration for a Colonel or a Captain on Account of his Valour, they ſhould fancy it a very graceful becoming Quality in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be afraid of their own Shadows; to ſcream in a Barge when the Weather is calmeſt, or in a Coach at the Ring; to run from a Cow at a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Yards Diſtance; to fall into Fits at the Sight of a Spider, and Earwig, or a Frog. At leaſt, if Cowardice be a Sign of Cruclty, (as it is generally granted) I can hardly think it an Accompliſhment ſo deſirable as to be thought worth improving by Affectation.</p>
            <p>AND as the ſame Virtues equally become both Sexes, ſo there is no quality whereby Women en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſtinguiſh themſelves from Men, for which they are not juſt ſo much the worſe, except that only of Reſervedneſs; which however, as you generally manage it, it nothing elſe but Affectation or Hypocriſy. For as you cannot too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance thoſe of your Sex, who preſume to take unbecoming Liberty before you; ſo you ought to be wholly unconſtrain'd in the Company of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Men, when you have had ſufficient Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their Diſcretion.</p>
            <p>THERE is never wanting in this Town, a Tribe of bold, ſwaggering, rattling Ladies, whoſe Talents paſs among Coxcombs for Wit and Humour; their Excellency lies in rude choquing Expreſſions, and what they call <hi>Running a Man down.</hi> If a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in their Company happens to have any Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in his Birth or Perſon, if any Misfortune hath befallen his Family or himſelf, for which he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd, they will be ſure to give him broad Hints
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:005772_0073_10270C4BC13D71A0"/>of it without any Provocation. I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the Acquaintance of a common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, rather than to that of ſuch Termagants as theſe. I have often thought that no Man is oblig'd to ſuppoſe ſuch Creatures to be Women; but to treat them like inſolent Raſcals diſguis'd in female Habits, who ought to be ſtript and kick'd down Stairs.</p>
            <p>I will add one Thing, altho' it be a little out of Place which is to deſire, that you will learn to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

For altho' this Letter is generally underſtood to be a Mark of Love, yet it is indeed nothing but Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation or ill Judgment. It is true, he wants ſo very few Accompliſhments, that you are in no great Danger of erring on this Side; but my cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is occaſion'd by a Lady of your Acquaintance, marry'd to a very valuable Perſon, whom yet the is ſo unfortunate as to be always commending for thoſe Perfections to which he can leaſt pretend.</p>
            <p>I can give you no Advice upon the Article of <hi>Expence,</hi> only I think you ought to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd how much your Huſband's Revenue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to, and be ſo good a Computer as to keep within it, in that Part of the Management which falls to your Share; and not to put your ſelf in the Number of thoſe politick Ladies who think they gain a great Point, when they have teaz'd their Huſbands to buy them a new Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, a lac'd Head, or a fine Petticoat, without once conſidering what long Scores remain unpaid to the Butche.</p>

I deſire you will keep this Letter in your Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and often examine impartially your whole Conduct by it: And ſo God bleſs you, and make you a fair Example to your Sex, and a perpetual Comfort to your Huſband and your Parents. I am, with great Truth and Affection,</p>
