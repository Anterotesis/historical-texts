            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>REJOICE, <hi>O ye nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his ſervants, and will render vengeance to his adverſaries; and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</hi>

            <p>THAT there is a GOD, "is the prime foundation of all religion." We ſhould therefore employ our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diligence to eſtabliſh our minds in the ſtedfaſt belief of it. For when once we have firmly ſettled in our minds the belief of GOD'S being, it will mightily influence all our powers of action; it will invite our hope, alarm our fear, and addreſs to every paſſion within us, that is capable of perſuaſion, and be in us a never-failing ſource of devotion and religion.</p>
            <p>A GOD without a providence, is a ſolitary kind of being, and affords but gloomy apprehenſions. For 'tis by his providence that all intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween GOD and his rational creatures is maintained,—therein he exerciſes and diſplays his perfections,—therein his power executes the contrivances of his wiſdom, and his wiſdom plans the methods of his goodneſs and grace, which open to the view and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the wiſe and good, through ſucceſſive ages and generations.</p>
            <p>BUT that branch of providence, which, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, demands our attention on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015776_0003_0F9A295D67E40D28"/>
and ſhould excite our gratitude, is GOD'S un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted government of the rational part of his creation,—mankind in particular. For as all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo the <hi>divine,</hi> ſuppoſes laws, and laws ſuppoſe rewards and puniſhments, of which intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences only are capable.</p>
            <p>SINCE, therefore, GOD intereſts himſelf in the affairs of mankind, and the univerſal adminiſtration of his providence extends to all his works, a large field opens for the employment of our contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive minds. And we are naturally led to conſider this divine government, as reſpecting communities; the affairs whereof are important, and upon which the order and felicity of the world greatly depend.</p>
            <p>GOD is the ſovereign of the world, and diſpoſes all things in the beſt manner. All bleſſings and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, of a public nature, and the revolutions of kingdoms and ſtates, are to be viewed as under the ſpecial direction of heaven. Hence the ſcripture ſaith, that GOD "increaſeth the nations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth them, he enlargeth the nations, and ſtraitneth them again—ſometimes he bleſſeth them, ſo that they are multiplied greatly; again, they are miniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and brought low, through oppreſſion, affliction, and ſorrow."</p>
            <p>THESE truths being neceſſarily interwoven with religion, and extenſively uſeful under the varying ſcenes of life, and miſteries in providence—the main deſign of the preſent diſcourſe, is to awaken our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the paſſages of divine providence—and lead us to a religious improvement of GOD'S hand, in the tragical events that took place on the <hi>nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth</hi> of April, 1775. I mean the MURDEROUS
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015776_0004_0F9A295E2A71A578"/>
WAR, <hi>rapine</hi> and <hi>devaſtation of that day,</hi> which we are now met to commemorate.</p>
            <p>UNDER this viſitation, or the greateſt trials imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, we have abundant conſolation, that GOD rules in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of this earth.</p>
            <p>THE words but now read, may be, perhaps, not unfitly applied to us, for comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under GOD'S chaſtiſements, and his uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards the enemies of his church and people:—"Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his ſervants, and will render vengeance to his adverſaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people." Theſe are the concluding words of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſong, which ſetteth forth GOD'S works of mercy and judgment towards the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his covenant people. And though, in their primary meaning, they reſpect that nation only, yet they may be accommodated and fairly applied to GOD'S faithful and obedient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at all times, and in all ages; inaſmuch as the latter part of the prophecy reaches unto the latter days, and is not yet wholly fulfilled.</p>
            <p>SOME interpret the former part of the verſe thus,—"Rejoice ye nations, who are his people," ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be a prophecy of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> becoming one body with the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>—becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſuppoſed in this ſong, great enmity between them, and that ſometimes they had ſorely plagued <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as at others, GOD rendered to them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they had done unto his people: but now breaks out in a rapture of joy, to think that they ſhould one day be reconciled, and made one people of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:015776_0005_0F9A29606803A318"/>
THE prophecy then before us, is not limited to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> but may be underſtood as extending to all GOD'S choſen, though oppreſſed and injured people, in all generations,—that he will recompenſe their wrongs—plead their cauſe—and do juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their enemies. And taking it in this latitude, we may collect ſeveral things from it, as worthy our notice, and pertinent to this occaſion. Accordingly I obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT GOD, in the righteous adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his providence, permits the ſons of violence to oppreſs his ſaints and people; and, in their malice and rage, to attempt their ruin, by waging war with them.</p>
            <p>GOD is a being of infinite power and inflexible juſtice, as well as conſumate wiſdom; and doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſovereign pleaſure, in the paternal and moral world. He over-rules all things for his own glory, and in ſubordination to that, has a particular regard to the happineſs of his covenant people:—His church and choſen are not without miſtakes and errors, in this imperfect ſtate—hence they are prone to degenerate and tranſgreſs—to be too regardleſs of GOD, and deficient in their obedience—nay, to be guilty of great wickedneſs. And it becomes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to puniſh ſuch revolters from the ways of GOD, and purity of manners. Hence, when the all-wiſe GOD deſigns the chaſtiſement and reformation of his backſliding people, he "viſits their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes,"—and uſes thoſe methods, that ſhall beſt promote his moral government; inflicting this or that judgment, as pleaſes him. The divine providence then is to be devoutly acknowledged in all events, in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic evils and calamities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:015776_0006_0F9A296128BB4EA0"/>
SOMETIMES there are viſible marks of GOD's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and diſpleaſure againſt his people. Their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are divided, and their ſtrength impaired—their enemies are permitted to diſtreſs and injure them—or they have been harraſſed by the will and conduct of ambitious, deſigning men, who have contributed to the ruin of their country, even at the ſame time they pretend a mighty zeal for its intereſt:—Or, they are ſcourged by haughty <hi>tyrants</hi> and cruel oppreſſors:—Yet the hand of GOD, and his over-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is to be acknowledged in theſe things, as much as when a people ſuffer by famine, peſtilence, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, ſtorms and tempeſts, &amp;c. which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly regarded as the more immediate tokens of GOD's anger, and works of his providence.</p>
            <p>IN all public evils, calamities and diſtreſſes of GOD's people, <hi>He</hi> in his providence, proceeds accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to equal rules, and for wiſe and ſalutary purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Hence the promiſes of temporal bleſſings made to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in caſe of their obedience to the divine commandments, and the threatnings of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evils and plagues denounced againſt them, in caſe of their diſobedience, recited in <hi>Levit.</hi> XXVI, and <hi>Deut.</hi> XXVIII chapters; related chiefly to them as a body politic, becauſe with regard to the public, they always took place. When religion and virtue flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed among them, and they walked in obedience to the divine laws, they proſpered, were ſucceſſful in their wars, had great plenty, and all things conducive to their welfare and happineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT when they revolted from GOD, and were generally corrupt and diſſolute, they were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> miſerable, and a prey to their jealous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious neighbours. And it may be noted, in general,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015776_0007_0F9A2962A9CEE568"/>
that when public calamities were inflicted upon them, whether by the more immediate hand of Heaven, as drought, peſtilence, famine, and the like; or, by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in providence, as the hands of their enemies and oppreſſors; it was always as a juſt puniſhment for their national iniquities; their idolatry, irreligion and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wickedneſs. And upon their repentance and reformation, theſe calamities were removed, and their proſperity reſtored.</p>
            <p>NOR was this courſe of providence peculiar to the <hi>Jews.</hi> The eſtabliſhed rule of the divine procedure towards nations is aſcertained in <hi>Jer.</hi> XVIII, 7, &amp;c. "At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.—And at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and concerning a kingdom, to build, and to plant it; if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them."</p>
            <p>WE are aſſured, in the oracles of truth, that 'Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation; but ſin,' i. e. aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vice and wickedneſs, "is a reproach to any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple." And with regard to mankind in all ages, may it not be ſaid, that when a people have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for juſtice, temperance, induſtry, and zeal for the public good, they have proſpered in all their affairs, and been high in reputation? And, perhaps, no inſtance can be produced of a nation's being given up to exterminating judgments and calamities, ſo long as virtue, probity and religion flouriſhed among them. But when falſhood and perfidy, injuſtice and general
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015776_0008_0F9A2963681A76D8"/>
corruption, with a contempt of religion, have general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed among them, they have fallen into many calamities, and been deprived of thoſe advantages they ſo much abuſed.</p>
            <p>THUS GOD, in a variety of ways, may correct and puniſh his degenerate people; and, among others, permit enemies to oppreſs them, <hi>ſhed blood</hi> in their land, and lay them waſte.</p>
            <p>IT by no means reflects upon the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of GOD, that thoſe whom he employs as inſtruments in the execution of his judgments upon a revolting, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people, are themſelves chargeable with injuſtice and cruelty; and have nothing in view but the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their own ambition, avarice and luſt of power. And commonly they who are the authors, or perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of ſuch violence and ſeverity upon a people, are afterwards, in GOD's time, juſtly puniſhed in their turn, for their vices, their pride, wantonneſs and barbarity.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, if we make a religious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch diſpenſations, we ſhall reſolve all into the good pleaſure of <hi>Him,</hi> who is "higher than the higheſt," and has the abſolute diſpoſal of all in his hands. And however undeſerving we may be of ſuch unrighteous treatment from men, <hi>our fellow-mortals;</hi> yet we are to adore the great—the wiſe—the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful GOD,—humble ourſelves under his mighty hand,—accept the puniſhment of our ſins,—learn righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,—patiently bear the indignation of the Lord, and quietly ſubmit to his providences; and, while his judgments are upon us, repent and reform, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in his almighty power, hope in his mercy, and plead his compaſſion and the riches of his grace, that

in his own way and time, which is the fitteſt, we may ſee his ſalvation. Paſs we, therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To obſerve, the diſpenſations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven towards <hi>oppreſſors and tyrants,</hi> the enemies of GOD's people. "For he will avenge the blood of his ſervants, and will render vengeance to his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,"—none ſhall hinder his proceedings, to be fully avenged of them.</p>
            <p>HE is the ſupreme Lord, governor and judge of the world, therefore will he chaſtiſe offenders; to him belongeth vengeance,—therefore the wicked ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>THE enemies of GOD's church and people, are GOD's adverſaries. "The Lord's portion is his people,—he keeps them as the apple of his eye"—verſes 9, 10, of the context. Whoever grieves or afflicts them, provokes GOD, for they are "his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar treaſure." And having a ſingular concern for them, he will be their ſhield and their defence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be perſecuted by their enemies. "For the Lord ſhall judge his people;" verſe 36. i. e. plead their cauſe, and deliver them from the oppreſſion of their enemies; as this phraſe is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed in the book of <hi>Pſalms.</hi> He will have mercy upon his ſervants, and turn his hand, which puniſhes them, upon their adverſaries.</p>
            <p>THUS utter deſtruction is denounced upon <hi>Edom,</hi> for their unnatural enmity againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and cruelty towards their brethren, in <hi>Obad.</hi> ver. 10, "For thy <hi>violence</hi> againſt thy brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſhame ſhall cover thee, and thou ſhalt be cut off forever."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:015776_0010_0F9A29650E5D8550"/>
To confirm our faith and hope in GOD, in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous times, in days of darkneſs and miſery, it may be proper to look back, and devoutly contemplate that moſt ſignal act of divine providence, that when the primitive religion which had been derived from the beginning, was in danger of being loſt among men, and the world became generally involved in groſs ſuperſtition and idolatry, it pleaſed GOD to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out a nation from the reſt of mankind, and to erect them into a ſacred polity, ſet apart by their fundamental conſtitution for the profeſſion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the faith and obedience of the one true GOD, in oppoſition to the worſhipping idols or falſe dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to the worſhipping the true GOD by images. The more effectually to awaken the attention of mankind, and to give the more illuſtrious confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that church conſtitution, it was wiſely order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in the founding and eſtabliſhing of it, there were repeated and amazing exertions of the power of GOD.</p>
            <p>AND the whole of that diſpenſation was admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſo contrived, as to prepare the way for a more ſpiritual and perfect ſtate of the church, which was to ſucceed it, and was to be more univerſally diffuſed; in the founding of which, providence interpoſed in a yet more remarkable manner, by a ſeries of moſt aſtoniſhing events.</p>
            <p>THROUGH the powerful influence of a wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, events that were deſigned for the deſtruction of the church, have been made ſubſervient to its greater ſtability. Thus <hi>Haman'</hi>s malicious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful plot, which threatned utter ruin to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation and religion, was moſt marvellouſly over-ruled to contribute to the confirmation thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:015776_0011_0F9A2965A84203D8"/>
LIKEWISE the <hi>chriſtian</hi> church, though the world ever was an enemy to it, has been firmly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed: It has been maintained againſt cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and the greateſt violence.—And though continually burning, it has not been conſumed,—though toſſed with tempeſts, and worried by its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors and adverſaries, frequently paſſing through the furnace of affliction; yet it retains a form more bright and beautiful, as of the ſpouſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the joyful mother of children, which no man can number.</p>
            <p>INDEED churches are not perfect or compleat; they are apt to decline and tranſgreſs;—nothing therefore can be more equal and fit, than that GOD ſhould, in his holy providence, manifeſt his righteous diſpleaſure againſt backſliding churches that have fallen from <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the remnant may become more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, holy and heavenly. The faith and patience of the ſaints be more exerciſed, their zeal and piety more eminent, and practical godlineſs more gloriouſly appear. And then, in due ſeaſon, GOD raiſeth his church and people from their afflicted and oppreſſed ſtate, and <hi>rendereth vengeance</hi> to their adverſaries and perſecutors. Thus <hi>Babylon</hi> of old was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her cruelty and oppreſſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church. And thus ſhall it likewiſe be in the caſe of myſtical <hi>Babylon;</hi> which, after having been long ſuffered to prevail, and to "make war with the ſaints of the moſt High," ſhall have a mighty downfall, wherein the vengeance and juſtice of almighty GOD,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015776_0012_0F9A2966694F7080"/>
ſhall be illuſtriouſly diſplayed; of which we have a ſtriking deſcription in XVIII. chap. of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>AND that we may be eſtabliſhed in the faith of the prophecy before us, that GOD "will avenge the blood of his ſervants," and execute "vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their adverſaries," we may advert to the animating promiſe of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> in the parable of the <hi>unjuſt judge,</hi> who, neither fearing GOD nor regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, was nevertheleſs prevailed on by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual cries of the widow, to do her juſtice againſt her adverſary; our Lord adds, <hi>And ſhall not</hi> GOD <hi>avenge his own elect?</hi>—Will he not much more be moved to vindicate his choſen and dearly beloved people, that cry to him day and night, under the cruel oppreſſion of their inſulting enemies, even though he may ſeem to <hi>bear long with them,</hi> to give them ſpace for repentance? I tell you, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly vindicate them, and when once he undertakes it, he will do it ſpeedily too." Herein, "our condeſcending Lord only intended to intimate, that if the repeated, importunate cries of the afflicted, may at length prevail even upon an inhuman heart, they will be much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by a righteous and merciful GOD, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to beſtow his favours, when he ſees we are prepared to receive them. We may rely upon it, that GOD will vindicate his ſaints. Let this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, though the rod of the wicked may for a while reſt on them—and let it intimidate the proud oppreſſors of the earth, who, in the midſt of all their pomp and power, are ſo wretched, as to have the prayers of GOD's people againſt them."</p>
            <p>WE have encouragement then, to hope in GOD,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015776_0013_0F9A296728596050"/>
that he will build up Zion—that he will appear ſtill for us, under all our diſtreſſes and oppreſſion—that he will <hi>avenge the innocent blood</hi> of our brethren, inhumanly ſhed in the beginning of the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt war—that he will <hi>render vengeance to his</hi> and our <hi>adverſaries</hi>—and one day reſtore tranquility to our country—that he will make our land "a quiet habitation," when we may view it in perfect peace, and free from all fears of hoſtile invaſions. <hi>For,</hi> to uſe the words of the prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> "The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will ſave us." Hence we are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led, in the laſt place, to obſerve from the conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words of my text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE kindneſs and compaſſion of GOD, to his penitent, praying and obedient people: "And will be merciful unto his land, and to his people."</p>
            <p>THOUGH GOD chaſtiſe his people with the rod of his hand, or permit enemies to oppoſe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, yet he will remember his holy covenant, and ſhew compaſſion to them, upon their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and repentance. This is illuſtrated in <hi>Neh.</hi> ix chap. wherein the <hi>Levites</hi> make a religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of GOD's goodneſs, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs—greatly provoking GOD by their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and rebellion againſt him, and contempt of his law; <hi>Therefore,</hi> as in verſe 27, "Thou deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt them into the hands of their enemies, who vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardeſt them from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gaveſt them <hi>ſaviours,</hi> who ſaved them out of the hand of their enemies."</p>
            <p>GOD will not "caſt off his people, neither will he
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015776_0014_0F9A2967E7FAB208"/>
forſake his inheritance: The Lord will not caſt off forever—but though he cauſe grief, yet will he have compaſſion, according to the multitude of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies." He will ariſe, and have mercy upon <hi>Sion,</hi> when the ſet time to favor her, is come.</p>
            <p>To repreſent the perpetual love of GOD to his church and people, the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> utters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this rapturous ſtrain, "Sing, O heaven, and be joyful, O earth, and break forth into ſinging. O mountains, for GOD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted"—chap. XLIX. 13. And ſpeaking of their deliverance at laſt, ſaith, ver. 26. "And I will feed them that oppreſs thee, with their own fleſh, and they ſhall be drunken with their own blood, as with ſweet wine, and all fleſh ſhall know that I the Lord, am thy <hi>Saviour,</hi> and thy redeemer, the mighty one of <hi>Jacob.</hi>"</p>
            <p>THE intention of GOD's ſevere diſpenſations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the deſtruction of his people, but their amendment, it becomes them to acknowledge his hand, confeſs and forſake their ſins, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſeek to him for needed ſalvation.—Hence, we are frequently exhorted in ſcripture to repentance, as the ſureſt way to obtain mercy from GOD; <hi>Job</hi> v. 17. "Behold, happy is the man whom GOD cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth; therefore deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Almighty—For he maketh ſore, and bindeth up, he woundeth, and his hands make whole. He ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea, in ſeven, there ſhall no evil touch thee. In famine he ſhall redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the ſword."</p>
            <p>THE corrections of his hand are the ſcourges of a faithful GOD, who retaineth not his anger forever,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015776_0015_0F9A2968A80266B0"/>
becauſe he delighteth in mercy. To this purpoſe we have a more general exhortation to repentance, in <hi>Hos.</hi> VI. I. "Come, and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up." The ſame GOD that puniſheth us, can only remove his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhew us mercy. GOD will "ſpeak peace to his people, and to his ſaints, if they return not again to folly—Surely his ſalvation is nigh them that fear him."</p>
            <p>AND the church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> notwithſtanding all oppreſſion and perſecution, ſhall one day break forth as the morning, clear as the ſun, fair as the moon, and triumph over all its potent, cruel adverſaries; even when the glorious things ſpoken of her, in the latter days, ſhall be accompliſhed;—correſponding to the prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. lx. wherein deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jews</hi> reſtoration from captivity, takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therefrom to repreſent the glories of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> kingdom, which began upon the firſt publication of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> but will not be compleated 'till the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are come into the church; and faith, "Violence ſhall no more be heard in thy land, waſting nor deſtruction within thy borders: Thy ſun ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall thy moon withdraw itſelf; for the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting light, and the days of thy mourning ſhall be ended: Thy people alſo ſhall all be righteous; they ſhall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. A little one ſhall become a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong nation:—I the Lord will haſten it in his time."</p>
            <p>FROM the proceeding diſcourſe, in connexion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015776_0016_0F9A2969C4993B18"/>
with our context, ariſe the following truths, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and improvement of the diſpenſations of heaven; and therefore proper for our meditation on the preſent occaſion. As,</p>
            <p>THAT we ſhould extol the Lord of heaven and earth, who is poſſeſſed of glorious perfections, which render him the only fit object of our religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>THAT we ſhould acknowledge the infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our GOD, and his ſovereign dominion over all; and give honour and ſervice to none other.</p>
            <p>THAT his works of providence, no leſs than of creation, are moſt perfect; ſince he doth nothing without the greateſt reaſon, and according to the rules of exact juſtice.</p>
            <p>THAT we are ignorant of the methods and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of GOD's judgments, that take place in the world.</p>
            <p>THAT all the evil, and all the good, that befalls any man, or the whole church, proceeds from the juſt and equal adminiſtrations of divine providence.</p>
            <p>THAT in GOD we may find a ſure refuge, at all times, for he is in one mind, and changeth not.</p>
            <p>THAT He will <hi>render vengeance to his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and do juſtice to the enemies of his church.</p>
            <p>THAT he will be merciful to his people, his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, penitent, praying people, and will, in his own way and time, <hi>avenge the blood of his ſervants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT therefore we have abundant cauſe to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015776_0017_0F9A296B2A37FFA8"/>
with his people;</hi> and to yield chearful and conſtant obedience to him.</p>
            <p>THESE hints might be profitably enlarged upon; but I muſt leave the more particular improvement of them, to your own private meditations; and fall in cloſer with the deſign of this <hi>anniverſary,</hi> which is to keep in mind a ſolemn remembrance of the origin of the preſent MURDEROUS WAR, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>innocent blood</hi> wantonly ſhed around this ſacred temple; and the ſubſequent ſlaughter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation by <hi>Britiſh troops,</hi> on that memorable day, APRIL NINETEENTH, one thouſand, ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ſeventy-five: A day religiouſly to be regarded by all profeſſed <hi>chriſtians.</hi>

            <p>IN purſuance of their oppreſſive meaſures (if not intentionally to begin the barbarous and bloody ſcene) the enemy came upon us like a flood, ſtealing a march from <hi>Boſton,</hi> through by-ways, under the darkneſs and ſilence of the night; and like <hi>cowards</hi> and <hi>rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> attacked us altogether defenceleſs; and cruelly murdered the <hi>innocent,</hi> the aged and helpleſs.

            <p>WITH aſtoniſhment and gratitude we recollect the kindneſs of our almighthy Preſerver, that no more were ſlain by the hand of violence; and that the

               <hi>our Brethren,</hi> now under arms. <hi>My Friends,</hi> Having early diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed yourſelves in a readineſs to promote the common good, and ſafety of your country; by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, with others, its invaders, and the murderers of your brethren in this <hi>town</hi> and <hi>neighbourhood,</hi> on
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015776_0021_0F9A296DE81F87B8"/>
that day we are now commemorating:—You eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arrows of death, when perhaps equally expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as thoſe that were cut off by the hand of violence: To the GOD of your life, and who was then, in a peculiar ſenſe, your preſerver, defence and ſhield, you owe everlaſting love and obedience.</p>
            <p>YOU were ſpared, it may be, further to ſignalize yourſelves, and to do yet greater ſervice for GOD and your bleeding country, which calls aloud to you, and all its hearty friends, to rouſe and exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the deſtruction of the common enemy and oppreſſor; and to wipe away the blood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this land has been ſtained. <hi>To arms!</hi> To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the battle of the warrior! is the language of divine providence; and you have every motive imaginable to awaken, and excite you to be up and doing the work of the Lord faithfully.—The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory of GOD, and the ſalvation of your country under GOD, call aloud upon all.—Duty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, liberty, religion and life, every thing worth enjoyment, demand ſpeedy and the utmoſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>CULTIVATE, my friends, a martial ſpirit, ſtrive to excel in the art of war, that you may be qualified to act the part of ſoldiers well; and, under provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, be helpful in vanquiſhing and ſubduing the enemies of GOD and this people; and be numbered among thoſe who ſhall be worthy to wear the laurels of victory and triumph.</p>
            <p>ABOVE all, let me recommend and urge it upon you to ſtrive for a more honorable and ſhining cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; I mean, that of <hi>true chriſtians,</hi> good ſoldiers of JESUS CHRIST; and to fight manfully under his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015776_0022_0F9A296EA8059EE8"/>
banner, as the high prieſt of your profeſſion, and great captain of your ſalvation. Then whatever ſervice he ſhall call you to, or ſufferings allot you;—wherever he ſhall lead, you will chearfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,—be ready to face the enemy and every danger, and meet death with calmneſs and intrepidity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever arreſted, and be conquerors through Him.</p>
            <p>WE wiſh you, and all our friends and brethren, called to bear arms, and jeopard their lives in defence of their country, and ſupport of the common rights of mankind, the preſence of GOD, and a bleſſing this day, from the houſe of the Lord, all grace and good in time, and glory everlaſting.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, Let us all devoutly worſhip and honor, fear and ſerve the Lord of hoſts, and GOD of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; hearken to his word, and ſeriouſly attend to every providence.—Let us continue our fervent cries to GOD, and offer up importunate, unceaſing ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the <hi>moſt High,</hi> to "avenge the blood of his ſervants,"—and be "merciful to" this "his land, and to his people." We are encouraged to this from the providence and promiſes of a powerful and faithful GOD.—The repeated ſucceſſes during this calamitous war, from its beginning to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, have been great and wonderful; and give us confidence in GOD, and hope of a happy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if we amend our ways and doings. Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, indeed, have been permitted to make great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in divers parts of our land (in their rage and cruelty unequall'd) who have attempted, with <hi>fire and ſword,</hi> to ſpread deſolation far and wide.<note n="*" place="bottom">Among many inſtances, may be mentioned the burning of <hi>Charleſtown, Falmouth, Norfolk, Kingſton:</hi>—The rapine and devaſtation in <hi>New York</hi> and the <hi>Jerſies;</hi> and their unparallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed treatment of the inhabitants there, both for inhumanity and debauchery.—To which may be added, their murdering our friends, whom the fortune of war put into their hands; I mean their ſtarving them to death; <hi>inhumanity more than ſavage!</hi> And to compleat their accurſed plan, they have hired and let looſe upon us the <hi>Indians,</hi> to ſcalp and butcher of every age and ſex, to plunder and lay waſte wherever they came: All this has been acted by <hi>Britons,</hi> who glory in their <hi>valor and humanity.</hi>

For as they began the war with a mean, daſtardly ſpirit, ſo they have proſecuted it, in all their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, with a rigour and barbarity, exceeding the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of the wilderneſs; yet, through the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heaven, they have been fruſtrated in their grand deſign, defeated and diſgraced.</p>
            <p>IN various inſtances, particularly in the laſt <hi>cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,</hi> a merciful GOD hath crowned <hi>our arms,</hi> with ſingular ſucceſs and victory;<note n="*" place="bottom">Our army in the <hi>Northern Department,</hi> was remarkably ſucceſſful in divers actions; particulary on the 7th October, in which they attacked the lines of the enemy, and drove them from their works, killing and captivating ſeveral of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers, and many privates; gaining great advantages. On the 17th October, 1777, Lieut. Gen. <hi>Burgoyne</hi> ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, and his whole army into the hands of the brave Major-General <hi>Gates,</hi> at the head of well-diſciplined continen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tal troops, and intrepid <hi>militia</hi> of <hi>New England.</hi>
               </note> enabling us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and break up a whole army, under one of the greateſt <hi>Generals,</hi> parhaps, that <hi>Britain</hi> can boaſt of. This is the Lord's doing, and 'tis marvelous in in our eyes.</p>
            <p>THE Lord's hand is not ſhortened, that it cannot ſave. We may then confidently put our truſt in the living GOD, and refer our cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, the cauſe of our oppreſſed and bleeding country—inſaſmuch as "he will be merciful to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015776_0024_0F9A297027E057F0"/>
his land." We are aſſured, "The Lord loveth the gates of <hi>Sion:</hi>" That he "will bleſs his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;" And that when "the Lord ſhall build up <hi>Zion,</hi> he ſhall appear in his glory. He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the prayer of the deſtitute—the children of his ſervants ſhall continue, and their ſeed ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before" him; and enjoy the tokens of the divine preſence among them.</p>
            <p>THESE aſſurances of our covenant-GOD and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may well animate our ſpirits, invigorate our faith, confirm our hope, and eſtabliſh our confidence in him, under the ſevereſt trials and miſeries that befall us, in this day of calamity and war.</p>
            <p>WHETHER the prophecy and promiſe in our <hi>text,</hi> ſhall be accompliſhed, while we of the preſent generation, are upon the ſtage of action; I known only to him, who is the Lord of life and death. However, we may piouſly and chearfully leave the event to GOD. Whoſe righteouſsneſs remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and his faithfulneſs to all generations.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude, without juſt hinting, that though we muſt neceſſarily concern ourſelves, in ſome degree, with the things of this preſent evil world, ſo long as GOD ſhall protract our lives; yet our higheſt intereſt lies in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, far beyond this ſtate of noiſe and war, danger and miſery. And whoever faithfully ſerves GOD and their generation here, in a wiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their talents, ſhall in the end, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive a crown of life, unfading and eternal.</p>
            <p>HERE is nothing, <hi>my hearers,</hi> nothing worthy
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015776_0025_0F9A29710EC08CE0"/>
your higheſt affection, and unceaſing purſuit.—"All that cometh is vanity."—All things are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to change, and in perpetual uncertainty. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing tends to diſſolution, and GOD alone is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are all children of mortality and muſt die out of this world.—Bleſſed be GOD, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and immortality beyond the grave is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained by divine revelation. Being called to glory by virtue, let us diligently and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perform all the duties of our holy religion; labor to ſecure our peace with GOD, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our only Savior—that we may be perfect and compleat in him, as our head.</p>
            <p>THAT ſo, when contending powers and jarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nations on earth ſhall be removed—all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and ſtates diſſolved—and all empire and dominion blotted out, excepting <hi>His</hi> who is the firſt cauſe, and laſt end of all things:—We may have a place in the higheſt heavens;—be admitted to dwell in GOD's immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence—and join the heavenly hoſt in the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſcriptions of bleſſing, and honor, and praiſe and glory to GOD and the lamb, for ever and ever.</p>
