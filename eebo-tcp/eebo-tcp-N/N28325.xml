            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AS it is poſſible that my Reader may not be acquainted with the Runic mythology, I have added Notes, at the end of each Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of this Work (to which the Numbers are a direction), explaining as much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make it perfectly intelligible. Any further elucidation may be obtained by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to MR.

                  <head>ILDEGERTE, QUEEN OF NORWAY.</head>
                  <p>WHO art thou, Oh heroine! endowed with the powerful ſpirit of Odin<note n="1">ODIN, alſo called Woden, Father of the Gods. He, his wife Freya, and ſon Thor, compoſe the ſupreme council of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. He is called the Univerſal Father, The Terrible and Severe God, The King of Slaughter, The God that carrieth Deſolation and Fire, the Active and Roaring Deity, The Giver of Victory, &amp;c. The fourth day of the week is conſecrated to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called Woden's day.</note>, and graced with the captivating ſweetneſs of Freya?<note n="2">Frea, or Freya, wife of Odin, and mother of the inferior Deities. Theſe names are, by ſome, aſcribed to two Goddeſſes, the former being Queen of the Gods, and the latter, ſiſter of Erey. To her the ſixth day of the week is conſecrated.</note>.—Who art thou, whoſe image darts its rays ſo bright through the cloud which veils the wonders of antiquity?—Riſe, riſe, ſacred ſhade of Ildegerte, riſe from the holy habitations of Vingolf<note n="3">Vingolf, the manſion of Love and Friendſhip.</note>—thou, before whoſe name I bend my knee, as heroine, as wife, as mother!</p>
                  <p>Swend was the Prince's name whom Thora bore, to reign hereafter over Norway.—As yet, the cradle was his throne, the roſe-bud his ſceptre. As yet he felt no pain but hunger, and no reſt but ſleep. With female penetration and manly ſpirit, Thora ruled the raw Norwegians;—with female gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and manly firmneſs, ſhe conducted her belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſon, from the narrow limits of infancy to the wide-extending path of youth. He grew. Upon
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037753_0004_100F440ED1FA2858"/>
his countenance bloomed the hope of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching morn, and grey-headed warriors, when they ſaw him, ſtroked their beards, and ſmiled.</p>
                  <p>No coſtly ornaments and ſilken garments, no ſtudied ſmiles and borrowed roſes, at that time, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied the morning hours of Northern women. The girl who wiſhed to pleaſe a Norwegian, muſt renounce the common employments of a female, and accuſtom herſelf to the warlike toils of man; muſt curb the ſteed of Iceland with uncovered hand, muſt kill the flying game with certain arrow, and oppoſe her glittering ſhield to the threatening ſword of her companion.</p>
                  <p>Thora, herſelf a perfect miſtreſs of theſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, aſſembled a troop of Amazons, who, led by her, chaſed the wolf and bear through almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable foreſts. Oft did the Queen ſit on ſome lofty bank, and feaſt upon theſe ſports; yet ever did her eye beam moſt friendly on her deareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion Ildegerte; for none like her could vault upon the back of the impetuous ſteed; none ſent the arrow ſo certain to its mark; none broke a lance with ſo much grace. And when ſhe raiſed her viſor to regain her breath; when her full blue eye glanced round more dangerous than her ſword; when ſhe moved, and the plume upon her helmet
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037753_0005_100F441103762F48"/>
ſlowly nodded; when ſhe ſpoke, and her voice ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the ſweetneſs of the flute—Oh! then aroſe in the heart of the young Prince an indeſcribable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which his wary mother ſaw, now in his glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye, now in his glowing cheek. She ſaw it with a ſmile of content; for though no royal blood flowed in the veins of Ildegerte, yet was ſhe the laſt ſurviving branch of a noble family, and would, if the daughter of a boor, have been worthy of the firſt throne on earth. Who was able to enchant each heart like Ildegerte? Who ſeemed ſo little to intend it? Her companions ſaw her, and were envious; they ſpoke to her, and envy vaniſhed.</p>
                  <p>About that time Canfried, the young King of Sweden, was travelling through the Northern Courts. Ambition brooded in the dark receſſes of his ſoul. The thirſt for power flaſhed from his ſcowling eye. Not content to ſway the groaning inhabitants of Sweden with an iron ſceptre, he reſolved, by the ſucceſs of a robber's arms, to encircle his brow with a triple crown. For this purpoſe was it that he traverſed Denmark and Norway—for this purpoſe was it that he cautiouſly approached their thrones, and ſpied into the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſtrength and weakneſs. He was
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037753_0006_100F441336328EB8"/>
handſome as Utgarda-Loke<note n="4">Utgarda Loke, an evil ſpirit, nearly reſembling our devil. He is deſcribed in the Edda (or Bible of the Northern nations) as exceeding handſome, but crafty and perſidious. He is called, The Artificer of Fraud, The Calumniator of the Gods, &amp;c. He, nevertheleſs, dwelt in Heaven, till, as a puniſhment for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated crimes and attacks upon the Gods, they chained him to three ſharp ſtones, which are for ever cutting his fleſh; while a ſerpent, hanging over him, diſtils its venom, drop by drop, upon his face. In this ſituation he is to remain till the deſtruction of the world.</note>, and villanous as he; cruel as the wolf Fenris<note n="5">
                        <p>The wolf Fenris, a ſon of Utgarda Loke. He was bred among the Gods; but they, being warned by oracles that he might one day become fatal to them, reſolved to confine him. No chains, however, could be forged which were ſtrong enough to hold him. At length a dwarf, in the land of the Black Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii, ſupplied Odin with a bandage of uncommon ſtrength. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranſon's deſcription of its texture is ſo ludicrous, that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to tranſcribe it:</p>
                        <p>"Hic nervus ſex conſtabat rebus; ſtrepitu nempe pedum felis, ex barbâ mulieris, radicibus montium, nervis urſinis, halitu piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, &amp; ſputo avium."</p>
                        <p>"This ſtring conſiſted of ſix things, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the noiſe made by a cat's feet, the beard of a woman, the roots of mountains, the nerves of bears, the breath of fiſhes, and the ſpittle of birds."</p>
                        <p>Having bound the wolf with this cord, they drew it through a huge rock, to which he is doomed to be confined till the laſt day, when he is to break looſe, and devour the ſun.</p>
                     </note>, and poiſonous as the Midgard<note n="6">The ſerpent of Midgard, one of Utgarda Loke's children, and an enemy of the Gods. Odin threw him to the bottom of the ocean, where he grew ſo large, that he wound himſelf around the whole globe of earth.</note> ſerpent.</p>
                  <p>In honour of her gueſt, Thora appointed a ſplended tournament. Towards the decline of day, when the Knights, weary of warlike diverſions, had diſencumbered themſelves of their helmets, the young heroines of Norway (ſuch was Thora's will) entered the liſts with courteous air, and demanded that Canfried ſhould break a lance with them. With a ſmile the young King ſeized his ſpear (for he was well verſed in chivalry); with a ſmile he threw himſelf upon his prancing charger, and rode into the open liſts. But againſt his nervous arm the force of the Amazons was vain; their lances ſplit againſt his ſhield, like the light gondola on the craggy rock. At length appeared Ildegerte. The purple beams of the ſetting ſun ſhone on her poliſhed helm; the ſteed ſoon felt her ſpur; ſwift as an arrow ſhe ruſhed againſt the King. Her lance ſhivered; but Canfried's feet flew from the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, and ſcarce could he preſerve his ſeat.</p>
                  <p>"Thou art ſtrong," cried the aſtoniſhed Swede, "let me behold the countenance of my antagoniſt."</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte ſprung nimbly from her horſe, caſt away her helmet, and her auburn locks fell in art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037753_0007_100F4415792E4A58"/>
ringlets down her ſnow-white neck. The look which ſhe caſt on Canfried ſubdued him on the ſpot: it was a look full of dignity, ſweetened by a half-ſmile; but even half a ſmile from Ildegerte might have animated a ſtone. The proud tyrant of Sweden ſtammered forth his admiration, and, like a loneſome flower upon a barren heath, love took root in his heart.</p>
                  <p>Already was the lamp of day extinguiſhed in the ocean; already the bright moon had riſen in the unclouded ſky, when the jocund troop, after having quaffed the overflowing horn, wandered into the cool refreſhing wood. Here ſome Knight was ſtretched upon the graſs, and ſuing to the dear object of his love for the reward of conſtancy. There the Scalds<note n="7">Scald, the name given to the ancient bards, who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to compoſe odes and hymns, which were chaunted at every ſolemnity. Theſe ſongs were, in general, deſcriptions of eminent exploits, and were animated by an enthuſiaſtic ſpirit.</note> were heard to chaunt the deeds of ancient times, and bliſsful ſpirits of Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall<note n="8">Valhall, the palace of Odin, to which warriors are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed after death. Here they paſs their mornings in tournaments and battles; the reſt of the day is employed in feaſting on the wild boar Serimner (which, though dreſſed every morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes entire again every night), and in quaffing Hydromel (or mead), which is adminiſtered to them in the ſculls of thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies whom they had ſlain while on earth.</note>; while the nightingale ſweetly intermixed her warblings with the lofty ſong. Here two friends ſauntered, arm in arm, engaged in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſcourſe; there a dozen nymphs were ſporting near a murmuring rill.</p>
                  <p>Deep in the thickets was a fall of water, which formed a baſon at the mountain's foot. Near to the graſſy edge there laid a moſſy ſtone, warmed by the heat of day. Here, in the cool of eve,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037753_0008_100F441709937A20"/>
was Ildegerte wont to bathe. Naked ſhe ſat upon the ſtone, while the ſmall waves curled to the bank, and kiſſed her feet. To-day too ſhe ſtole away (perceived, as ſhe thought, by none but the chaſte moon), far from the gay buſtle of the Court, to this her favourite ſpot. As the wood reſounded ſtill with noiſe and jubilee, ſhe ventured not, as uſual, to caſt away her burdenſome attire; but drawing her garment to her knees, and throwing her ſandals on the graſs, ſhe ſtepped into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where it was ſo ſhallow that it ſcarce ſprinkled her ancles.—Chaſte girl! the inviſible hand of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fione<note n="9">Gefione, the Goddeſs of Chaſtity.</note> was ſtretched above thee; for, inſpired with brutal paſſion, Canfried watched thy ſteps, ruſhed through the thicket, and, with a peal of laughter, took the ſandals from the bank.</p>
                  <p>"Prince," ſaid Ildegerte, turning round, and letting her garment fall, "Prince, in this country we think ſuch conduct improper."</p>
                  <p>"How!" replied Canfried, "improper to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe a lovely girl when ſhe is bathing! Then, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, the Norwegians deſerve to have no lovely girls among them."</p>
                  <p>"And if the females of your land," returned Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte, "allow themſelves to be ſurpriſed ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, they indeed deſerve ſuch conduct as your's.—Return my ſandals, and begone."</p>

                  <p>"Then, Prince," cried Ildegerte, enraged, "you have loſt all ſenſe of decency; and ſenſe, without decency, is a tree without leaves."</p>
                  <p>"Admirable!" exclaimed the King, "you can play on words as well as hearts. But, with due deference to your decency and ſenſe, allow me to bind theſe ſandals to your feet again."</p>
                  <p>"I command you to begone," cried the fair heroine.</p>
                  <p>"Do you think yourſelf in danger?" returned Canfried.</p>
                  <p>"Oh no!" anſwered Ildegerte diſdainfully.</p>
                  <p>"You are ſevere," ſaid he. "You do not even think me dangerous? Come, away with this deriſion and this ſcorn! Ildegerte I love you."</p>
                  <p>"Likely enough truly, after an acquaintance of two hours," rejoined ſhe.</p>
                  <p>"So much the more flattering to you," ſaid the King.</p>
                  <p>"I muſt own I did not know it," replied ſhe; "I can at leaſt find nothing but my face to thank for it."</p>
                  <p>"No, Ildegerte; thou haſt wounded me deeply. Fair thou art as Noſſa<note n="10">Noffa, the daughter of Frea, a Goddeſs of ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite beauty that whoever is lovely and handſome, or whatever is precious, is called by her name.</note>—wiſe as Vora<note n="11">Vora, the Goddeſs of Prudence and Wiſdom, who is ſo penetrating, that nothing can remain hidden from her.</note>.—
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037753_0010_100F2626015673F8"/>
I have a wife whom I dare not ſpurn from me, for her father is a powerful Prince; but come to my arms! Thou ſhalt be treated as a Queen. Come, ſhare my heart and bed."</p>
                  <p>"To ſuch a propoſition," anſwered ſhe, "Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte has but one reply."</p>
                  <p>She ſtruck him on the face, and fled.—Furious and vengeful he ruſhed after her; but with airy ſteps, that ſcarcely ſkimmed the tender graſs, Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte glided through the wood, led by the echoing horn, which ever attended on the Queen. There ſhe humbled herſelf at the feet of Thora, and was ſilent. The purſy Swede, who likewiſe ſoon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, felt no deſire to mention, in the preſence of witneſſes, the indignity he had ſuſtained. But, ere long, the Queen diſcovered Ildegerte's naked foot, and aſked her favourite why ſhe was without ſandals.</p>
                  <p>"I went," anſwered Ildegerte, with unaltered look, "to waſh my feet; I threw my ſandals on the graſs, and conclude that ſome beaſt of the foreſt muſt have ſtolen them."</p>
                  <p>"That beaſt was I," roared out Canfried, with grim ferocity; "that the ſandals belonged to you, I knew not; for had I known it they had lain there ſtill."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:037753_0011_100F441C9533F2B0"/>
With theſe words he caſt them at Ildegerte's feet.</p>
                  <p>"Prince," ſaid Thora, with an air of ſolemn majeſty, "when next you come into my kingdom, remember that it is my kingdom."</p>
                  <p>Canfried returned no anſwer. Swend looked aſkance at him. The courtiers murmured. Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte ſmiled. This moment was the dreadful ſource of many a crime, of many a fatal hour. The enraged Swede, whoſe heart was the lurking place of every villany, returned that very night to his native country, and carried the fable poiſon of revenge deeply rankling in his breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Slowly and mournfully approached the hour in which Thora, the mother of her people, paid the debt of nature, and was tranſported to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joys of Vingolf. She expired in the arms of Ildegerte and her ſon;—ſhe expired as ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her bleſſing upon both.—Amidſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned lamentations of many thouſands of her ſubjects was the grave prepared, which was to cover her remains. Silent, and with overflowing eyes, the pooreſt perſon brought ſome gift to be buried, according to the cuſtom of the country, with the dead. No Knight was aſhamed of the tear which ſtarted in his eye. Swend ſobbed, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037753_0012_100F441ED68E6618"/>
hid his face. Ildegerte threw herſelf upon the grave, and waſhed her diſhevelled locks with tears.—Still was ſhe lying there, in torpid grief, when Midnight had ſpread her mantle over wood and ſea.</p>
                  <p>The murmuring waves, the ruſtling pines, and Ildegerte's groans, were the only interruptions of the deep tranquillity. At length the morning broke upon her ſorrows, but it preſaged a dreary rainy day. The feathered ſongſters crept into their neſts; the ravenous vulture only hovered in the air. Ildegerte ſprung up—caſt another inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible look of ſorrow on the grave, wet with the dew of heaven and her tears—threw a lock of hair upon it, and fled—fled with her companions to the innermoſt receſs of a wood, where, in the ſhade of rugged oaks, an ancient caſtle offered an aſylum to the fugitives, who long taught its walls to echo ſighs for the loſs of Norway's benefactreſs.</p>
                  <p>Swend, now nineteen years of age, mounted his mother's throne, and followed her inſtructions by promoting the happineſs of his people, by liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and relieving the unfortunate, by chuſing proper objects for his friendſhip, and by fulfilling all the duties of a Knight.</p>
                  <p>But love accompanied him to the throne. In
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037753_0013_100F442060EBE6F8"/>
the midſt of ſtate concerns, in the aſſemblage of his Knights, in the temple of juſtice, at the altar of Odin, his eye wandered round in ſearch of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte. His heart miſſed her at the jocund feaſt, at the chorus of the virgins, and combat of the lance.</p>
                  <p>"What ſtrange ſenſation" ſaid he to himſelf (when he had one day ſtolen from the table, where the ſparkling brimmer invited him in vain, where the Scalds in vain ſtruck the ſilver chords, and ſung the noble deeds of his forefathers), "what ſtrange ſenſation makes my throne to me a dreary ſepulchre—my heart inſenſible to the joys of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and friendſhip? Away with this ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſlavery! The holy raptures of Valhall could not force a ſmile from me, as long as Fate forbids me to enjoy it doubly in the arms of love. What binds my tongue, that it makes not the confeſſion which floats upon my lips? What chains my hand, that it lays not crown and ſceptre at her feet, for whom the crown and ſceptre ſeem to have been formed?—Away to Ildegerte!—What is birth? Can royal blood make a fool wiſe, or a villain vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous?—Oh! in her alone can Thora live again! With her alone can I taſte the pleaſures of a throne!"</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037753_0014_100F4422970FF9F8"/>
He ſpoke, and went to ſacrifice in Louna's<note n="12">Loſna, or Louna, the Goddeſs who aſſiſts lovers, and makes up differences between them and married perſons, be they ever ſo much at variance.</note> temple.</p>
                  <p>"Reverend old man," ſaid he, addreſſing the Prieſt, "the ſervants of Odin have foretold to me the fate of my throne. Their words were dark, but I am eaſy; for 'tis the tyrant only who can fear futurity. Do thou foretel to me the fate of my heart, which is to me of no leſs value. But let thy words be clear as light, for every lover fears futurity."</p>
                  <p>The hoary Prieſt, with reverence, bent his knee, and proceeded to invoke the Deity of the Temple. The flame mounted from the altar, and Swend's heart, clear and chaſte, towards heaven.—The Prieſt returned with ſolemn aſpect; a cloud hung upon his brow, but mortal eye could not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh whether ſome baleful planet, or the ſun of hope was hid beneath this cloud. After a ſhort, but awful pauſe, he ſpoke:</p>
                  <p>"Beloved of the Gods and of thy people, a good Prince finds his reward in the arms of a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyrie<note n="13">Valkyries, Virgins who are ſent by Odin into the field of battle, to inſpire the warriors, to make choice of thoſe who are to be ſlain, and to alleviate the pangs of death. They are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employed in attending on the heroes who inhabit Valhall.</note>."</p>
                  <p>"'Tis ſhe! 'tis ſhe!" cried the enraptured Monarch. "To what mortal female in my realms could Louna give a title more than mortal? To her alone! To Ildegerte! I thank thee, reverend
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037753_0015_100F4425DA65BC78"/>
old man. Soon ſhalt thou hear from me—ſoon ſhall the ſteps of this your temple groan beneath the weight of gifts which I will heap upon your altars. Farewell! Give me thy hand. Farewell! Pray for me!"</p>
                  <p>"Prince," ſtammered the Prieſt, ſhaking his ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver locks with warning mien.—</p>
                  <p>But Swend no longer heard him. Swend flew through the wood, ſurpaſſed in ſpeed by nothing but his thoughts. The form of Ildegerte ſwam before his ſight. The name of Ildegerte floated on his lips. His ſweet interpretation of the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive oracle ſeemed to him the only one within the ſcope of poſſibility. Panting, he arrived at the gates of his caſtle, and ordered his ſwifteſt ſteed to be prepared. In glowing colours Fancy painted the delight of a firſt meeting, after the ſeparation of a year; but the warlike trumpet ſoon awoke him from his viſionary bliſs.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," cried Tott, the chief of all his troops, "prepare thy ſwifteſt ſteed, collect thy Knights and warriors, and march againſt the traitor Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fried. Seeſt thou that weeping multitude of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives, which increaſes every moment? One left his houſe in flames; another ſaw his wife defiled; a third fled over his ravaged fields; a fourth beheld
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037753_0016_100F44281566D9F0"/>
the murder of his helpleſs father! With a troop of banditti, Canfried is ſpreading deſolation through thy territories.—Yes! prepare thy ſwifteſt ſteed; aſſemble the valiant Norwegians. Away againſt the villain! Let him feel that the blood of thy anceſtors flows in thy veins, that the arms of thy Knights are firmly nerved, and that old Tott is ſtill alive."</p>
                  <p>Like a man who wakes from golden dreams by the ſtab of an aſſaſſin, Swend ſtarted at this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful news; but a ſingle glance towards his wretched ſubjects ſubdued the lover, and called forth the hero. He diſpatched expreſſes to his faithful Knights throughout the land. From every quarter they crowded with their hardy trains of well-armed vaſſals. With beating heart, Swend in a few days beheld, beneath his caſtle's walls, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army, and at their head the dauntleſs Tott.</p>
                  <p>"I go to relieve my ſubjects," whiſpered the powerful voice of valour in the Prince's breaſt, "their miſery and groans demand my help. Silent be the milder voice of love, till I can lay the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and my people's gratitude at Ildegerte's feet."</p>
                  <p>Clad in his burniſhed armour, the young hero preſſed his charger; at his ſide rode the intrepid Tott. The warriors ſtruck their ſhields; the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037753_0017_100F44299FC9FC38"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>lds ſung ſolemn hymns; the army marched. Old men, women, and children, were aſſembled on the road. They bleſſed their Ruler, who ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted all with friendly air; and, with uplifted eyes and hands, they ſued the Gods for victory and life.—Thus went the warriors thirſting for battle and revenge. Succeeding meſſengers, who brought accounts of accumulated rapine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, blew every Norwegian's heart into a raging blaze.</p>
                  <p>The hoſtile armies were now ſeparated but by half a day's march, when Swend convened the chiefs and leaders of the people, and ſtanding on a riſing ground, he thus addreſſed them with the fire of youth:</p>
                  <p>"My brave and faithful countrymen, be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow the deciſive day. Let ſacrifice be offered at the altar of Odin, that he may grant us victory—the victory of juſt revenge. Advance with your troops, under cover of the night, againſt this murderer and robber, that at break of day, the ſword of my people may ſend the plunderer, while he ſleeps, into the arms of Hela<note n="14">Hela, or Death, the daughter of Utgarda Loke. She was precipitated into Niflheim by Odin, and there had the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of nine worlds given to her.</note>."</p>
                  <p>"Not ſo," replied the cool experienced Tott; "let us act honourably, and according to the laws of war—let us ſend a herald to the Swediſh
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037753_0018_100F442C3648E578"/>
camp, to learn the cauſe of this attack. If Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fried require what is juſt, and he be willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the calamities occaſioned by this inroad, then chuſe, Oh King! the palm of peace, and ſheath the murderous ſword."</p>
                  <p>"Require!" exclaimed Swend, "what can he require?—Repair! what can he repair?—Is he a God, that he can re-animate my faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?"</p>
                  <p>"Alas, no!" returned Tott, "the dead are dead;—never have our eyes again beheld the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal who had left this earth. But ſtill live the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan children of the ſlain—ſtill ſighs many a widow, far from the habitation of her ſlaughtered huſband. To theſe let Canfried open his treaſures, and repay them trebly for the bloody booty."</p>
                  <p>"What!" cried Swend, with generous heat, "ſhall I take payment for my people's blood?—Never!—Canfried's kingdom ſhall not buy a drop from the meaneſt of my ſubjects."</p>
                  <p>"Juſt and true, if that blood were yet unſhed," replied the old General; "falſe and wrong if it be already ſhed.—Or wilt thou lead thy troops to death without neceſſity?—Thou haſt loſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, perhaps will ſacrifice thouſands."</p>
                  <p>"Enough!" anſwered the young King, "be it
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037753_0019_100F442F711260C0"/>
according to thy wiſh. I revere thy counſel as the counſel of a father."</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of this determination, ſoon as the morning dawned, a herald came to Canfried's tent, and demanded admittance to the King. Through rows of ſcoffing guards he was conducted to the tyrant's feat; who, ſurrounded by arms, ſeemed to read treachery in every eye, and, in the midſt of his ſubjects, trembled at the ruſtling of a withered leaf.</p>
                  <p>"Speak; what wouldſt thou here?" ſaid he to the herald.</p>
                  <p>"Hear me, Canfried, King of Sweden. Through me ſpeaks Swend, the mighty King of Norway. Why haſt thou fallen on me, like a robber on the ſleeping traveller?—Why haſt thou ſlain my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and laid waſte my realms?—Why haſt thou infringed upon the rights of nations, and not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably declared war againſt me?—Behold! the blood of my ſubjects cries to me for vengeance. I am approaching with my warriors, and Odin will chaſtiſe thee by my arm. But if thou, like an honourable King and Knight, will declare unto me the cauſe of this attack, rebuild the habitations of my ſubjects, ſilence the complaints of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and orphans thou haſt made, then will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037753_0020_100F4431A0D5A7A8"/>
my chiefs and leaders, ſtate thy demand inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly to them, and, if ſuch be found juſt and proper, by my royal word will I grant it. But, if thou refuſe this offer, let Odin judge between me and thee. The groans of the dying, and blood of the ſlain be upon thy head!"</p>
                  <p>The herald ceaſed. Canfried, contracting his briſtly eye-brows, darted a threatening look at him, and thus replied:</p>
                  <p>"Go, tell the ſtripling Swend, that Canfried, King of Sweden, Lord of a mighty empire, at which the whole North trembles, has more than a ſufficiency of land and gold; that he requires not from the Prince of Norway even a ſpan of earth; that his royal clemency is willing to atone for the calamities occaſioned by his warriors on one condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—The poſſeſſion of Ildegerte was the only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of my uſing arms; let Swend, within three days, reſign her to my royal bed, and theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening troops ſhall quit his borders. If not, with ſword in hand will Canfried force his way through the Norwegian ranks."</p>
                  <p>Beneath an aged oak the King was ſitting at the feet of Tott, catching each inſtructive word that dropped from the lips of the experienced Chief. The herald came into his preſence, and, not without
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037753_0021_100F44332B12B7D8"/>
trembling, delivered to him Canfried's haughty anſwer. Scarce had he ended, when Swend ſprung up, and gnaſhed his teeth. Old Tott remained calmly in his place.</p>
                  <p>"Sooner ſhall the ſtone float on the water's ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face," cried the King, "ſooner ſhall the ſtream return to its ſource, than I accept this ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condition."</p>
                  <p>"Not ſo haſty, young man," anſwered Tott, "let us coolly examine this propoſal; let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly place in competition what thou wilt loſe with what thou mayſt loſe: Thou wilt loſe a girl—thou mayſt loſe a kingdom."</p>
                  <p>"But this girl was the favourite of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," rejoined Swend.</p>
                  <p>"Bleſſings be upon thee, for thus revering the memory of thy mother," ſaid the Chief; "but even Thora herſelf would have ſacrificed her favourite for the welfare of her people."</p>
                  <p>"And ſhall I then," cried the Prince, "make Ildegerte miſerable? Shall I deliver her, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver injured me, into the arms of a barbarian—her, for whom each Knight would draw his ſword with pleaſure? Never, never!"</p>
                  <p>"But is it then ſo ſure," demanded Tott, "that Ildegerte will be miſerable? How many
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037753_0022_100F44359E2ADAC8"/>
women have, by gentleneſs and wiſdom, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed blood-thirſty tigers into men? Has not Ildegerte ſufficient talents and perfections to change this libertine, this enemy of Norway, to a loving huſband, and thy country's ſtaunch ally?</p>
                  <p>"And is not our defeat," reſumed the King, "as doubtful as that Ildegerte will be happy in the arms of Canfried?—I miſtake thee, Tott; thou art at the head of a powerful army—thou art required to ſight in the cauſe of juſtice, and thou feareſt to do it."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! young man," anſwered the hoary war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, with a ſmile, "when thou art hereafter tranſported to Valhall—when thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come to meet thee, let them bear teſtimony whether ſear was ever known by Tott. No!—Thrice on theſe borders have I led to victory the warriors of Norway. When I returned trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant from the laſt, I put into thy hands the laurel-crown, beſtowed upon me by thy father, and thou playd'ſt with it in thy cradle.—Thy father ſhook my hand, and ſaid, 'Dear Tott'—methinks I ſtill can hear him—'ſhould Odin ſummon me before my ſon arrives at manhood, let thy ſword be uſed for him, as it has been for me; but teach him, one muſt never fight, unleſs for a better purpoſe than to be able thus to play with laurels."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:037753_0023_100F4438D66805E0"/>
"Forgive me, dear old man," exclaimed Swend, "but thou miſtakeſt me in thy turn. May Vara<note n="15">Vara, the Goddeſs who receives all oaths, and puniſhes thoſe who violate them.</note> puniſh me, if mad ambition fires my ſoul!—But infamous it ſeems to me, to buy a peace at ſuch a price—infamous to make ſuch a propoſal to Ildegerte."</p>
                  <p>"The latter I will undertake," replied Tott.</p>
                  <p>Swend ſtarted, but the Chief continued—</p>
                  <p>"I know Ildegerte's exalted ſentiments: ſhe is always more than woman—often more than man. Her father was my friend, and the companion of my youth;—he fell in battle at my ſide, and his laſt breath recommended Ildegerte to my care. I have obeyed him, and ſhe well deſerves it. In her dwells the ſpirit of her father. Joy will ſparkle in her eye when I inform her that the ſacrifice for which ſhe is ſelected, will ſave the lives of many thouſands—perhaps too the life of her King."</p>
                  <p>Here he roſe.</p>
                  <p>"I haſten to her. Meanwhile conclude with Canfried a truce of ſix days; before the expiration of which, I ſhall bring Ildegerte to the camp."</p>
                  <p>He attempted to go, when Swend, in violent agitation, held him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:037753_0024_100F443B17B33AF0"/>
"One moment more, dear Tott—only a ſingle moment!—And doſt thou really think that—that—?"</p>
                  <p>"I think," anſwered the old man, ſurveying him with great aſtoniſhment, "I think I do not underſtand thee, and am aſhamed to ſee thee tremble."</p>
                  <p>"Oh my friend and father!" exclaimed Swend, throwing himſelf into the arms of Tott, "I love Ildegerte!"</p>
                  <p>A pauſe enſued.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" ſaid the old man, "now I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all this—now all is plain enough. Now too I forgive the accuſation againſt me. Thou loveſt Ildegerte? And what doſt thou intend to make her?"</p>
                  <p>"Can Tott aſk ſuch a queſtion?" demanded Swend, with dignity.</p>
                  <p>"Thy wife then!" replied the Chief, ſhaking his hoary head. "Young man, young man, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve of this. But to convince a lover, is more than to gain three victories. I am mute. Come let us away to battle."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, to battle, to battle!" cried Swend. "To fight at thy ſide is but paſtime."</p>
                  <p>They went. The young King flew from tent to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037753_0025_100F443D4E1E9408"/>
tent, embraced each Knight, ſhook each vaſſal by the hand, ſhot fire into each boſom from his eyes, and inſpired the whole army with his youthful ardour. In a few minutes the ſhouts of battle echoed through the camp. The King was followed by old Tott, who earneſtly ſurveyed the field of battle ſtretched before him, and pointed out to every Knight the poſt which he was but to quit as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror or corpſe. Amid the clamour of the troops, through which the war-hymns of the Scalds were ſcarcely audible, Swend ſaw, in every poliſhed ſhield, the form of Ildegerte. Amid the wild tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous ſhouts he could hear nothing but the liſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice of Ildegerte. Retired within his tent, he threw himſelf upon a couch, and thus gave vent to his feelings—</p>
                  <p>"To riſk my life and throne for Ildegerte—to loſe my life and throne for Ildegerte, is a thought devoid of bitterneſs. But if Odin has reſolved to ſpare the villain for a longer trial—if Fate has fixed on me, as an example, that the cauſe of juſtice does not always conquer; if, inſtead of flying into Ildegerte's arms, I may to-morrow fly into my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents' arms, who will then declare what Swend has done for her—for her, who little fancies what a ſacrifice I am about to offer, who perhaps has

never read the avowal of my paſſion in my eyes?—Contented I will die, if ſure I am lamented by her. She ſhall know the ſecret, which, till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, has been concealed within my breaſt; and then, to Odin I commit the guidance of my days. I ſhall bear with me the certainty of Ildegerte's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret to the bliſsful habitations of Valhall. He ſpoke; ſeized the parchment, and wrote:</p>

                        <p>"Can you, dear companion of my youth, ſtill recollect thoſe bleſſed days of innocence and joy, when, under Thora's eye, each evening ſeemed to come too ſoon?—Does your tongue ſtill ſometimes liſp the name of brother, with which I ſo often was enraptured? Do you ſtill bear in mind the ſacred bleſſing beſtowed upon us by my mother when ſhe left this world? If you have yet ſome faint remembrance of thoſe happy days, paſſed in fraternal intercourſe, when I concealed no ſecret from you—then, cenſure me that I have hid within my boſom, for whole months, wiſhes and hopes which even at this inſtant, cauſe my hand to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and my cheek to glow, as if Thora's ſon could harbour a diſhonourable thought.

my hopes and wiſhes. To rob me of you, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fried has invaded Norway with a powerful army. The fatal hour approaches which is to decide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his cauſe and mine. If Love and Fortune be propitious to my arms, Swend, in a few days, will lay his crown at Ildegerte's feet, and Ildegerte will complete the bleſſing which my mother gave us as ſhe died. But if my rival triumph (and the firſt moment of his triumph muſt be the laſt of my exiſtence), then, Ildegerte, drop a tear upon my early grave; lament the loſs of a brother—of a huſband."</p>

                  <p>After he had ſealed this letter with the button of his ſword, he gave it to a truſty meſſenger, whom his longing eye ſtill followed till he vaniſhed among the intercepting mountains.</p>
                  <p>He returned with lighter heart into his tent. His attendants came to arm him. With delight he gazed upon the burniſhed harneſs which, ere long, was to be ſullied with the blood of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or with his own. He thought the iron hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met eaſier than before; the corſlet far leſs cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. He vaulted on his charger, and flew with naked ſword to the head of his army. The troops received him with a joyful ſhout.</p>
                  <p>"A blue plume," whiſpered one to another,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037753_0028_100F4444107CCB70"/>
"let us not loſe ſight of him. 'Tis the young hero's firſt campaign, and his fiery looks declare his eagerneſs. Haſte hither, old experienced Knights, and gather round him."</p>
                  <p>And now thirty or forty of the braveſt warriors encircled the King. Each breaſt was another buckler to him; and this ſmall determined troop more valuable far than all the paltry guards around the throne of Canfried. Old Tott brandiſhed his glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſword above his head with youthful ſtrength, and hark! The trumpet's warlike clangor ſtruck the ear from each end of the troops. The Scalds chaunted ſolemn hymns; the Knights cloſed their viſors; the arms of the vaſſals claſhed; the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſtamped; the enſigns floated in the air; the heart of the young King beat high.</p>
                  <p>"Why delay?" cried he to the deliberate Chief. "Forward, ſwift as lightning! See! the nervous arms of my Knights are ſcarcely able to reſtrain their neighing ſteeds."</p>
                  <p>"We delay to conquer," anſwered Tott; "let this firſt flame ſubſide which burns ſo high, yet ſpreads but little ruin round it."</p>
                  <p>Slow and determined, like a dark cloud which bears the vengeful lightning in its breaſt, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the trembling foe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:037753_0029_100F44459A367EB8"/>
Uffo, Tott's valiant ſon (who had already ſhared in many a fight the glory of his father), led a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen troop of warriors through the valley, and waited for the ſignal of attack, that he might fall upon the enemy when leaſt expected, and ſtrike the daſtard hirelings with diſmay.</p>
                  <p>Canfried, meanwhile, attended by his Knights, flew from one wing of his army to the other, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to each that he ſhould recollect his duty, and endeavouring to revive the drooping courage of his followers by the hope of plunder.</p>
                  <p>But what can ſervile avarice avail againſt the arm which is fighting for its native land? Already had the ſword of the Norwegians forced a paſſage through the Swediſh ranks; already had Tott ſpread deſolation round him; already had Swend burſt into the throng, and piled a mountain of his ſlaughtered foes upon the plain; already was Uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo's armour ſprinkled with Swediſh gore; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the groans of the dying mounted towards heaven. Canfried ſaw, trembled, and gnaſhed his teeth. In vain did he roar till he was hoarſe, to rally the retreating cowards. In vain did he curſe the hour of his birth, Odin, and the habitation of the Gods. Almoſt inevitably loſt, Deſpair added vigour to his arm, and hovered above him with
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037753_0030_100F4447D1B29420"/>
her ſooty wings. Impetuous he ruſhed into the thickeſt troops of the Norwegians, followed by a ſquadron of raſh daring youths; they hewed their way with the deſtructive ſword, until they reached the place where Swend's blue plume high nodded in the air.</p>
                  <p>"Art thou here," cried Canfried, in a voice of thunder, "thou cradle-warrior, who haſt dared to match thyſelf with me? Advance thou fiery ſtripling, nor crouch inglorious thus beneath the bucklers of thy Knights! Advance, and meet a man!"</p>
                  <p>"Welcome! welcome," cried Swend, "thou whom in the heat of battle I ſo long have ſought. Hither, thou raviſher! The ſtripling ſhall chaſtiſe thee."</p>
                  <p>He looſed the reins, and ruſhed towards Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fried; but his ſtaunch companions (who had averted many a dangerous blow, and whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was now much decreaſed) threw themſelves between the combatants, and cried—</p>
                  <p>"No, you ſhall not ſtake your life againſt a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain's, who diſgraces his own crown, and wiſhes to ſteal your's. He is no more a Knight. Call one of our baggage-boys, that he may fell him with a tent-ſtaff to the earth."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:037753_0031_100F444B016475E8"/>
Foaming with fury, Canfried bellowed to the remnant of his army—</p>
                  <p>"Advance! advance! Revenge this inſult of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to your King."</p>
                  <p>At theſe words, a confuſed multitude, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome hundreds, fell on the twenty valiant Knights, whoſe breaſts were as a wall to their Monarch. Not one gave way—not one fell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking five of his enemies to ſerve him in Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall<note n="16">Such were the tenets of the Runic doctrine in ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, though, in others, it was ſuppoſed that the warriors did not take their enemies to Valhall as ſervants, but only their ſculls as cups. See Note (8).</note>. But now the mob, which ſtill increaſed and fought with blind deſpair, had ſlain the laſt, and Swend remained alone, at a diſtance from his army, whither his youthful intrepidity had led him.</p>
                  <p>"Yield, yield," cried Canfried, "that I may yoke thee to my chariot, and thus triumphantly proceed to Ildegerte's caſtle."</p>
                  <p>Swend's ſword made his reply. Canfried with great agility eluded the attack, and aimed a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtroke at his antagoniſt, which glided down his poliſhed armour. A furious combat now began between the tyrant of Sweden and the father of Norway. The youths in Canfried's retinue ruſhed againſt the ſolitary King, to drag him from his charger; but two old Knights, the only two in whom the honour of their order ſtill remained,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037753_0032_100F444D3540B890"/>
threatened to ſlay the firſt who dared to lay hands upon him. They formed a circle round the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, caſt a furious look upon their daſtard countrymen, and maintained the laws of war.</p>
                  <p>Like lightning flamed the ſwords of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending rivals. Ildegerte and a kingdom were to be the victor's prize. Canfried ſaw both; Swend, Ildegerte only. The combat long continued doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for ſkill and courage fought againſt deſpair and madneſs. But now, as Canfried raiſed his ſword, in order to conclude the conteſt by one deadly blow, Swend perceived an opening where the armlets faſten to the corſlet. He dexterouſly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the deſcending ſtroke, and in a moment would his ſword have forced a paſſage to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant's heart, when a vile aſſaſſin from behind ſtruck him with a mace upon the head. He fell prone from his horſe, and ſtreams of blood came guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his throat. One of the old Swediſh Knights flew the villain on the ſpot, bent down to Swend, and opened his viſor. His features ſwam in blood—his eye was broken.</p>
                  <p>"A good Prince finds his reward in the arms of a Valkyrie."</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the laſt words he uttered through his ſighs. He was laid acroſs his ſteed, and ſlowly
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037753_0033_100F444EC50DC320"/>
taken from the field of battle; but ere he reached the neighbouring ſpring, at which the Knight had purpoſed to refreſh him, he expired.</p>
                  <p>"Swend is dead!" cried Canfried to his troops. "The day is our's. Back to the battle!"</p>
                  <p>"Swend is dead!" exclaimed the flying army, and returned.</p>
                  <p>"Swend is dead!" was heard on every ſide. "With him fell the courage of the Norwegians."</p>
                  <p>Alas! too true!</p>
                  <p>"Swend is dead!" whiſpered each vaſſal to his comrade; "vaniſhed is the plume which nodded at our head."</p>
                  <p>"Swend is dead!" ſaid each Knight to his neighbour.</p>
                  <p>The dire intelligence ſoon reached the old intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Tott, who ſtill was ſpreading carnage through the plain.</p>
                  <p>"Follow me, children," ſaid he with utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance half-choaked, "avenge the death of your King and benefactor."</p>
                  <p>But in vain did he once more ruſh into the heat of battle; but a few hundreds followed him. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and grief had overpowered the almoſt conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army. The Norwegians fled in wild diſorder from the field, and thouſands fell a prey to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037753_0034_100F44520B0814D8"/>
ſwords of their purſuers. Tott, with only a ſmall, but valiant band, retreated to a hill, and there maintained his poſt againſt the united force of Sweden.</p>
                  <p>"Where is Uffo, my ſon?" ſaid he to the Knight ſtanding neareſt to him. "Is my ſon Uffo too among the fugitives?"</p>
                  <p>"No, venerable Chief," replied the warrior, "he fell, covered with wounds, amid the fight."</p>
                  <p>"Didſt thou ſee him?" demanded Tott; "Were his wounds in front?"</p>
                  <p>"All in his breaſt, and on his head," returned the Knight.</p>
                  <p>"Odin be praiſed!" exclaimed old Tott. "Let us fight to-day; to-morrow we will mourn."</p>
                  <p>He ſpoke, and opened his viſor to regain his breath, when lo! a fatal arrow came hiſſing through the air, pierced his right eye, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the laſt prop of Norway to the earth. A faint groan from all his followers accompanied the hero's fall. The ſword dropped from every feeble hand, and every arm ſunk impotently down. Yet none would be obliged to the victorious robber for his life, and Canfried towered the plain with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:037753_0035_100F44544BBF9568"/>
FLY, my ſpirit, far, far from the fatal plains, drenched in the blood of heroes!—Why ſhouldſt thou tarry with the dead?—No longer great and valiant deeds can ſignalize the field, for Tott, and Swend, and Uffo are no more. Lead me, ſoft Fancy, lead me to the ſilent bower, where, in the ſhadowy twilight, Ildegerte received the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger who came to announce to her the King's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment.</p>
                  <p>"Art thou a meſſenger of peace?" cried ſhe haſtily, as he approached, and knelt with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before her.</p>
                  <p>"From the King's hand I have received this letter," anſwered he, "with orders to deliver it to Ildegerte."</p>
                  <p>"Tell me," demanded ſhe, "how didſt thou leave the camp? Is Canfried's band of robbers vanquiſhed? Has Odin chaſtiſed the traitor?"</p>
                  <p>"When I left the camp," replied the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, "the Scalds were chaunting hymns; the Knights were cloſing their viſors; the armour was claſhing; the enſigns were flying, and the trumpet's blaſt proclaimed the attack."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:037753_0036_100F44568CE9EC68"/>
"Oh! then is our King perhaps already victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious," exclaimed ſhe, "and with the pangs of unſucceſsful villany, Canfried has retreated from our borders."</p>
                  <p>With theſe words ſhe opened the letter. She read—her cheek coloured. She read further—her cheek glowed. She cloſed the letter, and a tear trembled in her ſparkling eye.</p>
                  <p>"Leave me," ſaid ſhe, in a friendly tone, to the meſſenger.</p>
                  <p>"Moſt willingly, fair lady," anſwered he; "but do not long delay your anſwer, for the King awaits me with anxiety."</p>
                  <p>"With anxiety!" repeated ſhe, bluſhing. "How doſt thou know that?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! he commanded me a hundred times," returned the meſſenger, "to outſtrip the wind in ſpeed. He ſaid the meſſage was of conſequence, and every minute dear to him. Nay, after I was mounted and had left the camp, I ſtill could hear his voice deſiring me to haſten; and when I looked far behind me from the dale, I ſpied him ſtanding near his tent, and with his hand above his eyes, ſtill watching me."</p>
                  <p>"Enough! enough!" ſaid Ildegerte, much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, "go, feed thy horſe, refreſh thyſelf;—
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037753_0037_100F4458169F59F0"/>
to-morrow, ſoon as the ſun's firſt beams have tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the hills, thou mayſt return to the camp."</p>
                  <p>The meſſenger went. Ildegerte ſunk upon her knees, and prayed—</p>
                  <p>"Oh Thora! now immortal, who, when about to quit mortality, didſt call me daughter; if, amid the joys of Vingolf, thou ſtill canſt feel a happy mother's joys—if the name of Swend remain ſtill dear to thee, Oh reveal thyſelf to Ildegerte! If I be unworthy of thy ſon's bed, baniſh from my heart this growing paſſion. Let me fly into ſome deſert, and lament my fate, which made me not the daughter of a King."</p>
                  <p>She ceaſed, and with eyes ſwimming in tears, ſurveyed the riſing moon. Hark! a gentle even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breeze ſwept through the leaves; the bloſſoms ſhed their odours all around; the nightingale, warbled in plaintive ſolitary notes. Ildegerte's heart was full. The ſolemn twilight filled her mind with dark preſages. With wild affrighted looks ſhe haſtened through the wood, and hid her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the moſt loneſome chamber of the caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the prating meſſenger had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the curious females, who ſurrounded him, all that he knew about the letter—or knew not; all that Swend had ſaid to him—or not ſaid.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037753_0038_100F445B4B55DEE8"/>
He had increaſed the King's anxiety a hundred fold; a hundred times repeated Swend's eagerneſs for his return, and at laſt, with all the air of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he obſerved—</p>
                  <p>"It muſt be ſome great project of the King which my weak intellects cannot diſcover; but perhaps Ildegerte may give you further informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                  <p>Heavens! what buſtle, and what whiſpers now took place! At length the fair aſſembly agreed that they knew nothing, and reſolved that at ſupper the ſecret ſhould be drawn from Ildegerte; or that, if her ſilence was invincible, they ſhould at leaſt read it in her countenance.</p>
                  <p>The wiſhed-for hour arrived. All eyes were turned on Ildegerte, as ſhe entered the ſaloon, with her uſual air of friendly majeſty. She was recovered; the gentle glow of hope ſhone on her dimpled cheek. They ſat to table. All was ſilence;—all was liſtening expectation, while Ildegerte (not remarking this ſilence, or this expectation) talked with indifference to all. One coughed; another trod upon her neighbour's foot; a third winked to a fourth, and none dared to ſpeak. But towards the concluſion of the meal, Ildegerte addreſſed them, and every hand, about to lift the morſel to the mouth, ſunk motionleſs upon the lap.</p>
                  <p>

"You, my dear companions, have, in this caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for many months, with me lamented Thora.

                  <p>She ceaſed, and, ſoftly bluſhing, caſt her eyes upon the earth. Aſtoniſhment had chained the tongues of her companions; but ſoon they roſe tranſported, ſurrounded Ildegerte with careſſes, and paid homage to their Queen.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be owned that here and there an envious glance was ſeen, but Ildegerte underſtood that art ſo difficult to be acquired, of always maintaining a ſerenity of temper; and thus her ſilent dignity and friendly look ſubdued the proudeſt heart. During the firſt hours devoted to reſt, not one of all the damſels cloſed her weary eyes; each ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination was ſo full of all the events by which this laſt was cauſed, that it ſpurned the hand of Sleep when it ſeemed to offer the balſam of repoſe.</p>
                  <p>'Twas well for you, good ſouls! For why this ſhort repoſe? Already do the ſhrieks of horror rend the air, and draw full near your caſtle-gates: already do the groans diſturb the midnight ſilence: already does the cry of murder echo through the

wood. The dwarf upon the tower thrice blew his horn. The guards rouſed themſelves from ſleep, and haſtened to the portal, againſt which the approaching wretches thundered.</p>
                  <p>"Who thus diſturbs our nightly reſt?"</p>

                  <p>"Conquered wounded fugitives."</p>
                  <p>"Whence come you through the darkneſs of the night?"</p>
                  <p>"From the field of battle. We have marked the path by which we came with the blood that trickles from our wounds.—Odin, Odin has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced deſtruction on the land! Swend is dead, Uffo is fallen, Tott is in Valhall!"</p>
                  <p>"Deſtruction, deſtruction upon you, ye meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of evil!"</p>
                  <p>All was confuſion through the caſtle. Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhrieks, and cries for arms were heard on every ſide.

                  <p>"Awake! awake!" cried they, "thy ſleep is death."</p>

Ildegerte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore threw a garment round her, ſeized a taper, and with winged footſteps traverſed the vaulted galleries, through which the diſtant cries aſſailed her ear. Now her foot ſtruck againſt a corpſe, and now her wandering eye eſpied upon the floor a wounded man, who held with both his hands his bleeding ſide, and ſeemed already ſeized by Hela.</p>
                  <p>"Who art thou?" cried Ildegerte, ſhuddering.</p>
                  <p>"One who fights with Death for Valhall's joys," ſaid he.</p>
                  <p>"How cameſt thou here?" demanded ſhe. "What hand inflicted this deadly wound?"</p>
                  <p>"The hand of a Swede," anſwered he. "Swend is dead, Uffo is fallen, Tott is in Valhall!"</p>
                  <p>"Avenging Gods!" ſtammered forth Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>The taper dropped from her hand, and ſhe ſunk, devoid of ſtrength, againſt the wall. But ſoon her fleeting ſpirits were recalled by the groans of the dying warrior. She crept to her chamber, ſecured
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037753_0042_100F446394EA0100"/>
the entrance, and threw herſelf upon the floor. There long ſhe laid, nor ſhed a ſingle tear, nor heaved a ſingle ſigh. This moment of dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtupefaction paſſed away. She drew Swend' letter from her boſom, and her eye fell upon theſe words:</p>
                  <p>"Then, Ildegerte, drop a tear upon my early grave; lament the loſs of a brother—of a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band."</p>
                  <p>A ſudden flood of tears came to her relief.</p>
                  <p>"My brother! my huſband!" cried ſhe, in a voice half choked by ſobs.</p>
                  <p>No more could ſhe ſtammer forth; but in theſe two names her overflowing heart combined all the ſhadows of her paſt happineſs, with all the ſmiling proſpects of her future bliſs, which Fancy, a few hours before, had painted to her.</p>
                  <p>Overpowered by anguiſh, and almoſt drowned in tears, laid Ildegerte, till the ruddy morn co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured the caſtle's turrets. She awoke from the frenzy of deſpair, juſt as the riſing ſun caſt his firſt beams upon the lance and ſword, which, ſince Thora's death, had ruſted in a loneſome corner.</p>
                  <p>"Come forth, my arms," cried ſhe, "as yet employed but in the ſports of youth—come forth, and in my hands become the inſtrument of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

He always carries a mace or club, which he graſps with gauntlets of iron; and which, as often as he diſcharges it, returns immediately to his hand.

The fifth day of the week (Thor's day) is conſecrated to him.</note> with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ardour; make the din of arms more pleaſing to my ear than the lute's harmonious tones.

I fight for my brother—for my huſband!"</p>
                  <p>Deep crimſon coloured Ildegerte's cheeks; her eyes ſhot fire; her arm trembled, not with female fear, but manly rage. She incloſed her ſilken locks within her creſted helm (adorned, by Thora's hand, with three ſerpents' heads), locked her ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling boſom in the plated cuiraſs, girded the ſword to her loins, graſped the lance and buckler, and entered the vaulted hall, where, with downcaſt looks, her companions, bewailing the paſt, and trembling for the future, ſhrieked and tore their boſoms.</p>
                  <p>"Why all theſe cries and lamentations?" ſaid
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037753_0044_100F4468D1666FF0"/>
Ildegerte. "He is dead. Your tears will not recal him from the clay-cold arms of Hela. Your tears will not repel the robber from the gates of our late peaceful habitation. Was it then in vain that Thora ſnatched the ſpindle from our hand, and taught us manly exerciſe?—Let thoſe women weep and ſigh, whoſe only arms are tears and ſighs. Let thoſe daſtards tremble who would not ſell their lives for Valhall's joys.—Riſe, my companions! Is there a choice between death and ignominy? Why do we delay? Haſte, againſt the robber, who threatens the deſtruction of our innocence. Haſte, haſte againſt the murderer, who has robbed me of my brother—of my huſband. Let him feel that the heroiſm of the ſons of Norway dwells likewiſe in her daughters. Let him feel that the arm of a woman was not formed only to place her ſuckling to her breaſt. Riſe! Riſe! Redeem the honour of your native land. Revenge your Monarch's death. Conquer, or die with Ildegerte!"</p>
                  <p>Here grief and fury in contention choked her voice; but the heroine's words ſunk deep into the hearts of her liſtening friends. They gazed with reverence at her flaming eye.</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte leaned exhauſted on her lance, and ſolemn ſilence reigned. At this moment, an old
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037753_0045_100F446B08AE7D08"/>
Knight, ſeverely wounded, and ſupported by two 'Squires, ſlowly entered the hall. In his hand he bore a helmet with a blue plume. Silent, and with his mournful eye riveted upon it, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached Ildegerte. A ſecret tremor chilled her blood.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" cried ſhe, "'tis Swend's helmet."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied the Knight, "it is indeed Swend's helmet. The blood that cleaves to this plume, is the blood of my King. This helmet coſts me my life. I have fought honourably for it, and 'tis all that I could bring. Doſt thou ſee this mark? There a villain ſtruck him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. The daſtard! From behind!"</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte ſwooned.</p>
                  <p>"Ceaſe! ceaſe!" cried the females, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded her. The old Knight ſeated himſelf, laid the helmet down before him, gazed at it with his hands claſped, and, regardleſs of the cries around him, thus proceeded—</p>
                  <p>"Yes! the aſſaſſin ſtruck thee from behind. Thou wert a brave youth. Still do I ſee this plume towering amid the throng, while the wanton winds were playing with it; but now it droops, wet with thy royal blood. The barbarous deed calls loudly for revenge, but in vain does thy departed

ſpirit ſearch for an avenger. Uffo fell with his troop. Tott has ſhed the blood, warmed only by the love of his country. The murderous ſword has ſwept our warriors from the earth. Me, me only has Odin for a few moments ſpared, that I might ſecure this treaſure, and require ſome one to ſwear on this cold hand the moſt terrible of oaths; that I might, by this helmet, appoint him an avenger; that I might carry his oath to Valhall, and deliver it to Swend. But my ſtrength declines, my eye fades. Haſte! haſte, avengers, ere I die!"—He looked around. Ildegerte was recovered. In a moaning voice, the Knight again began—</p>
                  <p>"Has the angel of death not ſpared one—not one youth (had he but juſt eſcaped the rod), that this cold hand might once more draw the bloody ſword to make a Knight? Haſte! haſte, avengers, ere I die!"</p>
                  <p>"Make me, make me the avenger, venerable old man!" cried Ildegerte, claſping his knees with ardour, and throwing her own helmet from her. "To me give Swend's helmet, that on my head it may become a terror to the enemy; that the ſight of it may make the blood of Canfried ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; that this ſword may force it into circulation, and with it waſh the gore of my Monarch from this drooping plume."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="unknown:037753_0047_100F446F81819AD8"/>
"Is Norway then ſo far humbled," ſaid the dying Knight, "that her liberty and honour can only be defended by a woman's helpleſs arm?—Oh, father of the Gods! haſt thou then lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out my days—haſt thou allowed theſe eyes to be yet a little longer open, only that they may ſee the ſtorm tear up by the roots that tree, in whoſe ſhadow I have reſted eighty years, on whoſe branches I have hung many a well-earned trophy. Never have I wept but in my mother's arms—thoſe were the tears of a child; but to-day, in my old age, am I doomed to waſh theſe grey hairs in the tears of deſpair. Bear me into the open air, and let me die."</p>
                  <p>"Stay, I conjure thee, by the honour of thy order," exclaimed Ildegerte. "Thou deſpiſeſt the courage of a female, and ſcornſt a woman's helpleſs arm. Know then, old man, that ſhe whom Swend had choſen for his wife, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be his avenger. If the miſt of death has not yet dimmed thy eye, peruſe this letter. I am thy Queen. Thy Queen claſps thy knees, and with burning tears implores thee to make her the avenger of her huſband."</p>
                  <p>The old Knight took the letter with a trembling

hand. His eye examined it with difficulty, line by line, and at laſt reached the word Huſband.</p>
                  <p>"Be it ſo," cried he, much agitated, "I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thee my Queen before I die. Fear not theſe clay-cold lips. Kiſs me, that I may take thy kiſs to the holy habitations of happineſs, where, in the court of warriors, your huſband wanders under Odin's golden bucklers<note n="22">
                        <p>Odin's golden bucklers. The Edda tells us, that Gylfe, King of Sweden, went diſguiſed to Aſgard, the court of the Gods, and there ſaw theſe bucklers.</p>
                        <p>"Tunc cernebat ille palatium. Tecta ejus erant tecta aureis clypeis."</p>
                        <p>"Then he beheld a palace. The roof of it was covered with golden ſhields."</p>
                        <p>We are likewiſe told, that Eger, a Daniſh Nobleman, once vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the Gods, on which occaſion Odin had ranged through the hall ſwords of ſuch amazing brilliancy, as to make any other illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination needleſs, and had covered the walls with glittering ſhields.</p>
                     </note>."</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte preſſed her glowing mouth to the pallid lips of the expiring warrior—</p>
                  <p>"Take this kiſs," exclaimed ſhe, "to my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and with it the ſolemn oath to revenge his death, or to die worthy of his love."</p>
                  <p>"Swear then," ſaid the Knight.</p>
                  <p>"I ſwear," replied Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>He drew his ſword.</p>
                  <p>"Lay thy hand," proceeded he, "upon this ſword—the eye of the Omnipotent beholds us. Repeat my words—the ear of the Omnipotent hears us. With fire and ſword I ſwear to avenge the death of Swend, King of Norway. May the marrow dry within my bones, and may my hand be withered, if I ſheath the ſword before my venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be complete! With fire and ſword I ſwear to purſue Canfried, the murderer of my huſband. If I break this oath, may my name become the

                  <p>Thus ſwore Ildegerte. The ſurrounding virgins ſtood like ſtatues, gazing at her glowing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The old Knight now caſt away his ſword, and ſeizing with both hands the helmet of the King, exclaimed—</p>
                  <p>"Then let the ſight of this each morn awake thee to the renewal of thy oath. Still let thine eye behold the blood with which this plume is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared, long after the rain has waſhed it off!—Doſt thou promiſe this?"</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="unknown:037753_0050_100F447685CBBBF0"/>
"I promiſe it," anſwered Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>"Take then the jewel," ſaid he, "which I purchaſed with my life."</p>
                  <p>He placed the helmet on her head.</p>
                  <p>"Brace on thy armour," added he, "and mount thy charger; for thou art appointed an avenger. My eyes grow dim. My ſtrength is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted. Odin, I thank thee! Not in vain didſt thou command the ſcythe of death to wait till now, ere it cut the feeble thread of my exiſtence, and joined it to eternal bliſs. My laſt hour is come. My work is done. Bear me into the open air, and let me die in ſight of the ſun."</p>
                  <p>He leaned, devoid of ſtrength, upon his 'Squires. They bore him into the open air, and he died in ſight of the ſun.</p>
                  <p>NATURE created man a medium on the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of perfection; he never climbs to the higheſt ſtep, never ſinks to the loweſt; he is never quite ſo good, never quite ſo bad as woman. 'Tis not of you I ſpeak, ye prattling creatures, whom Plato doubts whether to reckon among our ſpecies: you I mean, ye elevated beings, for whoſe ſake Leſſing

                  <p>Never had ſuch heroic fire glowed in the breaſt of man. Ildegerte felt a new being. Unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrength was ſhed upon her. Revenge had ſubdued the gentleneſs of love, and love added fuel to revenge.</p>
                  <p>"You are witneſſes," cried ſhe, after the old Knight had left the hall, "your are witneſſes that I am ordained an avenger. This very day will I depart to fulfil my appointment. I have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions but the Gods and Juſtice. I have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors but this helmet and my ſword. Fallen are the mighty warriors of Norway. No valiant troops will follow me to battle.

                  <p>She caſt her eyes mournfully around.</p>
                  <p>"Is there not one?" ſaid ſhe.</p>
                  <p>"All! all! we will all accompany thee!" cried

they, ſeized with the noble enthuſiaſm, which ſtruck them with electric force.</p>
                  <p>They aſſembled round Ildegerte, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—</p>
                  <p>"Be our leader and our Queen. Appoint us by thy kiſs the ſervants of revenge."</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte embraced all, and away they fled to their chambers, hung up the harp and lute, caſt away the loom and ſpindle, and haſtened to clean their armour.</p>
                  <p>The heroic ardour was not long confined within the caſtle's walls. It echoed through the wood, and flew upon the wings of wind to the next town, where many a wife wept over the aſhes of her huſband, many a mother over the bones of her ſon. All dried their tears, tore helmet, mail, and ſword from the much-loved ſlain, and armed themſelves to fight under Ildegerte's banner. Swift flew the news into the land. From every quarter flocked whole troops of females, and ere the evening dew was mixed with the blood of the ſlaughtered, Ildegerte ſtood at the head of ſix thouſand Amazons, who (aſſembled on a plain, beneath the canopy of Heaven), ſwore to her the moſt dreadful oath to avenge the deaths of their huſbands, of their ſons, and of their brothers.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037753_0053_100F447CD7EA15E8"/>
They began their march under ſhadow of the night; and the conſtellation Orion was their guide. The next morning, the little army halted at the foot of a hill, when, to their no ſmall joy, the fugitives who had eſcaped deſtruction, joined them, in number about twelve thouſand.</p>
                  <p>From the ſummit of the hill, the heroine brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with meditating gloom over the warlike prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations at her feet.</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "there is the laſt reſource of our impoveriſhed land. Woe be to Norway if theſe too be ſacrificed! And ſure they muſt, unleſs a God fight for us. That triumphant army, which ſubdued the flower of our chivalry, will cruſh this ſmall undiſciplined band, as the bear cruſhes the ant-hill. I ſmile at Hela: I have ſworn to meet her, and each of my companions will ruſh into her arms, rather than wear the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant's ignominious chains. But what muſt become of thoſe poor innocents whom we have left heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly playing in our ſtreets?

through her ſoul. Theodoric, King of Denmark, Thora's nephew, was, at Swend's death, heir to the crown of Norway The hundred tongues of Fame deſcribed him to be handſome, juſt, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant.</p>
                  <p>"The blood of Thora," ſaid each ſtranger who had dwelt a few days at his Court, "the blood of Thora flows in the veins of this young hero."</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte diſpatched, without delay, ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to Theodoric, who ſpoke to this effect—</p>
                  <p>"Swend, thy kinſman, is no more. He is murdered by the villany of Canfried. All the Nobles of Norway are deſtroyed. A female only is advancing, at the head of females and of fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to avenge her deſolated country and her Monarch's death. Summon thy Knights, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble all their vaſſals. Haſte, haſte to defend a land which henceforth owns thee as its King."</p>
                  <p>Upon the ſwifteſt horſes the ambaſſadors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued their way to Denmark's borders; while Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte advanced towards the enemy, who, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of attack, were diſperſed over the country, laying waſte the fields, plundering the cottages, and murdering infancy and age.</p>
                  <p>With a ſmile of deriſion Canfried received the firſt account of the approaching Amazons. With
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037753_0055_100F4482928CD338"/>
a look, like the look of the devil, when he ſees the pious ſin, he heard that Ildegerte herſelf was at their head.</p>
                  <p>"'Tis well," cried he, with a ſcoffing laugh. "The bird flies of its own accord into the cage. Welcome! welcome, beauteous bride! In vain doſt thou oppoſe thyſelf to me. My ſword was drawn for thee, and cannot be turned againſt thee. Amid the din of war, I'll lead the to my couch, voluptuouſly unclaſp thy corſelet, enjoy thy virgin ſtruggles, and revel in that heaving boſom, ill adapted to be thus confined in mail."</p>
                  <p>In theſe terms did the tyrant, lolling on ſilken cuſhions, feaſt his fancy with laſcivious hopes; and as Ildegerte was not yet within his power, he ſummoned ſome harlot from the camp, and threw himſelf into her arms.</p>
                  <p>The ſcattered bands, of late engaged in murder and in rapine, ere long returned affrighted to the camp. Ildegerte's out poſts had ſeized part of the robbers, and the reſt had fled to announce the enemy's approach.</p>
                  <p>"Art thou ſo near already?" cried Canfried, in a tone of diabolical exultation. "By my faith, thou ſeemeſt to have an eager longing for a King's embrace. But ere the ſword be uſed to lead thee

Far more noble would it be, wert thou generouſly to ſtretch forth thy hand to him, whom thou haſt conquered, and who wears thy chains. Or, canſt thou think, lovely, yet raſh enchantreſs, that, becauſe thy girls have ſometimes broken a lance, they will dare to cope with my victorious Knights, beneath whoſe arms fell Tott and Uffo?—Baniſh the romantic whim. I offer thee my heart and peace. Let not thy lovely troops advance. It behoves me to wait

on thee—me, who am determined to poſſeſs thee, as friend or foe."</p>

                  <p>Beneath a canopy, majeſtically leaning on her lance, Ildegerte received the herald, who brought this letter.</p>
                  <p>"Thank the law of nations," ſaid ſhe to him, "that I do not puniſh in the meſſenger the audacity of the libertine who ſent him. Bring a ſack hither; throw ſome filthy dog into it, and deliver it to this man. When thou openeſt the ſack in preſence of thy maſter, and the dog runs out covered with ſores, ſay, This is Ildegerte's anſwer and her dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note n="23">I doubt not that many of our modern belles will be ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this diſguſting preſent of Ildegerte. But, let them revert to thoſe rude ages, in which barbariſm was extolled as virtue, and delicacy of ſentiment condemned as effeminacy. A ſcabby or mangy dog (for this is my author's expreſſion, though, from deference to the feelings of thoſe above-mentioned, I have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in terms <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Let theſe nice ladies, then, call to mind the ſpirit and manners of thoſe times, and if they be not ſuperfine indeed, Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte will loſe nothing in their eyes.</note>."</p>
                  <p>With theſe words ſhe turned her back to the trembling meſſenger, and went to prepare her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friends for the deciſive hour.</p>
                  <p>"What! not yet humbled!" cried Canfried, with ferocious mien. "Still that proud contempt with which I was accuſed of having ſtolen thy ſandals! Fall then a ſacrifice to thine obſtinacy. Alive I'll catch thee, and my vaſſals ſhall deflour thee."</p>
                  <p>Towards evening, Canfried ſent a ſecond herald to the camp.</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow," thus ran his meſſage, "ſhall the riſing ſun be witneſs of my triumph. Arm thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037753_0058_100F44889CACD5E8"/>
girl! Inſpire thy girls with courage. To-morrow will I ſend my baggage-boys againſt thee, who ſhall bind the raſh creatures to their horſes' tails, and drag them to my preſence."</p>
                  <p>A ſmile was Ildegerte's anſwer—a forced ſmile upon her countenance, and dark preſages of the future in her ſoul. She could not to herſelf deny, that her ſmall band was too weak to contend with an enemy thrice as numerous; and that the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and intrepidity of a few troops haſtily collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were not a match for ſkill and diſcipline. Her Amazons, indeed, had devoted themſelves to death, and ſhe herſelf would think it happineſs to die for him, who died for her. 'Twas not the fear of death that made her tremble, but the thought of going to Valhall, where the old Knight perhaps might meet her with the queſtion, "Haſt thou fulfilled thy oath?" Then to be obliged to anſwer, "No," although a gaping wound in her breaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed that No—this, this alone—</p>
                  <p>"Oh Father of the Gods!" exclaimed ſhe, with eyes ſwimming in tears, "this evening is perhaps the laſt of my exiſtence. If thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the battle of to-morrow ſhall decide for ever the ſlavery of my country, Oh! at leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, in the heat of action, to find the villain
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037753_0059_100F448AD1E58718"/>
who robbed my huſband of his life, that my arm may ſearch the way to his execrable heart! Let us fall together. Hurl him not to Niflheim's everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkneſs; allow him not the ſmall conſolation of ſuffering with many thouſands: take him to Valhall, where he will be the only ſufferer, that, in the happineſs of him whom he perſecuted, in the bliſs of him whom he murdered, he may feel the bittereſt of agonies."</p>
                  <p>Thus prayed Ildegerte, in whoſe heart the thirſt for vengeance had choked the milder ſenſations of female gentleneſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſtars already ſparkled in the ſky; Ildegerte ſent meſſengers from tent to tent.</p>
                  <p>"Refreſh yourſelves," ſaid they; "let the cup of joy paſs round, and reſt till ſun-riſe. Then brace on your armour, pray to the Gods, and ſally forth upon the plain, for to-morrow is the deciſive day."</p>
                  <p>The troops obeyed; they filled the horn, and drank to a happy meeting in Valhall.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile Ildegerte aſcended the hill, upon which the moon ſhone in awful majeſty, erected a ſmall altar, and ſacrificed to the God of war. Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, one of her deareſt companions, followed her.</p>
                  <p>"Let me," ſaid ſhe, with ſiſterly affection,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037753_0060_100F448DD635C698"/>
"reveal to you my doubts and fears. You did not act wiſely in diſmiſſing Canfried's meſſenger ſo ſcornfully."</p>
                  <p>"And what would Helga have done?" de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>"You have ſent ambaſſadors to Theodoric, King of Denmark," rejoined ſhe. "Fame ſpeaks loudly in the praiſe of this young hero, but our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is not his revenge, nor our impatience his. Allowing that he accedes to your requeſt; granting that he is allured by the proſpect of an empty throne, and takes up arms to gain a ſecond crown, not being ſufficiently oppreſſed by the weight of one; ſtill, what can you expect from this? The deciſive hour approaches. Pray to Odin that he will beſtow wings upon Theodoric's army. We muſt conquer without him, or die without him; for, at all events, the King of Denmark will come too late."</p>
                  <p>"And what do you infer from all this?" aſked Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>"That you would have done better," replied Helga, "had you, for a little while, caſt away theſe manly arms, and uſed the arms which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grants to all our ſex—cunning and deception. You might have detained Canfried's meſſenger for
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037753_0061_100F448F5E5DD1A8"/>
a few days with promiſes, and then given ſome equivocal reply, ſome gleam of hope. By this mode we ſhould have gained time—have gained every thing."</p>
                  <p>"You are right," returned the heroine; "but for the murderer of her huſband, Ildegerte has but one reply. To have left Canfried in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (were it but the ſuppoſition of a moment) that my ear was open to his vile propoſals, would have been a breach of my oath, would have been treaſon to the ſhadow of our King. No! Of this not a word more. Let us remain true to our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and die."</p>
                  <p>"I admire your courage, but not your policy," ſaid Helga.</p>
                  <p>"As you pleaſe," rejoined Ildegerte. "I have liſtened to, and anſwered your objections as a friend; I now, as your Chief, command ſilence. The morning begins to dawn; our moments are counted. Go; leave me to my devotions. Climb to the ſummit of the hill, and obſerve the Swediſh camp. As ſoon as you perceive the enemy in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, call to me, that we may deſcend, and wake our friends."</p>
                  <p>Helga went. Ildegerte ſacrificed and prayed. The border of the eaſtern cloud was tipped with gold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="unknown:037753_0062_100F4491B5DFB7B0"/>
"Do you ſee nothing, Helga?" demanded Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte.</p>
                  <p>"A death-like ſilence reigns around," ſaid ſhe; "I hear nothing but the warbling of the early lark."</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte prayed fervently. The ſmoke from the altar aſcended towards heaven. The outward edge of the ſun appeared in the horizon. Ildegerte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated her queſtion.</p>
                  <p>"I ſee," returned Helga, "a few men ſcattered here and there through the camp of the enemy. They are leading their horſes to the water."</p>
                  <p>"The time draws near," ſaid Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>She raiſed her hands and eyes towards heaven, and prayed aloud. The ſun roſe in full majeſty.</p>
                  <p>"What do you now ſee, Helga?" aſked ſhe.</p>
                  <p>"I ſee," anſwered Helga, "a thick cloud of duſt far in the weſt. I ſee the glittering of ſpears far as my eye can reach."</p>
                  <p>"In the weſt!" exclaimed Ildegerte. "Does your imagination deceive you?"</p>
                  <p>"Come yourſelf, and ſee," replied Helga.</p>
                  <p>The heroine mounted the hill. Before her eyes appeared an innumerable army. The ſun caſt his beams upon their poliſhed helmets. Already was her ear aſſailed by the neighing of their ſteeds, and the claſhing of their arms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="unknown:037753_0063_100F4494E75DA6E8"/>
"Heavens!" cried Ildegerte; "we are loſt. Odin has given life to ſtones in order to yoke our miſerable country!"</p>
                  <p>"See how they ſpread from ſide to ſide," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Helga; "the wood ſcems to be alive. Still, ſtill freſh troops appear."</p>
                  <p>"Deſcend! deſcend!" ſhouted Ildegerte. "Thunder to our warriors. Let us die at leaſt with ſword in hand."</p>
                  <p>They ruſhed together down the hill, and lo! the ambaſſadors who had been ſent to ſue for aid from Denmark, met them.</p>
                  <p>"Whither," exclaimed Ildegerte, "whither ſo quick? What means this breathleſs haſte? Who are the countleſs troops advancing from the weſt?"</p>
                  <p>"The troops of Denmark," anſwered they, "of our liberater and avenger. But a day's march from our camp, beyond the wood we found him, at the head of thirty thouſand warriors. Long had Fame announced to him the danger that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened this kingdom, yet did the news of our late Monarch's death force tears from his eyes. He is a friendly Prince, and ſeems a gallant Knight. He commends himſelf to your ſervices, and ſays, he hopes to know you better. You muſt immediately
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037753_0064_100F449722204C30"/>
call forth your troops, and take your ſtation on the left, while he draws toward the river on the right. Liſten to the firſt ſound of the trumpet, which is the ſignal that Theodoric's army is fording the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; the ſecond announces to you the ſafe arrival of the troops on the other ſide; and the third is the moment when you and they are to commence the attack. Odin grant ſucceſs to your arms!"</p>
                  <p>They bowed to the earth, and joyfully haſtened down the hill to communicate the tidings, and with them courage through their little camp. What ſhouts of tranſport echoed from every ſide! The ambaſſadors were incloſed, and lifted in the air, while grateful bleſſings were poured upon Theodoric. The cries of joy floated to the enemy acroſs the plain. Stunned with horror, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the innumerable ſpears, and burniſhed armour glittering in the ſun-beams Long Ildegerte ſtood immoveable. With uplifted hands, and the tear of gratitude ſparkling in her eye, ſhe looked towards the habitation of the Gods. At length ſhe threw herſelf into Helga's arms—</p>
                  <p>"Now, dear friend, thou ſeeſt Odin is juſt. His thunder ſeems to ſleep, but ſuddenly the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain feels its force. The hour of vengeance is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:037753_0065_100F4498ACDD5618"/>
She ſpoke, and haſtened to the troops, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her with loud acclamations. Already were they mounted on their chargers; mighty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence beamed upon every countenance, and each with eagerneſs awaited the third ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, the ſignal of attack.</p>
                  <p>Towards the leſt, as Theodoric commanded, Ildegerte led her valiant troops, who followed her with ſongs and jubilee, as if to tournaments and ſports. Not far from Canfried's camp, ſhe order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to halt, and with rapture heard the firſt ſound of the trumpet.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, the tyrant raged from tent to tent. In vain! Fallen was the robber's courage. Inſtead of graſping his ſword, each trembling coward ſeized the plunder, and prepared for flight. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by dangers, and almoſt ſinking under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, Canfried ſent a herald to Theodoric, King of Denmark, who thus addreſſed him—</p>
                  <p>"Why art thou come againſt me, who live in peace with thee? Join thy troops to mine, that we may annihilate theſe women, who have ſled from the ſpindle: then will we fraternally divide the realms of Norway, conquered by my valiant arm."</p>
                  <p>"Go, tell thy maſter," ſaid Theodoric, "to reconcile himſelf with Odin, for his laſt hour is
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037753_0066_100F449B06B26E88"/>
come. Norway is my hereditary right, nor will I ever ſhare it with a robber."</p>
                  <p>The herald faithfully delivered his meſſage, and Ildegerte heard the ſecond ſound of the trumpet. Deſpair ſtretched her ſable pinions over Canfried's head. The centinels ſtole one by one from his tent, and he, on whoſe nod, but yeſterday, the lives of thouſands hung, remained alone.</p>
                  <p>"Is it then reſolved?" cried he, foaming with fury. "Muſt all my high premeditated ſchemes be blaſted in their bud?—Ah! then ſhall my death at leaſt diſtinguiſh me from this baſe herd of flying daſtards. Pale and aghaſt, poſterity ſhall hear how Canfried fell. Riſe, demons of Niflheim! Cloud my ſenſes, that I may ruſh impetuous on their ſwords, and ſeek the girl who tears the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels from my brow.—What is this that boils with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me? In vain do ye torment me, ſenſations, termed by the vulgar, pangs of conſcience: in vain does the bloody recollection of my ſins attempt to torture me.—Thou phantom, called Virtue, I die without knowing thee. Oh, how wretched is he, whoſe miſery ariſes from his own crimes! My heart is my accomplice, and my executioner. But I will not feel that I am wretched. Death is my hope, and life my puniſhment. Curſed be thou,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037753_0067_100F449E1728F480"/>
Odin! I hate myſelf. I hate mankind! Away to death! Down, down to hell!"</p>
                  <p>Furious he ruſhed forward, and ſaw part of his flying army far away.</p>
                  <p>"There the cowards fly!" cried he. "Is there then no one who will die with his King?"</p>
                  <p>He looked round. His eye fell upon an old Knight, who was attentively ſurveying the ſtump of an oak, which had been lately felled. It was the ſame old Swede who ſlew the murderer of Swend, and led the dying Prince to a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpring, for the purpoſe of refreſhing him.</p>
                  <p>"What art thou doing here?" demanded Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fried.</p>
                  <p>"I am obſerving this tree," replied the Knight.</p>
                  <p>"Is it ſo remarkable a ſight that it can make thee forget thine own ſafety?" aſked the King.</p>
                  <p>"It is indeed remarkable," anſwered the Swede. "But yeſterday its top defied the hurricane."</p>
                  <p>"I underſtand thee," returned the tyrant, "but even in his fall ſhall Canfried ſtill be Canfried. Go. Fly, and leave me to my fate."</p>
                  <p>"I ſhall not fly," ſaid the Knight.</p>
                  <p>"Thou ſeeſt we are forſaken," rejoined Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fried.</p>
                  <p>"I am not forſaken," anſwered he.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:037753_0068_100F44A075F264F0"/>
"Not forſaken!" exclaimed the King. "On whom doſt thou place thy hope?"</p>
                  <p>"On God and my arm."</p>
                  <p>"On God!" cried Canfried, ſhuddering.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," ſaid the Knight, with a look of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards heaven, "on God."</p>
                  <p>"And on thy arm?" continued Canfried, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering. "A ſingle arm againſt two armies?"</p>
                  <p>"I know how to die," returned the Knight.</p>
                  <p>"I know it too," exclaimed the King; "I will not ſurvive the dreadful hour which robs me of my glory, to be bound in ignominious chains, and dragged before a woman's throne. Here," proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, drawing his ſword, "take this, and obey thy Monarch's laſt command:—Stab me."</p>
                  <p>"Never!" replied the veteran.</p>
                  <p>"I will die," ſaid Canfried, "by the hand of a friend and a Knight. Take it and ſtrike."</p>
                  <p>"Heaven forbid," rejoined he, "that I ſhould ſtain my hands with the blood of my King! Thus far we are not as yet degraded. Let theſe hirelings fly. The better half of thy army ſtill remains immoveable; and though it be not equal to the enemy in numbers, ſtill many a valiant Knight defends thy cauſe. Advance, my Liege! Shew thyſelf at the head of thy warriors, and if thou muſt die, die in battle like a Knight."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:037753_0069_100F44A2058B1CF8"/>
"'Tis well!" cried the tyrant. "Follow me. Seas of blood ſhall pay for every drop of mine, and if Odin grant me victory to-day, I'll build a temple, and confeſs aloud—there is a God."—</p>
                  <p>He haſtily vaulted on his charger, and flew to collect the ſcattered troops, which fear and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice had left him.</p>
                  <p>The warlike trumpet ſounded the third time; Ildegerte heard it with a beating heart, courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly brandiſhed her ſword, and ruſhed at the head of her Amazons againſt the hoſtile ſquadrons. At the ſame moment, like a thick wood, the lances of the Danes forced their way. At their head fought, with glowing ardour, Theodoric the King, and Prince Harold, his favourite. A cloud of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows darkened the ſun. Amid the din of war, the neighbouring cataract was heard no more. In vain did the deſpairing tyrant atchieve prodigies of valour. The heaps of ſlain increaſed around him every inſtant; every inſtant numbers forſook him, and begged their lives as they fled from the field.</p>
                  <p>"'Tis done!" cried Canfried, with ghaſtly fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; "I have reached the goal of my career. Black demons of Niflheim! dying, I devote myſelf to you. Help, help me to find the woman, whom I
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037753_0070_100F44A46E7ECD30"/>
once ſo ardently wiſhed to poſſeſs. My love is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into fury. She refuſed a Monarch's bed; be ſhe my companion on the bed of death!"</p>
                  <p>Wildly he rolled his eyes around the field, in ſearch of Ildegerte. Ildegerte ſought him, and ſoon they met. An involuntary tremor thrilled through Canfried's frame, when, by the crowned lion, he recognized, on Ildegerte's head, Swend's royal helmet.</p>
                  <p>"Has hell belched thee forth?" cried he, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his maſſy ſabre to conclude the combat with one deadly blow.</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte, unequal to him in ſtrength, but more nimble, eſcaped the threatening ſtroke, which glanced down her poliſhed armour. Now, as he raiſed his arm a ſecond time, ſhe ſpied the opening in his corſelet, and before his ſtroke deſcended, plunged her ſword into his boſom to the hilt. Bellowing, he fell at his horſe's feet. Black ſtreams of gore ruſhed down his armour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed the graſs. With the moſt dreadful curſes upon Ildegerte, and blaſphemy upon his dying tongue, he vomited his impious ſoul.</p>
                  <p>This combat decided victory for Norway, and reſtored her liberty. All that could fly, fled, and thoſe, who ſaw no way open, fell on their knees,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037753_0071_100F44A7B8970F80"/>
caſt away their arms, and threw themſelves upon the generoſity of their conquerors.</p>
                  <p>The old Knight, alone, by whoſe hand Canfried had wiſhed to die, had fixed himſelf againſt the ſame tree, which, a few hours before, had foretold to him his Monarch's fate; and with ſword in hand defended himſelf againſt the increaſing multitude. Him Theodoric diſcovered at a diſtance, ſprung forward, and diſperſed his troops, who were baſely fighting againſt a ſingle man.</p>
                  <p>"Yield!" ſaid he, to the almoſt exhauſted Knight. "Look round; thou art alone. How comes this youthful raſhneſs in a veteran's breaſt?"</p>
                  <p>"'Tis becauſe I am a veteran," replied he, "that I do not wiſh to ſurvive the loſs of this day's battle. But I yield to thee on one condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                  <p>"Name it," returned Theodoric.</p>
                  <p>"Let me bear away the body of my King, and go in peace to give it honourable burial."</p>
                  <p>"Didſt thou love thy King?" demanded the young Monarch.</p>
                  <p>"He was my King," anſwered the Swede, "and I did my duty."</p>
                  <p>"Enough!" ſaid Theodoric, much affected, "thy petition is granted."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="unknown:037753_0072_100F44AA0DC3A2C8"/>
"I have made no petition," replied he; "I have but required of thee what I (were thy body lying at my feet) ſhould not deny to one of thy Knights."</p>
                  <p>"Go then in peace," returned Theodoric, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his gauntlet off, "but not ere thou haſt given the King of Denmark thy hand."</p>
                  <p>"I thank thee," anſwered the Knight, ſhaking his hand, "and in return, young hero, accept the honeſt counſel of a man in years. Let not thy conqueſt make thee arrogant. Let the example of Canfried be ever preſent to thee, and teach thee how much ſtronger a defence than ſword and mail, is—the love of thy people."</p>
                  <p>"I promiſe," ſaid the young King, "to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy inſtructions. Come with me to my Court, and witneſs it."</p>
                  <p>"No," replied the Swede, "I have a native home, and two infant grand-children."</p>
                  <p>"Let me then, at leaſt, take thy friendſhip with me," ſaid Theodoric.</p>
                  <p>"Thou haſt it," rejoined he.</p>
                  <p>Thus they parted. The body of Canfried was laid upon a carriage, and ſlowly borne towards the borders of his kingdom. No lamentation filled
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037753_0073_100F44AB976A4728"/>
the towns through which it paſſed. No tear moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the ſand which covered it.</p>
                  <p>Scarce had Ildegerte fulfilled her oath as an avenger; ſcarce did ſhe ſee that nothing now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but to bind her temples with the wreath of victory, than ſhe left the field of battle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Helga only, haſtened to the camp, climbed the hill, which had ſmoked with her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice on the preceding night, and offered the firſtlings of her gratitude to Odin. As ſhe went to rid herſelf of her armour, ſhe was met by The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoric and the Nobles of his Court, among whom was Prince Harold. With reverence the King alighted from his horſe, and accoſted Ildegerte in theſe words—</p>
                  <p>"To you, valiant lady, belong my thanks, and the thanks of your country. Receive them in ſight of the whole army, and allow me and my retinue to behold your face."</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte humbly anſwered—</p>
                  <p>"My Lord and Sovereign! your generoſity is pleaſed to aſcribe to me what, without your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aſſiſtance, I had never effected. You are the deliverer of my native land. Allow Ildegerte to be the firſt who does homage to you."</p>
                  <p>She opened her viſor with downcaſt eyes, and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037753_0074_100F44ADD704DA50"/>
modeſtly knelt at his feet. How enchanting was her appearance! How majeſtic the air added to her figure by Swend's helmet, from which a few ringlets had ſtolen into ſight! How negligently beautiful the belt with golden fringe, that hung from her ſhoulder! Theodoric and his courtiers were aſtoniſhed. The former almoſt forgot the rules of courteſy, raiſed her with a trembling hand, ſtammered forth a few ſyllables, and kiſſed her forehead. Ildegerte, however, ſeemed not in the leaſt to have obſerved the impreſſion ſhe had made on the aſſembly, and withdrew to her tent, in order to exchange her armour for a female dreſs.</p>
                  <p>THINK not, miſtaken mortals, to eſcape the inviting dangers, which ſo often coſt you happineſs and peace. It is from them only that the ſpace of many years, of many miles cannot protect you. Your enemy is your heart, and if you never had a conteſt, you have had no enemy. In our boſoms we all bear a great enchanter, who can make old men young, and beggars Kings. Oh! if we knew not love and death, what could convince the haughty man that he is but a man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:037753_0075_100F44B063E44350"/>
King Theodoric returned to his pavilion, not as he had left it. Every object ſeemed beautiful and fair, for in every object he beheld Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>Prince Harold returned to his pavilion, not as he had left it. All was to him unaccountable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, for his heart was full—was full of Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>It is time to ſketch, with a few light touches, the characters of theſe two royal youths.</p>
                  <p>Theodoric was young and inexperienced, open to every impreſſion, eaſily deceived, and eaſily led aſtray. He had a warm eſteem for every good and noble action, yet often miſtook the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of good and noble, for reality. In every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating ſmile he ſaw a friend, into whoſe arms he threw himſelf without conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Harold was older and more ſubtle, pliant and reſerved, ambitious and voluptuous. He had the look of calmneſs with a boiling heart. He had a countenance, which, as the times required, aſſumed each maſk. He was pious with the pious, and ſcoffed with the free-thinker. He had once made an attempt to revive an ancient right to the crown, and his impotence alone reſtrained him within the bounds of a ſubject. In vain did many an aged counſellor, who looked into futurity, warn Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric to diſmiſs this dangerous rival from his throne.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037753_0076_100F44B347CEB010"/>
To policy Theodoric ſeldom liſtened, for he thought it too much at variance with humanity; and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold knew how to ſilence all ſuſpicion in a way ſo crafty—knew ſo artfully how to adopt every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that to the unſuſpecting Monarch his ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſoon became indiſpenſible.</p>
                  <p>Propped on his hand, Theodoric ſat, recalling to his mind with rapture every motion of the hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; and ruminating upon every word that ſhe had uttered.</p>
                  <p>With folded arms, with long and haſty ſteps, Harold meaſured his pavilion, fabricating ſchemes compoſed of love and of ambition.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſurpriſe them both. Let us fly, ſwift as thought, from tent to tent. Lend your right ear to the love-ſick ſighs of Theodoric, and your left to the daring plots of Harold:—</p>

                     <p>Not too haſty, be my motto. A wiſe man, though he love, will ſleep in peace, and leave the ripening of his plants to time; for the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous bloſſom is of leſs value than the meaneſt fruit.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>Such were the ſoliloquies of both.—Theodoric diſpatched a page to Ildegerte, to enquire whether ſhe had need of reſt after her fatigues, or if he might have the honour of an audience.</p>
                  <p>Harold, on his part, had ſtationed ſpies to watch each footſtep which approached Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>In the meantime, the page brought to Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric the wiſhed-for anſwer, that his viſit would be acceptable. With throbbing heart, and the glow
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037753_0079_100F44BA53514448"/>
of love upon his cheek, he entered her tent, and was received with great politeneſs. The youth gazed at her full blue eye in mute aſtoniſhment. She had caſt away her armour; her auburn treſſes were bound in a braid, and no longer buried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the helmet, which had covered her majeſtic forehead. In a long white robe, encircled at her ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der waiſt by her blue girdle, which was tied at her left ſide, from whence its ends, bordered with ſilver fringe, hung negligently down; with a hand ſo fair and ſoft, as if intended only for love's preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not to graſp the ſword, ſhe ſat oppoſite the King, bewitching as the goddeſs of youth and beauty, who, but a few hours before, had ſeemed the goddeſs of revenge and war. It was an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent pauſe, with which the converſation opened. Theodoric's looks ſpoke, and Ildegerte involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily caſt down her eyes.</p>
                  <p>Since the creation of the world, it has been the cuſtom, when one has nothing, or any thing of conſequence to ſay, to begin with a remark on the good or bad weather; which ever be the caſe, the tranſition always takes place by a cough. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoric too, pointed out, by ſtammers, to Ildegerte, the delightful day, which even the tenth month of the year afforded them. Ildegerte agreed with
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037753_0080_100F44BC936AEE98"/>
him, and that ſubject was at an end. The tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-cough now followed. Purple cheeks gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the confeſſion was approaching; downcaſt eyes announced it, and fingers, which inadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently played with the points of Ildegerte's girdle, accompanied it as interpreters. The moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent girl feels an inward ſenſation ariſe from theſe ſymptoms, which calls to her—"Be on thy guard. The enemy approaches."</p>
                  <p>"Angelic woman!" began Theodoric; "you have conquered friend and foe—the foe by your arm, the friend by your eye."</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte bluſhed; and, as uſual on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, aſſumed the appearance of not having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his meaning.</p>
                  <p>"Your Majeſty ſpeaks in enigmas," anſwered ſhe.</p>
                  <p>"Is it poſſible," exclaimed the King, "that you alone know not the power of your charms? You had a heart for revenge," proceeded he, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hand, "have you then none for love?"</p>
                  <p>"You either banter me, or forget yourſelf," replied ſhe, withdrawing her hand.</p>
                  <p>"The former were an inſult," ſaid Theodoric, "the latter in your preſence very poſſible."</p>
                  <p>"You may mean what you ſay," returned ſhe,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:037753_0081_100F44BE1CB00A38"/>
"yet ſomewhat odd it ſounds in the mouth of a man but juſt retired from battle."</p>
                  <p>"Surely not," obſerved the King, "unleſs you take the heat of blood for love. For, in what other reſpect does the emotion of a ſoul, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a battle, reſemble that ſweet ſenſation? But ſay, what do you call love?"</p>
                  <p>"Go, aſk the prieſts in the temple of their Goddeſs," rejoined Ildegerte. "I am not initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and know her only from the poems of our bards."</p>
                  <p>"Can falſhood dwell in ſuch a form?" cried Theodoric. "Am I ignorant that Swend—"</p>
                  <p>"I know what you would ſay," returned ſhe, interrupting him. "In his arms I hoped to have learnt it. Till now I have felt but gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. It was the impulſe to all that I have done. But I have been told, that to love is but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtep; and, without a bluſh, I own my heart was reſolved to take that ſtep."</p>
                  <p>"Ildegerte," replied the young Monarch, "may I hope for your friendſhip?"</p>
                  <p>"Whatever is valuable in my friendſhip," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, "I give you willingly."</p>
                  <p>"Enough!" exclaimed he, again ſeizing her
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037753_0082_100F44C059324970"/>
hand. "From friendſhip to love is likewiſe but a ſtep."</p>
                  <p>"A ſtep improper both for you and me," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>"You," ſaid Theodoric, ſomewhat hurt, "now banter me, or forget yourſelf. For indifference I was prepared, but not for contempt."</p>
                  <p>"Hear me then," returned ſhe. "It were pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery any longer to affect an ignorance of your meaning. I underſtand your looks and words. But does it become you, the King of Denmark and Norway, in the midſt of your victorious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, upon the path of glory, to ſue for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's heart, who has no other dowry than her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? You are Lord over your realms, yet is your heart their ſlave, and muſt never be your adviſer. Subdue this flighty paſſion. The daughters of Princes wait for you, and Kings deſire you for a ſon-in-law. You will make powerful alliances. The name of Theodoric will be revered by your neighbours, and the baſis of your throne will be immoveable."</p>
                  <p>"My throne," replied Theodoric, "is founded on the love of my ſubjects; and who is better able to augment this love than Ildegerte? For, even when I hear you ſpeak, I fancy myſelf in the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:037753_0083_100F44C35108DED0"/>
midſt of my ſenators. Such exactly are their arguments."</p>
                  <p>"You are paying me the greateſt compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," anſwered ſhe, "perhaps without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it."</p>
                  <p>"Right!" ſaid he. "Ildegerte, you have caſt away ſword and mail. Be once more quite a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Think you not that I bear enough when my head ſuſtains the crown? Muſt it alſo preſs upon my heart?"</p>
                  <p>"You belong entirely to your people," rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe.</p>
                  <p>"'Tis well!" exclaimed Theodoric; "I make the people judges between you and me. Let them decide whether they know one more worthy of the throne—whether they will have any other Queen."</p>
                  <p>"Not ſo," returned Ildegerte. "You ought to ſee clearly even if your ſubjects be blind. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, my friend (for by that name I will moſt willingly addreſs you), when the firſt ardour of your youthful paſſion had ſubſided, you would ſee but too clearly. Then, what a wretch ſhould I be! I entreat you, Theodoric, to be ſatisfied with my eſteem."</p>
                  <p>"What you have juſt ſaid," anſwered he, "I
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037753_0084_100F44C585B73DD8"/>
hope you did not mean it, was blaſphemy to Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and treaſon to your charms. No never—"</p>
                  <p>Here the good King was juſt about to pour forth a ſolemn declaration of his paſſion, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by oaths, ſighs, tears, and vows; and my reader would, without mercy, have been obliged to liſten to them, word for word, had not Prince Harold, as if called for, entered the tent, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Majeſty, that a large body of Swedes had been ſeen beyond the river, and that he had judged it expedient to double the guard. In reality it was a mere pretext; for this large body melted by degrees into a ſcore of ſtraggling fugitives. His ſpies had informed him that Theodoric had been ſeen alone, and in deep meditation, wandering to Ildegerte's tent. The converſation had already laſted half an hour, without the preſence of a third. Enough for a miſtruſtful heart! enough to rouſe the ſeeds of jealouſy! Harold therefore haſtened to interrupt a viſit, which wore an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſo ſuſpicious.</p>
                  <p>The King, unpleaſant as it was to be ſurpriſed at this deciſive moment, obeyed the duties of the public weal, and, accompanied by the Prince, left the tent. Ildegerte remained alone, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037753_0085_100F44C7100EE6A0"/>
and timidity about her heart, which ſeemed not exactly to agree with her late politic advice.</p>
                  <p>Harold, meanwhile, made every indirect endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw the ſecret from the King. But with Theodoric there was no need of circumlocution. His open heart offered to the traitor what he had but expected as the reward of artifice.</p>
                  <p>"Kinſman," began he, with a hearty ſhake of the hand, "oft haſt thou ſeen me roving, like a bee, from flower to flower. I thought myſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and perhaps was happy. But my hour at laſt is come. I love. I love with an ardour unfelt before, which ſeems to ſtretch my heart beyond its limits. Would that I could make the whole world happy!"</p>
                  <p>"It almoſt ſeems to me," anſwered Harold, "that there is no occaſion to requeſt a name which your viſit has betrayed to me."</p>
                  <p>"True," replied Theodoric; "the charms of Ildegerte only could have chained this fickle heart. Sure Odin ſent her from a better world, to give us a foreknowledge of thoſe heavenly joys—"</p>
                  <p>"Hold! hold!" cried Harold. "This you muſt tell herſelf, before the enthuſiaſtic fire evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; or, probably you have already done it?"</p>
                  <p>"I ſcarce know what I told her," ſaid the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037753_0086_100F44CA49A91D30"/>
King; "nothing very wiſe, I dare ſay. What ſhe anſwered, I know better. The noble girl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed a crown."</p>
                  <p>"What!" exclaimed Harold. "Is it poſſible that love can have led you ſo far aſtray, as to make you offer your crown to the daughter of a Knight?"</p>
                  <p>"The daughter of a Knight!" repeated Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric; "What mean'ſt thou? Had blind Fate ſnatched another lot from Fortune's urn, this Knight as eaſily had been a King, as eaſily a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Still Ildegerte had been Ildegerte."</p>
                  <p>"But, pardon me," rejoined the Prince, "is it not your duty to conſult the wiſhes of your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the welfare of the ſtate?"</p>
                  <p>"Thou too canſt talk like my old unfeeling ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors," replied Theodoric. "The wiſhes of my ſubjects!—My ſubjects adore Ildegerte. The wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the ſtate! What can be more profitable to the ſtate than to beſtow on it a Queen, whoſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will ſhare with me the load of government, whoſe valour will ſupply to me the place of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Chief? Our kinſman, Swend, thought thus. Him Thora formed, and blindfold will I follow his example."</p>
                  <p>"Not if Love bind the bandage on your eyes," ſaid Harold. "Moſt willingly would I aſſiſt you
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:037753_0087_100F44CC838F77F0"/>
in this plan, were it the only one which gained you what you wiſh. But why abſolutely make a Queen of her?"</p>
                  <p>"Peace!" cried Theodoric, "I tremble even to imagine what thou art about to ſay. For ſhame!"</p>
                  <p>"But—"proceeded Harold.</p>
                  <p>"Not another word," rejoined the King. "I am reſolved. To-morrow, ſoon as propriety allows, go to Ildegerte. Summon all your rhetoric, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold. Paint to her, in glowing colours, all I feel, yet am not able to expreſs. A third can do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To-morrow ſhe muſt explain, and will too, I dare be ſworn. Go; ſpeak as a friend. I, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, will act as a lover."</p>
                  <p>Harold was ſilent; for he feared, by further op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to betray himſelf. He went, and felt, as the hawk would feel, if forced to replace the ſtolen pigeon in its neſt. He threw himſelf upon his couch, and ſlept—little. With pleaſure would he have re-animated every Swede, whoſe body was ſtretched upon the plain, in order, if poſſible, to quench the blazing fire of love in the King's boſom, by the hurry of battle. With pleaſure would he have recalled the fugitives, gathered their ſcattered bands, inſpired them with temerity, and
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037753_0088_100F44CEC14C2F10"/>
urged them to a nocturnal ſurpriſe. But as the flight of the vanquiſhed enemy forbade him to indulge ſo frivolous a hope, and as he had to no effect racked his brain for a pretext, and toſſed upon his couch till the morning watch; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but to ſmile upon the wheel, to curſe the paſt, and await from futurity what the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſnatched away.</p>
                  <p>"Why do I torment myſelf?" cried he, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up. "If I cannot enjoy Ildegerte, I may the Queen of Denmark and Norway. Let fools feaſt upon the idle fancy that the firſt embrace is moſt delicious. What excites this ſilly wiſh in man?—Vanity. The idea that he is the firſt who awakes theſe ſenſations in the girl. Well, be it ſo, if I be but the firſt who make her wiſh for theſe once unknown ſenſations. 'Tis a mighty leap from the prattling of a child to the chaunting of a bard, yet muſt I learn the former ere I can underſtand the latter. Succeſs to thee, Theodoric! Teach the girl to prattle, while I tune my harp."</p>
                  <p>Thus did the vain fool conſole himſelf with the plans, hatched by his heated brain, while the young King, inſpired by ardent love, made prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the camp throughout the night, which I ſhall not diſcloſe to you, reader, that when you
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:037753_0089_100F44D04CDCF800"/>
have long enough puzzled yourſelf in vain, I may ſurpriſe you, as Theodoric ſurpriſed the object of his affection.</p>
                  <p>Now, when the morning dawned, too late for the impatience of the King, too early for the Prince's jealouſy, Harold ſlowly crept to Ildegerte's tent, and enquired of the females, who guarded it without, whether ſhe might be ſpoken to ſo early.</p>
                  <p>"Whether by you, Prince, I know not," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied one of them, "but her friend Helga has been with her ſince break of day."</p>
                  <p>"Natural enough!" grumbled Harold. "Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte, with all her valour, is but at laſt a woman. She muſt have her confidante. The conqueſt of hearts flatters female vanity but little, unleſs the mouth be allowed to blazon it, or at leaſt to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it in the ear of this, and that, under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſecrecy.—Go, girl," ſaid he aloud, "and announce me."</p>
                  <p>The Amazon went, while the Prince, full of choler, ſtamped into the earth the harmleſs daiſies that grew around the tent.</p>
                  <p>Ere long, Helga appeared in a light morning dreſs, and beckoned to Harold that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. He found Ildegerte, with her head prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon her arm. She appeared to have had but
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037753_0090_100F44D297D5C6B0"/>
little reſt, and the faint ſmile upon her countenance ſeemed almoſt forced.</p>
                  <p>"Oh how happy were the King!" began Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold, approaching her with a familiar air, "had he any ſhare in this meditative poſture!"</p>
                  <p>"How ſtrange," anſwered ſhe, ſmiling, "that the firſt word of man to woman muſt always be a compliment! What a mean opinion muſt you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of us! Well, yes; I was thinking of the King."</p>
                  <p>"Then would I bet," replied Harold, "that the alluring proſpects of futurity engaged your thoughts."</p>
                  <p>"You would loſe your wager," returned Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte.</p>
                  <p>"How!" exclaimed the Prince. "After all that Theodoric is ready to do for you?"</p>
                  <p>"'Tis true," ſaid ſhe, "that you are ſpeaking to a woman—to a woman who is not free from the weakneſſes of her ſex; but I never yet knew the tortures of ambition."</p>
                  <p>"You are right," anſwered Harold. "A crown has greater charms when from the hand of love."</p>
                  <p>"The firſt moment's love," rejoined the hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, "is but the ſun-beam which awakes the ſeed.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:037753_0091_100F262322916D20"/>
Whether there be a laſting ſtem, or tranſient flower, contained within it, who can now determine? And who would venture to build a hut, in the hope that from this ſeed would grow a tree to overſhade his hut?"</p>
                  <p>"Truly," ſaid Harold, "if you can moralize thus, you are not in love."</p>
                  <p>"Who told you that I was in love?" demanded Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>"So much bravery without ambition!" cried he. "So much beauty without love! Since I firſt knew that I had feelings, I have conſidered theſe two paſſions as the grand ſupports of life.—A crown, and a beauteous woman! He who offers ſuch rewards, may pile rocks upon rocks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe each drop of rain into a ſtream. I ſcorn the rocks, and laugh at the ſtreams. I climb to the goal, or ſink to the bottom, and die in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt."</p>
                  <p>"If ſuch be your ideas," returned Ildegerte, "I pity you. Ambition towers aloft, but deep is the abyſs to which it leads. Sweet is the draught which Love preſents, but the bitter is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom."</p>
                  <p>"There let it ſtay then," replied Harold. "To
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037753_0092_100F44D88F9E5A20"/>
empty the cup would be exceſs, and exceſs creates diſguſt."</p>
                  <p>"True it is," proceeded Ildegerte, "that were I, in the ſtorms of life, obliged to place reliance on one of theſe two paſſions, I ſhould prefer love to ambition."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Harold. "Thanks, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte, that you have not quite broken the ſtaff which ſupports me; that it is but the throne which you refuſe, and not the man who ſits upon it. A heart, which loves you—a heart which knows no other wiſh than to poſſeſs you—a faithful heart may hope at laſt to move you. I revive. Without a crown and ſceptre, I may contend for preference with him who bears them. I may hope—"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing may you hope," rejoined ſhe, "nor any other. I am free, and value my freedom. Prince, if you came hither in your own name to found me, our diſcourſe is at an end; but if you came in the King's name, tell him that I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the offer made by him yeſterday, that I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him as my King, eſteem him as my friend, and love him as my brother. Tell him to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with theſe declarations of Ildegerte, who is free. Were ſhe no longer free, ſhe would glory in her chains, but dreadful indeed would be her
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:037753_0093_100F44DA19B0DFB0"/>
lot, if ever forced to break them. Theodoric is an excellent young man, with a heart devoid of guile, but ſoft as wax. Who could be anſwerable for his fidelity?"</p>
                  <p>"I!" cried the King, ſuddenly throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her feet; "I, who will ſell my life for a broken arrow, my throne for a cup of poiſon, if Ildegerte refuſe to ſhare both with me. Why, beauteous woman, why this ſuſpicion, ſo diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both to you and me? Have you then but one perfection to bind me for ever to you? Is it your beauty only which has captivated me? Oh wiſdom and virtue, powerful and everlaſting ties of feeling ſouls, ſtill will ye be new and faſcinating, when wrinkles long have furrowed this full cheek, and when theſe auburn locks have long been grey. Sweet girl! oppoſe me no longer. Deſpiſe my crown, but not my heart."</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte was ſurpriſed, and felt herſelf kindly diſpoſed towards the graceful youth, who was laying at her feet. With a gentle and half-tender look, ſhe reached her hand to him, and ſtammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth—</p>
                  <p>"Riſe, Theodoric, and leave me alone."</p>
                  <p>"Not till I can call this hand my own," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he; "not till I have ſealed the affiance on
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:037753_0094_100F44DBA4F8F740"/>
your lips.—Approach, Eſcill; the moment is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived."</p>
                  <p>Eſcill, one of Theodoric's moſt illuſtrious Chiefs, entered the tent; in both hands he held a cuſhion of purple ſilk, bordered with golden fringe; upon the cuſhion laid a crown, glittering with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones. Eſcill bent his knee, and at the ſame moment martial muſic ſtruck the ear. The tent fell, and Ildegerte, with aſtoniſhment, beheld the whole army drawn up in battle array, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns floating in the air, and ſpears ſparkling in the ſun-beams. She heard the loud and joyful ſhout—</p>
                  <p>"Long live Queen Ildegerte!"</p>
                  <p>She was no longer able to command her heart. She ſunk into Theodoric's arms, and hid her glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheeks in his throbbing boſom. He preſſed her to his heart, ſeized the dazzling crown, and placed it on her head.</p>
                  <p>Not far from them ſtood a triumphant carriage, decked with flowers and ribands. Four ſnow-white ſteeds pranced at its thill, and ſnorted as they obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the golden rein of the nervous charioteer. The enviable youth lifted the prize of love with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port into the carriage, and ſlowly paſſed the front of his troops, that he might ſhew his happineſs to
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:037753_0095_100F44DED8F9D838"/>
every vaſſal. The army received him with loud acclamations. The kettle-drums rolled, the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets clanged, but louder than both, echoed the joyful cry—</p>
                  <p>"Long live Queen Ildegerte!"</p>
                  <p>When they reached the ſmall band of Amazons, the carriage was ſurrounded, the traces cut, and a thouſand times a thouſand hands drew the lovers to the altar of Siona<note n="24">Siona or Sioſna, the Goddeſs of wedlock.</note>. There waited a hoary-headed Prieſt, whoſe knife ſtill ſmoked with the blood of the recent ſacrifice. He prayed to Odin, bleſſed the couple, and received the oath of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love and fidelity. A ſumptuous banquet, by the light of a thouſand torches, cloſed the feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive day. The ſweet ſmile of ſatisfaction ſhone on every countenance but one;—Harold's alone was gloomy and contemplative. The veil of night ſhrouded the happy pair. Theodoric found bliſs and heaven in Ildegerte's arms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="unknown:037753_0096_100F44E10E63AB88"/>
OH! that I were here allowed to caſt away my pen! Oh that I might not wake you from the ſweet idea that virtue had paſſed, enjoying its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſurrounded by unfullied bliſs, even to to the grave!</p>
                  <p>Alas! our ſorrows and our happineſs are all a dream, and from this ecſtatic viſion was Ildegerte to be rouſed to miſery and horror.</p>

                  <p>(1) ODIN, alſo called Woden, Father of the Gods. He, his wife Freya, and ſon Thor, compoſe the ſupreme council of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. He is called the Univerſal Father, The Terrible and Severe God, The King of Slaughter, The God that carrieth Deſolation and Fire, the Active and Roaring Deity, The Giver of Victory, &amp;c. The fourth day of the week is conſecrated to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called Woden's day.</p>
                  <p>(2) Frea, or Freya, wife of Odin, and mother of the inferior Deities. Theſe names are, by ſome, aſcribed to two Goddeſſes, the former being Queen of the Gods, and the latter, ſiſter of Erey. To her the ſixth day of the week is conſecrated.</p>
                  <p>(3) Vingolf, the manſion of Love and Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>(4) Utgarda Loke, an evil ſpirit, nearly reſembling our devil. He is deſcribed in the Edda (or Bible of the Northern nations) as exceeding handſome, but crafty and perſidious. He is called, The Artificer of Fraud, The Calumniator of the Gods, &amp;c. He, nevertheleſs, dwelt in Heaven, till, as a puniſhment for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated crimes and attacks upon the Gods, they chained him to three ſharp ſtones, which are for ever cutting his fleſh; while a ſerpent, hanging over him, diſtils its venom, drop by drop, upon 
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:037753_0098_100F44F172427098"/>
his face. In this ſituation he is to remain till the deſtruction of the world.</p>
                  <p>(5) The wolf Fenris, a ſon of Utgarda Loke. He was bred among the Gods; but they, being warned by oracles that he might one day become fatal to them, reſolved to confine him. No chains, however, could be forged which were ſtrong enough to hold him. At length a dwarf, in the land of the Black Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii, ſupplied Odin with a bandage of uncommon ſtrength. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranſon's deſcription of its texture is ſo ludicrous, that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to tranſcribe it:</p>
                  <p>"Hic nervus ſex conſtabat rebus; ſtrepitu nempe pedum felis, ex barbâ mulieris, radicibus montium, nervis urſinis, halitu piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, &amp; ſputo avium."</p>
                  <p>"This ſtring conſiſted of ſix things, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the noiſe made by a cat's feet, the beard of a woman, the roots of mountains, the nerves of bears, the breath of fiſhes, and the ſpittle of birds."</p>
                  <p>Having bound the wolf with this cord, they drew it through a huge rock, to which he is doomed to be confined till the laſt day, when he is to break looſe, and devour the ſun.</p>
                  <p>(6) The ſerpent of Midgard, one of Utgarda Loke's children, and an enemy of the Gods. Odin threw him to the bottom of the ocean, where he grew ſo large, that he wound himſelf around the whole globe of earth.</p>
                  <p>(7) Scald, the name given to the ancient bards, who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to compoſe odes and hymns, which were chaunted at every ſolemnity. Theſe ſongs were, in general, deſcriptions of eminent exploits, and were animated by an enthuſiaſtic ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>(8) Valhall, the palace of Odin, to which warriors are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed after death. Here they paſs their mornings in tournaments and battles; the reſt of the day is employed in feaſting on the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037753_0099_100F26E3EB98ACD0"/>
wild boar Serimner (which, though dreſſed every morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes entire again every night), and in quaffing Hydromel (or mead), which is adminiſtered to them in the ſculls of thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies whom they had ſlain while on earth.</p>
                  <p>(9) Gefione, the Goddeſs of Chaſtity.</p>
                  <p>(10) Noffa, the daughter of Frea, a Goddeſs of ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite beauty that whoever is lovely and handſome, or whatever is precious, is called by her name.</p>
                  <p>(11) Vora, the Goddeſs of Prudence and Wiſdom, who is ſo penetrating, that nothing can remain hidden from her.</p>
                  <p>(12) Loſna, or Louna, the Goddeſs who aſſiſts lovers, and makes up differences between them and married perſons, be they ever ſo much at variance.</p>
                  <p>(13) Valkyries, Virgins who are ſent by Odin into the field of battle, to inſpire the warriors, to make choice of thoſe who are to be ſlain, and to alleviate the pangs of death. They are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employed in attending on the heroes who inhabit Valhall.</p>
                  <p>(14) Hela, or Death, the daughter of Utgarda Loke. She was precipitated into Niflheim by Odin, and there had the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of nine worlds given to her.</p>
                  <p>(15) Vara, the Goddeſs who receives all oaths, and puniſhes thoſe who violate them.</p>
                  <p>(16) Such were the tenets of the Runic doctrine in ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, though, in others, it was ſuppoſed that the warriors did not take their enemies to Valhall as ſervants, but only their ſculls as cups. See Note (8).</p>
                  <p>(17) Thor, the eldeſt ſon of Odin, the ſtrongeſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid among the Gods. He is ſaid, by ſome, to launch the thunder of Odin, and to be principally conſulted in heaven rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the deciſion of victory. He always carries a mace or club,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:037753_0100_100F26E5A65439B0"/>
which he graſps with gauntlets of iron; and which, as often as he diſcharges it, returns immediately to his hand. He is alſo poſſeſſed of a girdle, which has the virtue of renewing his ſtrength as often as is needful. The fifth day of the week (Thor's day) is conſecrated to him.</p>
                  <p>(18) Frey, the mildeſt of all the Gods. He preſides over the ſeaſons of the year, and beſtows fertility.</p>
                  <p>(19) Niord, the God of Winds, who checks the fury of the ſea, ſtorms, and fire.</p>
                  <p>(20) Lyna, the Goddeſs, to whoſe care are committed thoſe whom Frea intends to deliver from peril.</p>
                  <p>(21) Niflheim, or Hell, literally ſignifying Evil-Home.</p>
                  <p>(22) Odin's golden bucklers. The Edda tells us, that Gylfe, King of Sweden, went diſguiſed to Aſgard, the court of the Gods, and there ſaw theſe bucklers.</p>
                  <p>"Tunc cernebat ille palatium. Tecta ejus erant tecta aureis clypeis."</p>
                  <p>"Then he beheld a palace. The roof of it was covered with golden ſhields."</p>
                  <p>We are likewiſe told, that Eger, a Daniſh Nobleman, once vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the Gods, on which occaſion Odin had ranged through the hall ſwords of ſuch amazing brilliancy, as to make any other illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination needleſs, and had covered the walls with glittering ſhields.</p>
                  <p>(23) I doubt not that many of our modern belles will be ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this diſguſting preſent of Ildegerte. But, let them revert to thoſe rude ages, in which barbariſm was extolled as virtue, and delicacy of ſentiment condemned as effeminacy.

                  <p>OH how bliſsful are the firſt enjoyments of pure love! how celeſtial the tranſports of rewarded fidelity! The heart, (which even in the intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gratified ambition, ſtill creates new wiſhes) calmly ſinks to reſt, ſeeming as if it could never feel another want, and as if the whim of fickle Fortune had bound with garlands each deceitful ball which paſſes over us. Rapturous viſion! To the feeling mortal life derives its only charm from thy deluſive richly-coloured images. And ſure 'tis in our power to prolong this ſweet illuſion till al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Death ſhall lead us from the arms of love to thoſe ſublimer joys, of which that we may be partakers, our Creator will beſtow upon us finer organs. Yes 'tis in our power; but heaven-born wiſdom only can convert the cloying ſameneſs of the embrace to a clear ſtream of ever-flowing bliſs. He who has devoted the day to his duties and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs

Wiſdom, will every evening find happineſs in the arms of his wife, and Love with bounteous hand will ſhed upon him from his horn unfaded flowers. But this ſoft harmony of ſouls will not be found in buſtling courts and ſplendid palaces. There all is diſſipation; even love is diſſipation; not the mild and grateful hour, which re-animates the faculties for Wiſdom's ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The firſt weeks that followed the ſolemnization of the nuptials flew upon the wings of Joy to the abode of Love, there to announce the happineſs and gratitude of the young couple. Banquets, tournaments, and feſtive dances had their daily turn. From far and near haſtened the flower of Knighthood to the gay metropolis. All crowded to the throne of the fair Queen, and he, who had but once ſeen Ildegerte ſmile, returned contented to his home, feaſting on the fond anticipation of relating to his grand-children the happy times of his youth. What a lovely being! what a faſcinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweetneſs animated every word and look of the young Queen! There was not a heart which ſhe did not ſubdue. When ſome talkative old man deſcribed to her the length and breadth of his whole life (intereſting to him alone), when, as he ſpoke, his youthful fire once more inſpired him, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037753_0105_100F27124DBAEC50"/>
ſparkled in his ſunken eye, Ildegerte liſtened with modeſt attention and without interruption, as if the relation contained all that was amuſing and inſtructive. The old man departed, extolling her—"The Queen is an excellent woman; ſhe reveres old age."</p>
                  <p>When ſome old Knight's good wife, bleſſed by Heaven with more children than underſtanding, ſat at her ſide, yawning and lending only half an ear to the recital of battles and atchievements, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte ſoon knew how to looſe her tongue. She aſked after her ſons and daughters, received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in houſehold management, and in idea viſited the kitchen. The wife, well pleaſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at evening to her huſband, and exlaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—</p>
                  <p>"Our Queen is an excellent woman, mindful of what ſhe was, and what ſhe is!"</p>
                  <p>When the young jocund couples ſkimmed through the mazy dance, and, forgetting amid their pleaſure the etiquette of Court, made the air tremble with their exclamations, Ildegerte joined them, and far from correcting their playful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry by regal pomp, ſhe left a leſſon to one of the beſt of princes, who in later years ſucceeded to the crown of Denmark<note n="1">
                        <p>FREDERIC the Second, King of Denmark, when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tired of court-formality, uſed to ſay—
"The King's from home."</p>
                        <p>In a moment every one gave way to uncontrolled amuſements; but as ſoon as Frederic exclaimed—
"The King's returned."</p>
                        <p>The whole Court was at once reinſtated within the bounds of etiquette.</p>
                     </note>, that one may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037753_0106_100F271562F595C0"/>
deſcend from the throne, and enjoy a ſcene of momentary deception, which ſeems to recal the golden age of Saturn.—The young couples retired, loudly and unanimouſly declaring—</p>
                  <p>"Our Queen is an excellent woman; ſhe ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the grandeur of the crown!"</p>
                  <p>None of her perfections eſcaped the watchful eye of Theodoric. He roſe each morning with an ardent wiſh for evening, which was again to bring him to her arms. None of her charms eſcaped the jealous eye of Harold. He threw himſelf each evening on his couch more out of humour, and greeted each morning with a freſh curſe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Harold ſtill poſſeſſed ſufficient power to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due this increaſing paſſion, let Meiners, the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, decide, who probably on ſome cold win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's day, ſat at his deſk in a room without a fire, and while, with the apathy of a ſtoic, he proved to us "that it was in every one's power to fall in love or not,"<note n="2"> For the attempt to explain this abſurd doctrine, ſee Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's fantaſtic publication, entitled, "Vermiſchte Philoſophiſche Schriften."</note> forgot that the image of unhappy conſequences, which, according to his doctrine, we ought to paint to ourſelves, never is ſo ſtrong and lively in our ſouls as the proſpect of bliſs, which we hope to enjoy in the poſſeſſion of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object.</p>
                  <p>Harold did not ſubdue his paſſion, nor did he
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037753_0107_100F27178737A418"/>
wiſh to ſubdue it. It was no longer love alone that tortured him, but luſt, ambition, envy, and vexation. He curſed Chance and Fate (two words which with him had but one meaning) for having caſt him ſo near the throne, and yet robbed him of the power to mount it.</p>
                  <p>"Was I aſked," ſaid he, "when I came into the world, what character I would aſſume? am I to blame becauſe my mother was not a peaſant's daughter? This burning thirſt for ſame would then have been confined to the ſuperior cultivation of my little farm; more numerous herds, more productive land, more fruitful trees than thoſe of my neighbours, would have been the height of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold's wiſhes. Some good honeſt wench had ſhared my hard bed, and labour would have choked the ſeeds of ambition, ſown by Nature in my reſtleſs ſoul. What am I now? A miſerable medium between dignity and meanneſs, a fort of chief ſlave to the throne, a hanger-on to increaſe the ſplendour of the Court; a moſt obedient ſervant to receive the gueſts, and drink their healths. By Heaven, I will no longer play this ſorry part! Thus, or thus ſhall it be! Flows not in my veins the ſame princely blood to which Theodoric is obliged for empire? Were not my anceſtors Kings? Is it my fault, that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037753_0108_100F27190DF808D8"/>
one of them was ſuch a fool as to make a voluntary reſignation of his crown, that he might retire to ſolitude, as he ſaid, to ſerve the Gods, or, as his cotemporaries ſay, to lament his folly? Could he, by this renunciation, defraud his poſterity of their rights? No truly. Every throne is built upon the right of the ſtronger, though we pretend to fancy that we hold it by the grace of God. Give me a well-trained army, and a teeming treaſury—I'll prove my right to the dominion of half the globe."</p>
                  <p>Theſe principles ſoon gave birth to a ſcheme, which could only ſprout and ripen in a ſoul ſo baſe. The crafty villain knew full well that a feeling heart may know want even amidſt piles of wealth, and in the bittereſt poverty never can be truly wretched: hence the infernal project, founded on Theodoric's fickle diſpoſition, to rob him of his peace of mind, together with his throne.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile a year paſſed away in bliſsful uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The eyes of Harold often ſpoke with a wild tenderneſs; Theodoric perceived it not, and Ildegerte ſeemed not to perceive it. She would not mortify the man who was her huſband's friend; ſhe would not, by diſdain, make him doubly feel the hardſhip of his lot. And woe be to you, Oh women! who diſmiſs the man with contempt,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037753_0109_100F271AC5EC01A8"/>
that, without intending it, has ſwallowed poiſon from your charms. You have a thouſand other means, within the bounds which you yourſelves have choſen, to keep him at a reſpectful diſtance; you have a thouſand antidotes to cure him of his folly: but ſcorn and contempt betray a childiſh pride, and an unpoliſhed mind.</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte always acted with the mildneſs of the dove, and cunning of the ſerpent. She received the Prince at all times with a friendly cheerful air, and never courted or avoided an opportunity of being left alone with him. Whenever, on theſe occaſions, the converſation aſſumed by diſtant hints a dubious meaning, ſhe underſtood ſo well how to bend to the direct road, that ſhe often, without confuſion, checked the avowal, which already floated on the Prince's lips. When he gazed at her with ſilent tenderneſs, ſhe never caſt her eyes upon the earth, but looked directly in his face with the mien of virtuous ſimplicity, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects nothing criminal.</p>
                  <p>Harold was forced to confeſs that ſhe was not thus to be obtained, and that the look of artleſs innocence bound the ſeducer's tongue with heavier chains, than the oſtentatious virtue, which will have its merits acknowledged and reſpected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:037753_0110_100F271D761B93E8"/>
The roſes now bloomed a ſecond time, ſince the happieſt couple in the North had aſcended the throne, when Ildegerte bore a ſon, the image of his mother. His firſt infantile ſmiles were a new and more powerful tie, the ſtrongeſt which Nature has woven to bind tender hearts together. With a tear of joy, Theodoric received the dear pledge of love from the nurſe's hand. With the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate ſolicitude, he ſat throughout the firſt nights at Ildegerte's bed, angry at every fly that dared to interrupt her ſlumbers. Town and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhared the father's happineſs, and hailed, with feſtive joy, the birth of the young prince. Harold alone ſaw in this boy the robber of a diadem, which, as he thought, was formed to grace his brow; and on the day that a whole nation formed the pleaſing hope of ſeeing the virtues of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother flouriſh in young Haldan, (thus the Prince was called) he alone locked himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his palace, under pretence of indiſpoſition, which hindered his appearance at Court; for he was wiſe enough to know, how great would be the contraſt between his woeful viſage, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral happineſs, as well as how dangerous to his ſchemes might be ſome courtier's eye, which had penetration enough to fathom the bottom of his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037753_0111_100F271FAC476B30"/>
heart. But while Court, town, and country paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral weeks in glad feſtivity, he did not ſpend his time in idleneſs.</p>
                  <p>At Canfried's death, the crown of Sweden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to Hermanfried, his brother, an impetuous youth, whoſe temper was eaſily rouſed, and who was only reſtrained from many an act of folly by his gentle ſiſter Luitgardis, yet ſcarce ſeventeen years of age. Long had he obſerved with jealous eye the increaſing power of Denmark; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of his brother, with whom fell the flower of Sweden's warriors, had reduced his kingdom to a ſtate of impotence, and for the preſent bound his hands. Harold became acquainted, through his ſpies, with this young monarch's views, and failed not as a malecontent to furniſh him with projects, which were eagerly caught at. He offered him his ſervices and aſſiſtance, repreſented Denmark as an eaſy conqueſt, and propoſed to accept the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered crown as a foedary to Sweden. He was lucky enough to perſuade Hermanfried, who now made preparations for attack, while Theodoric careleſsly repoſed in the lap of peace.</p>
                  <p>But you would deceive yourſelf, good reader, if you imagined that the villain's propoſals to Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manfried were his real purpoſe; he only wiſhed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037753_0112_100F2721D001AFD0"/>
to plunge his country into a difficulty, from which it could not be extricated but by a mighty blow, and this blow was to hit Theodoric's heart.</p>
                  <p>All being ſettled to his wiſh, he, one morning, with downcaſt look and clouded forehead, entered the King's chamber.</p>
                  <p>"I bring you bad news," commenced he.</p>
                  <p>"Well, thanks to Fate for it," anſwered the King. "He who is too happy, eaſily becomes preſumptuous. Let me hear it."</p>
                  <p>"Hermanfried, King of Sweden," rejoined he, "is arming againſt you."</p>
                  <p>"Is that all?" ſaid Theodoric.</p>
                  <p>"All!" replied the Prince, "and enough as I think."</p>
                  <p>"I thought," proceeded the King," the Swedes were ſtill ſufficiently employed in healing the wounds inflicted by my ſword, when Canfried reigned. At all events their rage is but the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſcarce recovered foe, who dares to cope with his ſound antagoniſt."</p>
                  <p>"Even were it ſo," returned Harold, "poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy forbids us to deſpiſe a weaker foe. But my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is far different. Hermanfried, (as the ſpies whom I ſent out inform me), cannot brook
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037753_0113_100F2723DA9F8958"/>
the diſgrace ſuſtained by Sweden in his brother's reign. He is reſolved to waſh it away with blood, and conſcious of his own inability, has bound to his intereſt the princes of Tartary, Novagorod, Tiver, Aſtracan, and Caſan, part of whom have joined him as zealous allies, and the reſt lent him their armies for a large ſum. It is likewiſe agreed among them, that the confederate troops ſhall be allowed to plunder, murder, rob, and raviſh through the vanquiſhed realms, that all the booty as well as your royal treaſure ſhall be ſhared among the Tartarian princes, and your ſubjects be doomed to wear their chains, Ildegerte alone excepted, whom Hermanfried, to avenge his brother's death, intends to be devoured, in ſight of his ſubjects, by wild beaſts."</p>
                  <p>"Arrogant wretch!" cried Theodoric; "he may force the way to her through my breaſt."</p>
                  <p>"And will too," anſwered the Prince. "I confeſs that Harold trembles for the ſafety of your throne."</p>
                  <p>"Haſte then!" exclaimed the King. "Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect my whole force on the borders of Sweden; I myſelf will lead them to battle."</p>
                  <p>"Collect your whole force!" repeated Harold, ſhrugging his ſhoulders; "it amounts not to the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037753_0114_100F27260B4E7090"/>
tenth part of the armies combined againſt you. A conqueror, (as you well know) earns not his laurels without loſs. The defeat of Canfried coſt us many a hero's life. Many a hardy veteran was ſent to Valhall, and men do not grow like muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms."</p>
                  <p>"Give me your counſel then," rejoined Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric; "ſhall I avert the evil by my treaſures?"</p>
                  <p>"A mode unworthy of you," ſaid the Prince; "beſides, (as may, without the gift of prophecy, be eaſily foreſeen) of the worſt conſequences. It would betray our weakneſs, and Hermanfried will be revenged. His rage is not to be appeaſed by gold. I have already told you, he reſigns the booty to the Tartars."</p>
                  <p>"Let us then ſeek allies," returned Theodoric.</p>
                  <p>"Where? whom?" demanded Harold.</p>
                  <p>"Among the German Princes," anſwered he.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! they live in eternal diſcord with each other," replied Harold. "There every petty Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron is an abſolute Prince, who, from the turrets of his caſtle bids defiance to the boors, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes his wife and family by pillage and road-rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries."</p>
                  <p>"Well then, among the Britons," ſaid Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:037753_0115_100F2728B0166108"/>
"Yes," rejoined the Prince, "if the danger did not already beat at your door. The Britons are at too great a diſtance, and what intereſt could they have in venturing their troops acroſs the ocean, to aſſiſt a foreign nation, with whom they never were allied?"</p>
                  <p>"Speak then!" cried the King, in a tone of diſtreſs, "What muſt I do? Sacrifice all to the fury of the foe without defence?"</p>
                  <p>Harold pauſed.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! why," proceeded he at length, "did Fate combine ſo many amiable qualities in Ildegerte, and refuſe her the title of a king's daughter?"</p>
                  <p>"Kinſman," returned Theodoric, "your ideas make ſtrange ſprings."</p>
                  <p>"Not at all," anſwered he; "they unite very naturally. Were Ildegerte the daughter of ſiſter of a mighty Prince we ſhould not be ſtanding here, and puzzling where to look for an alliance."</p>
                  <p>"True!" ſaid the King, ſtruck with the truth of the obſervation.</p>
                  <p>"And had not my kinder couſin ſcorned the counſel of ſtate policy," continued Harold, "he might now, by a tender tie, have founded the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his ſubjects; he might, by a ſingle word,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037753_0116_100F272A36E68508"/>
have cauſed the uplifted hand to ſink, and ſent the threatening falchion to its ſcabbard.</p>
                  <p>"And what may this word be?" aſked he.</p>
                  <p>"I know from certain information," rejoined Harold, "that Hermanfried would not object, by a marriage between his ſiſter and the King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, to unite the Northern realms in friendly compact."</p>
                  <p>"His ſiſter!" repeated Theodoric, ſomewhat confuſed; "I ſcarce knew he had a ſiſter."</p>
                  <p>"A lovely girl," returned the villain, "who has ſcarce ſeen ſeventeen ſummers: Luitgardis is her name."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" anſwered the King. "And you can think that Canfried's brother (who, as you ſay, breathes nought but vengeance) would be willing to throw a girl, ſuch as you deſcribe Luitgardis to be, into the arms of his enemy?"</p>
                  <p>"I believe he would," anſwered Harold. "There is a certain anecdote in circulation at the Swediſh Court. Your picture (Heaven knows how) fell into the hands of the Princeſs; and, ſince that time, 'tis whiſpered the good creature of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeems quite loſt in contemplation, courts ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in ſhady groves, and has poſitively refuſed the hand of many a mighty prince. Nay, they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037753_0117_100F272C625F2DD8"/>
even pretend to have heard from one of her attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, that ſhe wears the much-loved picture ſet in diamonds near her heart, and often wets it with a tear."</p>
                  <p>Theodoric felt his vanity flattered.</p>
                  <p>"Were this true," replied he, "I ſhould pity her."</p>
                  <p>"Now you will eaſily perceive," continued Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold, "why Hermanfried, who loves his ſiſter moſt ſincerely, and to whom the ſufferings of her heart can be no ſecret, would renounce his thoughts of vengeance to ſee Luitgardis happy."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, plain enough," rejoined Theodoric, confuſed.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed," proceeded the Prince, "I have been privately given to underſtand—but I rejected it."</p>
                  <p>"Speak! what?" demanded the King.</p>
                  <p>"That you might, in order to ſpare the effuſion of blood, and the deſolation of your kingdoms, marry Luitgardis."</p>
                  <p>"Abſurd idea!" exclaimed he. "How is it poſſible? Is not Ildegerte—?"</p>
                  <p>"True. That was my anſwer," ſaid the crafty villain. "But they pretended that the welfare of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037753_0118_100F272F130A5BF0"/>
your ſtate might induce you to ſacrifice an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual for the public good."</p>
                  <p>"Never!" cried he.</p>
                  <p>"So I told them," replied Harold, "but they thought that you might ſweeten the ſeparation in a thouſand ways; that you might ſend her to her native country, eſtabliſh a Court for her under the title of Queen, and—but how can I recollect all the nonſenſe they fabricated to make the ſcheme practicable?"</p>
                  <p>"No!" exclaimed Theodoric. "Rather will I die in miſery, I and my people."</p>
                  <p>Harold, who now thought he had for this time done enough, as he plainly ſaw that the firſt ſpark, which he had careleſsly thrown, had already ſeized the cinders, that the gloomy frown of diſcontent and perplexity lowered upon Theodoric's brow, left to time the taſk of blowing it into a blaze, and finiſhed the diſcourſe by once more maliciouſly deſcribing the miſery which inevitably threatened him, if he did not ſeize the only thread that could guide him out of the labyrinth.</p>
                  <p>"True it is," ſaid he, ſhrugging his ſhoulders, "it requires but a couple of eyes, (even if they cannot penetrate ſo very far into futurity) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the iſſue of this bloody conteſt. You muſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037753_0119_100F273149DFD500"/>
deſcend from the throne of your forefathers, fly over the bodies of your ſubjects, and with difficulty ſave your life. But Ildegerte and your faithful Harold will every where accompany you. By the labour of our hands we will fertilize ſome deſert, and earn our daily morſel by the ſweat of the brow. And, when the ſpirits of the murdered Danes pour forth their curſes upon thee, when their blood cries for vengeance at the throne of Odin, Oh! may the infant Haldan's artleſs ſupplication bend the hearts of the Gods to thee again!"</p>
                  <p>With theſe words he left the weak Theodoric, in a perturbation which drove him to and fro like the crazy ſkiff upon the ſtormy main. Even the wreck of a world could not have moved him to an act of treachery, had the warmth of his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been the ſame as that which had inſpired him on the field of battle; but it muſt be owned that unmoleſted enjoyment had damped his ardour. A calm eſteem, (if not altogether devoid of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet conſcious of an undiſturbed poſſeſſion) was alone remaining in his breaſt. He already allowed himſelf many a little infidelity; he was able again to make compariſons between the charms of Ildegerte and of others: to be ſure he ſtill always found the former far ſuperior, but thought
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037753_0120_100F2732D1E23770"/>
the latter worth enjoyment. In ſhort, he was a weak young man, without command over any of his paſſions, and ſtill leſs ſo, when the crafty Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold always knew how to encourage and to ſatisfy them! Who but muſt have obſerved how dexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he attacked Theodoric's vanity? This mine was not the moſt ineffectual of all that he had ſprung. The gentle Luitgardis had never thought of falling in love with a picture. She was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly roving from one youthful pleaſure to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the very moment that Theodoric fancied her wan, wretched, and ſinking under the ſorrows of an unhappy attachment.</p>
                  <p>A few days elapſed. The report of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war ſpread far and wide. The danger was magnified by Harold's inſtigation, and the fate of the kingdom repreſented as hanging by a thread. Wherever the King turned his eye, it caught ſome gloomy ill-foreboding look. The people groaned and wept. The rich buried their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; the prieſts offered ſacrifice, and poured forth prayers both day and night.</p>
                  <p>In the midſt of theſe agonizing circumſtances, while Theodoric, with downcaſt head, was one morning meditating on his ſituation, his ſenators were announced. Bribed by the favourite in part
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037753_0121_100F2734EACCA658"/>
with words, in part with gold, they threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the feet of the King, and in the name of his miſerable ſubjects, claimed from him the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>"What muſt, what can I do?" ſaid he. "To convert ſtones into men is not in my power."</p>
                  <p>"Then you may at leaſt preſerve thoſe," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the chief ſenator, "who are now alive, who till the earth, and are the kingdom's chief ſupport."</p>
                  <p>"What do ye want of me?" demanded The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoric. "Is it I who wiſh to violate the peace?"</p>
                  <p>"No," anſwered the ſenator, "but you are he, who will not, by a trifling ſacrifice, ſecure it."</p>
                  <p>"What ſacrifice?" aſked he. "Name it."</p>
                  <p>"You know full well," rejoined the ſenator, "what price Hermanfried has ſet upon his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. He has fixed it as a dowry for his ſiſter."</p>
                  <p>"And call'ſt thou this a trifling ſacrifice?" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Theodoric.</p>
                  <p>"Trifling it is," ſaid he, "great as it may ſeem to you; trifling when compared with that far greater evil, which you will thereby avert. We ſtand here in the name of the people. We addreſs you not as father and as huſband! 'Tis the King to whom we fly for ſuccour. The peaſant prays for ſunſhine to uncloſe the ears of corn,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037753_0122_100F27372BB1A758"/>
even though here and there a bloſſom may be withered by the ſcorching beam."</p>
                  <p>"How!" cried he. "Could you vote for that noble being's baniſhment, to whom you ought to be grateful for an increaſe of your dignity?"</p>
                  <p>"'Tis this very gratitude," returned the ſenator, "which makes us cheriſh the fond hope that ſhe will not deſtroy her own good work. If the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of whole nations was the real motive of her glorious deeds, (and who among us dares to doubt it?) then may we certainly expect from Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte's elevated mind, that ſhe will comply with the wiſhes of the people, ſeeking her reward in the bleſſings of a reſcued nation, and truly ſeeking not in vain."</p>
                  <p>What could be urged againſt all this? Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, who already thought a ſeparation from Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte poſſible, who could reconcile this action to his fickle heart, by the ſpecious apology that he was but fulfilling the duties of a good king, and a father of his ſubjects; who had no fear of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic cenſure, ſince the nation had itſelf required this ſacrifice; who could only dread the voice of conſcience, which he lulled at pleaſure, and the voice of ſuffering innocence, which, far removed, might echo through the woods of Norway, but
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037753_0123_100F2739417E1C50"/>
never reach his ear.—What could you expect from ſuch a man? Strange it is that it ſhould ſeem to coſt him any pain, ſtrange that he did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conſent to all.</p>
                  <p>"Go, aſk the oracle. Its declaration ſhall be my deciſion."</p>
                  <p>With theſe words he left his ſenators, who, ſure of conqueſt, haſtened to the neighbouring temple, but too certain that the myſterious cloak, which ever ſhrouded the meaning of the oracle, would allow them to explain it as they pleaſed. After having placed a coſtly preſent on the altar, the prieſt began the ceremonies. His diſtorted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, his briſtling hair, his rolling eyes, and foaming mouth announced the preſence of the God. At length, inſpired by Odin, he addreſſed them thus:</p>
                  <p>"Before my eyes appear two Queens. This bears in her hand a ſword, and that a branch of palm. The ſerpent, which Theodoric cheriſhes in his boſom, ſhall be cruſhed by Ildegerte's foot."</p>
                  <p>With this unintelligible jargon, the ſenators contentedly departed.</p>
                  <p>"What can be more evident," ſaid one to the other, "than that the Godhead ſanctions our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? Two Queens! How can there be two,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037753_0124_100F273B5AE8AC00"/>
if Luitgardis be not underſtood as one? She who bears the ſword is Ildegerte, becauſe ſhe gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the ſtrife. She who bears the branch of palm is the Swediſh Princeſs, becauſe ſhe brings us golden peace."</p>
                  <p>The ſerpent in the King's boſom was the moſt knotty point to be explained, but even this they contrived to effect.</p>
                  <p>"The ſerpent," ſaid they, "ſignifies the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born oppoſition of Theodoric to the wiſhes of his people; and if Ildegerte willingly ſubmit to her fate, certainly ſhe may be ſaid to cruſh the ſerpent. Never ſurely was there a decree leſs capable of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation. 'Tis clear to the meaneſt capacity. A child may diſcover the ſenſe ſo plainly conveyed."</p>
                  <p>Thus they cheerfully returned to the palace, and announced the fixed reſolves of Fate; to which the King had given his ſolemn promiſe that he would ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>"Who can oppoſe the Gods?" ſaid he, after a pauſe. "I am reſolved. I give my people peace, perhaps to be in everlaſting war with myſelf."</p>
                  <p>Harold wiſhed no more. Before the wavering King had leiſure to recant, ambaſſadors were with the utmoſt ſecrecy diſpatched to Sweden, to ſue for the hand of Luitgardis. They returned in a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037753_0125_100F273D7B891E90"/>
a few weeks with the wiſhed-for anſwer, that, on this condition, Hermanfried was willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an agreement of eternal peace. Now the firſt ſtep was taken. To retreat would be ſtill more to exaſperate a formidable foe. Nothing therefore remained but to ſwim with the current. A ſecond embaſſy ſoon followed, veſted with full powers to ſettle the preliminaries of dowry and of jointure.</p>
                  <p>Who does not at once perceive the road which Harold was paving for himſelf by all theſe machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? Ildegerte, incenſed to the utmoſt by treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which, her proud heart will every moment whiſper to her, ſhe ſo little merits; Ildegerte, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of her huſband, together with a throne, will thirſt for vengeance, will ſeek an inſtrument to execute it, and in the Prince will find what her galled ambition and her ſlighted love require. To wound this ambition and love beyond all power of cure, ſhe muſt be witneſs of her rival's triumph. For this purpoſe, he perſuaded the king, (who, ſince the irrevocable acquieſcence, had been whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a vortex of perpetual agony, and was eaſily perſuaded to do any thing) not to remove Ildegerte from the Court till Luitgardis was approaching the gates of his metropolis.</p>
                  <p>"For," ſaid he, "how eaſily may any unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037753_0126_100F27409759FB48"/>
event—a ſtorm for inſtance, or a ſudden ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rob you of your bride; then would you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſs of one, without finding comfort and conſolation in the other."</p>
                  <p>To all this Theodoric conſented. Unpleaſant things we are ever willing to defer, and ſtill was the thought of loſing Ildegerte painful to his heart. The arrival of the Princeſs too (if this parting were deferred till then), might diſſipate his ſorrows, which he never could expect to be the caſe, while left in ſolitude to the agonies of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>All therefore ripened according to Harold's wiſh, and he reſigned himſelf entirely to the flattering hope of ſhortly reaping the harveſt of his labours.</p>
                  <p>As yet Ildegerte had not learnt a ſyllable of the dark deſigns which an infernal villain was meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt her peace. She reſigned herſelf entirely to the charming novelty of a mother's joys, and ſpent her time chiefly in playing with little Haldan as he ſat upon her lap, feaſting her eye and ear with the ſmile and liſp of infancy. The King was cautious not to interrupt her pleaſing dream of happineſs, and Harold had taken care to ſurround her by his creatures, that ſhe might have no ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion till a proper time. But now that he received intelligence of Luitgardis's approach, he thought
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037753_0127_100F2742A481DB10"/>
it right at once to unveil the infamous deſign. He viſited Ildegerte, and contrived to mingle ſo much of the myſterious in his words and looks, to imitate ſo well the mien of confuſion which in vain attempts concealment, that, at laſt, the Queen could not forbear to aſk—</p>
                  <p>"Why ſo reſerved to-day, Prince? Whence the cloud which hangs upon your brow?"</p>
                  <p>"Venture not, Oh Queen! to break that cloud!" replied he ſignificantly: "A flaſh might dart from it which would annihilate you."</p>
                  <p>"Would you try," ſaid Ildegerte ſmiling, "whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am but a woman to be frightened by mere words?"</p>
                  <p>"Words!" repeated he. "Yes, words, of which one would drive this ſmile of ſweet content for ever from your countenance."</p>
                  <p>"Then let me hear this one terrific word," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe. "You know that he who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the full extent of his misfortunes, is far leſs to be pitied than he who ſtands in doubt upon the brink of an abyſs, the near approach to which he has been left to gueſs."</p>
                  <p>Here Harold ſeemed as if he tried in vain to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>"No—impoſſible—not from my lips—pardon
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037753_0128_100F27442CFC3088"/>
—I have no utterance for black ingratitude and perfidy."</p>
                  <p>"You make me uneaſy, Prince," rejoined Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degerte. "What ſtroke of Fate can reach me in the arms of love? The King too has for ſeveral weeks ſeemed troubled and confuſed. Tell me what misfortune—Has Ildegerte unknowingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him?"</p>
                  <p>"How could Ildegerte!" exclaimed he, "the crown of womankind, afford melancholy a pretext to lower upon Theodoric's forehead? No. You have not offended him, yet will he doom the beſt of wives to miſery unutterable."</p>
                  <p>"Me!" cried Ildegerte. "Impoſſible!"</p>
                  <p>"But too true," returned Harold.—"Alas! Beauty, merit, and virtue muſt bind every heart in chains, but even beauty, merit, and virtue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold the fickle libertine in ſilken bonds for ever. Inexpreſſible are the ſervices you have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the ſtate. Your amiable qualities are the admiration of a whole nation, and exalt you far above the crown you wear. Why was the firſt of mortals made a prey to the wanton levity of a voluptuous traitor?"</p>
                  <p>"Hold, Prince," interrupted ſhe.—"You go too far. Juſtify your words."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:037753_0129_100F2745B7FD86D0"/>
"You deſire it," anſwered he, "and I obey. Hear then, and comprehend (if with your good heart you can) a villany moſt diabolical. You were a Queen: forget that! I know you. Still will you remain a Queen, if not upon the throne, yet in the hearts of all who love you. You were a wife: forget that too! 'Twas all a dream. Awake. You are a mother: never forget that! What has the guiltleſs ſuckling done, that he ſhould be robbed of his rightful inheritance by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's infamy? Who will protect him, if his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too forſake him?"</p>
                  <p>"Now by the golden ſhields of Odin,"<note n="3">Golden ſhields of Odin and Aſgard. See note 22.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Ildegerte, "never was oracle delivered in the groves of Aſgard<note n="4"> Golden ſhields of Odin and Aſgard. See note 22.</note> more obſcure. I was a Queen! I was a wife! When did I ceaſe to be ſo?"</p>
                  <p>"Since Theodoric," replied the Prince, "glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with bliſs, infernally reſolved to caſt you from his throne and bed. Since he ſent ambaſſadors to Hermanfried, to conclude an everlaſting union, and the knot which forms this union is Luitgardis, ſiſter of the King. Know you enough? Or will you drain the teeming cup of wormwood at a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle draught? Since he promiſed to ſend Ildegerte, to whom he is obliged for a kingdom—Ildegerte,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037753_0130_100F27E505A622F0"/>
the mother of his firſt-born ſon, an exile in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to Norway, but not till ſhe has witneſſed the triumphal coronation of her rival:"</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte—</p>
                  <p>But why need I deſcribe the broken accents of anger, aſtoniſhment, and indignation, the heavy ſighs of horror, diſcarded tenderneſs, and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affection? At the firſt moment, while her mind was unacquainted with a perfidy to which ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could nor would give credit; at the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuch an action ſeemed to her as monſtrous as to the poliſhed European the account of people, who in cool blood raiſe their clubs to ſend their aged parents to the grave. She believed not the Prince's words; but Harold ſwore ſo ſolemnly, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo many corroborations, now pointing out to her the increaſing coldneſs of Theodoric, now the preparations at Court, which betrayed the approach of ſome great feſtival, (and which indeed had not eſcaped her eye, though they had too little occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied her exalted mind to force from her an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive queſtion) connecting proof to proof ſo art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and making her imperceptibly extract ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion from her huſband's every look, that he at length planted in her ſoul the dreadful certainty of her impending fate. The unhappy being riveted
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037753_0131_100F27E6D99072E8"/>
her eyes upon the earth, unable to ſhed a ſingle tear, or form a reſolution, and ſcarcely retaining her ſenſes. This was the ſituation which Harold had awaited; upon this firſt ſtupor he had formed his plan.</p>
                  <p>"You perceive, Oh Queen!" proceeded the hypocrite, "that I am hazarding my life by diſcloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you a ſecret at which the King himſelf trembles. But long have you known how little I regard my happineſs and life, if Fate will but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to reſign them in your ſervice. Difficult it is to counteract Theodoric's infidelity, but not impoſſible. Rouſe your courage; I have many friends, and your Amazons are ready at the firſt ſignal to aſſiſt and to avenge you. Summon them to arms; graſp again the ſword which already has atchieved ſuch wondrous deeds; preſs on your head the helm of valiant Swend, (alas! he would not thus have treated you!) redeem a crown for little Haldan, which by primogeniture is his; drive the villain, together with the creature for whoſe ſake he baniſhes an Ildegerte, drive them into deſerved miſery, and mount the throne. My arm, and a thouſand arms, at my command, are prepared to draw their ſabres in your cauſe. My voice ſhall be the ſignal for revolt. Beneath your
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037753_0132_100F27EA6DF64410"/>
banners ſhall Harold perform miracles, and at your ſide will he mount the throne, or die."</p>
                  <p>"No, Prince," replied ſhe. "Far be from me ſuch conduct. True it is, you ſee my tears, nor am I able to reſtrain them; but think not that they flow for the ideal loſs of a crown, which, in the intoxication of his tranſports, Theodoric once forced me to accept: they flow for the loſs of a heart which was far dearer to me than the pomp of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal dignity; and if by arms I could recover this, what ſhould I thereby gain in his heart? No. I have no arms againſt Theodoric but my tears."</p>
                  <p>"Virtue overſtrained," ſaid Harold, "dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates into a fault; you forget that we are not debating on you and on your rights. If you ſink to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day beneath your weakneſs, you are preparing for yourſelf the bittereſt reproaches from a ſon. His fortunes now depend on your's, and his rights they are, which (if you feel the ſacred impulſe of a mother's duties) you muſt defend by arms. Or, do you chuſe that he ſhould beg his life hereafter at the mercy of your rival's children?"</p>
                  <p>"You ſtorm my heart in vain," rejoined Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte. "If Haldan do not inherit any throne from his mother, ſtill may he feel content in virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037753_0133_100F27EC813E34F0"/>
ſenſations, to plant which early in his boſom is the moſt ſacred of a mother's duties."</p>
                  <p>"Your ideas," anſwered Harold—"pardon me, beauteous Queen—your ideas have mounted to a better world, and you appear to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that you are ſtill an inhabitant of this our earth, on which they never can be realized. I leave you, for your preſent diſpoſition favours not the plan of cool, clear-ſighted judgment. I am convinced that the miſt, which ſeems to dim your eyes, will ſoon diſperſe. You will not bear the thought of being a mark for the deriſion of your rival. Till then, farewell," continued he, ſeizing Ildegerte's hand, and tenderly preſſing it, "fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well! and reſt aſſured that Harold, whoſe fidelity has long been known to you, will hazard his life a thouſand times for a ſingle tender look from you."</p>
                  <p>He went, and left Ildegerte in a ſituation which my pen would in vain attempt to deſcribe. A co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious flood of tears relieved her aching heart; ſhe threw herſelf into the arms of her faithful Helga, and was again able to weep and to complain.</p>
                  <p>"Fate then deſtined two powerful Kings to be my huſband, only that one might be torn from me ere I had poſſeſſed him, and that I might by the other be diſgracefully baniſhed, to lament in ſome
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037753_0134_100F27EE1A4C6C00"/>
lone deſert an attachment, the firſt enjoyment of which I have ſo dearly bought."</p>
                  <p>A thouſand projects ſtarted in her brain. At one time ſhe reſolved to throw herſelf at Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric's feet, and ſue for his affection, or death by his hand. At another, ſhe determined to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, with the dignity of injured virtue, to raiſe repentance in his boſom, and then to turn her back upon him with diſdain. But ſhe ever firmly rejected Helga's well-meant counſel, who with all her rhetoric ſupported Harold's plan.</p>
                  <p>"We can at leaſt," thought ſhe, "thereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the King, and from his fears obtain what his love denies."</p>
                  <p>"No," ſaid Ildegerte, "I require juſtice from his heart. If it be denied at that tribunal, I will be ſilent till we ſtand before the Higheſt Judge. Then, then will Ildegerte—pardon him!"</p>
                  <p>"Be ſilent!" repeated Helga. "What, even when the arrogant deriſion of a triumphant rival rends your heart!"</p>
                  <p>"No, Helga," anſwered Ildegerte, "I will not be a witneſs of her triumph. She ſhall not feaſt upon my agonies, nor ſhall the King. I am reſolved. In my boſom will I hide the dreadful ſecret, and at Court, where all are liars, my
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037753_0135_100F27F045C45950"/>
countenance ſhall likewiſe be a liar. With a ſmile will I appear at table; with a ſmile will I preſent the cup, and wiſh good night to him. With ſtedfaſt ſtep will I quit the ſaloon, diſguiſe myſelf in the habit of a ſlave, and fly of my own accord to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way's woods, that on the day which crowns his ſecond love, he may at leaſt miſs the triumph of beholding Ildegerte's tears. Haſte, dear Helga! Mount my ſteed, take as much of my treaſures as ſeems needful to you; haſte to the ſea ſhore, and buy a veſſel, which may be ready at my ſignal to bear me from theſe hated ſhores back to my unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed country, there to dwell with far more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed mortals."</p>
                  <p>By this reſolution ſhe abided, in deſpite of all the endeavours uſed by Helga to point out an eaſier remedy.</p>
                  <p>"You try in vain," ſaid Ildegerte, "to deceive me thus with ſhadows. By what other means can I ſave myſelf from the diſgrace, and aſſert thoſe ſentiments which ever were my pride? Shall I at his feet implore his love? or am I, by a huſband's infidelity, juſtified in forgetting that this huſband is my King? No. Let him alone bear the whole burden of a tainted conſcience. Far be the wiſh from me to ſhare it with him! But thou, Helga,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037753_0136_100F27F368B858D0"/>
faithful companion of my happier youth, and of my ſhort-lived dignity, wilt thou too reſign the pleaſures of a Court to follow into miſery a baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretch?"</p>
                  <p>Helga wept upon her boſom, ſwore eternal friendſhip and fidelity, and haſtened to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preparations for the ſecret flight. In a few days ſhe returned to the Queen with the happy tidings, that in a bay which was ſurrounded by the wood, a veſſel ready to ſail awaited her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p>WEAK Theodoric! thou wert not born to be a villain. The mine yielded not the iron in a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's ſhape, but hateful paſſions forged a dagger from it. Virtue has already left thy heart, yet is it leſs worthy of deteſtation than compaſſion. For what ſenſations had we given thee credit, if thy heart had ſtill remained a temple of virtue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with wiſdom and with love!</p>
                  <p>Do you ſee the reed ſhaken by the wind? Do you ſee him ſleepleſs, and envying the trabant,<note n="5">Trabant, the name given to the yeomen of the guard in the Northern Courts.</note> who, ſupported by a quiet conſcience more than by his halberd, nods at the palace-gate? Round
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037753_0137_100F27F587C14678"/>
him refreſhing ſleep had rocked all nature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He alone—the King, who fears no judge (that excepted who aſſerts the rights of virtue in his breaſt with unrelenting rigour) he alone rambles from room to room. The ſilken couch alleviates not the tortures of his conſcience; he gazes through the open window. Before him glitters the evening ſtar, which lighted once the flowery path of love when he conducted Ildegerte to the bridal chamber. Alas! then a tear of bliſs ſtood in the eye of the tranſported bridegroom, and the ſtar of love ſparkled therein with pleaſure. Now a cloud of ſad repentant tears hung heavily before his ſight; throughout his realms night was the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of repoſe—to him alone the meſſenger of reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated torment. The Court, the chaſe, the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, no longer diſſipated care—all, all was horror. Oh Solitude! thou ſmiling friend of Wiſdom, how terrific art thou to the wicked!</p>
                  <p>Such a night it was, that, overpowered by his feelings, Theodoric ruſhed from his room, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the irreſiſtible impulſe of his heart, which drew him to Ildegerte. By chance, the trabant, who guarded the chamber of the King, had ſunk under fatigue, and did not even wake at the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den opening of the folding doors. It is difficult,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037753_0138_100F27F71083BCC8"/>
during ſelf-ſuffering, to behold another's peace with pleaſure, and if the ſufferer be a King, he will generally become a tyrant.—The enraged The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoric ſeized the trabant, and ſhook him violently. The wretch ſtaggered, rubbed his eyes, and by the glare of lamps, which burned in the hall of the palace, beheld, with dread aſtoniſhment, the King before him.</p>
                  <p>"What!" cried the furious Theodoric, "dareſt thou then leave thy Monarch's life a prey to the firſt murderer, who is bold enough to creep under cover of darkneſs to his bed? Out of my ſight! thy life is forfeited! The riſing ſun ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee with the living!"</p>
                  <p>The trembling trabant fell upon his knees, and ſaid—</p>
                  <p>"Oh may the King hear me, and the man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me! I have a dear wife and ſeven young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; they daily call for bread, and, Sire, you know our allowance is but ſmall. Compelled by want, I bound myſelf for three days' labour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my wife and little ones, and ploughed the earth for ſcanty wages. I returned from work laſt night weary, but with a ſack of bread; I ſatisfied my children, and expected to have ſlept in my wife's arms. But the lot, Oh King! fell upon
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037753_0139_100F27F92ED067D0"/>
me to guard your royal chamber. I was obliged to come, and having been at labour for three days, and known but little reſt, ſleep overpowered me. I have forfeited my life, but throw myſelf upon your clemency, not for the ſake of this ſcar earned in your ſervice; but Oh! have mercy on my wife! have mercy on my helpleſs children!"</p>
                  <p>"Thou happy man!" muttered the reſtleſs King between his teeth, "how willingly would I ſay to thee, let us exchange ſituations. Come, throw thyſelf upon my ſilken couch; give me thy hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd, and in thy ſtead let me lean againſt the wall, ſinking to reſt with the ſweet conviction of having done my duty.—Riſe!" proceeded he aloud, "I pardon thee! Go to thy wife, I have no need of thee—I am the guardian of you all. Go home, and teach thy children to pray for their King."</p>
                  <p>He ſpoke, and wandered to the Queen's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with uncertain ſteps, tapped gently at the door, opened it with trembling hand, entered with tottering knees, and eyes which ſhunned the light. It was the very night that Ildegerte, for ever to eſcape the unmerited diſgrace, had determined to forſake the palace. She was reclining on a couch, with her face turned towards the window, waiting for the riſing moon, in order, by the aſſiſtance of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037753_0140_100F27FC0A1B20B0"/>
her light, to find the neighbouring bay, in which was concealed the ſhip that was to bear her from the coaſt of Denmark. At her feet ſat the faithful Helga; both were ſilent, both loſt in a labyrinth of ſorrowful reflections. Hark! Something was heard without the door! Now it ceaſed again—now it ſeemed to be retreating—now it returned, and the door was gently opened.</p>
                  <p>"The King!" cried Helga, ſtarting as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized his features.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately a dim lamp caſt but faint rays upon the couch, and ſpread a kind of twilight over Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte's glowing cheeks.—Theodoric too dared not to look at her, but riveting his eye upon the ground, obſerved not her confuſion.</p>
                  <p>"My huſband!" commenced ſhe, with a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dread that he had been apprized of her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "Whence ſo late at night?"</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, my love," ſaid he, "a frightful dream has forced me from my bed. Methought as you were laying in my arms, you were torn from me; I wiſhed to reſcue you—I wiſhed to riſe, and haſten after you, but could not. I felt my arms confined by infrangible chains—I heard your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and reproaches. I raged—I foamed, and yet the more I rouſed my ſtrength to burſt my
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037753_0141_100F27FE28A4D4B8"/>
fetters, the more, alas! was I confined by ſome inviſible power. I at laſt awoke: cold drops trickled from my forehead; I ſprung from my bed and haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened hither!"</p>
                  <p>"'T was but a dream," replied Ildegerte, "and ſuperſtition only ſeeks reality in ſhadows. How could you be thus alarmed? What can tear me from your arms as long as I am not torn from your heart?"</p>
                  <p>Theodoric only anſwered with a ſigh. He crept ſo affectionately into her arms, kiſſed her ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and talked to her ſo fervently, that Ildegerte, who thought it all hypocriſy and diabolical deceit, felt bitter ſorrow in her heart. It was painful to ſee herſelf mocked (as ſhe fancied) by the villain, whom with a ſingle word ſhe could unmaſk. She was ſilent, but unable to return the careſſes beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her by the traitor as he hung upon her neck. The riſing moon reminded her of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended flight. Ildegerte withdrew herſelf from the arms of her faithleſs huſband, feigned wearineſs, and begged repoſe. He went.—</p>
                  <p>Alas! then awoke in her recollection, as if by an electric ſhock, all the paſt joys of love. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her eyes ſtood the proſpect of a drear futurity.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps for the laſt time," thus whiſpered
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:037753_0142_100F27FFB0F86080"/>
her heart to her, "perhaps for the laſt time thou ſeeſt the dear betrayer, the father of thy child."</p>
                  <p>She purſued him, threw her ſnow-white arms around him, and ſtammered forth—</p>
                  <p>"Farewell! Forgive me, if I for another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rob you of repoſe. I forgot to ſhow you the dear little child, the pledge of our affection."</p>
                  <p>With theſe words ſhe drew the King, (whoſe confuſion evidently increaſed) partly by force, to the cradle, in which the innocent was ſlumbering.</p>
                  <p>"Look!" ſaid ſhe, "here is your ſon. Kiſs him, and bleſs him, that with his father's bleſſing and his mother's love, he may bid defiance to the ſtorms which Fate perhaps has ſpread above him."</p>
                  <p>The King bent to his firſt-born ſon, and kiſſed him; a tear dropped upon his little hand.</p>
                  <p>"For the ſake of that tear," cried Ildegerte, "I forgive thee."</p>
                  <p>She vaniſhed in the inner apartment.—Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric was thunderſtruck; he followed her with fixed eye, and willingly had otherwiſe interpreted her words than his conſcience too plainly pointed out. Long he ſtood irreſolute. His heart drew him to Ildegerte's feet, there to confeſs his crime, and ſue to her affection for pardon. But then the demon Policy whiſpered in his ear—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:037753_0143_100F2801E719FE98"/>
"Too far haſt thou proceeded. Already does the ocean bear the Swediſh Princeſs to thy ſhores; thou canſt but proceed; to retreat a ſtep is war and death."</p>
                  <p>He turned mournfully around, reached his chamber without knowing how, and ſought that repoſe which is granted only to the good.</p>
                  <p>All was again ſilent. No footſtep echoed through the loneſome galleries of the vaulted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. Ildegerte dried her tears, and demanded of her companion whether it was midnight.</p>
                  <p>"It is," anſwered ſhe. "All is quiet; above us ſhines the northern ſtar."</p>
                  <p>"'Tis well!" cried the Queen; "let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone. Alas! how is my heart oppreſſed! Where is my ſon?"</p>
                  <p>"He's ſtill aſleep," ſaid Helga.</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte approached the cradle, and ſurveyed him with maternal affection.</p>
                  <p>"Look, Helga, how calmly innocence can ſleep. Is his father's reſt ſo undiſturbed? Oh! How eaſy is it to diſcover the traces of conſcience in the features of any one aſleep! When the weary eye is cloſed, the recollection of evil or of good ſteals from the deep receſſes of the heart, ſettles upon the countenance, and is manifeſt in
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037753_0144_100F2804533BC460"/>
convulſive motions, or a gentle ſmile. What a pity to diſturb the innocent's delightful dreams! But his mother has been rouſed by the hand of miſery from the moſt delightful of all dreams!—the dream of love, and yet dare not complain. Away! I hear the crowing of the cock; away, before the morning dawns!"</p>
                  <p>Helga took the little ſlumberer in her arms, and he awoke not. Ildegerte with ſilent caution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded her companion through the dark paſſages, and reached at laſt a little gate, which was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her by a trabant, bought over to her intereſt.—She caſt back another mournful look.</p>
                  <p>"This palace I entered in triumph," ſaid ſhe, "through yonder ſpacious portals, and am now doomed to fly from it like a criminal through this ſmall gate. At that time the ſun ſparkled in a tear of joy, but now the moon in the tear of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Perfidious huſband! Away, that I may not curſe the recollection of him!"</p>
                  <p>She ſpoke, and took little Haldan in her arms, (for her affection could not even truſt him to the faithful Helga), and carefully carried him now through pathleſs foreſts, now over craggy cliffs, and now over bottomleſs moraſſes. The night was cold, but large drops trickled from the heroine's
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037753_0145_100F28071F4B98C0"/>
forehead. Her face and hands were lacerated by the briars; her feet, wounded by the pointed flints, left their bloody marks imprinted in the ſand. Already had they been wandering for two hours, when the Queen aſked Helga whether ſhe was weary.</p>
                  <p>"I dare not tell a falſhood," replied ſhe; "I am very weary."</p>
                  <p>"True," ſaid Ildegerte; "you have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious burden to ſcatter roſes on your path. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, faithful Helga."</p>
                  <p>"I am aſhamed," anſwered ſhe; "I'll follow you to death."</p>
                  <p>They continued their way. As yet they felt not the refreſhing ſea-breeze. The thickets grew more impenetrable, the path leſs beaten.</p>
                  <p>"Methinks," ſaid Helga, "the morning dawns. Do you ſee that purple ſtripe in the eaſt? Alas! what if the ſun betray us!"</p>
                  <p>"Courage! Courage!" exclaimed Ildegerte. "We ſhall eſcape; the night has led us too much to the left; at break of day we ſhall diſcern our road."</p>
                  <p>The fugitives, urged by anxiety, redoubled their efforts. They ſprung like kids from cliff to cliff; they crept like ſerpents through the interwoven
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037753_0146_100F294C11230238"/>
buſhes. Panting like hunted deer, they forced their way through brooks and ſwampy fens.</p>
                  <p>At once a thick fog aroſe, which dimmed the breaking day, and ſpread a ſecond night around them, far more impenetrable than the former, which had been enlightened by the moon and ſtars. The unhappy Queen covered the child with all the garments ſhe could ſpare, in order to defend him from the chilly rawneſs of the atmoſphere. She ſummoned all her reſolution to oppoſe the horrors of her ſituation, and had ſtill a word of comfort left for Helga.</p>
                  <p>Alas! poor helpleſs wretches! What avails it that ye wander thus, beſmeared with blood, in tears, and breathleſs? Do you know whither you are flying? Can you diſcern the tree cloſe to you? Are you certain that ſome hoſtile demon is not leading you through this labyrinth back to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace gate? Perhaps at that very moment the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams may diſperſe the fog, exhibiting your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled perſons to the deriſion of the Court and Hell.</p>
                  <p>"Oh Queen!" cried Helga, falling on a ſtone, "forgive me, I can go no further."</p>
                  <p>"Ye Gods! this is too much," cried Ildegerte. "Burden me not, Odin, beyond what I am able
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037753_0147_100F294D9C1646F0"/>
to bear. Collect this miſt into a thunder-cloud, and launch the dart of Hela to my heart."</p>
                  <p>She threw herſelf upon the damp cold earth, cloſe to her friend, preſſed little Haldan feebly to her boſom, and warmed him with her tears.</p>
                  <p>The flood-gates of Heaven opened.—Forth guſhed a torrent from the ſkies, accompanied by hall; the brooks were ſwoln beyond their banks, and the fields inundated; the miſerable fugitives were completely drenched. Rapid ſtreams rolled paſt them, and in huge drops a river ſeemed to fall from every tree.</p>
                  <p>Haldan (who till now had ſlept as ſoundly in his mother's arms beneath the canopy of angry Heaven, as on a bed of down in the palace of his father,) awoke, as at laſt the rain, in ſpite of Ildegerte's care, had forced its way. He awoke, and availed himſelf of the only arms which Nature (bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every beaſt, to man alone penurious) had granted him. He cried ſo loudly and piteouſly that his voice rent the heart of his afflicted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, more than the thorns her feet and hands. Fruitleſs were her careſſes, fruitleſs the offer of her breaſt, in which miſery had dried all nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At laſt her courage, her belief in a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who ſuperintends the ſufferings of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037753_0148_100F294F313922A0"/>
forſook her; mad with deſpair and anguiſh, ſhe wrung her hands, and curſed her exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Hark!</p>
                  <p>In the thickets barked a dog—not far diſtant ſeemed the ſound; freſh <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and ſtrength, inſpired the weary Queen.—She ſprung nimbly on her feet, ſtretched forth her hand to her exhauſted friend, raiſed her, commanded her to lean upon her arm, removed with her left hand the cloſe-ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented buſhes, claſped with her right the infant Haldan, and thus followed the ſound, which ſtill ſeemed nearer and nearer.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly ſhe ſtood before a ſmall hut, which, overſhadowed by thick interwoven branches, bade defiance to every ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>"I ſhall find ſome one here," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "whoſe compaſſion I ſhall excite by the artleſs account of my diſtreſſes. But if not, be my laſt reſource—this dagger."</p>
                  <p>Thus prepared for all, Ildegerte boldly knocked at the door of the little hut. But who can deſcribe her aſtoniſhment, when a female voice called from within—</p>
                  <p>"Hail, Queen of Denmark and Norway! En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! Enter! Come to my ſire, thou, Prince Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, and the faithful Helga."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="unknown:037753_0149_100F29530375A2A8"/>
At once the door flew from its hinges, and our heroine beheld ſitting, at a blazing fire, a decrepit old woman, who, with palſied head, tottered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, ſeized her hand, and conducted her to a kind of couch, made of ſoft moſs and twiſted ſedge. With benevolent ſolicitude ſhe took the little Prince from her arms, laid him near the fire upon a bed of roſes and ſweet-ſcented herbs, went to milk her goats, and appeaſed his hunger. She then brought fruits and bread, with a cordial drink made by herſelf of honey and berries; at the ſame time ſhe encouraged her gueſts by friendly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, preſſing them to partake of her homely cheer, and not to deſpiſe her poverty, for ſhe gave them what her little garden and cellar would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>"When you," ſaid ſhe, "are recovered from the hardſhips you have encountered in the night, I will conduct you, by the neareſt road, to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore. To be ſure 'tis long ſince I forſook my hut, for age and infirmity are ſiſters; but to-day, by the aſſiſtance of my ſtick, I will contrive to hobble along, for I think it well worth my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſacrifice the remnant of my ſtrength in the aſſiſtance of ſo good a Queen. Fear not; you will not be purſued; the ſhip lies unobſerved within a
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:037753_0150_100F29552EA95BB8"/>
ſecret bay, the wind is fair, and ere the ſun has half-fulfilled his courſe, the coaſt of Denmark will have vaniſhed from your view."</p>
                  <p>The good Queen ſtared at her with aſtoniſhment, not knowing how to ſolve the myſtery. The old woman ſeemed as well acquainted with her every ſecret as if ſhe had been the companion of her youth, and never left her ſide.</p>
                  <p>"Who art thou, unaccountable?" ſtammered Ildegerte in a tone of ſuſpicion; "who art thou, before whoſe eye the book of Fate lies open?"</p>
                  <p>"I am," replied ſhe, "Suanhilda, the ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, whoſe name perhaps has reached your ears."</p>
                  <p>A ſacred reverential impulſe ſeized the Queen. She had often heard at her huſband's Court of this miraculous woman, of her wonderous ſkill in magic and divination. But an inſtant before ſhe had been convinced that Fame had not exaggerated it. It would have been folly to conceal her ſecret from ſuch a favourite of the Gods: ſhe therefore wiſely determined to reveal to the old woman what the latter long had known, and implore her aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Suanhilda promiſed, and fulfilled her promiſe; for as ſoon as the wanderers had dried their clothes, healed their wounds, and ſatisfied their hunger, ſhe graſped her ſtaff, and led her gueſts (as quick
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037753_0151_100F2956BA8B9C20"/>
as the weight of a hundred years, which ſhe bore upon her back, would allow) by a ſmooth path, known only to herſelf, to the ſea-ſhore, where the crew joyfully hailed their freight, and a briſk breeze ſwelled the canvaſs. The ſun, no longer hid by clouds, now ſparkled in the rippling waves. Suan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilda embraced Ildegerte.</p>
                  <p>"Farewell," ſaid ſhe, with an awful ſolemnity, while ſhe gazed full in the horoine's face, and a more than mortal inſpiration overſpread her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; "farewell, till thou and thy thouſands are borne upon the ocean back to the coaſt of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, where the deſolated fields imbibe the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dew of Heaven, mingled with floods of gore, where the wretched peaſant groans to thee for help and for deliverance, where Treaſon ſpreads its ſooty pinions o'er the Palace.—Welcome, Oh heroine, amid the ſhouts of multitudes! Triumph and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, thrice bleſſed mother of Kings! Thy name ſhall be named in diſtant ages, and behold! thy children's children paſs before me, clad in purple, bearing the ſceptre of Norway, which is decorated with the ever-blooming trophies, earned by Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte."</p>
                  <p>The old woman, from a hillock near the ſhore, ſtill continued her prophetic bleſſings, when a
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:037753_0152_100F29586BE70B50"/>

                  <p>The voyage was proſperous, the weather favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. In a few days the heroine reached her native ſhores, and fled to the caſtle in the woods, which had before heard her lamentations for the loſs of Thora, and concealed her anguiſh for the death of Swend.</p>
                  <p>BACK to the palace of the poor deluded King, where (to borrow a ſimile from Monteſquieu) all is lifeleſs animation, and every one a walking ſtatue!</p>
                  <p>Scarce had Theodoric awoke from a ſhort ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which had rather wearied than refreſhed him, when he was informed that one of the Queen's attendants waited in the anti-chamber, and deſired admittance.</p>
                  <p>"Let her come," ſaid he, affrighted, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding ſomething unuſual. The crimſon flew into his face, he half-raiſed himſelf from his couch, and leaning on his elbow, fixed his eye upon the door.</p>

With downcaſt looks, Ingibert, (the ſiſter of our Helga) entered the apartment.—She was clothed in mourning, and from her head flowed the long crape to her feet.—Her uneven pace, her mute affliction, more appalled the King than if ſhe had wrung her hands in agony, and torn her hair. She approached him with reverence, and ſilently preſented a letter. Theodoric opened it with trembling hand, and read. Ingibert with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <head>Ildegerte to Theodoric, King of Denmark and Norway.</head>
                        <p>"Your generoſity (you termed it love) once forced me to accept a crown from your hand, while my armour ſtill was ſtained with Swediſh gore. In martial accoutrements I pleaſed you—in the modeſt attire of a houſewife I ceaſed to pleaſe you. The blood of Canfried led me to the throne, the blood of Canfried drives me from it; your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and mine may triumph, but far am I from demeaning myſelf ſo far as to reproach their daſtard ſouls. Take back the diadem, which ambition never placed upon my brow; I lay it voluntarily at your feet, to eſcape the inſult which ſo undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly awaited me.

                  <p>I leave it to your imagination, reader, to depict the impreſſion which this ſolemn adieu made upon his heart, ſtormed as it was on every ſide. You know he was no villain, though his weakneſs, his too eaſy flexibility led him to commit more crimes than Harold, with all his villany, could perpetrate. At this moment all his tenderneſs awoke; he again beheld in Ildegerte his amiable wife, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his ſon.—He again reflected on her exalted virtues and unmerited diſtreſſes; he reſolved to act like a man, and wept like a child. He determined boldly to ſurmount all the obſtacles of policy, but, inſtead of inſtantly executing what the angel of Virtue whiſpered, to make Harold firſt acquainted
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037753_0155_100F295FECF88320"/>
with this alteration in his ſentiments. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite was ſummoned.</p>
                  <p>"Read, Harold, read!" reaching with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand the open letter. "Read! give me thy advice, and calm, if poſſible, the tumult which rages in my heart."</p>
                  <p>Harold took the paper, and peruſed it.—The flight of Ildegerte was to him a thunder-bolt, which blaſted at one blow his brighteſt hopes. Yet could the eye of one, endowed with a knowledge of mankind, read likewiſe in the generous renunciation which theſe lines conveyed, the ſureſt method to regain Theodoric's wavering heart. This muſt be prevented; diſſimulation was more neceſſary now than ever. Harold with difficulty tried to force a ſmile, cloſed the letter, thruſt it in his boſom, and aſſuming an air of indifference, demanded—</p>
                  <p>"What does the King intend to do?"</p>
                  <p>"What he muſt do," replied Theodoric, "if he will obey the dictates of his heart; what he muſt do, if he will lay claim to a title far above that of King—the title of an upright man."</p>
                  <p>"But there is a wide difference," ſaid the Prince, "between an upright King and an upright individual. The latter can by no means be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in our preſent deliberation; the former
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037753_0156_100F29620B4ADE80"/>
muſt not conſult his heart, but the opinion of the nation."</p>
                  <p>"And of his own accord linger all his life upon the rock of conſcience?" cried Theodoric.</p>
                  <p>"If he will ſuffer his imagination," anſwered Harold, "to bind him to the rock, why, yes."</p>
                  <p>"Sorry I am, then," rejoined the King, "that I am a ſlave to mine. Spare your words; ſend a ſmall veſſel inſtantly to Norway for her; ſend an ambaſſador inſtantly to Sweden. I will not ſee the Princeſs, I will not hear her name again."</p>
                  <p>"The hoſtile army," replied Harold, "will bellow it loudly enough in your ears. What am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador can I ſend? who of all your ſubjects will ſtep forward to be torn in pieces by juſt exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Hermanfried would rave, Luitgardis with tears inſpire each arm. Every noble Swede would rather die a thouſand deaths than ſuffer ſuch an inſult to be unrevenged. Already do I ſee them burſt upon us like fragments of broken rocks; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready do I ſee them deſolate thy fertile kingdom, butcher thy ſubjects, and enſlave their children; already do I hear thy faithful followers curſe thy weakneſs, which drags them thus to ſlaughter for a woman's ſake. The welfare of the ſtate is your firſt law; this Ildegerte herſelf confeſſes by
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037753_0157_100F2964A9356C58"/>
her voluntary reſignation; you ſhould be obliged to her for having made the ſtep more eaſy, which coſts your heart, as I perceive, ſo much."</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Theodoric, "what muſt become of her? Is ſhe doomed, as a reward for all her love and valour, only to hunt the bears in Norway's foreſts?"</p>
                  <p>"Not ſo," anſwered Harold. "You may, by a thouſand little favours, alleviate her lot. Let her retain, as heretofore, the title of Queen, that will flatter her ambition. Let her have a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able revenue, that will procure the conveniences of life."</p>
                  <p>"But her heart—?" ſaid the King.</p>
                  <p>"That," replied the Prince, "will be more open to a mother's joys, more cloſely connected to her ſon, and will find its reward in the reflection of having contributed to the happineſs of a whole nation."</p>
                  <p>"And I—?" proceeded Theodoric, with a deep ſigh.</p>
                  <p>"To that queſtion," anſwered he, preſenting a miniature, "let the original of this reply."</p>
                  <p>"What is it?" cried the King, eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"The beauteous copy of a ſtill more beauteous girl," ſaid Harold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:037753_0158_100F2966C6399508"/>
"And the original?" demanded he.</p>
                  <p>"I dare not name," returned Harold; "you have forbidden it."</p>
                  <p>"Luitgardis?" aſked he, impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"The ſame," ſaid the Prince.</p>
                  <p>Theodoric riveted his eye upon the picture.</p>
                  <p>"She is handſome."—A pauſe.—"Beautiful!"—Another pauſe—"Enchanting!"</p>
                  <p>"And yet," rejoined Harold, "'tis thought the painter has but ill ſucceeded in the expreſſion of that gentle ſoul which animates theſe features. He was unable to ſteal from her that ſmile, which ſhe ſeems to have ſtolen from the goddeſs Freya."</p>
                  <p>"Who brought it?" aſked Theodoric.</p>
                  <p>"A meſſenger," returned the Prince, "who, at the ſame time, announces the near approach of the Princeſs. He reports that, at his departure from the Court, ſhe purpoſed to remain but three days longer, and as he has been by accident detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the road, he expects her to be cloſe behind him."</p>
                  <p>"So ſoon?" cried Theodoric. "Before we are prepared for her reception?"</p>
                  <p>"Heed not that," ſaid the villain; "only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your heart, and to your faithful Harold leave the reſt."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:037753_0159_100F296864E023C8"/>
"Haſte then!" exclaimed the King.—"Let no decoration or magnificence be wanting. Fame deſcribes her Brother's Court as ſplendid; I ſhould not wiſh her to miſs here what cuſtom may have rendered requiſite."</p>
                  <p>"Every coſtly ornament," ſaid Harold, "which your royal treaſure can procure, ſhe ſhall find in her apartments. Add to this," continued he, in a jocular tone, "the value which ſuch a preſent gains from your hand, and methinks Luitgardis will be ſatisfied."</p>
                  <p>The Prince was now going, when Theodoric detained him, by aſking for the letter.</p>
                  <p>"It were better, kinſman," rejoined Harold, "not to read it a ſecond time."</p>
                  <p>"It at leaſt deſerves an anſwer," obſerved the King.</p>
                  <p>"It does," returned Harold, "and I adviſe you to accompany it with preſents. Fail not alſo to call her Queen, and command the nobles who take it to bend the knee, as is meet when they approach the conſort of their King."</p>
                  <p>"And to convince her, by irreſiſtible elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence," proceeded Theodoric, fixing his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the picture, "of the ſad neceſſity which obliges
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037753_0160_100F296ADA598F48"/>
me, ſo contrary to the wiſhes of my faithful heart—"</p>
                  <p>"And ſo forth," interrupted Harold.—"Yes, yes; but allow me to ſtate another doubt which has occurred to me. If I am wrong my zeal for your ſafety muſt ſerve as my excuſe. Would it not be conformable to the dictates of caution, if you were to ſtation a few troops on the confines of Norway?"</p>
                  <p>"Why ſo?" demanded he.</p>
                  <p>"How eaſily," ſaid Harold—"pardon me, 'tis but a ſuppoſition, yet it is founded on a knowledge of the ſex, which, when ſlighted, ever thirſts for vengeance—how if Ildegerte, who in her native land has powerful intereſt, were to excite your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to revolt?"</p>
                  <p>"Peace!" cried the King. "Her noble ſoul cannot be capable of ſuch a thought."</p>
                  <p>"Of what cannot the ſtorm of paſſions make a woman capable?" anſwered he.—"Who ever yet repented caution? And, why is it neceſſary that the purpoſe for which your troops are ſent thither ſhould be known?"</p>
                  <p>"No," exclaimed the King, "it cannot be. I'll hear no more; not a ſingle man ſhall approach the borders, and thoſe at preſent ſcattered in that
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037753_0161_100F296DC506BE40"/>
diſtrict, ſhall immediately return, that Ildegerte may not think me guilty of harbouring the leaſt ſuſpicion."</p>
                  <p>"As you pleaſe," concluded Harold, "I have but done my duty."</p>
                  <p>The hypocrite departed. His deluded friend, (who had ſo often ſacrificed the ſubſtance for the ſhadow) ſought conſolation in the picture of the Swediſh princeſs, and tried, by gazing at her lovely features, to drive from his remembrance the tear which perhaps at that moment trickled down the cheek of Ildegerte. He convinced himſelf that he had done every thing which love and generoſity demanded. Had he been but a ſubject, reaſoned he, no power on earth ſhould have forced him to loſe Ildegerte; he would have fled with her to a deſert; wild herbs would, at her ſide, have been luxuries, and water nectar. But Fate had placed him in a ſtation which we mortals are for ever painting the moſt arduous and unenviable, which, however, not one in a thouſand voluntarily quits, and which none of us, who thus deſpiſe it, would refuſe, if it were offered. What remains to be done? He has but two alternatives; he muſt either audaciouſly oppoſe the will of the Gods, and the intreaties of his ſubjects, or caſt away the purple,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037753_0162_100F296FDC450B98"/>
and retire to Norway's woods, there to die poor and unknown, yet at the ſide of Ildegerte. The firſt no mortal dares to do, the latter he muſt not; for to leave a flock without a ſhepherd would be cruelty, and to rob his heirs of their paternal right would be madneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus the ſophiſt quietly ſubmits to his deſtiny, writes a luke-warm letter full of forced apologies to Ildegerte, tries to make amends by coſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents for what the ſtyle may want in affection, and wonders when ſhe ſends the preſents back, nor deigns to write him a reply. He terms her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct haughty, thinks he has a right to talk of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved injuries, and feels a ſecret joy in having found another cover for his perfidy.</p>
                  <p>Well is it for the villain, who can thus rock his conſcience to repoſe. Even Theodoric envies him, for he is not always able thus to impoſe upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſophiſtry.</p>
                  <p>A THOUSAND times has it been ſaid, (and falſely ſaid) that the path of ſeduction is only ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with roſes. True it is, the further one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, the more eaſy ſeems the way, the more
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037753_0163_100F297168E2EB40"/>
numerous theſe ſhort-lived flowers. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is not at the beginning of the road, but where it deviates from the path of Virtue. There has Virtue ſcattered many a thorn, which, from time to time, benevolently tears the thoughtleſs wanderer's foot, to make him attentive to the way which he is chuſing.</p>
                  <p>Luitgardis came. On every ſide triumphal arches were erected. The ſtreets were adorned with branches, the windows decked with garlands, and each clad in his beſt attire. A magnificent proceſſion paraded in honour of the feſtive day, but the countenances of the aſſembled multitude gave the lie to their garments; no joyful ſhout ſaluted the young couple; all was ſilent as if a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral were paſſing, and Theodoric, at the ſide of Luitgardis, felt the bittereſt mortification. He commanded meat and bread, as well as intoxicating liquors, to be given to the populace. All refuſed to taſte them, and crowded to the temple of Odin, where, ſince the laſt battle, Ildegerte had hung her lance and helmet, which they bedewed with tears.</p>
                  <p>Theodoric heard it, and his heart bled.</p>
                  <p>All ſeemed to combine on this day to plant a thouſand daggers in his heart. Sir Siegwin, an
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037753_0164_100F2973830F14C0"/>
old Swede, (the ſame who conveyed the body of Canfried from the field of battle, and ſlew Swend's murderer) came in the ſuite of Luitgardis to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the young Princeſs to the King: but ſcarce had he performed this errand, ere he ſprung upon his ſteed to return home.</p>
                  <p>"Whither ſo ſoon?" cried the aſtoniſhed King. "Will you affront me ſo much as to refuſe the cup of joy upon the day of my nuptials?"</p>
                  <p>"Sir," ſaid old Siegwin, "do you remember our interchange of friendſhip on the field of battle? My King commanded me to accompany the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; I have delivered her to you. My friendſhip I take back."</p>
                  <p>Without waiting a reply he ſpurred his ſteed, and vaniſhed from the ſight of the abaſhed Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric, whoſe conſcience loudly called to him—</p>
                  <p>'"Thou deſerveſt not the friendſhip of ſo worthy a man."'</p>
                  <p>Thus did the viperous tooth of Conſcience gnaw every morſel that he ate, taint every drop he drank, and poiſon every kiſs he imprinted on the lips of his bride.</p>
                  <p>And Luitgardis? Oh! ſhe was a good harmleſs being, ever gay and ever happy.—She ſaw no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it was wiſhed ſhe ſhould ſee, and enjoyed
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037753_0165_100F29762E3ECE60"/>
the pleaſures of the preſent hour, regardleſs of the next.</p>
                  <p>And Harold? 'Tis time to return to him, whoſe well-concerted plan had been defeated by the flight of Ildegerte, and whom you perhaps fancy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the thought of having ſo completely revenged his ſlighted love, and reſolved calmly to enjoy the fruits of this revenge. Nothing leſs. Harold (like a ſkilful cheſs-player, who always knows how to give another turn to his game, when a movement of his adverſary has defeated his firſt-plan) now aimed at the throne of his forefathers (as he termed it), even without the help of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. He had not a moment's doubt but that his hand would be accepted, when he had it in his power to make the offer from a throne. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his craft and knowledge of mankind, he ſometimes fell into the ſame miſtake as attaches to the reſt of us poor mortals.—He attributed to each character unintentionally ſome mixture of his own, by which miſtake it came to paſs, that as he laid down falſe poſitions, falſe conſequences enſued. He could as little fancy the patient and ſubmiſſive Ildegerte, as the Greeks a Juno, without jealouſy.</p>
                  <p>"Let me but be a King," was his falſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, "and ſhe will be ready enough to ſnatch at
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037753_0166_100F29784C1BBB40"/>
any opportunity of convincing Theodoric that she can be a Queen in spite of him."</p>
                  <p>ALMIGHTY Ruler of creation! Is it not enough that an audacious despot shall be able to destroy that noble emulation, the axis upon which all republican states turn, and substitute his mad ambition? Must even Love, that gentle child of Heaven, formed only for the consolation of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humanity, afford him a pretext?</p>
                  <p>Already was Harold, the favourite, possessed of a blind confidence, lord over the revenues of the kingdom, lord over the strongest forts, lord over the army; for he had ever contrived to remove from the throne the faithful and deserving patriot, and to supply the place by a creature devoted to his will. And who can deny that Theodoric assisted the traitor in his projects? Had he not lost the love of his people by banishing their idol, Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte? What had he been since that time, but a mark for their derision and contempt? Alas! but too easy access did Harold find to their hearts. He complained with the discontented, plotted with
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037753_0167_100F2979DA673B48"/>
the diſaffected, and, in a ſhort time, beheld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of a powerful party, who eagerly awaited the ſignal for revolt. Nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a favourable opportunity, and the demon of diſcord failed not to provide it.</p>
                  <p>Theodoric, in the poſſeſſion of a lovely wife, a double crown, an unmoleſted peace, was wretched; for the joys of the bridal bed, the grandeur of the diadem, the ſmile of peace ſtilled not the voice of his accuſer, Conſcience. He avoided himſelf, and the whole world; he launched eagerly into every diſſipation; he endeavoured to forget the paſt amid the noiſy buſtle of the Court. In vain, in vain! An irkſome diſguſt attended him, even to the arms of the beauteous Luitgardis. The ſociety of each contemptible court minion ſoon became indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe his ſhallow brain could daily hammer forth new means of diſſipation.</p>
                  <p>Harold availed himſelf of this ſtate of mind, and, by one of his partiſans, cauſed the King to fall upon the idea of making a tour through his realms.</p>
                  <p>"Excellent! Excellent!" cried the cheated mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. "We ſhall be daily amuſed by new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we ſhall hear the petitions of the diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037753_0168_100F297B97D46EF0"/>
Quick! make inſtant preparations, that the pleaſant ſeaſon may not paſs."</p>
                  <p>His impatience was beyond all bounds; every delay intolerable; not a hand was there in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace unemployed. In a few days he left the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, having appointed Prince Harold the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Regent during his abſence.</p>
                  <p>This was the moment which the favourite had awaited. He daily received meſſengers from the King, announcing the continuance of his journey; and ſcarce did he know him far enough advanced towards the confines, when he at once threw away the maſk, aſſembled his creatures round him, took the young Queen into cuſtody, overpowered the few who were faithful to Theodoric, and was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hailed by the infatuated populace, King of Denmark.</p>
                  <p>He mounted the throne with affected modeſty, heard and determined every cauſe in perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed ſome taxes which were heavy on the people, doubled the allowance of the army, ſacrificed to the Gods, gifted the prieſts, amuſed the vulgar by a few hired jugglers, publiſhed a plauſible mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto, indiſputably proving his right to the throne, and thus ſecured his booty without oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>Indiſſolubly, as he thought, was the knot of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037753_0169_100F297E4C5EAFE0"/>
power now tied; and on the ſummit of his gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur he felt no other wiſh than the gratification of his luſt. He ſeized the pen, and wrote—</p>

                  <p>A ſplendid embaſſy was diſpatched to Norway to deliver this letter, and to convey Ildegerte tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant to the coaſt of Denmark.</p>
                  <p>Immoveable, as if ſtruck by Odin's thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, ſtood the weak Theodoric, on hearing the dreadful tidings brought by a faithful fugitive. Long his tongue refuſed its office, and the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation that quivered on his lips, was—</p>
                  <p>"Oh Ildegerte, Ildegerte! This have I for thy ſake merited. Can the wretch who betrayed his own wife, complain of a friend's perfidy?"</p>
                  <p>Extend, good reader, your compaſſion to the miſerable outcaſt, for, at this moment, he ceaſes to deſerve your hate; behold and pity his deſperate ſituation. See where the Court-ſycophants ſteal away, to throw themſelves in the ſhadow of a more fruitful tree; for this, lopped of its leaves,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037753_0170_100F298112D486B0"/>
ſtands naked and defenceleſs. Forſaken by his friends and ſubjects, without an army, without money, without counſel, huſband of two wives, and unable to ſeek comfort in the boſom of either—this is the image of the wretch, who, torn by a thouſand agonies, extinguiſhes the indignation which his weakneſs had excited in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>He wandered from city to city—the gates were ſhut to him; he fled from village to village—ſcarce did ſome honeſt peaſant ſhare with him his morſel of coarſe bread.</p>
                  <p>Thus did he ſteal through a thouſand dangers to the remoteſt province of his kingdom, the only one ſtill faithful to him. Here he collected a band of a few thouſands, headed them, and boldly marched againſt the robber of his crown; but as he dared not hope for victory, he reſolved in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair to ruſh upon the ſword of the foe, and finiſh his miſerable being on the field of battle.</p>
                  <p>Harold laughed at his temerity, braced on his armour, aſſembled his innumerable troops, headed them, and fiercely ſallied forth to complete the ſubjection of the kingdom, and chain his rival to the triumphal carriage, which was to bear him and Ildegerte to the altar of Siofna. He daily expected the return of the ambaſſadors from Norway, and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:037753_0171_100F2982A19BF160"/>
was at a loſs to account for their long ſtay. But he conſoled himſelf with the idea, that when all had ſubmitted to the victor, he might reſt the more eaſy in the arms of love.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the two armies (if Theodoric's ſmall band deſerve the name of army) had approached each other. Theodoric wiſhed for battle, Harold avoided it; not becauſe he had the ſmalleſt doubt of a deciſive victory, but he would take the rebels (as he termed them) alive, ſurround them by ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior force, and compel them, by famine, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render their ſhadow of a King. Every thing ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to favour this project. In a barren valley, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of water, the inconſiderate King had pitched his tents. Every avenue was poſſeſſed by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Bread began to fall, and the burning thirſt of the loyal troops was quenched only by the dew of Heaven. A few excurſions were hazarded; each time the little band returned diminiſhed. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple murmured, and conſidered themſelves as ſheep led to ſlaughter.—The impulſe of ſelf-preſervation awoke, and eaſily overpowered the enthuſiaſtic idea of an unalterable allegiance to their ſovereign. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold daily ſent diſguiſed impoſtors to the camp, who offered pardon to all the wavering, if they
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037753_0172_100F2984F0F91048"/>
would voluntarily ſurrender, and deliver their King into his power.</p>
                  <p>"Why this delay?" ſaid they. "Your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have yielded to the conqueror, and are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. The new King is gracious; he will be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you; but beware how you provoke his wrath. Can you think, with a handful of men, to oppoſe hunger, thirſt, and an innumerable army? Harold could long ſince have annihilated your poor band, had he not pitied you infatuation, and wiſhed to ſpare the blood of his ſubjects, (for as ſuch he ſtill conſiders you). Seize and kiſs the hand which a father offers, ere you too late repent your obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy."</p>
                  <p>Theſe addreſſes naturally made a deep impreſſion on the minds of thoſe who heard them. They combined, and determined to offer the ſacrifice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in order to ſave themſelves from inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ruin.</p>
                  <p>Thus helpleſs was the ſituation of poor Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric. The deſign of his followers was not unknown to him, and each moment he expected to be drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in chains before the traitor, whom he had once loaded with kindneſſes. This idea was to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable. Once more his courage awoke:</p>
                  <p>"Rather die than increaſe Harold's triumph."
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037753_0173_100F2987913A4740"/>
Thus ſpoke he to himſelf, and prepared a cup of poiſon, which he was juſt about to ſwallow, when Eſcill entered his tent. He announced a woman, who, with a baſket of fruit, had ſtolen through the enemy, and deſired to ſpeak with him.—Scarce had he finiſhed, when the woman entered.</p>
                  <p>"Helga!" cried the King. "Art thou here? Is it poſſible?"</p>
                  <p>Helga ſilently greeted him, and delivered a letter.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <head>Ildegerte to Theodoric, King of Denmark and Norway.</head>
                        <p>"This moment I have landed, on the coaſt of Denmark, ſix thouſand Amazons and eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hardy Norwegians.

                  <p>"God of Heaven!" exclaimed Theodoric, while a flood of tears guſhed down his face, and not knowing what he did, he claſped the faithful Helga in his arms. "Is it not a dream? So much generoſity! So unmerited! How ſhall I dare to meet the injured angel, whom I have ſo baſely—"</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="unknown:037753_0174_100F298A7078FF20"/>
"Of that we muſt not now converſe," ſaid Helga. "Pardon me, Sir, you have too often ſacrificed the preſent to the future. Do you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and approve of Ildegerte's letter?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly," anſwered he, "and will follow her directions punctually."</p>
                  <p>"Then I have fulfilled my errand," rejoined Helga. "Farewell!"</p>
                  <p>"But another word," cried the King.—"How happens this? How did my diſtreſſes reach her ear!"</p>
                  <p>"Our enemy was ſo kind," returned ſhe, "as to honour us with a confidence, which we might have expected from you. But, to be brief, (for my time is ſhort) your worthy kinſman, Prince Harold, had for ſome time caſt an eye of affection upon Ildegerte, and having it in his power to add to the allurements of his perſon, the allurements of a throne, (whether acquired by birth or uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation is to him alike) he ventured (unhappily for him rather too ſoon) to make a formal offer of his hand by embaſſy. What followed is eaſily divined. The worthy ambaſſadors were confined, that the uſurper might remain in a ſtate of uncertainty; a ſmall army was haſtily collected; a favourable
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037753_0175_100F298C05619FE0"/>
breeze wafted us acroſs the ſea, and here we are with you to conquer or to die."</p>
                  <p>The good King could not check his tears, or bear this ſudden change of fortune.</p>
                  <p>"Tell her," cried he, "that ſhe has ſaved an ungrateful wretch from death and infamy, that this cup of poiſon had already touched my lips."</p>
                  <p>He was ſtill ſobbing and moaning to Helga, long after ſhe had left the tent.—She ſtole with her baſket through the hoſtile camp, mounted the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſteed that awaited her among the thickets, and haſtened to Ildegerte, who, in the meantime, had advanced a day's march at the head of her Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians. The re-animated King immediately convened the leaders of his little army, and announced to them the joyful news, which quickly ſpread from tent to tent, appeaſing hunger and diſaffection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring every heart with courage, every arm with ſtrength, every breaſt with loyalty, and every eye with martial fire. "Ildegerte!" was the general cry. A cheerful buſtle pervaded the camp. Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets were poliſhed, ſwords were ſharpened, and hymns of victory ſung by anticipation. Upon the ſummit of the neighbouring mountain a centinel was ſtationed, to ſtrike his ſhield thrice as ſoon as he eſpied the approaching army. Every one wiſhed
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037753_0176_100F298E2603F6D0"/>
to relieve this guard, for every one was eager to announce the happy tidings.</p>
                  <p>Harold heard with aſtoniſhment the ſhouts of joy in the valley, from whence the air till now had wafted to him naught but groans. A ſpy came to acquaint him with the threatened ſtroke. He was furious, and reſolved at break of the ſucceeding morning, to ſtorm the narrow valley, and deſtroy the paltry band, that when Ildegerte came, ſhe might find the work already finiſhed, and return diſappointed to the woods of Norway. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved—but the Gods had otherwiſe reſolved.</p>
                  <p>The ſun declined, and his firſt beams already kiſſed the ocean, when the guard upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thrice ſtruck his ſhield. Every one climbed to the ſummit, and with ſilent rapture ſaw the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous troops emerge from a cloud of duſt, ſpread in thick ranks acroſs the plain, and pitch their tents at a ſmall diſtance from the tyrant's camp.</p>
                  <p>Harold foamed with rage, and vowed the death of the audacious woman. 'Twas not fear that cauſed him thus to knit his brow, to fix his eye upon the earth, the gnaſh his teeth, and clench his fiſt. What had Harold to fear? Ildegerte's army, joined to Theodoric's weak exhauſted band, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not half his force, and half of Ildegerte's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037753_0177_100F299109F74500"/>
were women. Fear it was not, but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed affection, which converted his deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, drove his boiling blood into his head, and forced from him an oath to exterminate the daring creature, together with her beardleſs train.</p>
                  <p>With eyes that darted fire, he left his tent to prepare his troops for battle on the enſuing morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But alas! what a ſudden change! Shallow blockhead! Couldſt thou think the name of Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte was forgotten by the Danes?</p>
                  <p>"Who are they that approach?" ſaid one to another. "Are they friends or foes?"</p>
                  <p>Soon was it proclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"'Tis Ildegerte, our Queen, the valiant noble being! Who dares to lift his hand againſt her? If ſhe defends Theodoric, Theodoric is right, and we are rebels.—Away to her feet! Let us appeaſe the heroine's wrath by voluntary ſubmiſſion."</p>
                  <p>And ſee! Here and there a troop forſook its leader. The deſerters every moment increaſed; every moment increaſed the ſhouts of</p>
                  <p>"Long live Queen Ildegerte!"</p>
                  <p>One dragged away another; hundreds followed without knowing why or whither. They plucked green branches from the trees as a token of pacific diſpoſition, laid their arms at the feet of Ildegerte's
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037753_0178_100F299325142C18"/>
guard (which at firſt attempted to oppoſe them) crowded with acclamations to the camp, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a ſight of the Queen.</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte iſſued from her tent with an air of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic dignity. The multitude fell upon their knees, bleſſed their Queen, and ſued for pardon. The heroine waved her hand. A death-like ſilence reigned throughout the aſſembly, and anxious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation ſat upon every countenance.</p>
                  <p>"I thank you," ſaid ſhe, "for this mark of your attachment. My heart feels its value, and, as a female, I may be allowed without reſtraint to ſhed the tear which you ſee trembling in my eye. But I have nothing to forgive. 'Tis your King whom you have injured; 'tis your King, at whoſe feet you muſt try by ſupplication to avert the ſword of Juſtice. All I can promiſe is, to join my prayers to your's. Go, unite yourſelves to my followers, and wait with reſignation the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morn. The riſing ſun will diſpel the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which till now has bound your ſenſes."</p>
                  <p>She ceaſed, and the ſtill increaſing multitude reſpectfully obeyed her words. The camp was too ſmall to contain all that arrived. They paſſed the night beneath the ſtarry heavens, anxiouſly ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the break of day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="unknown:037753_0179_100F2994B30FABA8"/>
The ſun roſe, and Ildegerte in vain looked for an enemy. Notwithſtanding Harold's furious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, notwithſtanding the examples of a hundred, whom he with his own hand ſlew, as they were flying, his mighty army every inſtant leſſened. When he turned to the left, the right wing fled, and while in purſuit of this, the left forſook him. At laſt he remained alone and in deſpair. Too daſtardly to throw himſelf upon his ſword, he eſcaped through the darkneſs of night to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, embarked on board a fiſherman's ſkiff, fled to Germany, and in ſome miſerable hamlet hid his diſgrace and remorſe. No one purſued him. In a few years, exhauſted by the horrors of conſcience, he deſcended to the horrors of Niflheim.</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte mournfully returned thanks to the God of war for the victory obtained without a blow, and was informed, as ſhe departed from the altar, of Theodoric's near approach, who, with his band of faithful followers, had already left the valley, and was coming towards her through the enemy's deſerted camp. She haſtened to receive him.</p>
                  <p>But what Divinity inſpires me to deſcribe this meeting? Theodoric ſprung from his charger, threw himſelf at Ildegerte's feet, and writhed in the duſt. He was bathed in tears, and his ſobs
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:037753_0180_100F2996CC7CAF90"/>
choked his utterance.—Ildegerte raiſed him, and in a gentle voice beſought him to forget the paſt, and to forgive the rebels. She conducted him into her pavilion, to hide from the gazing multitude the confuſion of their Monarch.</p>
                  <p>What a triumph for the baniſhed Queen, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place a crown upon the head of her ungrateful huſband, to make him feel, in ſpite of his injuſtice, how great was her influence in the hearts of his ſubjects!</p>
                  <p>Joyfully the army now approached the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. All the gates were open to receive them—every heart beat friendly towards them. Luitgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis was releaſed, affectionately embraced by Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerte, and mortified by no reproach, or ſcornful look. Eaſy it is to imagine the perplexity of poor Theodoric. He loved Ildegerte more than ever. The army adored her; the heart of every Dane was her's; the whole Court hung with reverence upon her looks: The idea of her being mother to a guitleſs child, diveſted of his rights, added an affecting portion of compaſſion to reſpect and love.—No one doubted, after all ſhe had done for the nation, that ſhe would demand, and receive the moſt honourable reſtoration to the dignities of which ſhe had unjuſtly been deprived. The King
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037753_0181_100F299999957FE0"/>
was willing from his heart to make reparation for his crime, and Luitgardis, (though ſhe trembled at the thought) could not deny that Ildegerte was worthy of the preference. In this ſurmiſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was confirmed, when Ildegerte ſummoned an aſſembly of all the eſtates, for the purpoſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly addreſſing them. The day was fixed for this ſolemnity, and awaited with anxious curioſity by every Dane. During the intervening period, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious were the opinions of the points which were to be the ſubject of the Queen's harrangue.</p>
                  <p>If you wiſh to be a witneſs, reader, of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſcene, follow me. I will conduct you to a hill, from whence you may ſurvey the whole.</p>
                  <p>The morning dawned. The beams of the riſing ſun ſhed a cheerful luſtre on the plain, which, decked with innumerable flowers, ſtretched to an immeaſurable diſtance.</p>
                  <p>Look! There, where the far horizon cheats the ſight with a dark-blue ſhade, there riſes to the clouds a towering wood of firs. To the right, a rivulet glides ſoftly over the pebbles, in whoſe murmuring waves ten thouſand diamonds ſeem to ſparkle. To the left riſes a mountain awfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic, whoſe ſummit oft is crowned with clouds, and which oft derides the thunder roaring at its
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037753_0182_100F299BE8D381F0"/>
baſe. To-day, however, it is clear, and bears the altar, from which the curling ſmoke ſpires into the air. The prieſt, who, on his knees, with ſacred hand is nouriſhing the flame, ſeems at that height a dwarf.</p>
                  <p>But what thus glitters like the ſun, in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the plain? What dazzling mixture this, of gold and gorgeous colours?</p>
                  <p>'Tis the King's throne, to which are five ſteps, covered with ſcarlet ſilk. The hangings are of embroidered gold, which, drawn at the ſides into feſtoons, diſplay the lofty ivory ſeat ingeniouſly worked. There lies upon a ſatin cuſhion the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent crown, ſtudded with precious ſtones; near it the golden ſceptre. A hundred feathers, purple, white, and pearl-coloured, nod from the canopy with gentle motion to the ſeat.</p>
                  <p>But what thus glitters like the moon on each ſide of the throne?</p>
                  <p>The thrones of the two Queens, to which are three ſteps covered with blue ſilk. The ſeats are ſmaller, gilt, and carved in divers places. The canopies are of embroidered ſilver, upon which a plume of blue feathers here and there is wafted by the zephyrs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="unknown:037753_0183_100F299D79FB8D38"/>
But, what theſe diſtant warlike ſounds that ſtrike the ear?</p>
                  <p>They are the drums and horns, the flutes, the cymbals, and the trumpets (which with a ſolemn march precede the grand proceſſion), mixed with the people's ſhouts, who preſs round the King's triumphal carriage. At his right hand fits, with burniſhed armour, and with open helm, the hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Ildegerte. Upon her brow reigns the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of mighty deeds, and in her looks glows a majeſtic dignity. At his left hand ſits, in the ſnow-white robe of innocence, the gentle Luitgardis, with dejected mien and prophetic dread of her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſtiny. See what innumerable multitudes ruſh through the gates! See how they ſpread along the road, crowd to the carriage, cut the traces, and drag, with ſhouts of joy, their much-loved burden.</p>
                  <p>The magnificent proceſſion now approaches. Firſt come, with drawn ſwords, ſix thouſand Amazons, headed by the faithful Helga, who nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeparate, and ſurround their Monarch's throne. They are followed by the triumphal muſcle-formed carriage, bearing the royal group,<note n="6">Literally the royal trefoil.</note> attended by trabants, men, women, and children. Now come the nobles of the land, the eſtates of Denmark and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037753_0184_100F44E581AC44B8"/>
of Norway, the Knights, the Leaders, and the Senators. Each heads, according to his dignity or wealth, a larger or ſmaller troop of warlike vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, 'ſquires, armour-bearers, attendants. The train is endleſs.</p>
                  <p>But ſee! The King has already mounted his throne. Ildegerte has taken the ſeat on his right, and Luitgardis on his left. The different eſtates of the kingdom occupy the ſteps of the thrones.</p>
                  <p>Four heralds blow the trumpet, and command reſpectful ſilence. Inſtantly all is ſtill as if a God had deprived a million of exiſtence. No one dares to breathe, or quit the place, where Chance has fixed him. Thoſe who are behind, riſe on the tip-toe, ſtaring with eager looks over the heads and ſhoulders of the crowd before them.</p>
                  <p>Then aroſe Ildegerte from her ſeat with lofty dignity, and thus addreſſed the aſſembly:—</p>
                  <p>"Mighty King of Denmark and Norway, my lord and huſband—ye nobles of the realm and countleſs multitude, whoſe looks hang on my words with anxious expectation, think not that, by my petition and Theodoric's command, you are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled here to witneſs any deed which will leſſen the value of my heart. The unmerited affliction which I have endured, has neither damped my ſpirit, nor
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:037753_0185_100F44E81EB173D0"/>
diminiſhed the upright ſenſations of my ſoul. Far be it from Ildegerte, therefore, to ſeek the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of her happineſs in the miſery of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. I come not to require that ſtation, which the King's affection once beſtowed upon me. His will and your's have deemed it expedient, for the welfare of the ſtate, to unite the Northern king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms by this gentle tie, thereby to avert bloodſhed and diviſion. I revere your wiſdom, I wiſh not to cloud the fountains of private peace and unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe waters fertilize theſe realms. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Luitgardis not to be my Queen, but your's. May ſhe love Theodoric as I loved, as I ſtill love him! Ildegerte will be her ſiſter, not her rival. For myſelf therefore I have nothing to beg. Beg, did I ſay? Ildegerte never begs; for what the moſt holy laws of heaven and earth allot to her, ſhe demands. I demand of you, ye eſtates of both the kingdoms, that you reſtore to the child what your King has wreſted from the mother, that my ſon never may have cauſe to recollect my baniſhment. Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge loudly and openly—Prince Haldan is Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric's eldeſt ſon."</p>
                  <p>"He is! he is!" reſounded from all ſides.</p>
                  <p>"Speak then!" continued ſhe; "Where is he to look for his inheritance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
                  <p>

"He is heir to both the kingdoms," cried the people.</p>
                  <p>"I thank you," ſaid Ildegerte. "And you, Theodoric," proceeded ſhe, ſinking on one knee, "do you ſanction what your eſtates ſo loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree?"</p>
                  <p>The good King, (who, to-day, was literally but the ſhadow of a King, and who, toſſing on his ivory throne from ſide to ſide, read in the looks of his ſubjects that they thought him but a man, who knew not the difference between gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) ſtooped bluſhing to the heroine, and raiſed her in his arms.</p>
                  <p>"Am I not obliged to you," ſaid he, "for this my crown, this my ſceptre, and the happieſt hours of my exiſtence? Is not your ſon alſo mine? Do you aſk a ſinner this only to confuſe him?"</p>
                  <p>"Enough!" cried Ildegerte. "Now modeſt Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itgardis, your conſent alone is wanting."</p>
                  <p>The gentle being, from whoſe mild blue eyes the tears had long been falling on her throbbing boſom, roſe, and threw herſelf at Ildegerte's feet.</p>
                  <p>"Oh inimitable woman! allow me to attempt a copy of your virtues. Take back the place from which I innocently drove you—it belongs to you
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037753_0187_100F44EBE30AFE38"/>
alone. Let me in retirement merit but the title of your friend."</p>
                  <p>"Not ſo," rejoined the heroine. "You are the Queen, you are and ſhall remain ſo. As a wife, I have renounced every claim; I have only ſpoken as a mother, that my ſon, by being interwoven in my deſtiny, might not curſe my weakneſs. I ſtand here to open the gates of honour, which have been ſhut to him by my diſgrace. Declare!"</p>
                  <p>Luitgardis turned to the crowd.</p>
                  <p>"Liſten to me, Oh ye people! Let my weak voice reach your ears. And thou, all-ſeeing Vara, goddeſs of pure vows, avenger of perjury, thee do I call to witneſs, that I here acknowledge Prince Haldan to be the only lawful heir to both the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern crowns; and ſhould Siofna bleſs my bed, curſed be the child who wantonly dares to break his mother's oath!"</p>
                  <p>A murmur of applauſe pervaded the multitude.</p>
                  <p>"Have you," demanded Ildegerte, "well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the nature of this oath? Do you know the force of maternal love? What will you leave your children?"</p>
                  <p>"A grateful heart," ſaid ſhe. "Will they not even be obliged to you for their exiſtence?"</p>
                  <p>"Good woman," cried the heroine, "you
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037753_0188_100F44EF38913B50"/>
deſerve more than it is in my power to give. To rob your children of both crowns, in order to place them on the head of mine, were no longer maternal love, but rather an unbridled luſt of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Heaven grant my ſon ſtrength to bear but one, as may become an upright Monarch! 'Tis the diadem of Norway I demand for him; let Denmark's ſceptre remain in the hands of your children."</p>
                  <p>This conteſt between two virtuous ſouls drew tears from a million eyes. Ildegerte and Luitgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis were alternate objects of love and admiration. Every one wiſhed to give all to both, for both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved more than all that could be given. But as Ildegerte inſiſted on the generous renunciation of the Daniſh crown, the eſtates of both kingdoms unanimouſly reſolved that Prince Haldan be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and henceforth conſidered King of Norway, and in caſe of the royal iſſue being extinct in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the kingdoms, that the crown devolve upon the neighbouring Monarch.</p>
                  <p>Ildegerte had required nothing for herſelf; but every heart leaned towards her, and wiſhed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh in her boſom the remembrance of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved afflictions.—Ildegerte (thus decreed the eſtates) ſhall bear, during her life, the title of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:037753_0189_100F26E2644D6D30"/>
Queen of Norway, and deliverer of Denmark. She ſhall take her ſtation upon feſtivals at the King's right hand. She ſhall reign in Norway, during the minority of her ſon, as ſhe reigns in the hearts of its inhabitants, and a monument of braſs ſhall record her deeds to poſterity.</p>
                  <p>In the heroine's eye quivered a tear of bliſs. She bowed to the multitude, and a thouſand voices raiſed her name with joyful ſhouts to the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gods.</p>
                  <p>Loud ſounded the trumpets, cymbals, drums, and horns, but louder the glad cry of</p>
                  <p>"Long live Queen Ildegerte!"</p>
                  <p>A happy banquet followed the ſolemnities. In a thouſand decorated tents the teeming horn went round. The gay couples winded through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy dance, and the riſing ſun beheld the intoxicated ſlumberers ſtretched upon the dewy graſs.</p>
                  <p>But already does maternal love hurry Ildegerte to the ſtrand; already does the ſhip unmoor which is to bear the heroine to her native ſhores. But another embrace, another parting tear, another ſad adieu, and—the rowers daſh through the foaming waves, the pendants wanton in the air, a freſh breeze ſwells the canvaſs, and already is the coaſt hidden in the miſt. All is now loſt, except the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037753_0190_100F44F3B1158958"/>
loud bleſſings of the affected multitude, which are borne upon the wings of the wind to Ildegerte's ear.</p>
                  <p>NO more has my feeble pen to relate of this illuſtrious heroine. She was a Thora, and tried to make her ſon a Swend. But that ſhe was not immortal, and that, weary of life, ſhe too at laſt ſlept in the arms of Hela, is betrayed by the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, which hangs on the lyre of her Scald.</p>
