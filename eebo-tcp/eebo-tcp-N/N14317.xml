         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap> the Times have been hard, and our Commerce gone wrong,</l>
               <l>We ſtill have been able to ſtruggle along.</l>
               <l>If ſome, thro' Misfortunes, are ſlack in the Purſe,</l>
               <l>It is not ſo bad but it might have been worſe.</l>
               <l>Great Things, the Year paſt, were reveal'd to our Eyes:</l>
               <l>The Dutch have confeſs'd us their Friends and Allies,</l>
               <l>And humbled the Pride of our haughty Invaders,</l>
               <l>By fighting their Fleets and deſtroying their Traders.</l>
               <l>If the Engliſh ſucceeded in taking the COUNT,</l>
               <l>To what, in the End, did their Conqueſt amount?</l>
               <l>With their Boaſts, and their Brags, and their Shouts of Applauſe,</l>
               <l>It but ſav'd them from Ruin,—not ruin'd our Cauſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But leaving the Weight of political Cares</l>
               <l>To thoſe, who are plac'd at the Helm of Affairs,</l>
               <l>To the Humours of Fortune in all Things reſign'd,</l>
               <l>I mean by my Viſit to put you in Mind,</l>
               <l>That, as true as a Clock, both early and late,</l>
               <l>With the News of the Day I have knock'd at your Gate,</l>
               <l>And gave you to know what the World was a-doing,</l>
               <l>What LOUIS intended, or GEORGE was a-brewing.</l>
               <l>If ſometimes the Papers were trifling and flat,</l>
               <l>And the News went againſt us,—I cou'dn't help that;</l>
               <l>If Parties were angry, and vented their Spite,</l>
               <l>I bro't you their Wranglings,—not help'd them to write.</l>
               <l>I therefore preſume (and not without Reaſon)</l>
               <l>You'll remember your NEWSMAN, and think of the Seaſon;</l>
               <l>The Markets are high, and the Weather is cold;</l>
               <l>No <hi>Party</hi> I ſerve, and no <hi>Penſion</hi> I hold.</l>
               <l>We Hawkers are Men, and have Children and Wives</l>
               <l>To comfort our Hearts and to ſolace our Lives:</l>
               <l>But if I ſay more, you'll think it is Stuff;</l>
               <l>And <hi>a Word to the Wiſe is,</hi> in Reaſon, <hi>enough.</hi>
