         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And hence also it follow's that God never cutt's off the seed of his Servants from the special benefits of the Covenant, untill they have had the meanes thereunto, and they have positively rejected those meanes: and hence the Jewes (who are made the Pattern of what God will do toward all Gentile-churches, <hi>Rom.</hi> II.) were never cast off till by positive unbelief they provoked the Lord to break them off, by rejecting and refusing the meanes of their eternal peace</p>

            <p n="1">1. That as the Covenant run's not only thus, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>If thou believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou shalt be saved,</hi> but also <hi>I will enable to believe;</hi> So a mans entrance into Covenant is not only by actual and personal professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith [as some say] because God's Covenant run's a peg high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz:</hi>
               </abbr> to make and enable some to believe, and so to make that profession.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the very outward Covenant is not <hi>meerly conditional,</hi> but there is something <hi>absolute</hi> in it: and hence it follow's, that it is a great mistake of some who think that Circumcision, and Baptism, seal only conditionally [the outward Covenant being [say they] meerly conditionall] for those three things mentioned in the outward Covenant you see are in some respect absolute, and if the Covenant was only conditionall, then the Lord was no more in Covenant with Church-Members, than with pagans, and infidels, for it may be propounded conditionally to all such, that if they believe, they shall be saved, but assuredly God's grace is a little more extensive to the one, then to the other.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000082_0028_0F9F9187DBBD8C18"/>
3 Hence you may see what <hi>Circumcision</hi> once did, and <hi>Baptisme</hi> now <hi>seal's</hi> unto, even to Infants the seal is to confirm the Covenant: the Covenant is, that God (outwardly at least) owne's them, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon's them among his people, and Children, within his visible Church and Kingdome, and that here upon he will prune, and cutt, and dresse, and water them, and improve the means of their eternal good upon them, which good they shall have, unless they refuse in resisting the means; nay that he will take away this refuseing heart from among them indefinitely, so that though every one cannot assure himself, that he will do it particularly for this or that person, yet every one, through this promise, may hope, and pray for the communication of this grace, and so feel it in time.</p>
            <p>These things thus premised, to clear up the ensuing discourse, I shall now do two things. 1. Leave a few grounds and reasons to prove, <hi>that Children are in Church-Covenant, and so enjoy Church-Membership by their parents.</hi> 2. I shall then <hi>Answer your scruples.</hi>

            <p>Again it is confessed, that the <hi>external administrations</hi> of this one &amp; the same covenant, are diverse; but still <hi>the Covenant for substance</hi> is the same: For that old covenant was dispensed with other external signes, sacrifices, types, prophesies, then this under the new.

hence also it follow's that if they were Members as Believers, then not as Members of that nation.

               </gap>as then as carefull of keeping his Church holy as in these dayes, especially in the first constitution of it, as in this of Abrahams <hi>Gen.</hi>

               </gap>7. And hence God was as much provoked by their unholiness then, as by any unholiness now, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 16. Suppose therefore (as you imagine) that all the houshold, whether prophane or holy, were to be received into the Covenant, and so to the seal of it, do you think that this course of admitting all prophane persons then, would not make the Lord soon weary of, and angry with those family-churches, as well as of national, or congregational now, upon the like suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition? if therefore any servants born in the house, or hired, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, surely they were not such unholy ones, whom the Lord could not but be as much angry with, then as now; but they were godly and holy, at least in outward profession, upon which ground the Lord commanded them to be <hi>Circumcised.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know there are some and very holy &amp; learned also, who think that if any godly man undertakes to be <hi>as a father</hi> to an <hi>adopted Pagan or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> that such an one, not grown up to yeares, is from the example in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. to be received into the Covenant of the Church, and the seale of it: and I confess, I yet see no convicting argument against it, if it could be proved that some servants bought with Abraham's money were such, and were under years, but I see as yet no convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing argument for this assertion from this example; and therefore
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000082_0035_0F9F9193E4A0B198"/>
I stick to the former answer, and see no reason, from any rule of charity, but to believe that all those in Abrahams family, were either visibly godly or the children of such; to whom Circumcision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long's: and consequently might as well partake of Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as Abraham himself; which sort of servants in these dayes may as well be admitted to Church-membership, without fear of defiling the Church, as their masters themselves.</p>

               <hi>Answ.

So 'tis among children, they are all outwardly holy, yet many of them may be inwardly unholy, like Esau, must we not therfore accept them to Membership? It is a miserable mistake to think that inward reall holyness is the only ground of admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Church-Membership, as some <hi>Anabaptists</hi> dispute, but it is fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holyness, whether externally professed as in grown persons, or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously promised unto their seed.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> This similitude of marriage doth neither prove, nor illust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the thing; For the relation between father and such children is absolute &amp; natural, and hence continues though they say he shall not be their father, and though he profess he will not; but the relation founded upon Church-covenant, between member and member, is not natural, nor only, and allway absolute; but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, which condition not being kept, the relation may be, and is usually broken; for look as the <hi>Jews</hi> were not so absolutely God's people, but if they did in time <hi>reject</hi> the Gospel, they were to be cast off, and indeed are so at this day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 13 46; 51. So 'tis with all Gentile Churches, and the members thereof:&amp; as for that which you last say, That <hi>they may refuse their Parents Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant at age, as well as own it, and so may members go out at pleasure,</hi> which is disorder. <hi>I answer,</hi> That the like may be said of such members as come in by personal profession, for they may renounce their own Covenant with God and the Church, one may doe so, and so may twentie, yet though this be wickedness and disorder, yet the Church may proceed against them, and so it may against their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are bound to own the Covenant made with God, and of God with them in their Parents, as well as any Church-Members are to own their own Covenant by their own personal profession. What disorder therfore will come in as you conceive this way will come in by your own way, and what course you should take to heal the one, by the same you may heal the other.</p>

            <p>Thus you see an answer to your <hi>Six Objections.</hi> In the end of your paper there are <hi>TWO QUESTIONS,</hi> which I suppose may not a little trouble against their Baptisme and membership. To these briefly.</p>
            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>What good (say you) is it, either for a wicked, or an elect Child, till he be converted, to be in the Church? or what good may any have by being in the Church, till they can profit by what they enjoy?</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>What profit is it to persons grown up to yeares, and yet secretly hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, who enter into the Church by profession of the faith?</hi> you will say there is good and profit in respect of the priviledges themselves, but they abusing them they had, in this respect, better have been without them, because they bring hereby upon themselves greater condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               </hi> then of a <hi>Letter,</hi> to clear up the benefits from all Scruples, arising by being in outward Covenant, in Church fellowship, even unto Infants: I confess I find little said by <hi>Writers</hi> upon this Subject, &amp; I believe the doubts against <hi>childrens Baptisme,</hi> as they arise by blindness in this particular; so I think that God suffers that opinion to take place, that by such dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he may bring out light in this particular. I will only hint unto you some few of my many thoughts, which have long exercised me for many yeares in this thing. The <hi>good</hi> by childrens <hi>membership,</hi> especially when <hi>Sealed,</hi> is in four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In respect of God.</hi> God shews hereby the riches of <hi>his grace</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, in <hi>taking them to be his people: In Adopting them to be his children: In preventing them with many special promises aforehand of doing them good;</hi> by all which, the Lord doth as it were <hi>prevent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> in wooing their hearts as it were, so soon to draw them to him before he can actually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

So that I beseech you consider, suppose they cannot as yet understand, and so make profit by all this, yet is it not good for them, or for any of us to partake of Gods grace, before we know how to make use of it? is it not good for God to be good to them that are evil? is it not good for God to glorifie &amp; make manifest his grace to man, though man knowes not how to make use of his grace? was it not rich grace for <hi>Christ</hi> to wash <hi>Peters</hi> feet, and yet he not know at present what it meant, only (saith Christ) <hi>thou shalt know it afterward?</hi> is it not good for God to give life to us, and to let us be born in such and such a place of the Gospel where it is preached, and to lay in mercy aforehand for us, before we know how to be thankfull, or know how to use any of these outward mercies? and is it no mercy or favour to have so much spiritual mercy bestowed on children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, before they can be thankfull, or make use thereof? <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6, 7.

               <hi>because God loved them,</hi> this love was not Electing, &amp; peculiar love, (for thousands of these perished and went to hell) but it was his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall adopting love</hi> to choose them to be his people, and to improve all means for their good, and to give them the good of all those means unless they refuse: and to give indefinitely among them, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to many of them, such hearts as that they shall not be able to refuse the good of those meanes (as hath been shewed formerly) this is love, great love &amp; mercy; not shewn or promised to any who are not of the visible Church throughout the whole world. By which God is glorified; &amp; let him be so, though we cannot see how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it, when it first break's out; Have not you profited much by considering Gods preventing grace, long before you understood how to make use of it? hath not God received much glory from you for it? hath this grace then think you, been unprofitably spent on Gods part?
