         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AT the cloſe of July 1796, the French army, in two columns, drew nigh to the Auſtrian territories in Suabia; and upon the third of Auguſt the advanced guard of the right wing of the army of the Rhine and Moſelle, commanded by brigadier gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Abat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon the 4th of Auguſt, Ferino required from the town of Altorf a preſent of 300 louis for himſelf and the officers of his ſtaff, for which he promiſed his future protection to that place and its inhabitants. In like manner Tarreau extorted 125 louis from five ſmall villages, whilſt his worthy colleague Stouhlen, the commiſſary at war, at the ſame time impoſed the moſt exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant contributions of proviſions and clothing, the greater part of which he ſold, and then exacted the delivery of ſimilar arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Such oppreſſive conduct, joined to the ravages of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery and their inhuman treatment of the inhabitants, ſo enraged the peaſantry, that they took up arms to oppoſe force by force, and ſome villagers actually attacked a detachment of 30 men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the brigade of general Rouſſeau, who had, during their march, committed a variety of exceſſes, and of whom they killed five, wounded ſeveral, and put the reſt to flight. Upon the 8th of Auguſt this account was brought to that general, who was then at Altorf, and who ordered the ſtricteſt ſearch to be made for the ringleaders, when ſix peaſants were brought before him, and every one trembled for their lives, and the ſafety of the village. But Rouſſeau acted with more humanity and juſtice than perhaps any other general in the French army would have done on ſuch an occaſion; for after confining the peaſants during ſeveral days, he reckoned as part of their puniſhment their conſtant apprehenſion of approaching death, and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, after requiring and receiving an oblation of 200 louis, which were readily given to him, with great admiration of his lenity.</p>
               <p>The prudence and activity of the chief magiſtrate had ſaved Altorf from much oppreſſion, and its ſuture ſecurity was thought to be enſured by the appearance of an Imperial detachment upon the 29th of September, which was received with the greateſt joy by the inhabitants, when their hopes were moſt cruelly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by a dreadful engagement upon the following day. For the Auſtrian general Klingling, at the head of 2400 men, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken a poſition in the neighbourhood of Altorf, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced guard having repulſed a patrole of ſixty French Huſſars, this ſkirmiſh gave time for the main body of the French under general Ferino to advance, when the engagement ſoon became ſerious and general, and the Auſtrains having planted their artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery upon a hill ſouth of the town, the French in three columns, to the number of 10, 000. puſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033325_0004_0FF6C64D33EAF848"/>however they continued to engage with great bravery in the ſtreets of Altorf, upon the neighboring heights, and within the walls of the Benedict ac abbey of Weingarten, in hopes that they ſhould be reinforced by general Mercantin according to the plan which had been arranged. But ſuch were the force and ſituation of the French army that general Mercantin was not even able to inform Klingling of the obſtacles which prevented the intended junction; and to this is to be attributed the ill ſucceſs of the day.</p>
               <p>The abbey ſuffered ſeverely, both during and after the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for 500 of the enemy, burning with rage, and greedy of plunder, ruſhed into the convent, rifled every coffer and every cloſet, ranſacked every room from the garret to the cellar, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the greateſt part of the furniture, beat and wounded the prieſts and their attendants, robbed them of the money in their pockets, and carried away all the plate, linen, cloth, leather, and other articles, exclaiming, that it was their lawful booty. During theſe tranſactions, the ſame were carrying on in the town of Altorf, and many houſes were pillaged, even during the engagament. But this was only a prelude to greater and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued perſecution; for during five long and ſorrowful days were the town and convent abandoned to the extortion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries and officers, and to the exceſſes and rapacity of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. It ſeemed as if hell had opened and diſcharged upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf its moſt reprobate and execrable demons; for there is no enormity, however horrible, that was not perpetrated during thoſe painfully memorable days.</p>
               <p>The troops had no ſooner quitted the abbey, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries appeared there for the purpoſe of plundering in the name of the French republic, by exacting the moſt unheard of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, which were extorted by force of arms, and under me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of conflagration and the ſword. The whole ſtock of corn, of different kinds, all the cattle, all the wine and ſpirits, and, in ſhort, all the neceſſaries of life, were ordered to be delivered, either at the camp or into the hands of thoſe privileged locuſts. One loaded waggon ſucceded another, conveying away the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and at laſt, the empty caſks, ſacks, and common houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold furniture, were carried off, the horſes were ſtolen out of the fields, many of the articles were ſold or wantonly deſtroyed, and others were inſiſted upon in their ſtead. The fury of theſe banditti increaſed in proportion as their booty was diminiſhed by their numerous thefts; and under pretence of ſearching for hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den treaſure and concealed arms, they were guilty of the moſt barbarous exceſſes. Whoever refuſed to part with the ſhirt upon
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033325_0005_0FF6C64EED918318"/>his back was conſidered as a conſpirator againſt the French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, accuſed of not being a good patriot, and cruelly beaten, or maimed with a broad ſword; and the prelate of the abbey was upon the point of being hanged whilſt on his way to intreat the clemency of the commander in chief, and was ſaved only by the timely interference of an officer, who was more than commonly humane.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the firſt night after the engagement, ſome of the ſoldiers purpoſely and wantonly ſet fire to two houſes in the town, and would not permit any attempts to be made to quench the flames. Several other houſes were more than half conſumed by fire, in conſequence of their ſcattering red hot coals and burning candles about the rooms, under the beds and amongſt every heap of combuſtibles they could diſcover, ſo that nothing but the great vigilance and exertions of the proprietors could have prevented the entire deſtruction of the town.</p>
               <p>When Altorf was reduced to ſuch poverty as to afford no further temptation to the pillagers, they ſpread themſelves in bands over the ſurrounding country, attacked the cottages and habitations of the peaſantry (to whom they had promiſed liberty, equality and affluence) rifled their pockets, deſtroyed their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, tore up the floors of their rooms, cut open the mattreſſes and feather beds, dug up the ground in the cellars and gardens, turned over even the contents of the privies, in hopes of finding ſome concealed treaſure, returned ſix or ſeven times to the ſame houſes, and never quitted them until they had left nothing behind them but the bare walls. Oxen, cows and ſwine, were either driven off, cut in pieces upon the ſpot; or left cruelly mutilated; geeſe and poultry were carried away either dead or alive; and ſuch proviſions as could not either be conſumed or conveyed away were trodden under foot, or mixed with ſand, aſhes and ordure; nor did theſe ruffians ſpare even the ſtores of bread, which it is uſual in that country to keep dried for conſumption in the winter. Many cellars were left half full of wine, which had run from the caſks they had wantonly ſtaved; and the houſes were long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards impregnated with the vapour of the brandy which they had poured about the rooms in the moſt waſteful manner. They deſtroyed even the milk-pails and the appendages of the dairy; and in many dwellings there was not even a bench or a chair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken. The peaſants were ſometimes threatened with imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death, and ſometimes put to extreme torture, in order to procure a diſcovery of money and other valuables, which they were accuſed of having concealed; and many were ſeverely wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033325_0005_0FF6C64EED918318"/>and crippled, either by muſket balls, blows with the but ends of the firelocks, or ſtrokes of the broad ſword. The deepeſt and moſt apparent poverty was not even a protection againſt them; for beggars were ſtripped of their rags; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who were left without a ſhirt upon their back is by no means inconſiderable. Grey hairs and liſping infancy, the ſick, the dying, and even women in labour, were alike expoſed to the moſt inhuman treatment, and were dragged from their beds, kicked about, and frequently wounded, under pretence that they were the keepers of concealed treaſure. The women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther age nor infirmity, nor yet the moſt offenſive diſorders, were able to ſet bounds to their more than brutal luſt; and ten, twelve, and even twenty of theſe depraved wretches are known ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have gratified their paſſions with the ſame object, whilſt their flameleſs colleagues either kept guard at the door, or held loaded piſtols and fixed bayonets at the head of the unhappy ſufferer. Even in the infirmary near Weingarten did theſe cannibals com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame horrid crimes, and outrage perſons ſuffering under the moſt diſguſting maladies, and ſuch as preclude them from communication with the reſt of mankind.

Determined however to revenge themſelves, they ſet fire to the dwelling, which, with the furniture, granary, and every thing but the cattle, became a prey to the flames. Three other houſes met a ſimilar fate, and the damages fuſtained by this and an adjoining village amounted in contributions and in loſſes by plunder and conflagration, to the ſum of 44, 824 florins, or above £. 4, 000 ſterling.</p>
               <p>Not a trace of decency, not the leaſt regard to religion and its cuſtoms, appeared in the conduct of the French ſoldiery. In the churches they broke open the pyx, trampled the hoſt under foot, carried away the communion plate and the robes of the prieſts, deſtroyed the crucifixes and other images, and treated with ignominy every thing that is deemed holy by the catholic, and reſpected by the well meaning man of every religion. In one of the villages, where the church was ſtripped of its ornaments, and the miniſter completely pillaged, they placed upon the altar the figure of Satan, which they had taken from the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Redeemer tempted in the deſert; and in another vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage they placed a crucifix before the fire, and amidſt ſhouts of moſt indecent mirth, turned it round like meat roaſting upon a ſpit, whilſt the grey headed miniſter of the pariſh, at the vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able age of eighty-three, was not only plundered and inſulted, but ſeverely beaten, as a reward for the hoſpitality with which he had received them. And indeed it ought not to be forgotten, that, with very few exceptions, the moſt brutal actions and the greateſt exceſſes were committed in the houſe of thoſe, who, by anticipation of their wiſhes, or promptitude in execution of their orders, endeavoured to diſarm their ferocity, and ſecure protection and tranquility.</p>
               <p>It was not until the fifth of October that this diſtrict was relieved from the Republican troops, and from the tribe of Jews, ſpies, and traiterous informers, the refuſe of Suabia, who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the French army, and greatly contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The damages ſuſtained by the Abbey of Weingarten, by pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and requiſitions, amounted to 257, 082 florins; thoſe incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the town of Altorf, to 93, 229 florins; and the whole amount of damages ſuſtained by this diſtrict was 500, 000 florins, or upwards of 45, 000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling.</p>

               <p>Upon the ſecond of Auguſt 1796, a diviſion of the column under the orders of general Ferino marched through this village, when ſome chaſſeurs belonging to the advanced guard entered a ſhop, and forcibly took ſilk handkerchiefs and other goods to the value of 100 florins, for which they offered ſome aſſignats in payment; but upon the ſhopkeeper refuſing to take ſuch uſeleſs paper, they ſtruck at him with their ſabres, and left the ſhop with ſhouts of laughter and torrents of abuſe. Five others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the houſe of one of the magiſtrates, loudly aſking for wine and victuals, with which they were ſpeedily and amply ſerved, and for which they teſtified their gratitude by robbing their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainer of his watch and money. The ſame night they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened an inhabitant with death for telling an officer who wanted to put his carriage into his barn, that there was no room for it; and his life was with difficulty ſaved by a magiſtrate, who had him conveyed to the town priſon, (as a place of ſafety for the enemy) under promiſe that he ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>In the neighbouring village of Neubronn, belonging to the prince of Fruſtenberg, ſix riflemen impoſed a contribution of 400 florins, or about 27<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, pillaged ſeveral houſes, and ſo ill treated ſuch as endeavoured to protect their property, and to reſiſt the inſults offered to their wives and daughters, that many honeſt and induſtrious labourers were reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>If the rough and barbarous manner in which theſe armed ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians extorted what they wanted excited terror and deteſtation, their intemperance gave riſe to an equal degree of aſtoniſhment; for two Frenchmen would devour at a meal as much as would ſerve three hard working Germans during three or four days; and between the hours of two and nine, they would frequently have three complete meals, which they generally moiſtened with whole rivers of wine, plentifully ſweetened with ſugar, and uſually ſtrengthened with cherry brandy.</p>
               <p>Pfullendorf and the adjacent villages, ſuffered however, but little, in compariſon with other places, until the enemy began to retreat, when the French not only carried away or deſtroyed all the forage and corn they could find, but ſo entirely demoliſhed a ſmall hamlet in the neighbourhood, by breaking the windows, forcing open the doors, and deſtroying all the beds and other furniture in the houſes, as to oblige the owners to have recourſe to their neighbours for lodging and ſubſiſtence. After the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033325_0007_0FF6C655371355B0"/>at Biberach, upon the 2d of October, which was very deſtructive on both ſides, without altering the ſituation of affairs, the French main hoſpital was removed to Pfullendorf. The enormity of the requiſitions for this hoſpital was equalled only by the waſte and the frauds commmitted by the officiers de ſante (the phyſicians and ſurgeons) who publicly ſold the ſugar, and were more occupied in bargaining for the ſale of ſuch other articles as they had extorted, than buſied in attending to the wants of the ſick.</p>
               <p>Upon the fifth of October, general Moreau himſelf fixed his head quarters at Pfullendorf, and was followed by his whole army, which was diſtributed about the country, and, like the preceding hordes, rendered itſelf forever infamous by the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of every ſavage paſſion, the commiſſion of every ſort of exceſs, and the practice of every ſpecies of extortion.

A ſervant at the hoſpital of Pfullendorf, who ſerved as guide to a dragoon, was ſhot by the blood thirſty villain without any provocation, and ſo grievouſly wounded, that he ſhortly after expired. Two labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and a ſhoemaker were murdered in another place by ſome of the ſtraggling ſoldiers, for endeavouring to prevent ſome attro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious action, and for threatening to ring the alarm bell. A poor woman, 60 years of age, who was gleaning in a field, was forcibly thrown down by one of the Republican barbarians, and menaced with death if ſhe did not yield to his brutal deſires, whilſt another ſtood with his bayonet at the breaſt of her aged huſband, and forced him to be a witneſs of his wife's diſhonour. A church was broken open and plundered, and the miniſter's houſe completely rifled, under the eyes of general Moreau him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who to the lamentations of the ſufferer, contemptuouſly replied, "I cannot prevent it"—and quietly betook himſelf to his favourite cherry brandy, in which he indulged himſelf to exceſs, like the meaneſt of his ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the commiſſaries, who pillaged in the name of the Republic, one Nicolas particularly diſtinguiſhed himſelf; for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly required, as abſolutely neceſſary for the army, the delivery of ſuch an immenſe quantity of hay and corn as he was told, could not poſſibly be procured in ſo ſhort a time as he had mentioned, he made no ſcruple of declaring, that if a weighty purſe were offered to him for his own private uſe, he would ſay

Out of the many inſtances of fraud committed by the commiſſaries, we will mention one, which in ſeveral reſpects is not a little characteriſtic. One evening two of thoſe harpies required the delivery of 3000 pounds weight of beef upon the following morning; but the butcher ſuſpecting it to be a ſcheme to extort money, applied to an officer upon the ſtaff, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately agreed in opinion with the butchers, and gave them a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They followed his advice, were employed the whole night in ſlaughtering their beaſts, and were told the next day that the meat was not wanted.</p>

               <p>Before the armies of the French republic overran, vexed, and deſolated the Circle of Suabia, the inhabitants of the little town of Waldſee were enabled to form a correct judgment of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the republican troops, from the conduct of the French priſoners who had been originally quartered there between the 21ſt of December 1795 and 6th of July 1796, ſo that they heard of the approach of this lawleſs horde with more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions than the inhabitants of moſt other places. The French behaved more like conquerors than priſoners, not only towards the inhabitants, but towards the Auſtrian officers and ſoldiers; and when they heard that the whole French army had croſſed the Rhine, their outrageous joy knew no bounds. They inſulted the inhabitants in the groſſeſt terms, repaid the kindneſſes they had received with inſolence, and even with blows; began to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage the houſes of the peaſantry, robbed the gardens round the town, laid waſte the corn fields, endeavoured forcibly to diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our women and children, and by numerous exceſſes abuſed the kind and noble manner in which they had been treated by the Auſtrians. Several of the officers deceived the vigilance of the garriſon, and making excurſions to the neighboring free Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial towns of Ravenſburg and Biberach, reconnoitred the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and found many who, either out of intereſt or from attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the emiſſaries of liberty and equality, degraded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by carrying on a traiterous correſpondence with the enemy,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033325_0008_0FF6C65702FC9E30"/>and forwarding the diſpatches of the priſoners to the Directory, ſo that it is no longer to be wondered at that the leader of the Republican armies ſhould poſſeſs ſuch a circumſtantial knowledge of every diſtrict through which he was to paſs.</p>
               <p>Upon the 28th of July the Imperial general Frolich, at the head of his corps, quitted Waldſee, where he had arrived upon the preceding day, and being too weak ſucceſsfully to contend with the ſuperior numbers under the command of general Ferino, withdrew by Wurzach towards the Danube. He was followed by the emigrant legion amounting to nine or ten thouſand men, who upon the ſecond of Auguſt were at ſo ſhort a diſtance from Waldſee, that Ferino's advanced guard had puſhed within a mile and a half of their rear. Upon the following day a detachment of French infantry entered the town, and whilſt their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer was endeavouring to perſuade the magiſtrates that the inhabitants ſhould enjoy the moſt perfect ſecurity both in perſon and property, his ſoldiers forcibly entered the ſhops and carried away what they thought proper. The officer indeed ordered the goods to be reſtored, and appointed a non-commiſſioned officer to execute his commands; but only a few trifling articles were returned, and the non-commiſſioned officer publicly divided the reſt of the ſpoil amongſt his comrades, not failing to take due care of himſelf. Reeling with wine, and loaded with plunder, they quitted Waldſee in the evening, and were next morning ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by another detachment, five of whom haſtened to a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which they broke open and pillaged of the communion plate; after which they proceeded to a neighbouring village, plundered ſeveral houſes, and fired 15 times at one Beckhinger, a miller, who defended his property like a hero, and who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being himſelf wounded, ſhot one of the robbers dead upon the ſpot, broke the leg of another, and put the reſt to flight. In the mean time, thoſe in the town revelled in abundance; took the watches from the pockets of the inhabitants, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of paying in ſpecie for what they wanted, forced the tradeſmen to open their ſhops, took what articles they choſe, and paid for them in mandats and aſſignats.</p>
               <p>Upon the 7th of Auguſt, the advanced guard of the column commanded by general Ferino, amounting to 4, 000 men, under the orders of general Abbatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Others exacted a large quantity of diſhes, glaſſes, kitchen furniture, and proviſions for their reſpective corps in the neighbourhood of the town, but offered to relinquiſh the articles acquired for a certain compenſation in louis or dollars.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the maintenance of this rapacious ſoldiery, and of their numerous cavalry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> far ſurpaſſed the ability of this ſmall town, the commiſſaries ordered 300 buſhels of oats to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>At length, upon the 28th of September, the advanced guard of Ferino's column again marched into Waldſee, and was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeded by the main body of the army. The houſes were now crowded with ſoldiers, who committed every ſpecies of exceſs, and were even more fierce and malicious than before.

               <p>It was uſeleſs to complain to the general officers of the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable demands of the commiſſaries and the exceſſes of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, for their anſwer was, "Give them what they aſk for, and their extortions muſt neceſſarily terminate." And thus were they conſtrained to ſee all the proviſion of corn taken from the granary of the infirmary, and many of the inhabitants robbed of their whole ſtock of fodder for the winter. At midnight the whole army unexpectedly began to move, and commenced their march with burning torches and lighted endles in their hands; their retreat was covered by general Jordis, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a Frenchman was to be ſeen in or near the town of Wald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee; though upon their march a band of chaſſeurs ſtraggled into an outlying hamlet, and demanded the immediate payment of 12 louis as a contribution; but the peaſantry not producing it ſo ſpeedily as was expected, the banditti ruſhed into their houſes, deſtroyed every thing too bulky to be carried off, and rolling the winter ſtock of bread in filth and ordure, with malicious and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan-like ſhouts of laughter, offered it to the unfortunate and helpleſs labourers. When about 10<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling had been collected with much difficulty, and under continual dread of being maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred, theſe unhappy people were under the neceſſity of uſing the moſt humiliating entreaties to their plunderers to accept this ſacrifice, and do them no further injury.</p>
               <p>The damages incurred by the inhabitants of Waldſee, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this fraternal viſit from the <hi>great</hi> nation, amounted to 45,000 florins, or upwards of 4,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling.</p>

               <p>When the French appeared upon the banks of the lake of Conſtance, their leaders affected to be ſurpriſed that people ſhould be afraid of them, and that many ſhould deſert the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: "For," ſaid they, "we are only come to offer peace to the Emperor, and not to violate either your religion, your cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, your perſons, or your property, all which ſhall be moſt carefully reſpected and preſerved."

Tranquilized by this ſerious declaration the deputies returned home, and upon the third of Auguſt, at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the French, to the number of 6000 men, entered Markdorf and the neighbouring hamlets, and were entertained as liberally as poſſible by the inhabitants. But they ſoon began to break open doors and commit thefts, even under the eyes of the ſtaff officers, and ſome of the horde ſpread themſelves over the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding country, where theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length three volunteers were arreſted for having robbed a public meſſenger upon the highway of two watches and his money, and afterwards wounded him in the head with a bayonet, becauſe he complained of their ill uſage. A court martial immediately paſſed ſentence of death upon one of the malefactors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the others to the galleys, which latter part of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>No man knew better than Tarreau how to reap where he had not ſown, and no ſooner was he arrived at the caſtle of Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf than he began to demean himſelf like a madman, furiouſly complaining that bread had not been purpoſely baked for his army, although he knew that it was impoſſible to prepare ſuch a quantity upon ſuch ſhort notice, and that the troops had been ſo liberally treated with bread and wine upon their arrival. "If you don't inſtantly provide bread enough," ſaid he with a thundering voice, "I will give orders to my whole brigade to fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>out immediately iſſued a requiſition, by which 18,000 pounds weight of bread were ordered to be baked before nine o'clock at night, under the penalty of the town being given up to be plundered by the ſoldiers. The chief magiſtrate not aware that this was only a premiditated ſcheme to raiſe money, was full of anxiety for the town, well knowing that ſuch a proviſion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033325_0010_0FF6C65D0C8F0AC8"/>could not poſſibly be made in ſo ſhort a time; but he was ſoon relieved from his diſtreſs by a viſit from Labrouſſe, one of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ides-de-camp, and his faithful colleague in the arts of extortion, who adviſed him to pacify the general by a preſent of two gold watches. "But," added he, "you muſt not hint that I gave you this advice, for the general is a man of the <hi>moſt delicate feelings,</hi> and the <hi>niceſt honour.</hi>" Two handſome gold watches were immediately procured, and offered to Tarreau, whoſe fury abated, and whoſe brow was ſmoothed; whilſt Stouhlen tore in pieces the requiſition for the 18,000 pounds of bread. and ſaid, "Let them bake what they can"—and ſo ended the farce.</p>
               <p>The column ſoon afterwards proceeded on its march; but two days afterwards Stouhlen ſent a demand for 9,000 pounds weight of bread, which were delivered to him, and Markdorf was relieved from farther contributions, until the cloſe of September, though it ſtill ſuffered much from the exactions and thefts committed by the troops, who were continually marching to and fro.</p>
               <p>The retreat at length took place, and upon the 22d of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember the head quarters were fixed at Hofen, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Markdorf, which, with the adjoining villages, now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced every ſort of oppreſſion. Two of the commiſſaries, eſtabliſhed at different places near Markdorf, at the ſame time and with ſimilar menaces, required from that town the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant ſupplies; ſo that it was expoſed to the mercileſs attacks of thoſe harpies, without a poſſibility of redreſs, and requiſition ſucceeded requiſition. The deputy commiſſaries alſo viſited the adjacent country with their exactions, and obliged the peaſants either to comply with their demands, or to purchaſe their exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with gold. "We coin requiſitions like money," ſaid the commiſſary Nonette, who, like his brethem, readily and public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiſted from levying contributions in return for a preſent to himſelf; and the town of Markdorf was forced to pay him in caſh the value of 20 tons of hay and of 25 ſacks of oats, in order to prevent the threatened general pillage by the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery; nor could the execution of a ſimilar menace from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commiſſary be averted but by a well-timed preſent to his ſecretary.</p>
               <p>Upon, the morning of the fifth of October, Tarreau arrived at Markdorf with his ſtaff, and finding that his head quarters had been eſtabliſhed at the inn, he galloped up to the Caſtle, and vehemently demanding why it had not been prepared for his
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033325_0011_0FF6C65EE2CC7668"/>reception, added, ſpeaking to the burgomaſter, <q>But I know you had much rather entertain the Imperialiſts; here in the Caſtle, however, will I lodge, and if in the courſe of two hours five beds are not prepared for me and my ſtaff, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 25 laſhes, to be repeated every hour, until my orders are obeyed.</q> The beds were accordingly prepared; but Tarreau's wrath was not appeaſed; and it approached almoſt to madneſs, when late at night he received an order for the army to continue its retreat early the next morning. The people of Markdorf paſſed this whole night in the greateſt anxiety; for Tarreau had more than ten times threatened to ſet fire to the town in four different places, and his ungovernable rage gave them good reaſon to apprehend the worſt; they were, however, fortunate enough to eſcape the conflagration, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the barbarian marched away with his diviſion, followed by the execrations of the whole country, who upon the ſame day joyfully received the Auſtrians as their deliverers from the iron yoke which had been impoſed by theſe champions in the cauſe of liberty and equality. Their viſitations coſt the inhabitants of Markdorf near 40,000 florins, or about £ 3,600 ſterling; a large ſum, conſidering that the town did not contain more than 350 heads of families, few of whom were in a ſtate of affluence, and that they had, during ſome years, been very unſucceſsful in the culture and produce of their vineyards.</p>
               <p>It ought not to be forgotten, that in a hamlet near the town, ten brutal French ſoldiers alternately violated the chaſtity of a woman, who hourly expected to be taken in labour, and whoſe huſband was forcibly made a witneſs of their barbarity. An offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer too, whoſe aſſiſtance had been requeſted by the neighbours, upon entering the houſe, was ſo far from reproving the ſoldiers, that—horrible to relate!—he immediately followed their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and added to the injuries already offered to the expiring woman. In another village, a woman who had only borne a child about eight days, was diſhonoured and treated with ſuch violence that her recovery was extremely doubtful, and when, in deſpair, ſhe fled from them in her ſhift, and with her infant in her arms, ſhe was purſued by the looſe jokes and malign ſhouts of theſe inhuman ſons of Satan, over whoſe other atrocious actions in this diſtrict it is now time to throw a veil.</p>

               <head>MEERSBURG. A town upon the banks of the Lake of Conſtance, in the circle of Suabia, and the reſidence of the prince-biſhop of Conſtance.</head>
               <p>Advice having been received at this town upon the 18th of September, that the diviſion of the French army under general Tarreau, was retreating through that part of Suabia, the gates of the town were ordered to be ſhut; and, according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Notwithſtanding this precaution the inns were ſoon filled with French ſoldiers, and the ſtables were crowded with horſes they had ſtolen upon the march; and ſuch as could not gain admittance were amply provided with meat and drink at the gates of the town. Three days afterwards, Tarreau, who probably had long wiſhed for an oblation from Meerſburg, ſent the following deſpotic and alarming note to the magiſtrates; "I command you to appear at my head-quarters at Yſſni, in the courſe of twenty four hours." The Baron de Reichlin and two other reſpectable magiſtrates forthwith repaired to Yſſni, and were received by the aid-de camp Labrouſe, who reeling about half naked, greeted them in a thundering voice with "come in ſcoundrels as you are; your town ſhall ſpeedily be reduced to aſhes, and yourſelves exalted upon a gibbet;" and then placing a guard over them, and reaſſuring them, "that the ſun ſhould early the next morning light them on their way to the gallows," he ſtaggered into the apartment of Tarreau. The deputies at length diſcovered that their gaolers thir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon examination of the deputies the next morning, and upon their declaration that the gates had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ut by order of the governor, Labrouſe ordered two carriages to be prepared, and immediately drove with them, eſcorted by twenty huſſars, and preceded by a hangman to Meerſburg, when ſuch members of the regency as had not eſcaped were ſummoned and treated with the ſame inſolence and menances as the deputies had been ſubject to upon the preceding evening. Fire and ſword gallows and muſket ball, thundered inceſſantly from the lips of the tyrant, and he ſwore that the houſe of the governor ſhould inſtantly be reduced to ruins. At length after much altercation Labrouſſe detained two of the chief officers of ſtate as hoſtages,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033325_0012_0FF6C6626DB3DC10"/>and departed with them for head-quarters, where, whilſt the people of the town anxiouſly awaited the cataſtrophe, this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently tragical ſtory terminated in peaceful robbery. General Tarreau had an inclination for, and was complimented with a handſome carriage and two fine horſes belonging to one of the hoſtages, which, with a weighty purſe of gold, ſacrificed to him and his aſſiſtant Labrouſſe completed the expiation, though not until the friendſhip of the general's valet de chambre and cook had been purchaſed at the price of five louis each: for this knot of thieves was ſo cloſely united that it was not ſafe to paſs any of them unnoticed. Tarreau demanded alſo and received ſix horſes from the ſtables of the prince biſhop of Conſtance, and the commiſſary Didier impoſed upon the town of Meerſburg the moſt exorbitant contributions, which he afterwards withdrew upon receiving a preſent of ſixty louis and two fine horſes. Theſe are ſome of the many baſe actions of the French at Meerſburg, which though not generally plundered, was expoſed to much robbery and vexation; for ſome of the French, with an officer at their head forcibly entered a ſhop, and carried off goods to the value of ſeventy pounds ſterling; another party robbed a watchmaker of four gold and two ſilver watches; and ſeveral petty thefts were committed both by the officers and ſoldiers.</p>

All the coffers and cloſets were broken open and rifled—all the houſhold furniture was deſtroyed— the peaſants were required, with loaded piſtols at their breaſts, to deliver up their money—the beds and bedding were unripped and examined—and under pretence of ſearching for concealed treaſure, not only the floors of the rooms were torn up, but even infants were vehemently dragged from their cradles, and many families were deprived of nearly all their property. But ſtill more terrible to theſe peaceable and innocent country people was the infernal manner in which the female ſex was treated by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A party of grenadiers came to the houſe of a farmer and innkeeper in another village, and after being liberally ſupplied with proviſions, ſuddenly attacked the maſter of the houſe calling out in the language of highwaymen, "Your money or your life;" and when they had ſecured all the money he had about him, they forcibly threw him upon the ground and beat him, broke open and plundered all his cheſts and coffers, and were upon the point of departing with their booty, when they were joined by nine dragoons, who, after indulging themſelves with the contents of the cellar, diſcharged th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This place was viſited, upon the 18th of July 1796, by four mounted artillery men in ragged uniforms, who, in the ſtyle of a requiſition, demanded 66 ſacks of oats, and three waggon loads of hay, which were no ſooner delivered to them, than they conveyed them to a neighbouring town, and there ſold them for ready money.</p>
               <p>In the ſame month the environs were curſed with the preſence of general Tuncq, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This general choſe, as articles of plunder, wood and flax, and obliged the Baron de Schonaw, chief proprietor of Wehr, to cut down and deliver, in the courſe of five days 372 oaks and other trees, which he floated down the Rhine into Switzerland, where he had previouſly fixed an agent, who ſold the wood, and divided the ſpoil with his employer. When the chiefs of ſeveral vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages repreſented to him the impoſſibility of furniſhing what he required, he ordered them to be beaten, and chained together, and thrown into priſon like common malefactors. It is true, that upon complaint to the Directory, Tuncq was brought to a court martial and degraded, and that his aid-de-camp found it prudent to retreat with part of his booty; but no recompence was made to thoſe whom he had injured and plundered, and other privileged thieves, under the denomination of commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and agents, appeared in their room, and were ſanctioned in their numerous oppreſſions.</p>
               <p>Upon the 20th of October, in the afternoon, the rear guard (in every reſpect the refuſe) of the army of the Rhine and Moſelle appeared at Wehr, and encamped under the walls of the caſtle. The women and children now fled up the country with part of their cattle and effects, and took refuge in a wood; but the family in the caſtle and all the men remained at home, with the hope of in ſome degree, preventing the evils they ſo juſtly dreaded. The firſt ſet of banditti began their operations by plundering the villages, and in the courſe of three hours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to their camp 120 ſwine, 62 ſheep, 36 calves, a great quantity of poultry, and upwards of 1200 ſheaves of wheat; and finiſhed by tearing the ſhoes from off the feet of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033325_0013_0FF6C6642EF55CC0"/>The next viſit was from a party of huſſars headed by a colonel Marulat who appeared late in the evening, drank all the wine and ſpirits in the village of Wehr, and miſuſed thoſe who were not able to afford them any; and at midnight, when all was quiet, 600 volunteers, with bayonets fixed, appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the caſtle, and loudly called for 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>600 bottles of wine, at the ſame time threatening to ſet fire to the village and caſtle if their demand was not immediately complied with.

               <p>UPON the firſt days of October, a detachment of the army of the Rhine and Moſelle over-ran this village, and diſtinguiſhed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſuch exceſſes as cannot fail of ſtamping the <hi>Great Nation</hi> with everlaſting infamy. Not ſatisfied with the anticipation of their wiſhes by the inhabitants, they furiouſly ran about the ſtreet with drawn ſwords and cocked piſtols, broke into houſes, rifled the different apartments, carried away proviſions, kitchen uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, bedding, and wearing apparel, and wantonly deſtroyed what they could not convey away; ſo that the loſſes of the different proprietors amounted, upon the moſt moderate computation, to 21,000 florins, or nearly £ 2,000 ſterling. Thirty-ſix horſes, 96 ſwine, two bullocks fit for the ſlaughter-houſe, two calves, 150 geeſe, and a great quantity of poultry, formed one part of their ſpoil; and the miniſter of the pariſh, who was the principal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, loſt 60 louis in caſh, much ſilver plate, all his kitchen furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nearly all his clothes and houſehold linen, 5 beds, 35 ſacks of corn, and a large quantity of flour. Such of the corn and flour as they could not carry away, they rendered uſeleſs by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with duſt, aſhes and ordure: they alſo broke in pieces, the looking glaſſes, wardrobe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Of DUHEM, the General of Diviſion.</head>
               <head type="sub">At Fribourg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Briſgaw, in the circle of Suabia.</head>
               <p>UPON the 12th of October, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, orders were received to prepare quarters, in a gentleman's houſe, for a French general and four officers; ſoon after which appeared the general of diviſion Duhem, and a ſuite of 30 or 40 officers, ſeveral privates, and ſervants, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the greateſt complaiſance. But the general, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding tone, gave orders that a dinner, fit for a republican ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and twenty-five of his retinue, ſhould be provided at five o'clock, and he added, that he expected to be in all reſpects treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and attended according to his rank and dignity. Six rooms and the ſaloon were immediately opened; but the ſervants of the houſe not being able, in the hurry and confuſion, to find the keys of the other apartments, the general threatened to break open the doors, and his aid-de-camp began to talk about cudgels and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whips. Before I proceed, let me relate an anecdote of this aid-de-camp, highly characteriſtic of him and his aſſociates: Duhem hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iſſued an order that the magiſtrates of Fribourg ſhould furniſh the inſtruments uſed in the Turkiſh muſic, and they having repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the aid-de-camp the impoſſibility of obeying ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a demand, that ſhameleſs reprobate replied, "that if they would procure him a couple of handſome girls, they might keep the Turkiſh muſic for themſelves."</p>
               <p>The general, officers, and privates paſſed their whole time at the table, and every exertion was made to ſatisfy their gluttony, but in vain; for upon the 13th of October general Duhem, after bitterly complaining of his ordinary fare, with many threats commanded the delivery of 20 pounds weight of ſugar, 16 of coffee, 16 of rice, and 18 lemons, which he had no ſooner received, than he made a further demand of 50 bottles of champaigne, and 30 bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of ſweet wine; and the next morning, before his departure, he iſſued a freſh order for 50 more bottles of champaigne, which he received and conveyed away. Neither were his ſervants idle; for in the afternoon of the 13th of October, they broke into the ſaddle houſe, and plundered it of all the ſaddles and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they could find; and though the general and ſome of his officers ſaw them carry away their ſpoil, and were applied to for redreſs, they did not chuſe to liſten to the complaint, but ſuffered the booty to be carried off. When Duhem and his followers quitted the houſe, upon the fourteenth of October, it was diſcovered that they had left in their apartments and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033325_0016_0FF6C66D1912E260"/>beds the moſt filthy traces of their exiſtence, and that they had ſtolen ſeveral pairs of ſheets and a handſome counterpane, and rifled a portmanteau of its contents. The upper part of this houſe had been previouſly plundered by a commiſſary's aſſiſtant in July, and was now again publicly robbed, not by the ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable ſoldiery, but by a general, who affected to talk about diſcipline, and by his officers and ſervants. A French lieutenant had indeed been degraded and ſent to the galleys for levying a trifling contribution when the French firſt appeared at Fribourg; but that was done only to deceive the Germans until they had got a firm footing in the country, after which the incendiaries, murderers, and plunderers of all deſcriptions were ſuffered to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their ravages with impunity.</p>

               <p>UPON the fifth of October, whilſt a column of the army of the Rhine and Moſelle was retreating towards Switzerland, a party of the infantry marched acroſs the fields, plundered the two farm-houſes, ſtormed the convent, ſtripped the prieſts and their ſervants even of their ſhoes and neckcloths, and either car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away or deſtroyed all the bedding, and every thing elſe they could diſcover; and two cavalry officers, who appeared to have more humanity than their comrades, coming up an ordering them to deſiſt, were groſsly inſulted, deprived of their piſtols, and put to flight by the ſoldiers with their ſabres. The church was pillaged of the ſacerdotal garments and communion plate, and the greateſt indignities were offered to every thing that is deemed ſacred. Theſe exceſſes continued from eleven in the morning, until four in the afternoon; and the friars, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated blows, and threats of immediate death, loſt almoſt every thing but their lives.</p>

               <p>To this place of the 8th of October was a day of terror and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; and as the report of the French cruelties had already reached the ears of the inhabitants, the women and children fled, with ſome of their valuable effects, into an adjoining wood, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be there ſecure from the attacks of the ſoldiers, who were now upon their retreat, and entered the village, to the number of 3000. Some of them ſtopped at the parſonage, and demanded
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033325_0017_0FF6C66F6ADDC910"/>wine; but whilſt the miniſter was giving orders for its delivery, they dragged him into the cellar, and robbed him of his watch, whilſt others ſtole his horſes out of the adjoining paſture. In the mean time the heroes who, in the language of their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>had not ceaſed to deſerve well of their country,</hi> began pillaging with ſuch violence and rapacity, that the inhabitants were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by deſpair to attempt the protection of their property, which enraged the aggreſſors ſo much, that they threatened to burn the village, and would probably have done ſo, but for the exertions of ſome officers, and for the flight of the peaſants, whom they purſued towards the wood, where the ſhrieks of the women and children preſently diſcovered their retreat. When the ſoldiers had here ſatisfied their rapacity, and plundered the poor fugitives of nearly all that they poſſeſſed, they completed the tragedy with outrages the moſt ſhocking to humanity. Married women were diſhonoured in the preſence of their huſbands and children; and young girls were deſpoiled of their innocence under the eyes of their parents and companions. Even women, who had borne children only eight or ten days, were not ſafe from the diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful outrages of theſe inhuman wretches, who dragged the infants from their arms, and inſenſible to the agonizing ſcreams of the ſufferers, threatened the reſiſtance of their mothers with inſtant death.</p>

They broke into the dwelling of one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal farmers, carried off all the proviſions, linen, and wearing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, even of the children, and ſtole a waggon and four horſes, with which they conveyed away their booty; and moſt of the houſes in the village underwent a ſimilar fate. But the miniſter of the pariſh was one of the greateſt ſufferers; for not even age or ſevere illneſs could protect him from ill uſage, and from being dragged from his bed under pretence that he had concealed his money; after which they broke open his wardrobe and coffers, and carried away all his money, plate, houſehold linen, and wearing apparel.</p>

His followers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ranſacked every part of the houſe, and the ſoldiers either carried away or deſtroyed what had been left by their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; every thing was deemed lawful prey, and ſcarcely a houſe eſcaped without being completely pillaged. The beer in the caſks was waſted, large branclies of fruit trees were cut off, and even the water pipes were cut to pieces, ſo that the village remained four days without water. Women advanced in years, and girls who were hardly out of their childhood, were ſacrificed to the paſſions of theſe ſavages; and a French officer who attempted to put a ſtop to their brutality, was ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wounded by them, that he fell almoſt lifeleſs from his horſe. Duhem, who demanded a quantity of ſugar and coffee, and condeſcended to accept about three louis in their ſtead, marched out of Biburg the next morning; when it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that the great general and his gang underſtood the art of thieving and deſolating as well as the reſt of the banditti; for they had carried away all the plate and linen, let all the wine run out of the caſks in the cellar, and done all poſſible miſchief to the furniture.</p>

But this was only a prelude to greater calamities; for general Vandamme having, either through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or inattention, eſtabliſhed his military cheſt at Stozin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, under a ſmall guard, and an Auſtrian party, lying only five miles diſtant, having in the courſe of their patrole, fallen in with and carried it off, and made the guard priſoners, the inhabitants were accuſed of having given information to the Auſtrians, and a detachment, under the command of colonel Lavalle, arrived upon the 10th of Auguſt, with orders to ſet fire to the village. Old and young, and women with infants at the breaſt, rending the air with their lamentations, haſtily fled into the fields, and at four o'clock the cannons were pointed againſt the houſes, whilſt the huſſars and chaſſeurs with cocked piſtols and drawn ſwords, prevented the flight of the few who had remained there. One woman was killed by them upon the ſpot, and another died two days afterwards in conſequence of the blows ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon the breaſt with the but-end of a piſtol. Lavalle, after the moſt humiliating entreaties, at length yielded to the prayers of the clergy and other perſons, and promiſed to ſpare the town upon the payment of 1,000 louis, which condition, though tending to their ruin, was complied with; but moſt of the houſes were pillaged, ſeveral women were abuſed in the

From that period until the middle of September, not a day paſſed but the village was either plundered by ſoldiers or oppreſſed by commiſſaries armed with requiſitions; and as they conſtantly rendered uſeleſs what they could not carry away, the damages ſuſtained by the inhabitants amounted to upwards of 3,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling. But no adequate idea can be given of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties inflicted upon the men, and of the outrages committed againſt the women, both here and in the neighbouring towns and hamlets; it is, however, worthy of obſervation, that theſe ſelf-named protectors of the peaſantry ſeemed to take the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delight in robbing the houſes, and deſtroying the peace of that claſs of people, whoſe protection and welfare they and their employers have ſo frequently declared to be the chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their ambition.</p>

               <p>A man happening indiſcreetly to expreſs his joy at the retreat of the French, and the near approach of the Auſtrians, was ſhot at and mortally wounded; and another, who had expreſſed the ſame ſatisfaction, and had attempted to defend his property, was deliberately ſhot, after tearing his fleſh to pieces, and pulling his tongue out by the roots. Married women and girls, mothers and their daughters, who had hoped for ſafety in the church, were violated at the foot of the altar; and neither the venerable age of ſeventy or eighty years, nor the moſt loathſome diſorders and deformities, could check the paſſions of the invaders, who left behind them traces of diſeaſes, whoſe very names had until then been unknown in this ſequeſtered diſtrict. All the archives in the town-houſe were wantonly deſtroyed, the churches in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way profaned and defiled, and even the croſſes upon the graves of the dead were objects of their fury and paſſion for deſtruction.</p>

               <head>OF GENERAL TARREAU, At Hofen, a Benedictine convent, in Suabia, near the Lake of Conſtance.</head>
               <p>SEVERAL of the leaders of the French hordes have, by their miſdeeds, forever connected their names with infamy; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tarreau united in himſelf the ſeveral bad qualities of the reſt. and cannot be mentioned without horror and deteſtation. The moſt unbounded rapacity, inſatiable cruelty, intemperance, thirſt of revenge, vulgar inſolence, contempt of every thing ſacred and decent, and the diſavowal of all the feelings of humanity, formed the baſis of the character of this man, who in no country but in France, and there only under the auſpices of ſuch a revolution, could ever have been entruſted with the command of an army. Some of his monſtrous exceſſes have already been recorded, and it remains only to be told, that when the French were obliged to give way before the Auſtrians, this man, raging like a tiger that had loſt its prey, arrived upon the 23d of September at Hofen, where he eſtabliſhed his head-quarters, and with his worthy aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate Labrouſſe, and his confidential valet Laguerre, endeavoured to make himſelf a ſmall compenſation for the loſs of the ſpoils of Vienna, of which the French had thought themſelves ſecure. His whole character will beſt be known from the following dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful declaration, which was continually upon his lips, that "He only repented having at any time acted with humanity, and of not having converted into duſt and aſhes all the cities, villages, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033325_0020_0FF6C677B207A1E8"/>convents he had ſeen upon his march." His life at Hofen was one continued ſcene of cruelty, robbery, intemperance, and debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and upon the 23d of September he ſent a requiſition to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of 6,000 pints of brandy, to be delivered in 24 hours, under pain of being given up to be plundered by the ſoldiery. No more than half of the quantity demanded could be found in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and was ſent off towards head quarters by water, but was detained by contrary winds; upon which Farreau threatened not only to ſet fire to the town, but to put to death the chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and ſeveral others whom he detained as hoſtages, and who, after paſſing the night under the apprehenſions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The booty remained three days at head quarters, and was then ſold by the commiſſary Stouhlen to the neighbouring Swiſs; nor did the French ſoldiers taſte one drop of this liquor, which had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted under pretence that it was neceſſary for the army.</p>

               <p>THAT not only privates, but that even officers of rank, either pillaged or divided the ſpoil, is proved by innumerable inſtances, of which we think it neceſſary only to notice the following. A carriage laden with plunder, belonging to an officer upon the ſtaff, having broken down during the retreat of the French army, two of the inhabitants of the village of Eyken, where the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happened, were obliged inſtantly to provide another convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and re-load the booty, which was ſo ſpeedily and well exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that, contrary to their expectation, and to the uſual practice of his comrades, he rewarded them with 16 pounds weight of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and a complete ſet of joiners' tools! Another officer of rank ſold in the ſame village a bird cage and a Bohemian drinking glaſs for the ſum of about ſeven pence ſterling; and at Rheinfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, another officer having ſold a horſe to a Swiſs of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of Baſle for 9 louis, he no ſooner received the money than jumping upon the horſe he gallopped away, and diſappeared both with the horſe and money. A ſoldier having ſtripped a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſervant of the boots he was wearing, was, upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the ſervant to an officer, obliged to reſtore them; but the officer drawing them on, and finding that they fitted him, told the ſervant, in a jeering tone, that they were much too good
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033325_0020_0FF6C677B207A1E8"/>for him, and ſtrutted away with them. Whilſt the French were at Donauwerth, a general officer, accompanied by two officers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When Tarreau had his head quarters at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial town of Wangen, he made a requiſition of ſuch a quantity of corn as it was impoſſible for the municipality to furniſh; but the chief magiſtrate having received a hint that the general was very fond of cray-fiſh, he ſent him a preſent of ſome out of an adjoining lake, famous in Suabia for thoſe fiſh, with which the general was ſo pleaſed that he withdrew the demand for corn, but put in requiſition all the cray-fiſh in the lake for the daily ſupply of his table, as long as he ſhould remain there.

When theſe latter had ſwallowed up the neighbouring countries, they quarrelled with the Swiſs.

The Swiſs army was ſound; the people were brave and active; but what, with ſuch governors, were they to do againſt ten times their forces —They ruſhed on the enemy's cannon; were blown to pieces by thouſands. The women fought by the ſides of their huſbands; no leſs than <hi>eight hundred</hi> of them expired under the ſabres of the
