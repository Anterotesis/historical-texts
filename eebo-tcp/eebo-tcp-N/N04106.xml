            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT hath been an old Failing in Men, even as antient as the Fall of Man, to be apt and quick ſighted in other Mens faillings, and as blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in their own Infirmities: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its a great unhappineſs unto the whole human Race, that they cannot comply with this one Goſple Inſtruction (viz.) <hi>Caſt firſt the Beam out of thine own Eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clear to caſt the Mote out of thy Brothers Eye;</hi> the Misfortune of which ſad and unhappy Diſſaſter have been the chief cauſe of my appearing once more to publick View, as the Author of and Voucher to the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, by way of an Anſwer to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pamphlet handed about in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under the unproper, unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, inconſiſtent, undeſcreat, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of <hi>A Speech or Sermon made by way of a Charge unto a Grand-Jury,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005060_0004_1016980563F12430"/>which ſuits the Time, Purpoſe and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, juſt as much as the Propoſition whereupon the Theme is grounded ſuits good Chriſtian Mens Ears, or the Theme ſuits Goſpel and Truth, even juſt ſo much, after my Opinion: With what Views, Aims and Ends the honourable Author of ſuch Religious Chapters Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, ſuch Oration, at ſo an unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, unſeaſonable a Time, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent to the Matter at that Time in Hand: I ſhall not here undertake to determine, leaſt I ſhould controul the Authors Mentals, ſeeing he is ſo pleaſed to tell us, that it is purely out of Love and Good-will to Mankind and love of Truth: And if this be true its a good Morral; how Mean and Shallow ſo ever the Sences be that it proceeds from: And in that Nature it beſpeaks a very greatful Acceptance: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I miſtake the Authors Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſuſpect the verity of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and ſhould humbly conceive that it was ſome other Object that gave Conceptions to this Religious Plan: Why yet it fortuneth any ignorant miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, that the Maſter of theſe ſo lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005060_0005_10169806EC185C50"/>and plauſeable Performances, is ſaid to be a wiſe, politick, grave Man, and hath no doubt Wit enough to look upon the ſharp rebuke of Religious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, as they proceed from godly Love to his Soul, with ſuch Aſpects of good and godly Friendſhip, as all ſuch things in their own Nature require; therefore I begin to ſay, if I have good reaſon to believe that the Author of ſuch a claſhing, inconſiſtent Heap of Folly and Madneſs, is ſeven fold more under Miſtake and Error than thoſe that he travels to correct and reform, certainly if ever he did himſelf expect any Thanks ſuitable to his Toile, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Expence, for their Recovery; he will be ſo Modeſt as to return the ſame Meaſures unto any that at leaſt with as good Reaſon and Will labour to recover him from the like or worſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſter.</p>
            <p>I am bound in Conſcience to try to lift you out of the Bogg of the diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nature, and out of the dark Dungeon of Ignorance, and ſet you in the Light of the glorious Goſpel; and in order to that purpoſe it ſeems to me the beſt way
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005060_0006_1016980C5B863808"/>to take a retrograde Order, according to the Goſpel Rule, of beginning with the laſt firſt; for ſhould I firſt begin with the Propoſition upon which the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of your Pamphlet is grounded, that will certainly prove Falſe at the firſt Chop, and ſo then, according unto the Rules of Reaſon, my Work will be at an End as ſoon as I begin; becauſe it's a general Rule in Reaſons, <hi>That if the Propoſition be Falſe the Concluſion cannot be True:</hi> And it can be nothing but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity to look any further into a Place that we are ſure hath little or no Truth in it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things being thus premiſed, as an Introduction; I come now to the Matter.</p>
            <p>In an Advertiſement, in the <hi>Gazette</hi> of <hi>March the</hi> 3d 1741-2, the Gentleman, the Author of the Speech and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, was pleaſed to tell us that he was a united Member of a Society of Religious People called <hi>Quakers:</hi> And that Men might not take him for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt or a Deis-Man, he ſums up ſome of theſe extraordinary Principles that he would have Men think he holds in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005060_0007_1016980F00FB9640"/>with that Society, as Meekneſs, Humility, Charity, Patience, Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love, <hi>Not</hi> rendering Evil for Evil, nor Revilling even for Reveilling; I ſuppoſe for ſhortneſs ſake, he went no further, to ſhew what Principles he held in common with them of CHRIST and the Goſple; No, he hath done me ſo much Hardſhip as to leave me that Task to endeavour to do: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Indeed, that it was no Prudence in the Remark-Maker, be he who he will, to uſe ſuch provoking Language; nor can I take it for any Produce of any thing Divine, or of even good Morals either; for it's really abſurd to think to reduce Men to Reaſon by a huff of foul Words. And on the other Hand, I muſt ſay too, Men ought not to erect Hobgoblings and Mockings, fit for no other Purpoſe but to ſtart Paſſions in the weaker Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: I declare I do not know the Remark-Maker, nor do I aprove of his Method: But this is worthy to be ſaid of him, he really had more Wit then to Sum up the religious Principles he held, of not Rendering Evil for Evil,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005060_0008_10169810887CA350"/>nor even Reviling for Reviling: Whilſt he was in the act that theſe Principles ſo expreſly forbid: Nor was it a ſmall Surprize to me to ſee our ſo reported wiſe, grave, polite Author, make uſe of the like <hi>Paranomaſia,</hi> by myſtick Alluſions, and by expreſs Words to and by falſe Accuſations too, that are plain enough ſeen through: For through the Epithetes might ſhew him to be a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and hot Nature or Temper: Yet the Epithetes do not ſhew him to be an apoſtate Tool nora Time-ſerver either: But let not Truth any longer offend you [ſuppoſe I tell you in Truth and Honeſty, for I am no reſpecter of Perſons, I regard no Mans Perſon in theſe Caſes] that its greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved amongſt all Societies, that you meaſured your Remarker's Corn by your own Buſhel, when you paſt your Judgment upon the Symptoms of the Epithetes, as ſhall full plainly appeare by and by: I am really Sorry to tell you that it's a ſhocking Surprize to me and many others, that would ſain har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour an Opinion of the Authors being a polite wiſe Man; Is it poſſible that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005060_0009_101698133AEE97F8"/>you ſhould be a Member of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Society of People, that profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves taught by that Spirit of Truth that leadeth unto all Truth, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, that is true and is no lye? And this Society, and you as a United Member of that Society, hath held forth that the Goſple Diſpenſation is a Diſpenſation that knoweth nothing but Love, Peace, Unity, Patience, Charity, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> all love to God and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will unto Men, and averſeth all Strife, Envie, Malice and Blood-ſhed; and after you have held forth for a long ſeer of Years back, as well Exampleary as by Doctrine, that this hath been taught you by this infalable Teacher (and ſo well it agrees with the reveil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed written Word) and now, for a Man that Declareth himſelf a united Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to ſtand forth and declare againſt the Dictates of that infalable Teacher, that it is both falſe and erronious; how can this hang together any better then Ropes of Sand, as the old ſaying is; is it poſſible in any Caſe, that you could ever be any Member of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of People that have all ways held
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005060_0010_1016981618AC92F8"/>forth that the Goſple Covenant, <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> Chap. 31. hath long ſince taken Place, and that Chriſt had appeared in a Spiritual Manner, without Sin, unto Salvation, the Second Time; in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Manner, to as many as look and wait to receive him in that order, and than he hath taken Poſſeſſion of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom in the Hearts of true Believers, and there he and only he is the ſole Teacher in the aforeſaid Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Manner: And could thou then be a Member of this Society that hath ſo many Years paſt held this Doctrine forth by Doctrine and Examples, now at this time a Day, be ſo Ignorant as to make ſuch harangues hapy and hapy and hapy again will that Day be when Swords ſhall be turned Plough-Sheers; if ever thou had believed there would come ſuch a Day, is it poſſible that thou ſhould Averſe, and with all thy might, oppoſe every thing that hath any ſhew of the dawn of that Day: Conſider that the Epithites of theſe things leave but a bad Aſpect, I am apt to think that the Author of the Remarks was ſome what of my Opinion,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005060_0011_1016981A0D0FF6B0"/>that if no Religion could be true but what is agreeable to the Law of Nature, and ſeeing the Goſple muſt be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to deſcribe the Law of Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that believe the Goſple; then certainly if this ſhould paſs without Annimadverſion, the Stones would cry out againſt the Chriſtian World: I need not inform any Goſpler that we are all by Nature the Children of Wrath, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Malidiction of Gods Wrath and Hatred, and that we through Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have utterly loſt that ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in which we were firſt created, from which diſmal State no Medicene can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, but only that ſalivateing Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote of Faith in Chriſt, which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote purgeth out all Envy, Strife, Wrath, Blood-ſhed, Murders, &amp;c. and forms us by a Tranſmutation into a new Creature that knoweth nothing in its Nature but Love, Concord, Peace and Unity, which all have attendance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prophitecal Day in the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effects of it: Could it ever be poſſible, that a Man of Honeſty and Honour, that was <hi>Compus-mentus,</hi> could ever have compoſed ſuch a Quile of

What is a Tool but a ſecondary Mean in the Hands of a Prime Labourer, that acts ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Mind and Motions of the Uſer, to effect his deſigned Aims and Views with? What is a Time Server, but a mutable un-ſtable Perſon that changeth to ſute that ſide of the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where he thinketh his Intereſt may be the Greateſt and Secureſt: Such a Perſons Epithetes ſheweth him to be an Apoſtate, Tool and Time-Server, in my Semple Opinion: However I leave every Reader to Judge for himſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pamphlet-Writer or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark-Maker is ſhewed by the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes to be an Apoſtate, Tool and Time
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005060_0013_1016981E48601E88"/>Server; and proceed now to Caſt an Eye into the Pamphlet it ſelf, as the original Head-Spring of the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, where firſt I met with excuſe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for, that the Author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Piece is about to uſe ſo much Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity, as to go about to prove a Thing that proves it ſelf in it's own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as (he ſaith) I muſt needs be ſo Vain as to think how I am under full as great an Obligation to pray Pardon for the ſame Fault.</p>
            <p>And now followeth that (ſo called) impregnable Propoſition, Foundation or principle Head-ſpring, upon which all this Bull-work and Rampant Edifice bottoms, which matter conſiſteth of the following Meterials, <hi>No Religion foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon any pretended Refutation of the Will of God can be True, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with, and repugnant to the Law of Nature:</hi> Thus it ſeems ſtands the Caſe; Well, and if this be the Caſe, then we are of all Men in Chriſt moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as ſaith the Apoſtle. Note the Propoſition is General, <hi>viz.</hi> To THE LAW OF NATURE; Well, is God then bound to the Law of Nature; ſure
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005060_0014_1016982133C284D0"/>this Obligation Muſt be either from the great Connexion of Peace, Love and immuteable eſpouſed Unity between God and Nature, and that be Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, becauſe the Law of Nature hath but one only Property in the whole (at leaſt) human Race, whether <hi>Turks, Barbarians, Jews, Indians, Negros, &amp;c.</hi> which they all hold in common with Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>How this natural Philoſophy doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I ſhall not here ſtand to cenſure, but ſay it muſt be this Obligation or ſome other Obligation; but it can be no other Obigation, for any other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation muſt needs tend to make God Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Bond-ſlave, which would be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; this muſt ſpring then from the <hi>Wolſton-<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> Deis-men's</hi> Opinion, that is, that God made all Things in the State &amp; Nature that they now, ſtand, &amp; in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up in an <hi>Onus,</hi> or <hi>Sphere,</hi> out of which they cannot paſs; nor to any thing perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular hath God any regard: So that every thing anſwereth it's Purpoſe, and every Action that is done, anſwereth to the good of one another; and that every one hath Free-will to do what he liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005060_0015_1016982508ADBDA0"/>to do, and every Action is Good, and ſo God cannot be ſo Contrary to Himſelf, as to deſtroy Nature, which is his own Work, of which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is Principle and Head.</p>
            <p>Of theſe I hinted before, under the Name of <hi>Modern Sadduces;</hi> I am realy apt to think I have now hit the Mark well: But my Reader will ſay, <hi>What do they hold concerning the Devil?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That it is a fained Fable:</hi> There is no ſuch Thing, ſay they. And this nothing differeth from down-right <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> and <hi>Annihilation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could make many notable Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and ſhew it demonſtrably Plain in the current Courſe of Actions and Things, but as it Interfereth not with my Deſign here, I now turn back to the Matter.</p>
            <p>Seeing God can do nothing Inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Law of Nature: If I can prove from the Holy Records, That Nature and it's Law is at this Time contrary to God, and not Subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods Law, either the Goſpel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord muſt be Falſe, or the Pamphlets Propoſition Falſe. In St. <hi>Mathew's</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005060_0016_10169826919BC448"/>Goſpel, Chap. 5. v. 38. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye have heard ſay, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth:</hi> Every Body that knoweth what the Law of Nature is, will ſay this is agreeable to the Law of Nature: but then what muſt be ſaid of this Teacher, and his Doctrine? <hi>But I ſay unto you, reſiſt not evil, but if any Man Smite thee on the right-Cheek, turn the other, and if any Man ſue thee at the Law, and take thy Coat, give him thy Cloak alſo; and if any Man compell thee to go with him a Mile, go with him twain</hi> ver. 39, 40, 41. <hi>It hath been ſaid by them of Old, Thou ſhall Love thy Friend and Hate thine Enemies.</hi> This ſtill agrees with the Law of Nature: But who is this that Preaches this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine? <hi>Love thine Enemies, &amp;c.</hi> why truly, if there were any Truth in our Pamphlet Writers Propoſition, he is an Impoſter, and his Doctrine Falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repugnant to the Law of Nature: And this well agrees to the Principles of the Deis-Men: Well; But is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a Member of a Society of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that hold Chriſt to be their Teacher, ſhould thus toil and labour to prove
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005060_0017_101698293900F8C8"/>that Teacher an Impoſter. Can this be called a Member; rather, can this Man call himſelf a Member, and not confeſs himſelf an Impoſter, with the ſame, and in the ſame Breath that he Spends, to call himſelf a Member. I have often heard ſay that a Child will Laugh and Cry in one Breath; but I never, I think, heard of a wiſe Man to ſay and unſay the ſelf ſame thing in a Breath.</p>
            <p>Again, he here either muſt avouch it to be inconſiſtent with the Nature of God to Deſtroy his Enemies, or that God hath no Enemies: If God hath no Enemies, then he here again holds the Teſtimony of Scripture Falſe; if God hath Enemies, and can and doth deſtroy his Enemies, I am to ask him who or what may be called Gods Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; if God doth not, cannot, or will not deſtroy his Enemies; then the <hi>Quakers</hi> are highly to be commended, to follow Gods own Example, and the Pamphlet-maker highly to be blamed to offer to Seduce them from ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Examples. From all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid, I declare the Propoſition
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005060_0018_1016982C24F4E448"/>notoriouſly Falſe, Ergo, the Concluſion. Nor can I ſee any Chance or Choice for any other Man, but he muſt either hold the Propoſition Falſe, or the Goſpel Falſe, for I think it a moral Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſave both, and ſo, according to the School-mens Rules of Reaſon, ends the Matter.</p>
            <p>But for as much as I am but an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Perſon, and none of thoſe School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, excuſe me if I purſue the Theme ſo far as to make two or three farther Obſervations upon it: And <hi>firſt,</hi> our pretended Religious Member, in ſome of his Performances, was pleaſed to ſay, That ſuch things as were put forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon to ſupport them, were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy of but little Credit; If he pleaſeth to render ſome Reaſon, why he, after he had dipt his Pen in thoſe glorious Scriptures in ſuch Order and Form as a Man in a doze migh have dipt his Fingers into a hot Pitch Pot, and when it ſtuck to his Fingers and burnt him, he waked, ſhuffled this way and that way, and could find no way with either Honour or Honeſty; or tolerable Sence, to get clear of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005060_0019_1016982FF8B0BDB8"/>till at laſt he ſhuffls and wipes it off upon the Apoſtles: What Reaſon I ſay hath he to ſhew for binding up ſuch heavy Burthens to lay upon the Apoſtles that were ſo intolerable for himſelf to bear. If you had not told, that you was a <hi>Quaker,</hi> I ſhould have taken you for a Frier that was about with his Baskit picking up the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, or over-and-aboves, of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to ſupply the want of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of this Age: Indeed if you had proved the Goſpel Rules in part or in the whole, limited in part or in the whole, to ſome particular Perſons, or that they were any way appealed in part, ſo that they concerned not the Chriſtians of this Age; you had ſhewed ſome Reaſon for what you ſaid: But how you have ſhewed juſt the ſame Reaſon for what you have ſaid, as a Man would have had to plead a Law not to concern a Subject of this Age, becauſe it was made a long time a go, and juſt the ſame Reaſon: But what ſay you; Was not this the ſame that Chriſt taught his Apoſtles? Was not this the ſame that they taught others? Was not that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005060_0020_1016983184F8DB90"/>the ſame that was carefully made Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Record of, and handed down from Age to Age, for a Rule of Life and Manners, to all Chriſtian Men of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation the ſecond:</hi> It was ſome what of a Myſtry to me, and ſtill is ſo how you firſt laid down your Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon general Terms; and after good Part of your Argument grounded upon it, You attempted to reſtrict it to a ſcrap of the Law of Nature: I ſhould have been ſo fooliſh as to have thought a Man might as well have moved the Foundation of a Stone Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Edifice was in great Part erected upon it. No, no more then you can mend an original Write made by good Inſtructions, after Iſſue is joined upon it: And I am apt to think that you have made ſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrably Plain what you intended and meant by the Law of Nature, at firſt, that I am doubtful that you will get the ſame Praiſe and Aplaud from the Learned, as thoſe good Houſe-Wives give thoſe corrupt Tinkers that mend one Hole in their Pan and make two.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005060_0021_1016983429DB5CD0"/>
               <hi>Obſervation the third:</hi> Suppoſe that you and I are convinced that the Law and Wars both bottom upon one Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and that they are great Evils, and many evil Conſequencies attend them both, as both are Harbingers of Striſe, Wrath, Diſcord, Envy, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> as you ſay, ſo ſay I in that Caſe; and to your Queſtion (<hi>viz</hi>) doth it therefore follow that its good in no Caſe: I anſwer, it is good for a Chriſtian Man to ſhun e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every Appearence of Evil: Yet it is good amongſt ſuch as have no Faith in God, ſuch as are without God in the World, that have not the Grace of God in them to inable them to be a Law to themſelves, that depend in the Arm of Freſh more than in the Power of God; ſuch as look upon things altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after the outward Appearence, and chooſe to cleave to the Practice of other Pagan Notions, that know not God, nor nought believe of his Promiſes; to all ſuch the Laws of Wars are good: But it doth not follow that Men are Convinced of all Evils, therefore they are convinced of none.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005060_0022_101698371A8F83C8"/>
Can any reaſonable Creature allow it to ſtand with Love to Truth and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to preach up, that becauſe Men are not convinced of all Evils, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought not to ſay they are convinced of any Evil: Becauſe they are not convinced that the Law is an Evil, therefore they ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be convinced that War is an Evil: Becauſe through frail Infirmity Men are attended with many Evils, therefore they muſt Object againſt no Evil: Becauſe Men are not Convinced that the Law is Evil therefore they muſt not Object againſt War as an Evil, tho' they are convinced it is an Evil. For all the drift and ſcope of all the doctrine contained in the Pamphlet is, <hi>why if War be an Evil: So is this, and ſo is that: Wo be to them that ſet evil for good.</hi> The whole ſcope of Doctrine tends not to refute Evil by Scripture Authority and good Reaſon, but aims and ſtrives to ſupport one Evil by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a greater Evil by a leſſer; and in that order to ſecure and fortify all Evils ſecurely together: And this is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005060_0023_1016983B08667B70"/>the real drift of the Pamphlet, as far as I can ſee into it.</p>
            <p>So you may ſee, that no Truth can come of a Falſe Propoſition, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſavoureth of the <hi>Atheiſtick, Deis-Mens, Sadducetical</hi> Principles in my Opinion; and the Author was pleaſed, in one of his Religious Chapters, with a great Sum to ſum up the Principles of his pretended Society: With Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did you by your Religious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet intend to ſhew us, your poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Readers, thoſe Performances as the Fruits and Produce of theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or to thereby let us know you were clean departed from all ſuch like Principles? As to my own part, I do freely confeſs I am not qualified with ſuch Aquirements as to put me in a Capacity to judge of your Religious Performances from the Symtoms of the Epithete, with certainty, for ſhould I with my weak Abilities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Epithets, it would, I doubt, be the firſt Queſtion to be determined, whether or no you and thoſe Principles (that you caſt up with ſuch great Sum, in order to let us know what extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005060_0024_1016983C925A9FA8"/>Principles you are Maſter of, as Member of that Society) ever met in any other Manner than a Borrower may meet with a Thing to be lent? and then it will fall out odly: If the firſt Queſtion ſhould determine negatively, it might chance to give Cauſe from my ignorant Judgment upon the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the ſhewing Nature of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets, to conclude you as great a <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liculator</hi> and <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in Caſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ever trod <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Ground: From hence it might riſe theſe Conjectures from natural Conſequences, <hi>That he that was ſuch a groſs</hi> Pelliculator <hi>and</hi> Hypocrite <hi>in Caſes of Religion, and Things belonging to God and Conſcience; why not in all other Caſes?</hi> So, I ſay, to avoid all this, I refuſe to Conſult the Epithets or Concrete, and content my ſelf only to ask the Queſtion, and wait my Anſwer from you, the Author of thoſe Religious Chapters.</p>
            <p>I may well aſſure you that its not with any Pleaſure, and much leſs in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſulting Manner, that I am obliged to treat the Author of thoſe Religious Performances in this ſort of ſreedom of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005060_0025_1016983F3AB02798"/>Words: No, it is realy a pity, and I am ſorry that a Man, that I believe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, in moſt other Caſes, is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, prompt, wiſe, diſcrete Man: It is lamentable, and realy a pity that ever he hath bound himſelf Voucher to ſuch a confuſed Heap of Contradictions, Folly and Madneſs, that I never ſaw the like in all my life, expoſed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick View in ſuch Cobweb Dreſs.</p>
            <p>In my ſimple way of thinking, I do know myſelf to be a Man but of weak Capacities, and yet I ſhould have realy thought it but a Piece of good Juſtice done me, if Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi> had put me into his Bedlem, for Tatling over ſuch a Huffe of Vaniety: It would have been much more ſurprizing then it is to me, had I not been acquainted with the ſtories of the old Religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who when they attempted to make uſe of Religion as a Cloak or Screen to infoiſt Aims, Vews and Ends of Thing, of a contrary different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; why they always have thereby runned themſelves into Redicule and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005060_0026_1016984212D31398"/>
And now, <hi>finaly,</hi> I can aſſure you that I have no envious Eye upon the Perſon of my Antagoniſt, but would ſerve in any reaſonable Service that I may: Nay, I may ſay farther, I ſhould greatly delight in ſuch grave Perſons Converſation and prudent Conduct in State Affairs, were it not for that I cannot for my Life help conceiting [tho' perhaps its nothing but Conceit] that all his Words and Actions ſent and ſavour of the <hi>Woolſtonnitiſh Deis-Mens</hi> Principles, which I abominate. As to my Method of delivering of my Mind, every Man may eaſily conjecture the Cauſe of my Order of Words, my Reaſon for my appearing in Publick, hath no other View but to defend my own Chriſtian like Principles in the <hi>firſt</hi> Place; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to defend the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt as the Foundation of my Principles; <hi>thirdly,</hi> to refute, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, what ſeems to me may hurt weak Conſciencies, by ſetting open a Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to let in Perſecution, and lay heavy dooms of Conſtraint upon realy and truly tender Conſciences; and <hi>laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> out of Good-will and Reſpect unto
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005060_0027_10169845D11686E8"/>my Antagoniſt, to let him ſee that he himſelf is as ſubject and liable to the common Infermities, Errors and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of human Creatures, as any Man at all.</p>
