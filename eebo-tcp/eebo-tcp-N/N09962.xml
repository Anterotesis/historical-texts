            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt breathes a ſpirit of the pureſt benevolence; and if it were univerſally believed and obeyed, it would ſo renew the heart, ſoften the temper and rectify the behaviour of mankind, as to make this world an habitation of peace and harmony. But, alas, how little influence has this divine religion upon the hearts of men, even thoſe among whom it is known and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed! Inſtead of that mild and pacific diſpoſition which the Prince of Peace requires in all his ſubjects, do we not ſee boiſterous and malignant paſſions uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the empire of the ſoul, violating the moſt ſacred obligations, trampling on reaſon and conſcience, and ſetting at defiance the vengeance of heaven? Inſtead of that love which ſhould reign among creatures of the ſame God, inhabitants of the ſame earth, do not hatred and revenge ſwell their boſoms and operate to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all order and ſafety?—or, ſometimes in a more ſilent, but not leſs deſtructive manner, do not ſubtilty and deceit undermine the foundations of civil peace, and break thoſe bonds of union, on the ſtrength
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012667_0005_0F8BE52E0E2CE030"/>
of which the happineſs of ſociety depends? To reſtrain the diſordered paſſions, and render life and property more ſecure, government and ſubordination have taken place, and the inhabitants of the world are by the wiſdom of the great providential Ruler formed into various nations and kingdoms, which have each their diſtinct laws and rules, founded on reaſon and experience; and the "powers that be" in theſe ſeveral political bodies
<q>are ordained of God for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well</q>:<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiii.1. 1 Pet. ii.14.</note> He has wiſely delegated to the civil magiſtrate the power of vengeance which belongeth only to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But even this wiſe and benevolent inſtitution is not always ſufficient to ſecure the peace and welfare of ſociety; for the ſame luſts which produce jealouſies, hatred and quarrels among individuals, do ſometimes operate in a larger ſphere, and cauſe nation to riſe up againſt nation, and kingdom againſt kingdom. The heads and rulers of ſocieties are men of like paſſions and infirmities with their ſubjects; they are apt to be blinded by ſelf-intereſt, wedded to particular ſchemes of policy, inflamed with pride and vain glory, miſled by artful deceivers, and precipitated into meaſures which time and reaſon will condemn: Innumerable are the ſeeds of jealouſy and diſcord which are ſown by the grand enemy of mankind, who fails not to improve every opportunity to raiſe heats and animoſities, to ſtir up the depraved paſſions, which are all in his ſervice, ready to do his deſtructive work; and when public diſputes ariſe between any of the powers of the earth which cannot be quelled by the voice of reaſon, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the love of peace; when public inſults are committed, and the ſafety of the commonwealth threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by hoſtile invaſion, where can the injured body appeal for a deciſion of the controverſy, but to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler of the world, who
<q>ſits in the throne, judging right?</q>
And how muſt this appeal be made?
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012667_0006_0F8BE52F07EA65D0"/>
God does not interpoſe in a miraculous way to rectify the diſorders of ſtates and kingdoms; but as he has implanted in men the principle of ſelf-preſervation, and given them the means of defence, ſo he allows them to repel injuries by violence, and take all prudent ways to guard themſelves againſt deſtruction; while he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides over the events of war, keeping them ſometimes long in ſuſpenſe, and making each party inſtrumental of puniſhing the other, often bringing about revolutions quite different from the intention of the combatants, making the wrath of man to praiſe him and accompliſh the juſt and wiſe deſigns of his holy providence.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Iſaiah x.5, 6, 7, 12, 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The neceſſity of ſelf-defence in the kingdoms of this world is evident from the very nature and deſign of ſociety, which in this tumultuous and diſordered ſtate of things cannot ſubſiſt without being ſufficiently guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt external injuries. Has the all-wiſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Parent of the univerſe furniſhed the brute and reptile creation with the neceſſary inſtruments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? and does the inſtinct which he has implanted in them prompt them to make uſe of theſe weapons for their own ſubſiſtence and ſecurity? and has he not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in mankind a natural courage, a martial ſpirit, and given them ſkill and power to provide themſelves with all the neceſſary inſtruments of defence? and can it be ſuppoſed that we muſt make no uſe of theſe gifts of nature, even when providence points out the neceſſity? Do we guard our fields from devouring beaſts, our houſes and our bodies from the injuries of the weather? and ſhall we not have the privilege of defending our lives, our liberties, our property, our families, our civil government from hoſtile invaders? Muſt we tamely yield to every lawleſs uſurper, and ſuffer tyrants to ſport with the lives and eſtates of mankind? Muſt all thoſe laws, which the wiſdom and experience of ages have founded; muſt the ſacred bonds of ſociety, the peace, the welfare, the happineſs of mankind, be ſacrificed to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012667_0007_0F8BE52FA111D5E8"/>
the impetuous rage of a foreign conqueror? Forbid it, reaſon and conſcience; forbid it, ye heroic worthies of old,
<q>who through faith ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xi.33, 34.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The meek and compaſſionate Redeemer of the world, who "came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke ix.56.</note> though he commands his diſciples to "live peaceably with all men,"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. xii.18.</note> "to be tender-hearted and forgiving even toward their bittereſt perſonal enemies,"<note n="§" place="bottom">Matt. v.44.</note> yet does not expect that, conſidered as members of civil ſocieties, they ſhould tamely ſubmit to ſuch injuries as tend to overthrow the peace and ſafety of the kingdoms of this world in which they dwell.</p>
            <p>What a ſtriking proof of the lawfulneſs of ſelf-defence has our bleſſed Lord given us in that noble teſtimony which he bore to "the truth" when he ſtood unjuſtly arraigned before Pilate's bar, explaining and vindicating his claim to the kingdom of Iſrael. In anſwer to Pilate's demands, "whether he was King of the Jews," and "what he had done," our Lord declares,
<q>My king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not from hence.</q>
By this "good confeſſion"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Tim. xi.13.</note> he cleared himſelf of the charge of being an enemy to Caeſar, and proved that he had no deſign to ſet up as a rival to the Roman government, yet ſtill holding his claim to the title of King, and declaring the nature of his kingdom to be entirely different from all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world, which cannot ſubſiſt without the means of ſelf-defence. It is plain that Chriſt did not
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012667_0008_0F8BE5304BE05820"/>
allow his diſciples to fight in his defence; for he had juſt before reproved Peter for drawing his ſword and ſmiting the High Prieſt's ſervant;<note n="*" place="bottom">John xviii.10, 11.</note> and it is as plain from our Lord's own declaration, that if his kingdom had been of this world he would have allowed them to fight for him.</p>
            <p>In theſe remarkable words he diſtinguiſhes the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at the head of which he was now placed, not only from all the kingdoms of this world in general, but from <hi>the national church or kingdom of Iſrael</hi> in particular, and this he does by taking away from his ſpiritual kingdom, that, without which no kingdom of this world can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, <hi>the power of ſelf-defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Chriſt makes a diſtinction between his new kingdom, and the ancient kingdom of Iſrael, appears from this clauſe,
<q>but now is my kingdom not from hence</q>; the word <hi>now</hi> implies that there was ſome alteration made in the nature of his kingdom, or that what was before his kingdom did now ceaſe to be ſo, and give way to a more pure and ſpiritual diſpenſation.<note n="†" place="bottom">The reader may ſee this point largely illuſtrated and confirmed in Mr. <hi>Glas</hi>'s Teſtimony of the King of Martyrs, chap. 2d and 3d.</note> The ancient church of Iſrael was <hi>the kingdom of God,</hi> a kingdom in which God exerciſed a peculiar kind of government, being their Lord and Sovereign in a ſenſe diſtinct from that in which he is the providential Governor of the world: and as we read of God's making himſelf <hi>viſible</hi> at divers times to ſome of that favourite nation, with a particular view to the ſetting up and maintaining of a temporal kingdom; ſo, we muſt underſtand theſe as well as all other appearances of the Deity, which are repreſented as <hi>viſible,</hi> to have been made by Him who is <q>the brightneſs of his glory and the expreſs image of his perſon <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. i.3.</note>;</q> for

            <p>The grand reaſon why this ancient kingdom of Iſrael was kept ſo diſtinct from other kingdoms of the world, and governed by JEHOVAH in ſuch a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was, that it might be a figurative repreſentation of the elect church or ſpiritual kingdom of true believers, who are
<q>a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people</q>
               <note n="§§" place="bottom">1 Peter ii.9.</note>, who are under the ſpiritual government of Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore when the time of his humiliation was expiring, and he was going to be exalted at the right hand of the Father,
<q>to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to [his ſpiritual] Iſrael and remiſſion of ſins</q>
               <note n="¶¶" place="bottom">Acts v.31.</note>, he made a plain declaration, that the nature of his kingdom
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012667_0010_0F8BE531C4244998"/>
was changed; that whereas it had ſubſiſted under the form of a temporal kingdom, being confined to one particular nation; now it was aſſuming a ſpiritual form, and going to be manifeſted in its true nature and glory: Whereas before it had been not only lawful but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that his kingdom ſhould be defended by arms, like all other kingdoms of this world; now it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be of ſuch a nature as not to be defended by temporal power and weapons: Whereas before, the ſeat of his kingdom and the place of his royal reſidence had been the city of Jeruſalem and the temple which was built therein; now the ſeat of his kingdom and the place of his reſidence was the heaven of heavens, where all ſincere worſhippers were to meet by faith, round the throne of grace, and where the triumphant company of the redeemed will finally celebrate the victory which their glorious Lord has gained over all his enemies.</p>
            <p>We are then to conſider our Lord's words as holding forth to us theſe two contraſted truths:
<q>That when God's kingdom ſubſiſted under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral form, as a kingdom of this world, it was both lawful and neceſſary that it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the ſword.</q>
But
<q>That that ancient conſtitution is now diſſolved, and the kingdom of God is a ſpiritual kingdom, not of this world, and therefore not capable of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the ſword.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why God's kingdom, under the former appearance of it, was to be defended by the ſword, was, that it was a kingdom of this world, containing a mixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of civil and eccleſiaſtical polity, calculated as well for the temporal proſperity as the ſpiritual improvement of the ſubjects: It was liable to be invaded and deſtroyed by temporal enemies, as it was by Nebuchadnezzar, who deſtroyed Jeruſalem and the temple, and cauſed an
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012667_0011_0F8BE5340B1B6628"/>
interruption of ſeventy years in the theocratical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And it was alſo by God's permiſſion finally deſtroyed by the Roman army under Titus Veſpaſian, from which it has never recovered.</p>
            <p>As this was its ſtate, and as it was liable to ſuch cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as other kingdoms of this world are; ſo it was highly neceſſary that it ſhould be guarded and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner as they are. Accordingly, we find the nation of Iſrael combined together in a <hi>military</hi> form from the beginning of their becoming a ſeparate people, and the Lord who was their Sovereign bore the ſtile of "a Man of War," and "God of the armies of Iſrael:" They went up "harneſſed out of the land of Egypt," and kept themſelves in a warlike poſture, under the conduct of their divine Leader, all the time of their march through the wilderneſs, where they had to encounter divers mighty nations who oppoſed them: They were led in martial array into the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by their brave and faithful Joſhua, (whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is one of the moſt noble and unſpotted in the Old Teſtament) and divers of the Judges who ſucceeded him were heroes of renown, and rendered the nation formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable againſt its enemies. Numerous are the battles, ſieges and victories recorded in the book of God from the days of Moſes to the death of Joſiah; but among them all, the reign of David ſtands diſtinguiſhed as the time when God granted the greateſt ſucceſſes: He was "a man after God's own heart," raiſed up to fulfil his purpoſes, to give his people reſt, by ſubduing all their enemies, and leaving the kingdom in peace to his ſon Solomon; and herein he was a remarkable type of Jeſus Chriſt, whom God has anointed King on his holy hill of Zion, where
<q>he muſt reign till he hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all enemies under his feet.</q>

of him by the High Prieſt, who preſented the Urim and Thummim in his breaſt-plate before the oracle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the divine anſwer to the petition of the enquirer: Yea, the warlike actions of the ancient worthies are ſaid to have been performed "through faith," and by
<q>the ſpirit of the Lord coming upon them</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Judges iii.10.vi.34.ix.29, &amp;c.</note>; from whence we conclude not barely that war was <hi>permitted,</hi> like poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy and divorce, but that it was <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> in the kingdom of Iſrael, which was a kingdom of this world. God not only allowed, but commanded it in particular caſes, and he has no where forbidden it to the kingdoms of this world, nor even to his own people as ſubjects of ſuch kingdoms, nor indeed could he have done it without deſtroying the very exiſtence of political bodies: If then it be God's will that government and order be kept up, and that the kingdoms of this world ſhould ſubſiſt as ſuch, then it is his will that they ſhould uſe the means of ſelf-defence when his providence points out the neceſſity.</p>
            <p>The mild and forgiving precepts of the goſpel might as fairly be pleaded againſt the execution of penal laws on malefactors, as againſt preſerving the peace of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety by repelling foreign invaders, and deſtroying thoſe who would deſtroy the foundations of government and property; and it deſerves to be ſeriouſly conſidered, whether the ſuffering an enemy to invade our country and deſtroy the lives of our friends and neighbours when it is in our power to defend them, would not render us as guilty, in the ſight of God, as if we actually murdered them ourſelves?

            </p>
            <p>A miſtaken concluſion has been drawn from the words of our text—
<q>Becauſe Chriſt ſaid that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world, and therefore that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhall not fight, therefore thoſe that fight are not his diſciples nor ſervants</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Barclay's Apology, prop. xv. § 14.</note>. But, Chriſt does not ſay abſolutely that his ſervants ſhall not fight— "then would my ſervants fight," for what?
<q>
                  <hi>that</hi> I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews.</q>
It is readily allowed that Chriſt here diſcountenances all attempts to defend <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his kingdom</hi> by the ſword—but to ſay that it implies that his ſervants ſhall not fight at all, and that thoſe that fight are not his ſervants, is more than can be proved. Whoever underſtands the nature of Chriſt's kingdom muſt be ſenſible that an attempt to defend it by arms would be equally raſh and ridiculous, it being abſolutely impoſſible to do it. Men may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what they call the kingdom of Chriſt, they may defend a form of Chriſtianity which has been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with their civil government, and makes a part of their conſtitution; ſuch eſtabliſhments may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and may be deſtroyed by the ſword; and if every ſuch eſtabliſhment was actually deſtroyed the kingdom of Chriſt would ſtill ſubſiſt unhurt; for it is not in the power of men nor devils to aboliſh that glorious conſtitution which is
<q>built on the foundation of the apoſtles and prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone.</q>
The ſeat of Chriſt's kingdom is the heaven of heavens, this cannot even be attacked by the proudeſt aſſaults of temporal or ſpiritual enemies; and if they ſhould kill the bodies of the ſubjects of this kingdom, which is the utmoſt they can do, their ſouls would be immediately received into the heavenly Zion, and glorified with their exalted Head: Should all the forms of Chriſtianity now ſubſiſting in the world be
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012667_0014_0F8BE53645A5DCA0"/>
aboliſhed; ſhould Chriſtians be driven from the ſociety of one another, and ſcattered ſingly through the earth, Chriſt's ſpiritual kingdom would ſuſtain no injury; while he is the head and bridegroom of his church,
<q>neither tribulation nor diſtreſs, nor perſecution, nor famine, nor nakedneſs, nor peril, nor ſword—neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate them from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii.35, 38, 39.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is in vain then to think of uſing the ſword in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Chriſt's kingdom; it is ſo ſpiritual and heavenly in its nature, that no weapon formed againſt it ſhall proſper, nor can any weapon uſed in its defence be of the leaſt avail: It is able to ſubſiſt in the world not only without any help from the kingdoms of the world, but even in defiance of all their art and ſtrength, all their malice and enmity againſt it. And as it receives no ſupport from, ſo it does no injury to them: It does not interfere with any of their natural rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges: It makes no alteration in their conſtitutions: It does not deprive the Prince of the allegiance of his ſubjects, nor the ſubjects of the protection of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; but it leaves all matters relating to civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and government in the ſame ſtate as it found them, only enforcing the natural duty of ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the higher powers, from the nobleſt motives; and as to the natural right which all the kingdoms of this world have to defend themſelves by the ſword, Chriſt has never made the leaſt alteration, but has ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implicitly <hi>recognized</hi> and allowed it.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid I hope it appears ſufficiently plain, that to defend and maintain the peace of civil ſociety againſt foreign invaſion is not only allowable, but is a neceſſary and important duty; and it may juſtly be conſidered as a branch of that power which God has
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012667_0015_0F8BE537567F2F90"/>
given the ruler for the welfare of his ſubjects, for
<q>he beareth not the ſword in vain, but is the miniſter of God, a <hi>revenger</hi> to execute wrath on him that doeth evil</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiii.4.</note>; if the evil doer be within the bounds of his juriſdiction the proceedings againſt him muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtabliſhed laws of the land; but if a <hi>foreigner</hi> ſhould invade the rights and property of his ſubjects, and aim to overthrow his government, the ruler, who is the natural guardian of his people's rights, muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Law of Arms,</hi> and in the uſe of thoſe means appeal to heaven for a deciſion of the controverſy.</p>
            <p>Having ſtated this matter as a point of <hi>duty,</hi> let us go a little further, and ſee what may be done in a way of <hi>prudence,</hi> to maintain the peace and happineſs of human ſociety. And I think it is a very clear conſequence from what has been ſaid, that it is the part of a wiſe government to take ſuch meaſures as ſhall have the beſt tendency to <hi>prevent</hi> any encroachments being made on the natural rights and property of the ſubject: If it is lawful to arm againſt an invading foe, it is certainly prudent to keep that foe at a diſtance, and ourſelves in ſuch a poſture of defence as ſhall intimidate him and prevent his attacks; then, if he is ſo hardy as to aſſault us we ſhall be the better able to repel him, and if he periſhes in his attempt he is really his own executioner. All this may be done with a very good temper, and in the exerciſe of that benevolence which we are to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain toward an enemy, and which is never inconſiſtent with our own ſecurity. If it be known that an houſe is well guarded and defended, the probability is far greater that the owner will ſleep in peace, than if it was expoſed to be robbed; the caſe is juſt the ſame with regard to a nation or kingdom as an individual; if there be proper care taken to render it formidable againſt foreign invaſion, it is more likely that the peace of that kingdom will be preſerved, than if it was defenceleſs,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012667_0016_0F8BE53C5536AA00"/>
eſpecially if it be an object of deſire in the eyes of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince. A ſudden call to arms on the ſurprize of an enemy's firſt appearance is ſo terrifying, that, if the uſe of arms be not previouſly known, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as many bad conſequences as the enemy's attack itſelf: It is better therefore to underſtand the art of war, though it ſhould ſerve only for an amuſement, than by neglecting it to expoſe ourſelves to the hazard of an invaſion, the conſequences of which muſt be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to an unguarded and unprepared people: And as other nations, and thoſe in particular whom we have moſt reaſon to fear, are expert in the uſe of arms, it muſt be a great piece of careleſsneſs if we ſuffer our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to remain ignorant of an art ſo eſſentially neceſſary to our own ſafety.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh continent is now ſwiftly advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuch a degree of opulence as muſt render it an object worthy to be coveted by ſome ambitious foe: The European nations cannot but be envious at the vaſt increaſe and proſperity of our empire; and as it is well known that ſome of them are as ſuperior to us in the cabinet as they are inferior in the field, it is far from impoſſible that intrigues may be formed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our mother country in ſome war upon the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean continent, in ſupport of her allies, and divide her maritime forces by raiſing alarms in diſtant parts of the globe where we have connexions; and when a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity offers, a deſcent may be made on our coaſts, and our friends at home not being able to grant us the neceſſary ſuccours, we muſt be left to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Then, unleſs we know the uſe of arms, of what avail will be our natural courage? it will only expoſe us to be more eaſily marked out as objects of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>We have known what it is to contend with a ſavage enemy where military art and ſkill availed nothing, and <hi>vigilance</hi> could be our only ſecurity; but we have never yet had to encounter with regular troops who have
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012667_0017_0F8BE53D2ECD3F38"/>
made the art of war their ſtudy and exerciſe: To op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, is not a work that can be learnt in a moment, but muſt be the reſult of experience and addreſs, under the influence of that natural fortitude which diſtinguiſhes the inhabitants of Britiſh America, and of New-England in particular, the deſcendants of an hardy race, who, animated by the nobleſt principles, encountered every adverſity with unremitting ardour to leave this land a ſacred legacy to their poſterity.</p>
            <p>But to diſcourage an enemy from attempting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion muſt in the eye of reaſon be a more deſirable advantage than to repel the invaſion when it is actually begun. It was a ſenſible remark which was made by a French priſoner of diſtinction<note n="*" place="bottom">

<q>That it was bad policy in the French officers of Louiſbourg, to hinder the Engliſh from viewing at all times the ſtrength of their fortifications; becauſe if the Engliſh had been <hi>well</hi> informed of their ſtrength, the moſt ſanguine raſh perſon in the world could not have imagined ſuch a reduction, without regular troops and artillery. And, further, that our allowing the French officers, priſoners, freely to view Boſton and the country of New-England, would effectually diſcourage any French attempt to invade a country ſo well peopled.</q>
As this country is now become an object of curioſity, and is viſited by many foreigners, who doubtleſs make juſt obſervations, and carry them home for the information of their own countrymen, ſhould they have occaſion to obſerve a martial ſpirit and military knowledge prevailing among us, the report thereof ſpread among diſtant nations would be a much greater ſecurity to us, than merely the knowledge of our country being 'well peopled;' for then they would

not dare to think of diſturbing our repoſe without equal numbers, ſkill and courage; and what European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could furniſh and ſupport an army equal to the vaſt attempt, without expoſing herſelf defenceleſs to her rival neighbours, and to the juſt reſentment of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured mother country?</p>
            <p>For ſeveral years paſt, Great-Britain has experienced the advantage of a regular ſtanding militia, in raiſing the ſpirit of the people, and rendering them formidable againſt their neighbours. In the beginning of the laſt war a general panic run through the nation, upon the news of an intended invaſion, and the preparations that were made from year to year in the ports of France; the numbers of veſſels that were ſaid to be conſtructed for a ſpeedy diſembarkation of troops raiſed a terrible alarm, and made the nation anxious for their ſecurity; but when the genius of Britain awoke and gave birth to the new militia laws, they begun to feel their own ſtrength, diſmiſſed their foreign allies, and very ſoon the idea of an invaſion from the flat-bottomed boats of France became as ridiculous as it had been dreadful.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <q>The general ſcheme of the preſent militia laws is to diſcipline a certain number of the inhabitants of every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>choſen by lot</hi> for three years, and officered by the Lord Lieutenant, the deputy Lieutenants and other principal Landholders, under a commiſſion from the Crown.

They are to be exerciſed at ſtated times: and their diſcipline in general is liberal and eaſy; but when drawn out into actual ſervice, they are ſubject to the rigours of martial law, as neceſſary to keep them in order. This is the <hi>conſtitutional</hi> ſecurity which our laws have provided for the public peace, and for protecting the realm againſt foreign or domeſtic violence; and which the ſtatutes declare is <hi>eſſentially neceſſary to the ſafety and proſperity of the kingdom.</hi>

And, if the crown of Great-Britain had any right by priority of diſcovery or otherwiſe, the grants which have been made under the royal ſanction from time to time, have imparted that right to the preſent occupants. If any right can be claimed by us in conſequence of the dereliction of the former poſſeſſors; thoſe territories from which they have been forced, either by the neceſſity of ſeeking ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence elſewhere, or by an utter extinction of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical exiſtence, are undoubtedly ours. And, laſtly, if we ought in juſtice to be recompenced for the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs injuries we have ſuffered from them in paſt years, we have a clear title to the poſſeſſion of thoſe wilds which ſerved as lurking places, from which they iſſued forth to commit their depredations. Such being our uncontroverted right to this country, which is now daily becoming more valuable and important, it is certainly our duty to defend and ſecure it; and if we neglect the neceſſary means thereof we ſhall prove ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy our relation to thoſe noble adventurers who firſt planted it.</p>
            <p>Another argument ariſes from the many <hi>inſtances of a defenceleſs and ſecure people falling an eaſy prey to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of foreign invaders.</hi> The limits of this diſcourſe will not allow me to be particular in recounting all the inſtances that might be produced; but I may not omit the mention of thoſe, the remembrance of which is ſuggeſted by the place where we are now aſſembled:— This very <hi>ſpot</hi> was once a ſcene of blood and devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—An unaccountable ſecurity reigning among the ancient inhabitants of this town, occaſioned their being ſurprized in one fatal night by an artful and vindictive enemy, who ſacrificed many of them to their implacable

reſentment; and within a few years after two neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring plantations ſuffered like dreadful effects of their fury.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Indian war which began in Plimouth colony, in 1675, ſoon ſpread its fatal effects into theſe parts, exciting and encouraging the eaſtern Indians to commence hoſtilities againſt the Engliſh ſettlers, in revenge for ſome private injuries.— After Philip's death, in Auguſt 1676, numbers of thoſe Indians who were in confederacy with him, took refuge among the Indians of Penicook, who had continued peaceable during the war, and were on friendly terms with the people of Dover and other neighbouring ſettlements. Forces being ſent from Boſton to ſearch for thoſe diſguiſed enemies, and being arrived at Dover, where about four hundred Indians were peaceably aſſembled; by a ſtratagem of Major Richard Waldron they ſurrounded and ſeized the whole body, without the loſs of a life on either ſide (September 6); and the perfidious Indians being ſeparated from the friendly, (who were diſmiſſed) they were ſent to Boſton, to the number of about two hundred, a few were put to death and the reſt ſold into ſlavery abroad, of whom ſome found their way home. This action of the Major's was by the Indians deemed treachery and breach of friendſhip, and though they might have known he did it in conſequence of orders from the Government of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, under whoſe juriſdiction this province then was, yet according to their principles he deſerved ſimilar treatment in revenge. But it was not till thirteen years after that matters were ſufficiently ripened to ſtrike the meditated blow. There had been then a renewal of friendly intercourſe between the Indians of Penicook and Saco and the Engliſh, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the latter too ſecure, and gave the former an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to execute their vindictive purpoſe more effectually.— On the evening of the 27th of June, 1689, ſeveral Squaws applied to each of the garriſoned houſes at Cocheco for lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Meſandowit, Sachem of Pigwacket, was, as uſual, kindly entertained by Major Waldron: By an unaccountable negligence, no watch was kept in the night, ſo that the Squaws in the ſeveral garriſons, and Meſandowit in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor's, ſilently opened the gates and gave the ſignal by a whiſtle to their comrades, who were at hand, who ruſhed in and did their deſtructive work before the Engliſh could have time to repel them: They barbarouſly murdered the old Major and <hi>twenty-two</hi> others, took <hi>twenty-nine,</hi> and having burned the beſt houſes, drew off towards Canada, from whence they had been encouraged and ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>Within a year after, viz. March 18, 1690, a body of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and French fell ſuddenly upon the inhabitants of Salmon-Falls, deſtroying the beſt part of that plantation, about <hi>thirty</hi> perſons were ſlain and above <hi>fifty</hi> carried captive; the Engliſh boldly ventured in purſuit of the enemy, and had a ſkirmiſh, in which about four or five were killed on both ſides, but night put an end to the action.</p>
                  <p>Theſe exploits not being ſufficient to glut the revenge of the Indians, who were now newly engaged in the French intereſt, they were ſtill determined on further miſchief: After having made divers attacks upon the Eaſtern ſettlements, and being informed by their ſpies of the defenceleſs and ſecure ſtate of the people at Oyſter-River, they ſuddenly fell upon them in the morning of the 18th of July, 1694, killing and captivating between <hi>ninety</hi> and an <hi>hundred</hi> perſons, with the loſs of only one Indian. There had been a peace made the year before at Pemaquid; but the Indians, like ſome of the politeſt nations in Europe, could keep their faith no longer than till they ſaw a fit opportunity to break it.</p>
                  <p>N. B. This account is collected from Mr. Hubbard's and Dr. Mather's hiſtories, and from the information of divers aged and credible perſons.—One of the captives (Mrs. Chriſtina Baker) taken in 1689, is ſtill living here.</p>

            <p>The Gentlemen who are commiſſioned to the ſeveral <hi>Offices</hi> in this regiment will we hope diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do honour to their ſtations by their diligent and united attention to the duty aſſigned them.— Gentlemen, the cauſe in which you are engaged is good; the fear of the God of armies, the love of your country, of its civil and religious Liberty, are noble principles to animate you; theſe will render the duty of furniſhing your own minds, and inſtructing your countrymen in the art of war, a pleaſing employment, and if you are ever called to action will ſerve to alleviate the burdens of duty, and inſpire you with true courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We truſt, therefore, that the ſame generous and manly ſpirit which you have already diſcovered, will not ſuffer you to be content with enjoying the honour of a title, but will make you ſtudious to deſerve well of your country, ſo that the reſpect ſhewn you by others may be not merely the effect of complaiſance, but a juſt tribute to your real merit.</p>
            <p>No man I preſume will think it beneath him to be a <hi>Soldier,</hi> in defence of his family, his intereſt, his civil and religious liberty. My Brethren, many of you have in time paſt girded on the harneſs, and proved

yourſelves good ſervants of your King and country in the late wars; and thoſe of you who have not been in actual ſervice have the ſame natural intrepidity and alertneſs which are eſſential qualifications of a good ſoldier, and by which the men of theſe northern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have been always remarkably diſtinguiſhed. You will not therefore need to be urged to a vigorous and graceful exertion of theſe gifts, in the military ſervice; you are not to be ſubject to the rigour and ſeverity of a ſtanding army, but to that eaſy diſcipline which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient among neighbours united together for their own ſafety; your officers are not a ſet of ſtrangers, who might have ideas of rank &amp; ſubjection different from yourſelves; but they are your friends and neighbours, who value your intereſt and reputation as dearly as their own, and would expoſe you to no difficulties but what they would cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endure themſelves: You know, that in all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there is a neceſſity for order and ſubjection, or the valuable ends in view cannot be anſwered: As your duty is, therefore, ſo eaſy, and will be but little interruption to your neceſſary buſineſs; as the end of military know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſervice is the good of the community, the defence and protection of your deareſt intereſts; ſo, we truſt you will unanimouſly and cheerfully addreſs yourſelves to the duty, and render yourſelves in this as well as other ways uſeful and ornamental members of ſociety.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Let us <hi>all</hi> remember that though the knowledge and practice of military duty are ſo neceſſary to our defence and ſecurity as ſubjects of the kingdoms of this world; yet all theſe improvements are of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral nature, and the knowledge and utility of them will ceaſe with our preſent form of exiſtence. Soon, very ſoon ſhall we get into the world of Spirits, where we ſhall live and converſe in a manner vaſtly different from what we do here; and our eternal ſtate will be
