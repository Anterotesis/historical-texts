            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AFFECTING HISTORY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FREDERIC Manheim, an induſtrious German, with his family, conſiſting of his wife, Catharine, a daughter of eighteen years of age, and Maria and Chriſtina, his youngeſt children (twins,) about ſixteen, reſided near the river Mohawk, eight miles weſt of Johnſton. On the 19th of October, 1779, the father being at work at ſome diſtance from his habitation, and the mother and eldeſt daughter on a viſit at a neighbour's, two hoſtile Canaſadaga Indians ruſhed in, and captured the twin ſiſters.</p>
            <p>The party to which theſe ſavages belonged, conſiſted of fifty warriors, who, after ſecuring twenty-three of the inhabitants of that neighbourhood, (among whom was the unfortunate Frederic Manheim,) and firing their houſes, retired for four days with the utmoſt precipitancy, till they were quite ſafe from purſuit. The place where they halted on the evening of the day of reſt, was a thick pine ſwamp, which rendered the darkneſs of an uncommonly gloomy night, ſtill more dreadful. The Indians kindled a fire, which they had not done before, and ordered their priſoners, whom they kept together, to refreſh themſelves with ſuch proviſions as they had. The Indians ate by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Inſtead of retiring to reſt after ſupping, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palled

captives obſerved their enemies buſied in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which boded nothing good. Two ſaplings were pruned clear of branches up to the very top, and all the bruſh cleared away for ſeveral rods around them. While this was doing, others were ſplitting pitch pine billets into ſmall ſplinters about five inches in length, and as ſmall as one's little finger, ſharpening one end, and dipping the other in melted turpentine.</p>
            <p>At length, with countenances diſtorted by infernal fury, and with hideous yells, the two ſavages who had captured the hapleſs Maria and Chriſtina, leaped into the midſt of their circle, and dragged thoſe ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fated maidens, ſhrieking, from the embraces of their companions. Theſe warriors had diſagreed about whoſe property the girls ſhould be, as they had jointly ſeized them; and, to terminate the diſpute, agreeably to the abominable uſage of the ſavages, it was determined by the chiefs of the party, that the priſoners, who gave riſe to the contention, ſhould be deſtroyed; and that their captors ſhould be the principal agents in the execrable buſineſs. Theſe furies aſſiſted by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, ſtripped the forlorn girls, already convulſed with apprehenſions, and tied each to a ſapling, with their hands as high extended above their heads as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and then pitched them from their knees to their ſhoulders with upwards of ſix hundred of the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſplinters above deſcribed, which, at every punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were attended with ſcreams of diſtreſs, that echoed and re-echoed through the wilderneſs. And then to complete the infernal tragedy, the ſplinters, all ſtanding erect on the bleeding victims, were every one ſet on fire, and exhibited a ſcene of monſtrous miſery, beyond the power of ſpeech to deſcribe, or even the imagination to conceive. It was not until near three hours had elapſed from the commencement of their torments, and that they had loſt almoſt every reſemblance of the human form, that theſe helpleſs virgins ſunk down in the arms of their deliverer, Death.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE following is a juſt and true account of the tragical ſcene, of my family's falling by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, which I related when at your houſe in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and you requeſted me to forward in writing. On the ſecond ſabbath in May, in the year 1782, being my appointment at one of my meeting houſes, about a mile from my dwelling houſe, I ſet out with my dear wife and five children, for public worſhip. Not ſuſpecting any danger, I walked behind 200 yards, with my bible in my hand, meditating—as I was thus employed, all on a ſudden, I was greatly alarmed with the frightful ſhrieks of my dear family before me—I immediately ran with all the ſpeed I could, vainly hunting a club as I ran, till I got within 40 yards of them: my poor wife ſeeing me, cried to me make my eſcape—an Indian ran up to ſhoot me. I had to ſtrip, and by ſo doing out-ran him. My wife had a ſucking child in her arms: this little infant they killed, and ſcalped. They then ſtruck my wife at ſundry times, but not getting her down, the Indian, who aimed to ſhoot me, ran to her, ſhot her through the body, and ſcalped her: my little boy, an only ſon, about ſix years old, they ſunk the hatchet into his brains, and thus diſpatched him. A daughter, beſides the infant, they alſo killed and ſcalped. My eldeſt daughter, who is yet alive, was hid in a tree, about 20 yards from the place where the reſt were killed, and ſaw the whole proceedings. She ſeeing the Indians all go off, as ſhe thought, got up, and deliberately crept out from the hollow trunk; but one of them eſpying her, ran haſtily up, knocked her down, and ſcalped her.—alſo her only ſurviving ſiſter, on whoſe head they did not

leave more than one inch round, either of fleſh or ſkin, beſides taking a piece out of her ſkull. She, and the before mentioned one, are ſtill miraculouſly preſerved, though, as you muſt think, I have had, and ſtill have, a great deal of trouble and expenſe with them, beſides anxiety about them, inſomuch that I am, as to worldly circumſtances, almoſt ruined. I am yet in hopes of ſeeing them cured; they ſtill, bleſſed be God, retain their ſenſes, notwithſtanding the painful operations they have already and muſt yet paſs through. At the time I ran round to ſee what was become of my family, and found my dear and affectionate wife, with five children, all ſcalped in leſs than ten minutes, from the firſt outſet—no one, my dear brother, can conceive how I felt—this, you may well ſuppoſe, was killing to me. I inſtantly fainted away, and was borne off by a friend, who by this time had found us out—When I recovered, oh the anguiſh of my ſoul!—I cried—would to God I had died for them, would to God I had died with them. O how dark and myſterious did this trying providence then appear to me! but—</p>

            <p>This, dear ſir, is a faithful, though ſhort narrative of that fatal cataſtrophe—and my life amidſt it all, for what purpoſe, Jehovah only knows, redeemed from ſurrounding death—Oh, may I ſpend it to the praiſe and glory of his grace, who worketh all things after the council of his own will. The government of the world and of the church, is in his hands.—May it be taught the important leſſon of acquieſcing in all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I WROTE you a note a few days ago, in which I promiſed you the particulars of an affair between a white man of this county, and two Indians: now I mean to relate the whole ſtory, and it is as follows:</p>
            <p>The white man is upwards of ſixty years of age; his name is David Morgan, a kinſman to col. Morgan, of the rifle battalion. This man had, through fear of the Indians, fled to a fort about twenty miles above the province line, and near the eaſt ſide of Mononga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hela river. From thence he ſent ſome of his younger children to his plantation, which was about a mile diſtant, there to do ſome buſineſs in the field. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards thought fit to follow, and ſee how they fared. Getting to his field, and ſeating himſelf upon the fence, within view of his children, where they were at work, he eſpied two Indians making towards them; on which he called to his children to make their eſcape. The Indians immediately bent their courſe towards him. He made the beſt haſte to eſcape away, that his age and conſequent infirmity would permit; but ſoon found he would be overtaken, which made him think of defence. Being armed with a good rifle, he faced about, and found himſelf under the neceſſity of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning four of five perches towards the Indians, in order to obtain ſhelter behind a tree of ſufficient ſize.</p>
            <p>This unexpected manoeuvre obliged the Indians, who were cloſe by, to ſtop, where they had but ſmall timber to ſhelter behind, which gave mr. Morgan an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhooting one of them dead upon the ſpot. The other, taking the advantage of Morgan's empty gun, advanced upon him, and put him to flight a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and being lighter of foot than the old man, ſoon came up within a few paces, when he fired at
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026540_0009_0FD093BB23FC1110"/>
him, but fortunately miſſed him. On his mr. Morgan faced about again, to try his fortune, and clubbed his firelock. The Indian, by this time, had got his toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk in order for a throw, at which they are very dextrous. Morgan made the blow, and the Indian the throw, almoſt at the ſame inſtant, by which the little finger was cut off Morgan's left hand, and the one next to it almoſt off, and his gun broke off by the lock. Now they came to cloſe grips. Morgan put the Indian down; but ſoon found himſelf overturned, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian upon him, feeling for his knife, and yelling moſt hideouſly, as their manner is, when they look upon victory to be certain. However, a woman's apron, which the Indian had plundered out of a houſe in the neighbourhood, and tied on him, above his knife, was now in his way, and ſo hindered him getting at it quickly, that Morgan got one of his fingers faſt in his mouth, and deprived him of the uſe of that hand, by holding it, and diſconcerted him conſiderably by chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; all the while obſerving how he would come on with his knife. At length the Indian had got hold of his knife, but ſo far towards the blade, that Morgan got a ſmall hold of the hinder end; and as the Indian pulled it out of the ſcabbard, Morgan giving his finger a ſevere ſcrew with his teeth, twitched it out through his hand, cutting it moſt grievouſly. By this time they were both got partly on their feet, and the Indian was endeavouring to diſengage himſelf; but Morgan held faſt by the finger, and quickly applied the point of the knife to the ſide of its ſavage owner; a bone happening in the way prevented its penetrating any great depth, but a ſecond blow directed more towards the belly, found free paſſage into his bowels. The old man turned the point upwards, made a large wound, burying the knife therein, and ſo took his departure inſtantly to the fort, with the news of his adventure.</p>
            <p>On the report of mr. Morgan, a party went out from the fort, and found the firſt Indian where he had
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026540_0010_0FD093BCA4075F98"/>
fallen; the ſecond they found not yet dead, at one hundred yards diſtance from the ſcene of action, hid in the top of a fallen tree, where he had picked the knife out of his body, after which had come out parched corn, &amp;c. and had bound up his wound with the apron aforementioned; and on firſt ſight he ſaluted them with, How do do, broder, how do do, broder? but alas! poor ſavage, their brotherhood to him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to tomahawking, ſcalping, and, to gratify ſome peculiar feelings of their own, ſkinning them both; and they have made drum heads of their ſkins.</p>

            <p>I HAVE wrote to mr.—of your city, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a very particular affair between a white man and two Indians. I am now to give you a relation in which you will ſee how a perſon of your ſex acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted herſelf in defence of her own life, and that of her huſband and children.</p>
            <p>The lady, who is the burthen of this ſtory, is named Experience Bozarth. She lives on a creek called Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard-creek, in the ſouth-weſt corner of this county. About the middle of March laſt, two or three families who were afraid to ſtay at home, gathered to her houſe, and there ſtayed; looking on themſelves to be ſafer than when all ſcattered about at their own houſes.</p>
            <p>On a certain day ſome of the children thus collected, came running in from play in great haſte, ſaying, there were ugly red men. One of the men in the houſe ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to the door, where he received a ball in the ſide of his breaſt, which cauſed him to fall back into the houſe. The Indian was immediately in over him, and engaged with another man who was in the houſe. The man toſſed the Indian on a bed, and called for a knife to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026540_0011_0FD093BE0684CAF0"/>
kill him, (Obſerve theſe were all the men that were in the houſe) Now mrs. Bozarth appears the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who not finding a knife at hand, took up an axe that lay by, and with one blow cut out the brains of the Indian. At that inſtant, (for all was inſtantaneous) a ſecond Indian entered the door, and ſhot the man dead, who was engaged with the Indian on the bed. Mrs. Bozarth turned to this ſecond Indian, and with her axe gave him ſeveral large cuts, ſome of which let his entrails appear. He bawled out, murder, murder. On this, ſundry other Indians (who had hitherto been fully employed, killing ſome children out of doors) came ruſhing to his relief; one of whoſe heads mrs. Bozarth clove in two with her axe, as he ſtuck it in at the door, which laid him flat upon the ſoil. Another ſnatched hold of the wounded bellowing fellow, and pulled him out of doors, and mrs. Bozarth, with the aſſiſtance of the man who was firſt ſhot in the door, and by this time a little recovered, ſhut the door after them, and made it faſt, where they kept garriſon for ſeveral days, the dead white man and dead Indian both in the houſe with them, and the Indians about the houſe beſieging them. At length they were relieved by a party ſent for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This whole affair, to ſhutting the door, was not perhaps more than three minutes in acting.</p>

            <head>Narrative of the adventures of capt. Iſaac Stewart; taken from his own mouth, in March, 1782.</head>
            <p>I WAS taken priſoner about 50 miles to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Fort Pitt, about 18 years ago, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and was carried by them to the Wabaſh, with many more white men, who were executed with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of horrid barbarity; it was my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to call forth the ſympathy of Roſe, called the good woman of the town, who was permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026540_0012_0FD093BF8A6A88D0"/>
from the flames, by giving, as my ranſom, a horſe.</p>
            <p>After remaining two years in bondage amongſt the Indians, a Spaniard came to the nation, having been ſent from Mexico on diſcoveries. He made application to the chiefs, for redeeming me and another white man in the like ſituation, a native of Wales, named John Davey; which they complied with, and we took our departure in company with the Spaniard, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to the weſtward, croſſing the Miſſiſſippi near la riviere Rouge, or Red River, up which we travelled 700 miles, when we came to a nation of Indians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably white, and whoſe hair was of a reddiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, at leaſt moſtly ſo; they lived on the banks of a ſmall river that empties itſelf into the Red River, which is called the River Poſt. In the morning of the day after our arrival amongſt theſe Indians, the Welchman informed me, that he was determined to remain with them, giving as a reaſon that he underſtood their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it being very little different from the Welch. My curioſity was excited very much by this informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I went with my companion to the chief men of the town, who informed him (in a language I had no knowledge of, and which had no affinity to that of any other Indian tongue I ever heard) that their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers of this nation came from a foreign country, and landed on the eaſt ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, deſcribing particularly the country now called Weſt-Florida, and that on the Spaniards taking poſſeſſion of Mexico, they fled to their then abode; and as a proof of the truth of what he advanced, he brought forth rolls of parchment, which were carefully tied up in otter skins, on which were large characters, written with blue ink; the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters I did not underſtand, and the Welchman being unacquainted with letters, even of his own language, I was not able to know the meaning of the writing. They are a bold, hardy, intrepid people, very warlike, and the women beautiful, when compared with other Indians.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:026540_0013_0FD093C641E8FBB0"/>
We left this nation, after being kindly treated and requeſted to remain amongſt them, being only two in number, the Spaniard and myſelf, and we continued our courſe up the waters of the Red River, till we came to a nation of Indians, called Windots, that never had ſeen a white man before, and who were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the uſe of fire arms. On our way, we came to a tranſparent ſtream, which to our great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, we found to deſcend into the earth, and, at the foot of a ridge of mountains, diſappeared, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably clear, and, near to it, we found the bones of two animals, of ſuch a ſize that a man might walk under the ribs, and the teeth were very heavy.</p>
            <p>The nation of Indians who had never ſeen a white man, lived near the ſource of the Red River, and there the Spaniard diſcovered, to his great joy, gold duſt in the brooks and rivulets; and being informed by the Indians, that a nation lived farther weſt, who were very rich, and whoſe arrows were pointed with gold, we ſet out in the hope of reaching their country, and travelled about five hundred miles, till we came to a ridge of mountains, which we croſſed, and from which the ſtreams run due weſt, and at the foot of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Spaniard gave proofs of joy and great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having found gold in great abundance. I was not acquainted with the nature of the ore, but I lifted up what he called gold duſt from the bottom of the little rivulets iſſuing from the cavities of the rocks, and it had a yellow caſt, and was remarkably heavy: but ſo much was the Spaniard ſatisfied, he relinquiſhed his plan of proſecuting his journey, being perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he had found a country full of gold.</p>
            <p>On our return he took a different route, and, when we reached the Miſſiſſipi, we went in a canoe to the mouth of the Miſſouri, where we found a Spaniſh poſt; there I was diſcharged by the Spaniard, went to the country of the Chickeſaws, from thence to the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rokees, and ſoon reached Ninety-ſix, in South Carolina.</p>

            <p>MASSY HERBESON, on her oath, according to law, being taken before John Wilkins, <abbr>eſq.</abbr> one of the commonwealth's juſtices of the peace in and for the county of Alleghany, depoſeth and ſaith, that on the 22d day of this inſtant, ſhe was taken from her own houſe within two hundred yards of Reed's block houſe, which is called twenty-five miles from Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; her huſband being one of the ſpies, was from home; two of the ſcouts had lodged with her that night, but had left her houſe about ſunriſe, in order to go to the block houſe, and had left the door ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wide open. Shortly after the two ſcouts went away, a number of Indians came into the houſe, and drew her out of bed by the feet, the two eldeſt children, who alſo lay in another bed, were drawn out in the ſame manner, a younger child, about one year old, ſlept with the deponent. The Indians then ſcrambled about the articles in the houſe; when they were at this work, the deponent went out of the houſe, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the people in the block houſe; one of the Indians then ran up and ſtopped her mouth, another ran up with his tomahawk drawn, and a third ran and ſeized the tomahawk and called her his ſquaw; this laſt Indian claimed her as his, and continued by her; about fifteen of the Indians then ran down towards the block houſe, and fired their guns at the block and ſtore houſe, in conſequence of which one ſoldier was killed, and another wounded, one having been at the ſpring, and the other in coming or looking out of the ſtore houſe. This deponent then told the Indians there were about forty men in the block houſe, and each man had two guns, the Indians then went to them that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026540_0015_0FD093C40E474600"/>
were firing at the block houſe, and brought them back. They then began to drive the deponent and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren away; but a boy, about three years old, being unwilling to leave the houſe, they took it by the heels, and daſhed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> houſe; then ſtabbed and ſcalped it. They then took the deponent and the two other children, to the top of the hill, where they ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped until they tied up the plunder they had got. While they were buſy about this, the deponent count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and the number amounted to thirty-two, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding two white men, that were with them, painted like the Indians.</p>
            <p>That ſeveral of the Indians could ſpeak Engliſh, and that ſhe knew three or four of them very well, having often ſeen them go up and down the Alleghany river, two of them ſhe knew to be Seneccas, and two Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, who had got their guns mended by her huſband about two years ago. That they ſent two Indians with her, and the others took their courſe towards Puckty. That ſhe, the children, and the two Indians had not gone above two hundred yards, when the Indians caught two of her uncle's horſes, put her and the youngeſt child on one, and one of the Indians and the other child on the other. That the two Indians then took her and the children to the Alleghany river, and took them over in bark canoes, as they could not get the horſes to ſwim the river. After they had croſſed the river, the oldeſt child, a boy of about five years of age, began to mourn for his brother: one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians then tomahawked and ſcalped him. That they travelled all day very hard, and that night arrived at a large camp covered with bark, which, by appearance, might hold fifty men; that the camp appeared to have been occupied ſome time, it was very much beaten, and large beaten paths went out in different directions from it; that night they took her about three hundred yards from the camp, into a large dark bottom, bound her arms, gave her ſome bed clothes, and lay down
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026540_0016_0FD093C6525298F8"/>
one on each ſide of her. That the next morning they took her into a thicket on the hill ſide, and one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with her till the middle of the day, while the other went to watch the path, leaſt ſome white people ſhould follow them. They then exchanged places dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remainder of the day; ſhe got a piece of dry veniſon, about the bulk of an egg, that day, and a piece about the ſame ſize the day they were marching; that evening, (Wedneſday the 23d) they moved her to a new place, and ſecured her as the night before: during the day of the 23d, ſhe made ſeveral attempts to get the Indian's gun or tomahawk, that was guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, and, could ſhe have got either, ſhe would have put him to death. She was nearly detected in trying to get the tomahawk from his belt.</p>
            <p>The next morning (Thurſday) one of the Indians went out as on the day before to watch the path. The other lay down and fell aſleep. When ſhe found he was ſleeping, ſhe ſtole her ſhort gown, handkerchief and a child's frock, and then made her eſcape—the ſun was then about half an hour high—that ſhe took her courſe from the Alleghany, in order to deceive the Indians, as they would naturally purſue her that way; that day ſhe travelled along Conequeneſſing creek. The next day ſhe altered her courſe, and, as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, fell upon the waters of Pine creek, which emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into the Alleghany. Thinking this not her beſt courſe, took over ſome dividing ridges, fell in on the heads of Squaw run, ſhe lay on a dividing ridge on Friday night, and on Saturday came to Squaw run, continued down the run until an Indian, or ſome other perſon ſhot at a deer; ſhe ſaw the perſon about one hundred and fifty yards from her, the deer running and the dog purſuing it, which, from the appearance, ſhe ſuppoſed to be an Indian dog.</p>
            <p>She then altered her courſe, but again came to the ſame run, and continued down it until ſhe got ſo tired that ſhe was obliged to lie down, it having rained on
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026540_0017_0FD093C7D2A21888"/>
her all that day and the night before; ſhe lay there that night, it rained conſtantly; on Sunday morning ſhe proceeded down the run until ſhe came to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leghany river, and continued down the river till ſhe came oppoſite to Carter's houſe, on the inhabited ſide, where ſhe made a noiſe, and James Cloſier brought her over the river to Carter's houſe.</p>
            <p>This deponent further ſays, that in converſing with one of the Indians, that could talk Engliſh very well, which ſhe ſuſpects to be George Jelloway, he aſked her if ſhe knew the priſoner that was taken by Jeffers and his Seneccas, and in gaol in Pittſburg? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered no—he ſaid, you lie. She again ſaid ſhe knew nothing about him; he ſaid ſhe did, that he was a ſpy, and a great captain; that he took Butler's ſcalp, and that they would have him or twenty ſcalps; he again ſaid, that they would exchange for him; that he and two more was ſent out to ſee what the Americans were doing; that they came round from Detroit to Venango; the Indian took paper, and ſhewed her that he, at Fort Pitt, could write and draw on it;—he alſo aſked her if a campaign was going out againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians this ſummer—ſhe ſaid no—he called her a liar, and ſaid they were going out, and that the Indians would ſerve them as they did laſt year; he alſo ſaid the Engliſh had guns, ammunition, &amp;c. to give them to go to war, and that they had given them plenty laſt year; this deponent alſo says, that ſhe ſaw one of the Indians have captain Crib's ſword, which ſhe well knew. That one of the Indians aſked her if ſhe knew Thomas Girty, ſhe ſaid ſhe did—he then ſaid that Girty lived near Fort Pitt; that he was a good man, but not as good as his brother at Detroit; but that his wife was a bad woman; ſhe tells lies on the Indians, and is a friend to America. Sworn before me the day and year firſt above written.</p>

            <head>Sufferings of Peter Williamſon, one of the ſettlers in the back parts of Pennſylvania. Written by himſelf.</head>
            <p>I WAS born within ten miles of the town of Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen, in the north of Scotland, of reputable parents; at eight years of age, being a ſturdy boy, I was taken notice of by two fellows belonging to a veſſel, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed (as the trade then was) by ſome of the worthy merchants of Aberdeen, in that villainous and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice, of ſtealing young children from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ſelling them as ſlaves in the plantations abroad, and on board the ſhip eaſily cajoled by them, where I was conducted between decks, to ſome others they had kidnapped in the ſame manner, and in about a month's time ſet ſail for America. When arrived at Philadelphia, the captain ſold us at about ſixteen pounds per head. What became of my unhappy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions I never knew; but it was my lot to be ſold for ſeven years, to one of my countrymen, who had in his youth been kidnapped like myſelf, but from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther town.</p>
            <p>Having no children of his own, and commiſerating my condition, he took care of me, indulged me in going to ſchool, where I went every winter for five years, and made a tolerable proficiency. With this good maſter, I continued till he died, and, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my faithful ſervice, he left me two hundred pounds currency, which was then about an hundred and twenty pounds ſterling, his beſt horſe, ſaddle, and all his wearing apparel.</p>
            <p>Being now ſeventeen years old, and my own maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having money in my pocket, and all other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, I employed myſelf in jobbing for near ſeven years; when I reſolved to ſettle, and married the daughter of a ſubſtantial planter. My father-in-law made me a deed of gift of a tract of land that lay (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily for me, as it has ſince proved) on the frontiers of the province of Pennſylvania, near the forks of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026540_0019_0FD093CAC8BD4E00"/>
containing about two hundred acres, thirty of which were well cleared and fit for immediate uſe, on which were a good houſe and barn. The place pleaſing me well, I ſettled on it. My money I expended in buying ſtock, houſhold furniture, and implements for out-of-door work; and being happy in a good wife, my felicity was compleat: but in 1754, the Indians, who had for a long time before ravaged and deſtroyed other parts of America unmoleſted, began now to be very troubleſome on the frontiers of our province, where they generally appeared in ſmall ſkulking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, committing great devaſtations.</p>
            <p>Terrible and ſhocking to human nature were the barbarities daily committed by theſe ſavages! Scarce did a day paſs but ſome unhappy family or other fell victims to ſavage cruelty. Terrible, indeed, it proved to me, as well as to many others; I that was now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in an eaſy ſtate of life, bleſſed with an affectionate and tender wife, became on a ſudden one of the moſt unhappy of mankind: ſcarce can I ſuſtain the ſhock which for ever recurs on recollecting the fatal ſecond of October, 1754. My wife that day went from home, to viſit ſome of her relations; as I ſtaid up later than uſual, expecting her return, none being in the houſe beſides myſelf, how great was my ſurprize and terror, when about eleven o'clock at night, I heard the diſmal war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whoop of the ſavages, and found that my houſe was beſet by them. I flew to my chamber window, and perceived them to be twelve in number. Having my gun loaded, I threatened them with death, if they did not retire. But how vain and fruitleſs are the efforts of one man againſt the united force of ſo many blood thirſty monſters! One of them that could ſpeak Engliſh, threatened me in return, <q>That if I did not come out, they would burn me alive,</q> adding, however, <q>That if I would come out and ſurrender myſelf priſoner, they would not kill me.</q> In ſuch deplorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I choſe to rely on their promiſes, rather than
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026540_0020_0FD093CCCC635B30"/>
meet death by rejecting them; and accordingly went out of the houſe, with my gun in my hand, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had it. Immediately on my approach they ruſhed on me like tigers, and inſtantly diſarmed me. Having me thus in their power, they bound me to a tree, went into the houſe, plundered it of every thing they could carry off, and then ſet fire to it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed what was left before my eyes. Not ſatisfied with this, they ſet fire to my barn, ſtable, and out-houſes, wherein were about 200 buſhels of wheat, ſix cows, four horſes, and five ſheep, all which were conſumed to aſhes.</p>
            <p>Having thus finiſhed the execrable buſineſs, about which they came, one of the monſters came to me with a tomahawk <note n="*" place="bottom">A tomahawk is a kind of hatchet, made ſomething like our plaiſterers' hammers, about two feet long, handle and all. They generally uſe it after firing their guns, by ruſhing on their enemies, and fracturing or cleaving their ſculls with it, and very ſeldom fail of killing at the firſt blow.</note> and threatened me with the worſt of deaths, if I would not go with them. This I agreed to, and then they untied me, and gave me a load to carry, under which I travelled all that night, full of the moſt terrible apprehenſions, leſt my unhappy wife ſhould likewiſe have fallen into their cruel power. At day break, my infernal maſters ordered me to lay down my load, when tying my hands again round a tree, they forced the blood out at my fingers' ends. And then kindling a fire near the tree to which I was bound, the moſt dreadful agonies ſeized me, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was going to be made a ſacrifice to their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The fire being made, they for ſome time danced round me after their manner, whooping, hollowing and ſhrieking in a frightful manner. Being ſatisfied with this sort of mirth, they proceeded in another manner; taking the burning coals, and ſticks flaming with fire at the ends, holding them to my face, head hands,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026540_0021_0FD093CCD2657900"/>
and feet, and at the ſame time threatening to burn me entirely if I cried out: thus tortured as I was, almoſt to death, I ſuffered their brutalities, without being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to vent my anguiſh otherwiſe, than by ſhedding ſilent tears; and theſe being obſerved, they took freſh coals, and applied them near my eyes, telling me my face was wet, and that they would dry it for me, which indeed they cruelly did. How I underwent theſe tortures has been matter of wonder to me, but God enabled me to wait with more than common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for the deliverance I daily prayed for.</p>
            <p>At length they ſat down round the fire, and roaſted the meat, of which they had robbed my dwelling. When they had ſupped, they offered ſome to me: though it may eaſily be imagined I had but little appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to eat, after the tortures and miſeries I had ſuffered, yet was I forced to ſeem pleaſed with what they offered me, leſt by refuſing it, they ſhould re-aſſume their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh practices. What I could not eat, I contrived to hide, they having unbound me till they imagined I had eat all; but then they bound me as before; in which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition I was forced to continue the whole day. When the ſun was ſet, they put out the fire, and covered the aſhes with leaves, as is their uſual cuſtom, that the white people might not diſcover any traces of their having been there.</p>
            <p>Going from thence along the Suſquehanna, for the ſpace of ſix miles, loaded as I was before, we arrived at a ſpot near the Apalachian mountains, or Blue-hills, where they hid their plunder under logs of wood. From thence they proceeded to a neighbouring houſe, occupied by one Jacob Snider and his unhappy family, conſiſting of his wife, five children, and a young man his ſervant. They ſoon got admittance into the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate man's houſe, where they immediately, without the leaſt remorſe, ſcalped both parents and children: nor could the tears, the ſhrieks, or cries of poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent children, prevent their horrid maſſacre: having
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026540_0022_0FD093CE63B20FC0"/>
thus ſcalped them, and plundered the houſe of every thing that was movable, they ſet fire to it, and left the diſtreſſed victims amidſt the flames.</p>
            <p>Thinking the young man belonging to this unhappy family, would be of ſervice to them in carrying part of their plunder, they ſpared his life, and loaded him and myſelf with what they had here got, and again marched to the Blue-hills, where they ſtowed their goods as before. My fellow ſufferer could not ſupport the cruel treatment which we were obliged to ſuffer, and complaining bitterly to me of his being unable to proceed any farther, I endeavoured to animate him, but all in vain, for he ſtill continued his moans and tears, which one of the ſavages perceiving, as we travelled along, came up to us, and with his tomahawk gave him a blow on the head, which felled the unhappy youth to the ground, whom they immediately ſcalped and left. The ſuddenneſs of this murder ſhocked me to that degree, that I was in a manner motionleſs, expecting my fate would ſoon be the ſame: however, recovering my diſtracted thoughts, I diſſembled my anguiſh as well as I could from the barbarians; but ſtill, ſuch was my terror, that for ſome time I ſcarce knew the days of the week, or what I did.</p>
            <p>They ſtill kept on their courſe near the mountains where they lay ſkulking four or five days, rejoicing at the plunder they had got. When proviſions became ſcarce, they made their way towards Suſquehanna, and paſſing near another houſe, inhabited by an old man, whoſe name was John Adams, with his wife and four ſmall children, and meeting with no reſiſtance, they immediately ſcalped the mother and her children before the old man's eyes. Inhuman and horrid as this was, it did not ſatisfy them; for when they had murdered the poor woman, they acted with her in ſuch a brutal manner, as decency will not permit me to mention. The unhappy huſband, not being able to avoid the ſight, intreated them to put an end to his miſerable
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026540_0023_0FD093D0A6A9A4E0"/>
being; but they were as deaf to the tears and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this venerable ſufferer, as they had been to thoſe of the others, and proceeded to burn and deſtroy his houſe, barn, corn, hay, cattle, and every thing the poor man, a few hours before, was maſter of. Having ſaved what they thought proper from the flames, they gave the old man, feeble, weak, and in the miſerable condition he then was, as well as myſelf, burdens to carry, and loading themſelves likewiſe with bread and meat, purſued their journey towards the Great Swamp. Here they lay for eight or nine days diverting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at times, in barbarous cruelties on the old man; ſometimes they would ſtrip him naked, and paint him all over with various ſorts of colours: at other times they would pluck the white hairs from his head, and tauntingly tell him, 'He was a fool for living ſo long, and that they ſhould ſhew him kindneſs in putting him out of the world.' In vain were all his tears, for daily did they tire themſelves with the various means they tried to torment him; ſometimes tying him to a tree, and whipping him; at other times, ſcorching his furrowed cheeks with red-hot coals, and burning his legs quite to the knees. One night after he had been thus tormented, whilſt he and I were condoling each other at the miſeries we daily ſuffered, 25 other Indians arrived, bringing with them 20 ſcalps and 3 priſoners, who had unhappily fallen into their hands in Conogocheague, a ſmall town near the river Suſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanna, chiefly inhabited by the Iriſh. Theſe priſsoners gave us ſome ſhocking accounts of the murders and devaſtations committed in their parts; a few inſtances of which will enable the reader to gueſs at the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the provincials have ſuffered for years paſt. This party, who now joined us, had it not, I found, in their power to begin their violences ſo ſoon as thoſe who viſited my habitation; the firſt of their tragedies being on the 25th of October, 1754, when John Lewis, with his wife and three ſmall children, were
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026540_0024_0FD093CE6A92D590"/>
inhumanly ſcalped and murdered; and his houſe, barn, and every thing he poſſeſſed burnt and deſtroyed. On the 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, Jacob Miller, with his wife and ſix of his family, with every thing on his plantations, ſhared the ſame fate. The 30th, the houſe, mill, barn, 20 head of cattle, two teams of horſes, and every thing belonging to George Folke, met with the like treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, himſelf, wife, and all his miſerable family, conſiſting of nine in number, being ſcalped, then cut in pieces and given to the ſwine. One of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial traders, belonging to the province, having buſineſs that called him ſome miles up the country, fell into the hands of these ruffians, who not only ſcalped him, but immediately roaſted him before he was dead; then, like cannibals, for want of other food, eat his whole body, and of his head made, what they called, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian pudding.</p>
            <p>From theſe few inſtances of ſavage cruelty, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſituation of the defenceleſs inhabitants, and what they hourly ſuffered in that part of the globe, muſt ſtrike the utmoſt horror, and cauſe in every breaſt the utmoſt deteſtation, not only againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but againſt thoſe who, through inattention, or puſillanimous or erroneous principles, ſuffered theſe ſavages at firſt, unrepelled, or even unmoleſted, to commit ſuch ourages, depredations, and murders.</p>
            <p>The three priſoners that were brought with theſe additional forces, conſtantly repining at their lot, and almoſt dead with their exceſſive hard treatment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived at laſt to make their eſcape; but being far from their own ſettlements, and not knowing the country, were ſoon after met by ſome others of the tribes, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at war with us, and brought back. The poor creatures, almoſt famiſhed for want of ſuſtenance, having had none during the time of their eſcape, were no ſooner in the power of the barbarians, than two of them were tied to a tree, and a great fire made round them, where they remained till they were terribly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026540_0025_0FD093CE75D54BB8"/>
ſcorched and burnt; when one of the villains with his ſcalping knife, ripped open their bellies, took out their entrails, and burned them before their eyes, whilſt the others were cutting, piercing, and tearing the fleſh from their breaſts, hands, arms, and legs, with red-hot irons, till they were dead. The third un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy victim was reſerved a few hours longer, to be, if poſſible, ſacrificed in a more cruel manner; his arms were tied cloſe to his body, and a hole being dug, deep enough for him to ſtand upright, he was put into it, and earth rammed and beat in all round his body up to his neck, ſo that his head only appeared above ground; they then ſcalped him, and there let him remain for three or four hours, in the greateſt agonies; after which they made a ſmall fire near his head, cauſing him to ſuffer the moſt excruciating torments; whilſt the poor creature could only cry for mercy by killing him immediately, for his brains were boiling in his head; inexorable to all he ſaid, they continued the fire, till his eyes guſhed out of their ſockets; ſuch ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing torments did this unhappy creature ſuffer for near two hours before he was quite dead. They then cut off his head, and buried it with the other bodies; my taſk being to dig the graves; which, feeble and terrified as I was, the dread of ſuffering the ſame fate enabled me to do.</p>
            <p>A great ſnow now falling, the barbarians were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, leſt the white people should, by their tracks, find out their ſkulking retreats, which obliged them to make the beſt of their way to their winter-quarters, about two hundred miles farther from any plantations or inhabitants. After a long and painful journey, being almoſt ſtarved, I arrived with this infernal crew at Alamingo. There I found a number of wigwams, full of their women and children. Dancing, ſinging, and ſhouting were their general amuſements. And in all their feſtivals and dances, they relate what ſucceſſes they have had, and what damages they have ſuſtained
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026540_0026_0FD093D332D7DA98"/>
in their expeditions; in which I now unhappily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came part of their theme. The ſeverity of the cold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, they ſtripped me of my cloaths for their own uſe, and gave me ſuch as they uſually wore themſelves, being a piece of blanket, and a pair of mockaſons, or ſhoes, with a yard of coarſe cloth, to put round me inſtead of breeches.</p>
            <p>At Alamingo I remained near two months, till the ſnow was off the ground. Whatever thoughts I might have of making my eſcape, to carry them into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was impracticable, being ſo far from any planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or white people, and the ſevere weather render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my limbs in a manner quite ſtiff and motionleſs: however, I contrived to defend myſelf againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency of the weather as well as I could, by making myſelf a little wigwam with the bark of the trees, covering it with earth, which made it reſemble a cave; and, to prevent the ill effects of the cold, I kept a good fire always near the door. My liberty of going about, was, indeed, more than I could have expected, but they well knew the impracticability of my eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them. Seeing me outwardly eaſy and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, they would ſometimes give me a little meat, but my chief food was Indian corn. At length the time came when they were preparing themſelves for another expedition againſt the planters and white people; but before they ſet out, they were joined by many other Indians.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the ſnow was quite gone, they ſet forth on their journey towards the ba<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k parts of the province of Pennſylvania; all leaving their wives and children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in their wigwams. They were now a formidable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, amounting to near 150. My buſineſs was to carry what they thought proper to load me with, but they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted me with a gun. We marched on ſeveral days without any thing particular occurring, almoſt famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of proviſions; for my part, I had nothing but a few ſtalks of Indian corn, which I was glad to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026540_0027_0FD093D55C802C50"/>
eat dry: nor did the Indians themſelves fare much better, for as we drew near the plantations they were afraid to kill any game, leſt the noiſe of their guns ſhould alarm the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>When we again arrived at the Blue-hills, about thirty miles from the Iriſh ſettlements before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we encamped for three days, though God knows, we had neither tents nor any thing elſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us from the inclemency of the air, having nothing to lie on by night but the graſs. Their uſual method of lodging, pitching, or encamping, by night, being in parcels of ten or twelve men to a fire, where they lie upon the graſs or bruſh, wrapped up in blanket, with their feet to the fire.</p>
            <p>During our ſtay here, a ſort of council of war was held, when it was agreed to divide themſelves into companies of about twenty men each; after which every captain marched with his party where he thought proper. I ſtill belonged to my old maſters, but was left behind on the mountains with ten Indians, to ſtay till the reſt ſhould return; not thinking it proper to carry me nearer to Conogocheague, or the other plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Here I began to meditate an eſcape, and though I knew the country round extremely well, yet I was very cautious of giving the leaſt ſuſpicion of any ſuch intention. However the third day after the grand body left us, my companions thought proper to traverſe the mountains in ſearch of game for their ſubſiſtance, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me bound in ſuch a manner that I could not eſcape: at night, when they returned, having unbound me, we all ſat down together to ſupper on what they had killed, and ſoon after (being greatly fatigued with their day's excurſion) they compoſed themſelves to reſt, as uſual. I now tried various ways to try whether it was a ſcheme to prove my intentions or not; but after making a noiſe and walking about, ſometimes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with my feet, I found there was no fallacy.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026540_0028_0FD093D74D8CB448"/>
Then I reſolved, if poſſible, to get one of their guns, and, if diſcovered, to die in my defence, rather than be taken: for that purpoſe I made various efforts to get one from under their heads (where they always ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them) but in vain. Diſappointed in this, I began to deſpair of carrying my deſign into execution: yet, after a little recollection, and truſting myſelf to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine protection, I ſet forwards, naked, and defenceleſs as I was. Such was my terror, however, that in going from them I halted, and pauſed every four or five yards, looking fearfully towards the ſpot where I had left them, leſt they ſhould awake and miſs me; but when I was two hundred yards from them, I mended my pace, and made as much haſte as I poſſibly could to the foot of the mountains; when, on a ſudden, I was ſtruck with the greateſt terror at hearing the wood-cry, as it is called, which the ſavages I had left were making, upon miſſing their charge. The more my terror encreaſed the faſter I puſhed on, and, ſcarce knowing where I trod, drove through the woods with the utmoſt precipitation, ſometimes falling and bruiſing myſelf, cutting my feet and legs against the ſtones in a miſerable manner. But faint and maimed as I was I continued my flight till day-break, when, without having any thing to ſuſtain nature, but a little corn left, I crept into a hollow tree, where I lay very ſnug, and returned my prayers and thanks to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine being, that had thus far favoured my eſcape. But my repoſe was in a few hours deſtroyed at hearing the voice of the ſavages near the place where I was hid, threatening and talking how they would uſe me, if they got me again. However, they at last left the ſpot, where I heard them, and I remained in my apartment all that day without further moleſtation.</p>
            <p>At night I ventured forwards again, frightened; thinking each twig that touched me a ſavage. The third day I concealed myſelf in like manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and at night travelled, keeping off the main
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026540_0029_0FD093D8CC886790"/>
road as much as poſſible, which lengthened my journey many miles. But how ſhall I deſcribe the terror I felt on the fourth night, when, by the ruſtling I made among the leaves, a party of Indians, that lay round a ſmall fire, which I did not perceive, ſtarted from the ground, and, ſeizing their arms, ran from the fire amongſt the woods. Whether to move forward or reſt where I was, I knew not, when to my great ſurprize and joy, I was relieved by a parcel of ſwine that made towards the place where I gueſſed the ſavages to be; who, on ſeeing them, imagined that they had cauſed the alarm, very merrily returned to the fire, and lay again down to ſleep. Bruiſed, crippled, and terrified as I was, I purſued my journey till break of day, when, thinking myſelf ſafe, I lay down under a great log, and ſlept till about noon. Before evening I reached the ſummit of a great hill, and looking out if I could ſpy any habitations of white people, to my inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joy, I ſaw ſome which I gueſſed to be about ten miles diſtance.</p>
            <p>In the morning I continued my journey towards the neareſt cleared lands I had ſeen the day before, and, about four o'clock in the afternoon, arrived at the houſe of John Bell, an old acquaintance, where knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the door, his wiſe, who opened it, ſeeing me in ſuch a frightful condition, flew from me, ſcreaming, into the houſe. This alarmed the whole family, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fled to their arms, and I was ſoon accoſted by the maſter with his gun in his hand. But on making myſelf known, (for he before took me to be an Indian) he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately careſſed me, as did all his family with extraordinary friendſhip, the report of my being murdered by the ſavages having reached them ſome months before. For two days and nights they very affectionately ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied me with all neceſſaries, and carefully attended me till my ſpirits and limbs were pretty well recovered, and I thought myſelf able to ride, when I borrowed of theſe good people (whoſe kindneſs merits my moſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026540_0030_0FD093DA6EE255A8"/>
grateful returns) a horſe and ſome cloaths, and ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my father-in-law's houſe in Cheſter county, about one hundred and forty miles from thence, where I arrived on the 4th day of January, 1755, (but ſcarce one of the family could credit their eyes, believing with the people I had lately left, that I had fallen a prey to the Indians) where I was received and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the whole family with great affection; upon enquiring for my dear wife, I found ſhe had been dead two months! This fatal news greatly leſſened the joy I otherwiſe ſhould have felt at my deliverance from the dreadful ſtate and company I had been in.</p>

            <p>THERE is ſeldom a more difficult taſk undertaken by man, than the act of writing a narrative of a perſon's own life; eſpecially where the incident borders on the marvellous. Prodigies but ſeldom happen; and the veracity of the relaters of them is ſtill leſs frequently vouched for; however, as the diſpenſations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards me have been too ſtriking not to make a deep and grateful impreſſion, and as the principal part of them can be atteſted to by living evidences, I ſhall proceed, being confident that the candid reader will pardon the inaccuracies of an illiterate ſoldier, and that the tender hearted will drop the tear of ſympathy, when they realize the idea of the ſufferings of ſuch of our unfortunate country folks as fall into the hands of the weſtern Indians, whoſe tender mercies are cruelties.</p>
            <p>I was born and brought up at Falmouth, Caſco-bay, where I reſided until I attained to the ſeventeenth year of my age. My parents were poor, the farm we occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, ſmall, and hard to cultivate, their family large and expenſive, and every way fitted to ſpare me to ſeek
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026540_0031_0FD093DBCB74C8F8"/>
a ſeparate fortune; at leaſt theſe ideas had gained ſo great an aſcendancy in my mind, that I determined, with the conſent of my parents, to look out for a mean of ſupporting myſelf.</p>
            <p>Having fixed on the matter firmly, I took leave of my friends, and ſailed, the 1ſt of May, 1791, on board a coaſting ſchooner for Boſton. Being arrived in this capital, and entirely out of employ, I had many uneaſy ſenſations, and more than once ſincerely wiſhed myſelf at home with my parents; however, as I had ſet out on an important deſign, and as yet met with no misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, pride kept me from this act, while neceſſity urged me to fix ſpeedily on ſome mode of obtaining a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>My mind was ſeverely agitated on this ſubject one morning, when a young officer came into my room, and ſoon entered into converſation on the pleaſures of a military life, the great chance there was for an active young man to obtain promotion, and the grand proſpect opening for making great fortunes in the weſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. His diſcourſe had the deſired effect; for after treating me with a bowl or two of punch, I enliſted, with a firm promiſe on his ſide to aſſiſt me in obtaining a ſergeant's warrant before the party left Boſton.</p>
            <p>An entire new ſcene now opened before me. Inſtead of becoming a ſergeant, I was treated ſeverely for my ignorance in a matter I had till then ſcarcely thought of, and inſultingly ridiculed for remonſtrating againſt the conduct of the officer. I ſuffered great uneaſineſs on theſe and other accounts, of a ſimilar kind, for ſome time; at length, convinced of the futility of complaint, I applied myſelf to ſtudy the exerciſe, and in a few days became tolerable expert. The beginning of July we left Boſton, When we arrived at fort Waſhington, I was ordered to join capt. Phelon's company, and in a few days ſet out on the expedition under general Harmar. Thoſe alone who have experienced, can tell
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026540_0032_0FD093DEE63A5C98"/>
what hardſhips, men undergo in ſuch excurſions, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, fatigue and toil were our conſtant attendants: however as our expectations were raiſed with the idea of eaſy conqueſt, rich plunder, and fine arms in the end, we made a ſhift to be tolerably merry: for my own part, I had obtained a ſergeantcy, and flattered myſelf I was in the direct road to honour, fame and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Alas! how fluctuating are the ſcenes of life! how ſingularly precarious the fortune of a ſoldier! Before a ſingular opportunity preſented, in which I could have a chance to ſignalize myſelf, it was my lot to be taken in an ambuſcade, by a party of Kickappoo Indians, and with ten others conſtrained to experience ſcenes, in compariſon of which our former diſtreſſes ſunk into nothing. We were taken on the bank of the Wabaſh, and immediately conveyed to the upper Miami, at leaſt ſuch of us as ſurvived. The ſecond day after we were taken, one of my companions, by the name of George Aikins, a native of Ireland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo faint with hunger and fatigue, that he could proceed no further. A ſhort council was immediately held among the Indians who guarded us, the reſult of which was that he ſhould be put to death; this was no ſooner determined on, than a ſcene of torture began. The captain of the guard approached the wretched victim who lay bound upon the ground, and with his knife made a circular inciſion on the ſcull; two others immediately pulled off the ſcalp; after this they each of them ſtruck him on the head with their tomahawks, they then ſtripped him naked, ſtabbed him with their knives in every ſenſitive part of the body, and left him, weltering in blood, though not quite dead, a wretched victim to Indian rage and helliſh barbarity.</p>
            <p>We were eight days on our march to the upper Mia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, during which painful travel, no pen can deſcribe our ſufferings from hunger, thirſt, and toil. We were met, at the entrance of the town, by above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Indians, beſides ſquaws and children, who were
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026540_0033_0FD093E3982F77A0"/>
apprized of our approach by a moſt hideous yelling made by our guard, and anſwered repeatedly from the village. Here we were all ſeverely beaten by the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and four of our number, <abbr>viz.</abbr> James Durgee, of Concord, Samuel Forſythe, of Beverly, Robert De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy, of Marblehead, and Uzza Benton, of Salem, who all fainted under their heavy trials, were immediately ſcalped and tomahawked in our preſence, and tortured to death with every affliction of miſery that Indian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity could invent.</p>
            <p>It was the 4th of Auguſt when we were taken, and our unhappy companions were maſſacred the thirteenth. News was that day received of the deſtruction at L'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guille, &amp;c. of general Harmar's army, numbers of ſcalps were exhibited by the warriors, and ſeveral pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, among whom were three women and ſix chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, carried through the village deſtined to a Kickappoo ſettlement, further weſtward. The 15th of Auguſt, four more of my fellow priſoners, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Lemuel Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of Boſton, Thomas Tharp, of Dorcheſter, Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Upham, of Miſtick, and Younglove Croxal, of Abington, were taken from us; but whether they were maſſacred or preſerved alive, I am unable to ſay. After this nothing material occurred for a fortnight, except that we were ſeveral times ſeverely whipped on the receipt of bad news, and our allowance of proviſions leſſened, ſo that we were apprehenſive of ſtarving to death, if we did not fall an immediate ſacrifice to the fire or tomahawk: but heaven had otherwiſe decreed.</p>
            <p>On the night following the 30th of Auguſt, our guard, which conſiſted of four Indians, tired out with watching, laid down to ſleep, leaving only an old ſquaw to attend us. Providence ſo ordered that my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had, by ſome means, got one of his hands at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and having a knife in his pocket, ſoon cut the withes that bound his feet, and that which pinioned my arms, unperceived by the old ſquaw, who ſat in a drowſy poſition, not ſuſpecting harm, over a ſmall fire in the wigwam.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:026540_0034_0FD093E15195EC30"/>
I ruminated but a few moments on our ſituation; there was no weapon near us, except my companion's knife, which he ſtill held, I looked on him to make him obſerve me, and the ſame inſtant ſprung and graſped the ſquaw by the throat to prevent her making a noiſe, and my comrade in a moment cut her throat from ear to ear, down to the neck bone. He then ſeized a tomahawk and myſelf a rifle, and ſtriking at the ſame inſtant, diſpatched two of our enemies, the ſound of theſe blows awakened the others, but before they had time to riſe, we renewed our ſtrokes on them, and luckily to ſo good effect, as to ſtun them, and then repeating the blow, we ſunk a tomahawk in each of their heads, armed ourſelves completely, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what proviſions the wigwam afforded, we commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ourſelves to the protection of Providence, and made the beſt of our way into the wilderneſs.</p>

Hunger, thirſt, and fatigue, were our conſtant companions. We travelled hard day and night, except the few hours abſolutely requiſite for repoſe, that nature might not ſink under her oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at which period one conſtantly watched while the other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>teenth of September, having often to ſhift our direction on account of impaſſable bogs, deep moraſſes and hideous precipices, without meeting any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture worthy note. On the morning of the fifteenth, as we were ſteering nearly a north courſe in order to avoid a bog that intercepted our courſe, S.E. we found the bodies of one old man, a woman and two children newly murdered, ſtript and ſcalped. This horrid ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle chilled our blood; we viewed the wretched vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026540_0035_0FD093E37B0E4D28"/>
and from what we could collect from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we concluded that they had been dragged away from their homes, and their feet being worn out, had been inhumanly murdered, and left weltering in their blood. We were at a great loſs now to determine what courſe to ſteer; at length we pitched upon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection about northweſt, and walked on as faſt as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to eſcape the ſavages, if practicable. About noon this day, we came to a good ſpring, which was a great relief to us; but which we had great reaſon a few minutes after to believe would be the laſt of our earthly comforts. My companion, Richard Sackville, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral of captain Newman's company, ſtepped aſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thicket, on ſome occaſion, and returned with the account that a few rods diſtant he had diſcovered four Indians with two miſerable wretches bound, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under a tree eating; and that if I would join him, he would either relieve the captives, or periſh in the attempt. The reſolution of my worthy comrade pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me greatly; and as no time was to be loſt, we ſet immediately about the execution of our deſign: Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville took the lead, and conducted me undiſcovered, within fifty yards of the Indians; two of them were laid down, with their muſquets in their arms, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be aſleep; the other two ſat at the head of the priſoners, their muſquets reſting againſt their left ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and in their right hands each of them a toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk, over the heads of their priſoners. We each choſe our man to fire at, and taking aim deliberately, had the ſatisfaction to ſee them both fall; the others inſtantly ſtarted, and ſeeming at a loſs to determine from whence the aſſault was made, ſell on their bellies, and looked carefully around to diſcover the beſt courſe to take; mean time we had recharged, and ſhifting our poſition a little, impatiently waiting their riſing; in a minute they raiſed on their hands and knees, and having as we ſuppoſed diſcovered the ſmoke of our guns riſing above the buſhes, attempted to crawl into
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026540_0036_0FD093E675315710"/>
a thicket on the oppoſite ſide. This gave us a good chance, and we again fired at different men, and with ſuch effect, that we brought them both down; one lay motionleſs, the other crawled along a few yards, we loaded in an inſtant, and ruſhed towards him, yet keeping an eye on him, as he had reached him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade's gun, and ſat upright in a poſture of defence. By our noiſe in the buſhes he diſcovered the direction to fire; alas too fatally, for by his fatal ſhot I loſt my comrade and friend Sackville. At this moment the two priſoners who were cloſe pinioned, endeavoured to make their eſcape towards me, but the deſperate ſavage again fired, and ſhot one of them dead, the other gained the thicket within a few yards of me: I had now once more got ready to fire, and diſcharged at the wounded Indian; at this diſcharge I wounded him in the neck, from whence I perceived the blood to flow ſwiftly, but he yet undauntedly kept his seat, and having new charged his guns, fired upon us with them both, and then fell, ſeemingly from faintneſs and loſs of blood. I ran inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the pinioned white man, and having unbound his arms, and armed him with the unfortunate Sackville's muſquet, we cautiouſly approached a few yards nearer the wounded Indian; when I ordered my new comrade to fire, and we could perceive the ſhot took effect. The ſavage ſtill lay motionleſs. As ſoon as my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had re-loaded, we approached the Indian, whom we found not quite dead, and a tomahawk in each hand, which he flouriſhed at us, ſeemingly determined not to be taken alive. I, for my own part, determined to take him alive, if poſſible; but my comrade p<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> enquired of my new companion what courſe we ought to ſteer, and whence the party came, from whoſe power I had relieved him. He informed me with reſpect to the courſe, which we immediately took, and on the way let me know, that we were within about three days march of fort Jefferſon; that he and three others
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026540_0037_0FD093E69B27D3F8"/>
were taken by a party of ten Wabaſh Indians four days before, in the neighbourhood of that fort; that two of his companions being wounded, were immediately ſcalped and killed; that the party, at the time of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, had in their poſſeſſion ſeven other priſoners, three of whom were committed to the charge of a party of four Indians. What became of them we knew not: the others being worn down with fatigue, were maſſacred the day before, and which I found to be thoſe whoſe bodies poor Sackville had diſcovered in the thicket; that the other two Indians were gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſettlements, having ſworn to kill certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe names he had forgotten, and that deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed to be their whole drift.</p>
            <p>My comrade, whoſe name on enquiry, I found to be George Sexton, formerly a reſident of Newport, Rhode-Iſland, I found to be an excellent woodſman, and a man of great ſpirit, and ſo grateful for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance I had been inſtrumental in obtaining for him, that he would not ſuffer me to watch for him to ſleep, but one hour in the four and twenty, although he was ſo fatigued as to have abſolute need of a much greater proportion; neither would permit me to carry any of our baggage.</p>
            <p>From the time of being joined by Sexton, we ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſoutheaſt courſe, as direct as poſſible, until the 18th towards night, directing our courſe by the ſun and the moſs on the trees by day, and the moon by night: on the evening of the 18th, we providentially fell in with an American ſcouting party, who conducted us ſafely, in a few hours, to fort Jefferſon, where we were treated with great humanity, and ſupplied with the beſt refreſhments the fort afforded, which to me was very acceptable, as I had not taſted any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept wild berries and ground nuts for above a week.</p>
            <p>The week after our arrival at fort Jefferſon, I was able to return to my duty in my own regiment, which the latter end of Auguſt joined the army on an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

againſt the Indians of the Miami Village, the place in which I had ſuffered ſo much, and ſo recently, and where I had beheld ſo many cruelties perpetrated on unfortunate Americans. It is eaſier to conceive than deſcribe the perturbation of my mind on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The riſk I ſhould run in common with my fellow ſoldiers, ſeemed heightened by the certainty of torture that awaited me in caſe of being captured by the ſavages. However, theſe reflections only occaſioned a firm reſolution of doing my duty, vigilantly, and ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my life in action as dear as poſſible, but by no means to be taken alive if I could evade it by any exertion ſhort of ſuicide.</p>
            <p>My captain ſhewed me every kindneſs in his power on the march, indulged me with a horſe as often as poſſible, and promiſed to uſe his influence to obtain a commiſſion for me, if I conducted well the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition;—poor gentleman! little did he think he was ſoon to expire gallantly fighting the battles of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try! I haſten now to the moſt intereſting part of my ſhort narrative, the deſcription of general St. Clair's defeat, and the ſcenes which ſucceeded it.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of November we arrived within a few miles of the Miami Village. Our army conſiſted of about 1200 regular troops, and nearly an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of militia. The night of the 3d, having reaſon to expect an attack, we were ordered under arms, about midnight, and kept in order until juſt before day-light, at which time our ſcouts having been ſent out in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious directions, and no enemy diſcovered, we were diſmiſſed from the parade to take ſome refreſhment. The men in general, almoſt worn out with fatigue, had thrown themſelves down to repoſe a little: but their reſt was of ſhort duration, for before ſunriſse, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians began a deſperate attack upon the militia, which ſoon threw them into diſorder, and forced them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire precipitately, into the very heart of our camp.</p>
            <p>Good God! what were my feelings, when, ſtarting
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026540_0039_0FD093E9B3AD0100"/>
from my ſlumbers, I heard the moſt tremendous firing all around, with yellings, horrid whoopings and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring groans in dreadful diſcord ſounding in my ears. I ſeized my arms, ran out of my tent with ſeveral of my comrades, and ſaw the Indians with their bloody tomahawks and murderous knives butchering the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing militia. I fled towards them, filled with deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſcharged my firelock among them, and had the ſatisfaction to ſee one of the tawny ſavages fall, whoſe tomahawk was that inſtant elevated to ſtrike a gallant officer, then engaged ſword in hand with a ſavage in front. My example, I have reaſon to think, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated my companions. Our own company now reached the place we occupied, and aided by the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of other companies and regiments, who joined us indiſcriminately, we drove the Indians back into the buſh, and ſoon after formed in tolerable order, under as gallant commanders as ever died in defence of America. The firing ceaſed for a few minutes, but it was like the interval of a tornado, calculated by an inſtantaneous, dreadful reverſe, to ſtrike the deeper horror.—In one and the ſame minute ſeemingly, the moſt deadly and heavy firing took place on every part of our camp; the army, expoſed to the ſhot of the enemy, delivered from the ground, fell on every ſide, and drenched the plains with blood, while the discharge from our troops directed almoſt at random, I am fearful did but little execution. Orders were now given to charge with bayonets. We obeyed with alacrity; a dreadful ſwarm of tawny ſavages roſe from the ground, and fled before us; but alas! our officers, rendered conſpicuous by their exertions to ſtimulate the men, became victims to ſavage ingenuity, and fell so faſt in common with the reſt, that ſcarce a ſhot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as ſpent in vain.—Advantages gained by the bayonet, were by this means, and want of due ſupport, loſt again, and our little corps obliged in turn, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to give way before the Indians.—We were now
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026540_0040_0FD093EBC64E3648"/>
reduced to leſs than half our original number of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar troops, and leſs than a fourth part of our officers, our horſes all killed or taken, our artillery men all cut off, and the pieces in the enemy's hands; in this dreadful dilemma we had nothing to do but to attempt a retreat, which ſoon became a flight, and for ſeveral miles, amidſt the yells of Indians, more dreadful to my ears, than ſcreams of damned fiends to my ideas, amidſt the groans of dying men, and the dreadful ſight of bloody maſſacres on every ſide, perpetrated by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians on the unfortunate creatures they overtook, I endured a degree of torture no tongue can deſcribe, or heart conceive; yet I providentially eſcaped unhurt, and frequently diſcharged my muſket, I am perſuaded to effect.</p>
            <p>Providence was pleaſed to ſuſtain my ſpirits, and preſerve my ſtrength; and although I had been ſo far ſpent previous to ſetting out on the expedition, as to be unable to go upon fatigue for ſeveral days, or even to bear a moderate degree of exerciſe, I reached fort Jefferſon the day after the action about ten in the morning, having travelled on foot all night to effect it.</p>
            <p>Thus have I made the reader acquainted with the moſt intereſting ſcenes of my life; many of them are extraordinary, ſome of them perhaps incredible; but all of them founded in fact, which can be atteſted by numbers. General St. Clair, in conſequence of my ſufferings and what he and others were pleaſed to call ſoldier-like exertions, preſented me with an enſign's commiſſion, on joining the remains of my old compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in which ſtation I mean to ſerve my country again, as far as my ſlender abilities will permit; truſting that the ſame kind protecting providence, which hath covered my head in the day of battle, and ſhielded me repeatedly in the hour of danger, will diſpoſe of me as to infinite wiſdom ſeems beſt; and if I die in the cauſe of my country, may the remembrance of my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, eſcapes, perſeverance through divine ſupport, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026540_0041_0FD093ECC96BB288"/>
repeated mercies received, kindle a flame of heroiſm in the breaſt of many an American youth, and induce him, while he reads the ſufferings of his unfortunate countrymen, to exert himſelf to defend the worthy inhabitants on the frontiers from the depredations of ſavages; whoſe horrid mode of war is a ſcene to be deprecated by civilized nature, whoſe tender mercies are cruelties and whoſe faith is by no means to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on, though pledged in the moſt ſolemn trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

            <head>Account of the dreadful devaſtation of the Wyoming ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in July 1778. From Gordon's hiſtory of the American war.</head>
            <p>SO early as the 8th of February, 1778, general Schuyler wrote to congreſs—"There is too much reaſon to believe, that an expedition will be formed (by the Indians) againſt the weſtern frontiers of this ſtate (New-York) Virginia and Pennſylvania." The next month he informed them—"A number of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks, and many of the Onondagoes, Cayugas, and Senecas, will commence hoſtilities againſt us as ſoon as they can; it would be prudent therefore early to take meaſures to carry the war into their country; it would require no greater body of troops to deſtroy their towns than to protect the frontier inhabitants." No effectual meaſures being taken to repreſs the hoſtile ſpirit of the Indians, numbers joined the tory refugees, and with theſe commenced their horrid depredations and hoſtilities upon the back ſettlers, being headed by colonel Butler, and Brandt, an half blooded Indian, of deſperate courage, ferocious and cruel beyond exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Their expeditions were carried on to great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the exact knowledge which the refugees poſſeſſed of every object of their enterpriſe, and the immediate intelligence they received from their friends on the ſpot. The weight of their hoſtilities fell upon
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026540_0042_0FD093EDE2E8E3C0"/>
the fine, new and flouriſhing settlement of Wyoming, ſituated on the eaſtern branch of the Suſquehanna, in a moſt beautiful country and delightful climate.—It was ſettled and cultivated with great ardor by a number of people from Connecticut, which claimed the territory as included in its original grant from Charles II. The ſettlement conſiſted of eight town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, each five miles ſquare, beautifully placed on each ſide of the river. It had increaſed ſo by a rapid population, that the ſettlers ſent a thouſand men to ſerve in the continental army. To provide againſt the dangers of their remote ſituation, four forts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to cover them from the irruptions of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. But it was their unhappineſs, to have a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable mixture of royaliſts among them; and the two parties were actuated by ſentiments of the moſt violent animoſity, which was not confined to particular fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or places; but creeping within the roofs and to the hearths and floors where it was leaſt to be expected, ſerved equally to poiſon the ſources of domeſtic ſecurity and happineſs, and to cancel the laws of nature and humanity.</p>
            <p>They had frequent and timely warnings of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which they were expoſed by ſending their beſt men to ſo great a diſtance. Their quiet had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the Indians, joined by marauding parties of their own countrymen, in the preceding year; and it was only by a vigorous oppoſition, in a courſe of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful ſkirmiſhes, that they had been driven off. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tories, and others not before ſuſpected, had then and ſince abandoned the ſettlement; and beſide a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of all their particular circumſtances, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with them ſuch a ſtock of private reſentment, as could not fail of directing the fury, and even giving an edge to the cruelty of their Indian and other invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enemies. An unuſual number of ſtrangers had come among them under various pretences, whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour became ſo ſuſpicious, that upon being taken up
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026540_0043_0FD093F297A0DFB8"/>
and examined, ſuch evidence appeared againſt ſeveral of them, of their acting in concert with the enemy, on a ſcheme for the deſtruction of the ſettlements, that about twenty were ſent off to Connecticut to be there impriſoned and tried for their lives, while the remainder were expelled. Theſe meaſures excited the rage of the tories in general to the moſt extreme degree; and the threats formerly denounced againſt the ſettlers; were now renewed with aggravated vengeance.</p>
            <p>As the time approached for the final cataſtrophe, the Indians practiſed unuſual treachery. For ſeveral weeks previous to the intended attack, they repeatedly ſent ſmall parties to the ſettlement, charged with the ſtrongeſt profeſſions of friendſhip. Theſe parties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide attempting to lull the people in ſecurity, anſwered the purpoſes of communicating with their friends, and of obſerving the preſent ſtate of affairs. The ſettlers, however, were not inſenſible to the danger. They had taken the alarm, and col. Zebulon Butler had ſeveral times written letters to congreſs and gen. Waſhington, acquainting them with the danger the ſettlement was in, and requeſting aſſiſtance; but the letters were never received, having been intercepted by the Pennſylvania tories. A little before the main attack, ſome ſmall parties made ſudden irruptions, and committed ſeveral robberies and murders; and, from ignorance or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all ties whatever, maſſacred the wife and five children of one of the perſons ſent for trial to Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, in their own cauſe.</p>
            <p>At length, in the beginning of July, the enemy ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly appeared in full force on the Suſquehanna <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by col. John Butler, a Connecticut tory, and couſin to col. Zeb. Butler, the ſecond in command in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. He was aſſiſted by moſt of thoſe leaders, who had rendered themſelves terrible in the preſent frontier war. Their force was about 1600 men, near a fourth Indians, led by their own chiefs: the others were ſo diſguiſed and painted, as not to be diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026540_0044_0FD093EF6954BFE0"/>
from the Indians, excepting their officers, who, being dreſſed in regimentals, carried the appearance of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. One of the ſmaller forts, garriſoned chiefly by tories, was given up or rather betrayed. Another was taken by ſtorm, and all but the women and children maſſacred in the moſt inhuman manner.</p>
            <p>Colonel Zeb. Butler, leaving a ſmall number to guard fort Wilkeſborough, croſſed the river with about 400 men, and marched into Kingſton fort, whither the women, children and defenceleſs of all sorts crowded for protection. He ſuffered himſelf to be enticed by his couſin a abandon the fortreſs. He agreed to march out, and hold a conference with the enemy in the open field (at ſo great a diſtance from the fort, as to ſhut out all poſſibility of protection from it) upon their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, according to their own propoſal, in order to the holding of a parley for the concluſion of a treaty. He at the ſame time marched out about 400 men well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being nearly the whole ſtrength of the garriſon, to guard his perſon to the place of parley, ſuch was his diſtruſt of the enemy's deſigns. On his arrival he found nobody to treat with, and yet advanced toward the foot of the mountain, where at a diſtance he ſaw a flag, the holders of which, ſeemingly afraid of treachery on his ſide, retired as he advanced; whilſt he, endeavouring to remove this pretended ill-impreſſion, purſued the flag, till his party was thoroughly encloſed, when he was ſuddenly freed from his deluſion, by finding it attacked at once on every ſide. He and his men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſurpriſe and danger, fought with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and bravery, and kept up ſo continual and heavy a fire for three quarters of an hour, that they ſeemed to gain a marked ſuperiority. In this critical moment, a ſoldier through a ſudden impulſe of ſear, or premeditated treachery, cried out aloud—"the colonel has ordered a retreat." The fate of the party was now at once determined. In the ſtate of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that enſued, an unreſiſted ſlaughter commenced,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026540_0045_0FD093F0F44E55C8"/>
while the enemy broke in on all ſides without obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Col. Zeb. Butler, and about ſeventy of his men eſcaped; the latter got acroſs the river to fort Wilkeſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, the colonel made his way to fort Kingſton; which was inveſted the next day on the land ſide. The enemy, to ſadden the drooping ſpirits of the weak remaining garriſon, ſent in, for their contemplation, the bloody ſcalps of a hundred and ninety-ſix of their late friends and comrades. They kept up a continual fi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> upon the fort the whole day. In the evening the colonel quitted the fort and went down the river with his family. He is thought to be the only officer that eſcaped.</p>
            <p>Colonel Nathan Denniſon, who ſucceeded to the command, ſeeing the impoſſiblity of an effectual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, went with a flag to col. John Butler, to know what terms he would grant on a ſurrender: to which application Butler anſwered with more than ſavage phlegm in two ſhort words—<hi>the hatchet.</hi> Denniſon having defended the fort, till moſt of the garriſon were killed or diſabled, was compelled to ſurrender at diſcretion. Some of the unhappy perſons in the fort were carried away alive; but the barbarous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, to ſave the trouble of murder in detail, ſhut up the reſt promiſcuouſly in the houſes and barracks; which having ſet on fire, they enjoyed the ſavage pleaſure of beholding the whole conſumed in one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral blaze.</p>
            <p>They then croſſed the river to the only remaining fort, Wilkeſborough, which, in hopes of mercy, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered without demanding any conditions. They found about ſeventy continental ſoldiers, who had been engaged merely for the defence of the frontiers, whom they butchered with every circumſtance of horrid cruelty. The remainder of the men, with the women and children, were ſhut up as before in the houſes, which being ſet on fire, they periſhed altogether in the flames.</p>

               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:026540_0046_0FD093F491C940D0"/>
A general ſcene of devaſtation was now ſpread through all the townſhips. Fire, ſword, and the other different inſtruments of deſtruction alternately triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſettlements of the tories alone generally eſcaped, and appeared as iſlands in the midſt of the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin. The mercileſs ravagers having deſtroyed the main objects of their cruelty, directed their animosity to every part of living nature belonging to them; ſhot and deſtroyed ſome of their cattle, and cut out the tongues of others, leaving them ſtill alive to prolong their agonies.</p>
            <p>The following are a few of the more ſingular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the barbarity practiſed in the attack upon Wyoming. Capt. Bedlock, who had been taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, being ſtripped naked, had his body ſtuck full of ſplinters of pine knots, <note n="*" place="bottom">Pine knots are ſo replete with turpentine, that they are fired and uſed at night to illuminate the room; and lighted ſplinters are often carried about in the houſes of the Carolina planters inſtead of candles.</note> and then a heap of pine knots piled around him; the whole was then ſet on fire, and his two companions, capts. Ranſon and Durgee, thrown alive into the flames and held down with pitchforks. The returned tories, who had at different times aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the ſettlement in order to join in thoſe ſavage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, were the moſt diſtinguiſhed for their cruelty; in this they reſembled the tories that joined the Britiſh forces. One of theſe Wyoming tories, whoſe mother had married a ſecond huſband, butchered with his own hands, both her, his father-in-law, his own ſiſters and their infant children. Another, who during his abſence had ſent home ſeveral threats againſt the life of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now not only realized them in perſon, but was himſelf, with his own hands, the exterminator of his whole family, mother, brothers and ſiſters and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled their blood in one common carnage, with that of the ancient huſband and father.
