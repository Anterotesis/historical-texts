            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Candid Examination of Dr. MAYHEW'S Obſervations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel in Foreign Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a long time ſince Dr. MAYHEW publiſhed his <hi>modeſt</hi> obſervations, on the charter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Society for the propagation of the Goſpel in foreign parts; and as no perſon hitherto has thought it worth his while to enter into a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial examination of his principal argument, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably concluded that his performance would not have met with a full reply. And in truth if he had drawn this concluſion from the nature and manner of his writing, as being too intemperately manag'd to deſerve the notice of either a Gentleman or a Scholar, he had thought as other men do; for this, it has been ſaid is the true reaſon, why he has been ſuffer'd to triumph thus long in his performance, and to boaſt of it as unanſwerable. Every gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has had a liberal and polite education, thinks it beneath his character to enter the liſts with one who obſerves no meaſures of decency or good manners, nay who does not ſcruple to ſacrifice the meek and gentle ſpirit of the Goſpel to the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a licentious and ungovernd temper. Nor does the author of the preſent remarks pretend to rival him in this unbecoming talent; herein he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009360_0005_103211B378EADCA0"/>to reign without a competitor. But ſince he is liable to "think more highly of himſelf than he ought to think," and is already unhappily "wiſer in his own conceit," than in any ones elſe; it may be eſteem'd an act of charity to give him juſter notions both of himſelf, and of his writings in general, but eſpecially of his late performance, than he ſeems to have entertain'd.</p>
            <p>THE method which will be uſed in diſcharging this charitable office, will be to repreſent the Doctor ſometimes in the meek and benevolent light in which he affects to be conſidered; at other times, and by way of contraſt to this, he will be produced in the light in which he has really exhibited himſelf: For altho' theſe are toto coelo different, yet without a juſt and impartial repreſentation of him in both theſe reſpects, it will be impoſſible to give him a true knowledge of himſelf, which is a point the author is very ſolicitous of; and is not without reaſonable hopes of accompliſhing.</p>
            <p>TO this purpoſe the author propoſes to conſult the Doctor's writings in general, which, as they are ſufficiently voluminous, will afford abundant matter for ſuch a repreſentation, and being all of them corrected with his own hand, and ſent abroad by his own appointment, may fairly be conceived to be a genuine picture of the man.</p>
            <p>IT will be proper to begin with his laſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſted piece, entitled <hi>Obſervations on the charter and conduct of the Society,</hi> &amp;c. The Introduction to which begins with theſe remarkable words, <q>There are ſome men who write—controverſy merely from a wrangling diſpoſition, without any regard to truth, right, or the importance of the matters conteſted.</q> Now one may defy any
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009360_0006_103211B55D352088"/>man who ſhall read this paſſage, and eſpecially if he has read two or three volumes of ſermons publiſhed in Boſton ſince the year 1754, and ſome occaſional thankſgiving diſcourſes, in almoſt every one of which matters of controverſy have been dragg'd in, tho' for the moſt part as it were by head and ſhoulders; I ſay, I defy any ſuch man, not to think of <hi>one</hi> who ſtiles himſelf <hi>paſtor of the weſt church in Boſton.</hi> And no doubt every one will be ready to join with the Dr. in the words immediately following, "that this is a turn of mind unbecoming a chriſtian." And had he not been too unhappily inattentive to his own maxim as before cited, doubtleſs he would here have dropp'd his pen. <q>But ſome of his friends</q> too "partial" indeed "in his favor" inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly prevented him from profiting by his own admonition, having it ſeems "expreſſed a deſire that" notwithſtanding <hi>"his" great</hi>

            <p>IN the 8th page of his obſervations, the Doctor affects to be very candid and ingenuous. <q>He is ſenſible" he ſays, "that the Society are a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Body, and to be treated with all the regard that is conſiſtent with truth and juſtice— he declares it is by no means his intention to charge that venerable Body with any <hi>wilful</hi> known miſconduct, or improper application of monies.</q> This is very commendable, if he had but kept it in mind through the whole of his polite inquiry; but as though he was ſenſible he ſhould very ſoon break through the aforeſaid equitable rule, <q>he requeſts the candor of his readers, that no advantage may be taken of any <hi>incautious expreſſion</hi> that may <hi>eſcape</hi> him in the purſuit of his argument, even
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009360_0007_103211B761047038"/>tho' it ſhould at <hi>firſt view,</hi> have the <hi>appearance</hi> of ſuch an accuſation. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Obſervations P. 8.</note>
               </q> This however is a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſtulatum, and therefore it is not propoſed, nay, the author hereby promiſes the gentleman that he will not take advantage of <hi>one</hi> or even of <hi>two</hi> incautious expreſſions, that appear undeſignedly to have eſcaped him, if at <hi>firſt view only</hi> they have the <hi>bare appearance</hi> of ſuch an accuſation; but then he cannot extend the ſame indulgence to <hi>very many</hi> expreſſions importing a charge of wilful known miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct, and improper application of monies; eſpecially, if not only at the <hi>firſt view,</hi> but on a ſecond and third view, they do not appear to have merely eſcaped him, but were manifeſtly intended to ſupport ſuch an accuſation. Much leſs will he be intitled to this indulgence, if it ſhall appear that the Society are directly charged by him with miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the monies committed to their truſt, in numerous paſſages of his book, but moreover, that the general deſign of it was, an attempt to prove this very point.</p>
            <p>THE Dr.'s book is entitled <q>Obſervations on the charter and conduct of the Society, &amp;c. <hi>deſigned</hi> to ſhew their non-conformity to each other.</q> In ſupport of this title, after ſometimes contracting, then ſtretching and wire-drawing the ſenſe of the charter, ſeal, &amp;c. of the Society, he concludes that the <hi>ſole</hi> deſign of their inſtitution was to propagate the goſpel among the heathen, or in thoſe colonies whoſe religious ſtate was, and according to him, now is, little better than heatheniſm. But this which he aſſerts to be the laudable and only deſign of their inſtitution, they have, he ſays, groſsly perverted and abuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009360_0008_103211B940454660"/>
THUS in page 55, he ſays <q>the Society have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted a ſufficient forwardneſs to encourage and increaſe ſmall diſaffected parties in our towns, upon an application to them.</q> And in the 57th page he repreſents the Society as hoping that theſe ſmall parties will by their influence gradually bring on a general ſubmiſſion to an epiſcopal ſovereign; and <q>affirms that this has long been the formal deſign of the Society, and is the true plan and grand myſtery of their operations in New-England.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN his 106th page he tells us that the <q>affair of Biſhops in America, has been a favourite object with the Society," and in the next page, that the Society ſpare neither endeavours, applications, nor expence, in order to effect their <hi>grand deſign</hi> of <hi>epiſcopizing</hi> all New-England,</q> and a few lines further, <q>The Society have long had a <hi>formal deſign</hi> to diſſolve and root out all our New-England churches.—This (he ſays) fully and clearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for their being ſo ready to encourage ſmall epiſcopal parties all over New-England, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them miſſionaries.</q> In page 110 he affirms that <q>the Society have been expending large ſums every year in New-England, <hi>quite beyond the deſign of their inſtitution,</hi> to ſupport and increaſe the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal party as ſuch.</q> In the ſame page he charges the Society with robbing the heathen to eaſe and gratify the epiſcopalians here, and forms this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon his foregoing repreſentations, that <q>the Society are guilty of a flagrant abuſe of a noble inſtitution.</q> And in the 112th page, that they have <q>alienated their revenues from a truly noble to a comparatively mean, narrow, party deſign.</q> After theſe ſeveral direct and plain accuſations of the Society as abuſing their truſt, and miſapplying the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009360_0009_103211BB21971348"/>money put into their hands, he wipes his mouth again, and abſurdly enough aſſures his reader, that <q>he would by no means be underſtood as charging ſo reſpectable a Body with any wilful criminal abuſe of power, or miſapplication of monies.</q> i. e. he would not have the reader believe him; for that is the ſenſe of his words, as they ſtand connected with what went before, if indeed they have any ſenſe at all in them.</p>
            <p>WILL he now have the <hi>firmneſs</hi> to aſſert, that all the <hi>expreſſions</hi> and paſſages which have been here quoted (and five times as many more might have been added) are only <hi>incautions expreſſions,</hi> that inadvertently <hi>eſcaped him,</hi> that they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as matter of <hi>accuſation,</hi> and that if poſſibly they have ſuch an <hi>appearance,</hi> it is only <hi>at firſt view?</hi> If he ſhould aſſert this. I am perſuaded his friends at leaſt muſt bluſh for him. Is the ſupporting ſmall parties in New-England, in order to facilitate the affair of <hi>epiſcopizing</hi> the colonies, <hi>the formal deſign</hi> of the Society, to which they give their chief atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to which the largeſt part of their fund is applied? Can he aſſert all this, and yet ſay that he does not charge that venerable Body <q>with any wilful known miſconduct, or improper application of monies?</q>
            </p>
            <p>PERHAPS this <hi>conſiſtent</hi> reaſoner will chuſe to ſay that the Society are miſled, and form their plan upon the miſrepreſentations of their <hi>wicked</hi> miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. Something like this is aſſerted in a note upon a thanſgiving ſermon on the reduction of Canada, preached and publiſhed by him in the year 1760. <q>It is probable that they [the Society] have been groſsly impoſed upon by falſe repreſentations of the ſtate of religion in theſe parts, which has
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009360_0010_103211BDA5CDCF88"/>been the occaſion of their employing ſo much of their charitable care about thoſe who ſo little need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, to the neglect of thoſe who were periſhing for want of it: For which impoſitions, abuſes and miſapplications, their deceivers are anſwerable; if not to them, yet certainly to an HIGHER AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORITY.</q> But ſurely whatever repreſentations theſe miſſionaries have made, the Society muſt judge whether the complying with ſuch repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was, or was not conſiſtent with their charter; ſo that notwithſtanding his ſtriving to palliate his accuſation of the Society, by caſting the odium of a pretended miſapplication of their charity on the miſſionaries, the ſlander will ſtill remain where he at firſt placed it, on the Society themſelves. Beſides, the members of the Society are not all of them utterly unacquainted with the plantations; ſome of them have heretofore, and others do even now reſide in moſt of the governments upon the continent, (New-England not excepted) many of them not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for their ſtation, wiſdom and integrity. Theſe gentlemen muſt therefore be alſo in a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with the miſſionaries to abuſe the world, and miſapply the monies entruſted with them. This ſeems to be the conſequence of his general accuſation.</p>
            <p>IF the Dr. would ſay any thing further to ſoften the odium of this accuſation which he has caſt upon the Society, it muſt be by aſſerting that they did not underſtand their own charter; this, if true, may ſerve in ſome meaſure to take off the charge of wilful abuſe and miſapplication; and that he ſuppoſes it true is clear from hence, that he has ſpent many pages and employed his great learning and penetration in explaining this intricate charter, that the Society may no longer miſapply their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009360_0011_103211BF5289BA40"/>for want of underſtanding the real deſign of their inſtitution. It may be queſtioned however, whether his refin'd criticiſm and curious explanation will merit the thanks of the venerable board. That untoward word <hi>orthodox,</hi> which ſo much raiſes his indignation wherever he meets with it, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps after all his learned pains, ſairly comprehend the diſſenters from a national eſtabliſhment. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that be, there is certainly no method of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling his candid profeſſions of juſtice, decency and reſpect towards the Society, or his ſolemn declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it is not his intention to charge that venerable Body with <hi>wilful known</hi> miſconduct: I ſay, it is impoſſible to reconcile theſe things, with the numerous abuſes, accuſations and indecencies which have been already produced, and with which he has treated that reſpectable Body directly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, in almoſt every page of his book.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, the Society either have, or have not acted contrary to the meaning and deſign of their charter; that they have not, is at leaſt highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable from the character of wiſdom, honor and piety, which the world will generally allow to thoſe of them at leaſt, who are chiefly active and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in managing their affairs. If they have acted contrary to the deſign of it, as the Dr. affirms (and pretends to think he has prov'd) they have either done ſo <hi>wilfully,</hi> or thro' ignorance. That they have not done it wilfully, the Dr. himſelf allows; it remains then, according to him, that their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct is owing to ignorance: Either they have miſunderſtood the true and real deſign of their charter, or have not a competent knowledge of the ſtate of religion in the plantations, or how their affairs are conducted there, being impoſed on by the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009360_0012_103211C12D9B4718"/>repreſentation of their miſſionaries, or that both theſe things concur to miſlead them, into an abuſe of their inſtitution. The latter ſeems to be his ſenſe of the thing, viz. that they are ignorant both of the true meaning of their charter, and alſo of the ſtate of religion in the plantations; for he ſays in the cloſe of his introduction, that <q>the profeſs'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his obſervations is to ſhew, that they (the Society) have in ſome reſpects counteracted and defeated the truly noble ends of their INSTITU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, however <hi>contrary to their intention.</hi>
               </q> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have done ſo or not, will fall under exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination hereafter. In the mean time I ſhall take leave of his introduction with this ſingle remark, that from the paſſages already quoted, as well as from many others that might have been produced from this curious book of obſervations, it appears that the profeſſions of candor and ingenuity which the Dr. ſet out with, and his declaration of reſpect for ſo venerable a body as the Society, are mere affectation and grimace, and tend only to prove that he "knows not what manner of ſpirit he is of."</p>
            <p>It was obſerved before, that according to the Dr's repreſentation the Society are ignorant of the true ſenſe and meaning of their charter, and alſo of the ſtate of religion in the plantations; for the aſſerts that they have greatly perverted the deſign of their inſtitution, and yet will not allow their miſconduct to be wilful; it remains therefore that their miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the truſt they have undertaken, is owing to ignorance.</p>
            <p>It will be proper therefore to inquire firſt, Whether the Society muſt not be ſuppoſed to have a competent knowledge of the ſtate of religion in the plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo far at leaſt as relates to the deſign of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation. And,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009360_0013_103211C3124BBB28"/>
2. Whether they may not alſo reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to underſtand the true ſenſe, meaning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their charter; for it theſe two things can be proved to the ſatisfaction of diſintereſted and unprejudiced people, it will follow, either that the Society are not chargeable with miſconduct and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application of their charity, or if they are ſo, that ſuch miſconduct is known, wilful and intended, which the Dr. does not allow.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be examined is, Whether the Society have not a competent knowledge of the ſtate of religion in the plantations. Dr. Humphries in his hiſtory of the Society page 22d, acquaints us, that <q>upon their firſt engaging in this work the Society preſently perceived it conſiſted of three great branches, the care and inſtruction of our own people, ſettled in the colonies; the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Indian Savages, and the converſion of the Negroes. The Engliſh planters had a title to their firſt care" &amp;c.— "The Society began therefore with the Engliſh, and ſoon found there was more to be done among them, than they had as yet any views of effecting.</q> He then proceeds to give <q>a ſmall ſketch of the ſtate and condition of each colony, formed from accounts, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and perſons of the beſt note, ſent over to the corporation.</q> I ſhall omit what is ſaid of the ſouthern <hi>heatheniſh</hi> colonies as Dr. Mayhew <hi>modeſtly</hi> calls them, becauſe theſe he allows to be proper objects of the Society's charity, and proceed to the ſtate of religion in New-England as repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hiſtory before mentioned. After ſpeaking of the firſt ſettlement of the country, and the ſtate of religion in the early days of it, Dr. Humphries proceeds to ſay,— <q>Since that time great numbers
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009360_0014_103211C4F3224560"/>of people, members of the church of England, have at different times ſettled there, who thought themſelves ſurely entituled, by the very New-England charter to a liberty of conſcience in the worſhipping of God after their own way. Yet the Independents (it ſeems) were not of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, but acted as an <hi>eſtabliſhment.</hi>" "The members of the church of England in Boſton met with ſo much obſtruction in attempting to ſet up that form of worſhip, that they were obliged to petition the King for protection. Their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was granted, and a Church thereupon erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which occaſioned the members of the church of England in many other towns in New-England to declare their deſire of the like advantage, and accordingly wrote very zealous letters to biſhop Compton, for miniſters; and now it appeared they were a very conſiderable body of people. <note n="*" place="bottom">Hemph. Hiſt p. 39.</note>
               </q> From theſe ſeveral paſſages, it appears that the Society did not proceed haſtily and without due caution and information of the ſtate of religion in the colonies which they propoſed to aſſiſt. Dr. Humphries goes on and ſums up the religious ſtate of the colonies in a brief repreſentation of it, from the memorials of Governor Dudley, Col. Morris, and Col. Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote. I ſhall paſs over the ſouthern colonies for the reaſon before mentioned, and come to New-England.—<q>In Connecticut colony in New-England there are about 30000 ſouls, of which when they have a miniſter among them. about 150 frequent the church; and there are 35 commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants. In Rhode-Iſland and Narraganſet, which is one government, there are about 10000 ſouls, of which about 150 frequent the church, and there are 30 communicants. In Boſton and Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataway
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009360_0015_103211C70ED96058"/>governments, there are about 80000 ſouls, of which about 600 frequent the church, and 120 the ſacrament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After ſuch particular information from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of theſe honorable perſons, perhaps no man except Dr. Mayhew and his voucher, will ſuppoſe the Society could be ignorant of the ſtate of religion in this part of the world, nor conſequently where it was moſt proper to employ their charity. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Dr. Humphreys acquaints us that <q>the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of ſeveral colonies, and other Gentlemen of character abroad, and merchants here in London, having given ſuch a particular deſcription of the religious ſtate of the plantations; the Society found it was high time to enter upon the good work"<note n="*" place="bottom">Humph. Hiſt. p. 44, 45.</note> eſpecially as "great numbers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of various humors, and different tenets in religion, began to contend with great zeal, which ſhould be firſt ſupplied with miniſters of the church of England, and wrote very earneſt letters to the Society—They (the Society) thought any further delay now would be inexcuſable, after the people had preſſed ſo earneſtly for their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</q> Yet as if all this care was inſufficient, and that the Society might leave no method unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, for gaining a more perfect knowlege of the ſtate of religion in the colonies, <q>before they proceeded to appoint miſſionaries to particular places, (they) reſolved to ſend a travelling miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, who ſhould travel over, and preach in the ſeveral Governments, on the continent of the Britiſh America.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ditto 73.74.</note> Accordingly they did ſend the Rev. Mr. Keith, who landed at Boſton on the 11th of June 1702. and in the courſe of two years travel'd
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009360_0016_103211C8F26202A0"/>over and preached in all the Governments betwixt Piſcataway river and North-Carolina incluſively, when having finiſhed his miſſion he returned to England, and publiſhed a full account of his labours.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Humph. Hiſt. p 74.</note> One thing in his narrative I ſhall juſt mention, viz. That <q>in divers parts of New-England, he found not only many people well affected to the Church, who had no church of England miniſters, but alſo ſeveral New-England miniſters deſirous of epiſcopal ordination, and ready to embrace the church worſhip, ſome of whom both hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably entertained Mr. Keith and Mr. Talbot (who had joined Mr. Keith as an aſſiſtant) in their houſes, and requeſted them to preach in their congregations, which they did, and received great thanks, both from the miniſters and from the people. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ditto 78, 79.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. Keith in the concluſion of his narrative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Society, the want of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of miniſters for a people diſperſed over ſuch large countries,</q> and among others makes mention of Narraganſet, Swanſey, Little Compton &amp; Rhode-Iſland in New-England, which Places had engaged him to preſent their humble requeſts to the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſend miniſters among them.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ditto.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding this particular information, ſupported by many carneſt petitions from the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for miniſters of the church of England, <q>the Society thro' the whole management of the truſt, have been ſo far from obtruding the church of England worſhip upon any ſort of people abroad—that they have not been able to give any aſſiſtance to great numbers of people, who have in very moving terms, with a true chriſtian ſpirit
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009360_0017_103211CAD30EC8C0"/>requeſted it; and whom they <hi>knew</hi> to ſtand very much in want of it. There remain upon their books numerous petitions of this ſort.</q>— I ſhall omit thoſe from the ſouthern colonies, for the reaſons before mentioned, and proceed to that of New-England, which as Dr. Humphreys acquaints us (page 61) <q>tho' before provided with an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and preſbyterian miniſtry, yet had great numbers of inhabitants, who could not follow that perſuaſion, but were exceeding deſirous of worſhipping God, after the manner of the church of England. I ſhall give the reader (ſays he) a few petitions which ſhew plainly the Society did not concern themſelves here, till they were loudly called upon; and that the inhabitants in many places, did not only fend petitions for miniſters, but alſo built churches before they had any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, which is an uncontroulable evidence— that the people themſelves deſired to have the church of England worſhip, with a hearty zeal and true ſincerity.</q> The Dr. then proceeds to ſpecify as petitioners ſeveral inhabitants of Rhode-Iſland, Narraganſet, Newbury, Marblehead, New-Hampſhire, Little Compton and Tiverton, Braintree near Boſton, and Stratford in Connecticut.<note n="*" place="bottom">Humph. Hiſt. p 61.62.</note> 
               <q>The caſe of theſe two laſt towns he tells us was alſo further recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Society's care, by gentlemen of conſiderable figure and intereſt. Colonel Morris preſſed very earneſtly for a miniſter for Braintree, and Colonel Heathcote, for another, for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Connecticut colony; great numbers of whom were very earneſt to have a miniſter of the church of England. Robert Hunter, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of New-York, in the year 1711, writes
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009360_0018_103211CCB1826870"/>thus to the Society, concerning the people at Stratford: When I was at Connecticut, thoſe of our communion at the church at Stratford, came to me in a body; and then, as they have ſince by letter, begged my interceſſion with the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Society, and the right reverend the Lord biſhop of London, for a miſſionary; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very much in earneſt, and are the beſt ſet of men I met with in that country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How theſe ſeveral teſtimonies which have been produc'd will operate upon Dr. Mayhew, it is not eaſy to ſay; but to the ſober, judicious and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, the following concluſions may perhaps be thought fairly drawn, viz. That the Society have omitted no proper means of information concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of religion in the colonies—That their religious ſtate muſt therefore be competently known to that venerable board—And that if they have been guilty of any notorious miſconduct or miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of their charity, it could not be owing to ignorance of the true condition of things abroad, but muſt be attributed to ſome other cauſe: For allowing what the Dr. has moſt uncharitably inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that the miſſionaries have miſrepreſented the condition of things among us, and by that means endeavoured to miſlead the Society to an improper application of the monies lodged in their hands; yet can any modeſt perſon ſuppoſe that Governors of colonies, merchants, and other gentlemen of character, have all along combined with the ſaid <hi>wicked</hi> miſſionaries, to abuſe and miſlead the Society into a wrong diſpoſition of their charity? Or is it probable that their own members, ſeveral of whom do reſide in the colonies, ſhould conſpire with the worthy perſons before mentioned to carry on the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009360_0019_103211CED41CA6B0"/>deceit? It is hoped the Dr. himſelf is not ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a party ſpirit as to affirm the probability of this, if he is, without doubt he is alone in ſuch an uncharitable cenſure. And therefore this point may be left without any further remarks, to the public opinion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Inquiry is; Whether the Society may not reaſonably be ſuppoſed to underſtand the true ſenſe, meaning and deſign of their Charter.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who examine the liſt of members of which the Society is compoſed, as it is exhibited in the yearly abſtract of their proceedings, the preſent inquiry will appear very extraordinary. That a Sett of Gentlemen, many of them highly diſtinguiſh'd in the world for their great parts, and extenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, ſhould miſtake, or be at a loſs about the true meaning of a charter, which has nothing at all in it that is intricate or obſcure, is what no reaſonable perſon will admit. And notwithſtanding the Dr's <hi>refined criticiſm,</hi> ſome may perhaps imagine that it muſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue no ſmall meaſure of ſelf-ſufficiency in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to oppoſe his ſingle ſentiment, to that of ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſpectable a body. Few beſides the Dr. himſelf, will really believe that they needed his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for acquiring a right underſtanding of their charter. If we ſhould ſuppoſe, that thoſe very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed divines, who from the beginning have compoſed a conſiderable part of that body, ſhould be leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the phraſe and purport of an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſome meaſure foreign to their profeſſion; yet doubtleſs the Lord Chancellor, the chief Juſtices of the King's Bench and common pleas, whoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar profeſſion it is, may be ſuppoſed to underſtand the nature of inſtruments of this kind. And as the Society are obliged to exhibit an annual account of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009360_0020_103211D0AFE20A98"/>their proceedings to theſe very learned and worthy perſons, it is ſurprizing that they ſhould ſuffer them to proceed above 60 years, without once acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that their conduct was not agreeable to the <hi>Letter and Spirit</hi> of their charter. That the Society ſhould at laſt be obliged to a <hi>profound critic</hi> in New-England for an ellucidation of this kind, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many years ſtood the teſt of an annual exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, by thoſe whom the royal wiſdom thought proper to appoint as their ſuperviſors—Believe it they that can—</p>
            <p>Some friend of the Dr's may poſſibly here cry our, what would this remarker be at? The Dr. has plainly prov'd that the Society have been guilty of great miſconduct, have acted quite inconſiſtent with the intent and deſign of their charter, and from a principle of charity is willing to impute it to miſinformation, or ignorance; while this writer who affects to be the friend of the Society is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to defeat the Dr's benevolent purpoſe, and ſeems as tho' he deſigned to prove their miſconduct to be wilful.</p>
            <p>After thanking the candid Dr. for his good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the author confeſſes it is his opinion, and he thinks it has in ſome meaſure been prov'd; either that the Society have not acted inconſiſtent with their charter, or if they have done ſo, that it was knowingly, wilfully and deſignedly done. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thinks, as all reaſonable men muſt think, that the Society do very well underſtand the deſign and meaning of their charter—And alſo that they have a competent knowledge of the ſtate of religion in the plantations.</p>
            <p>If theſe two things are allowed, the concluſion will unavoidably be what was mentioned before, viz.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009360_0021_103211D290166498"/>either that the Society have <hi>wilfully</hi> miſconducted, of elſe, that there has been no miſconduct in the caſe—That they have <hi>wilfally</hi> miſconducted the Dr. difallows, therefore, there has been no miſeconduct at all.—Here then the argument and imputation which the Dr. has caſt upon the Society, drop of courſe.</p>
            <p>However, tho' the Dr. has been candid enough to clear the Society from any intentional abuſe of their charter, poſſibly others may not be ſo ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Beſides it may be eſteemed unfair to take this advantage of the Dr's conceſſion, to the neglect of thoſe many curious arguments he has brought to prove what he had before given up; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the inconſiſtency of it, he has throughout his book laboured to prove (that which he gave up in the beginning;) that the Society have really been guilty of wilful and deſigned abuſe of their truſt. And therefore the author hopes the Dr. will forgive it, if upon a general view of the obſervations, he is led to queſtion the ſincerity of that declaration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, viz. <q>That it is not his intention to charge that venerable body (the Society) with any wilful known miſconduct or improper appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of monies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Noah Hobart (whom by the way the Dr. has dubb'd a <hi>biſhop,</hi> for his heroic exploits in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy) has plainly ſpoke out, and directly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Society with a deſigned abuſe and perverſion of their truſt, at leaſt ſince the firſt ten years after their incorporation,<note n="†" place="bottom">Hobart's 2d Addreſs, p. 126. compar'd with following pages.</note> though indeed like the Dr. he afterwards ſeems diſpoſed in ſome meaſure to retract the charge, and chuſes rather to impute it to their ignorance of the ſtate of religion in New-England,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009360_0022_103211D4F7484860"/>and to the impoſition and miſrepreſentation of their <hi>wicked</hi> miſſionaries.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Hob. 2d Addreſs, p. 145.</note> But the author conceives it has already been proved that their conduct cannot be imputed to a want of knowledge, and whatever the diſpoſition of Mr. Hobart or his copier may be, it is preſumed that an accuſation of the Society as wilfully betraying their truſt, will be received by the impartial world, with the reſentment it deſerves. It is not the Society alone, who are thus unjuſtly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned by theſe licentious pens, but the integrity and honor of their inſpectors alſo, the Lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and the chief juſtices of the King's bench, who yearly examine and approve their tranſactions, do of conſequence ſuffer impeachment by their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny; nay the extenſive abuſe reaches to every benefactor to that Society, who, as an annual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their proceedings is publiſhed and put into their hands, muſt be ſuppoſed to approve them, ſince otherwiſe it is more than probable they would have withdrawn their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>As for the learned and ingenious Dr. Mayhew, he certainly deſcended very low, when he vouchſafed to become the tranſcriber of Mr. Hobart's addreſs, for (excepting ſome perſonal reflections upon his antagoniſt) there appears little elſe throughout his obſervations, beſides a ſervile copying of that curious peice <hi>of defamation.</hi> The method indeed he may claim to himſelf, and ſometimes the phraſe and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſion. The Dr. owns "the book has been of ſervice to him," and promiſed to "make proper acknowledgments wherever he ſhould make uſe of it" yet has not perhaps always been ſo good as his word; nor will the empty honor of a <hi>biſhop</hi> which he arbitrarily confers on him, be allow'd a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009360_0023_103211D680D64778"/>ſufficient compenſation for the liberties of this kind which he has taken. He aſſerts that "Mr. Hobart wrote ſo ſolidly, and judiciouſly upon the ſubject, that it was hardly needful for him to ſay any thing," this is granted, unleſs he could have advanced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new, which the other had not offer'd before; eſpecially as Mr. Hobart's peice received as ſolid and judicious an anſwer, which the Dr. thought proper wholly to neglect. In truth, had the Dr. but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully read the Rev. Mr. Beach's diſpaſſionate but maſterly reply to Mr. Hobart's ſecond addreſs, he might have ſeen a full and compleat anſwer to all he has written (except what is merely perſonal) without breaking in upon that peaceable diſpoſition which gives him ſuch "an <hi>averſion to controverſy.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The Dr. affirms p. 18. That <q>nothing is to be ſuppoſed the object, or any part of the object of this charitable and royal inſtitution, but what plainly appears to be really ſo, from the very words of the charter"— and a little after "the words of the charter itſelf muſt determine and limit the ſenſe of the royal Grantor, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the legal power conferred on the — Grantees.</q> We ſhall ſee preſently how far the Dr. adheres to his own invariable rule of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He confeſſes <q>that the Britiſh plantations or the King's ſubjects were really the primary, more immediate object of this inſtitution.</q> And pray why not the ſole and entire object of it? There is certainly no other object "particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed" in the charter, beſides that of the King's ſubjects. Has he forgot what he had aſſerted but a few lines before, that <q>nothing is to be ſuppoſed any part of the object of this inſtitution, but what plainly appears to be ſo from the very words of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009360_0024_103211D85B40D268"/>the charter.</q> Why then are the King's ſubjects ſaid to be the <hi>primary, more immediate,</hi> and not the <hi>ſole</hi> object of their inſtitution? ſince they are the only object expreſly mentioned in the <hi>very words of the charter.</hi> It was a ſtrange overſight in this great critic, to depart ſo ſuddenly from his invariable rule; or perhaps there was a deſign to be ſerved in interpreting the charter by way of implication, tho' expreſly contrary to his own rule of a literal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; and that was to perſwade the world, that this ſociety was erected chiefly for propagating the Goſpel among the Indians. To this purpoſe he has conveniently contrived two objects of this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one <q>primary and immediate (the Kings ſubjects) the other the grand ultimate object which is the Indians bordering on the colonies.</q> But becauſe the expreſs words of the charter, which he had repreſented as the ſole rule of their conduct, unluckily make no mention of "this grand ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate deſign", therefore he found himſelf under a neceſſity of departing from the rule himſelf had contrived, in order to adapt one of greater latitude. Indeed the Dr. aſſures us that this phraſe <hi>"the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the goſpel in thoſe parts,"</hi> neceſſarily "includes the grand ultimate deſign" before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned "of chriſtianizing the Indians." But pray Dr. why ſo? Is not the deſign of that phraſe <hi>the propagation of the goſpel</hi> fully anſwer'd, by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to thoſe of the King's ſubjects who ſeem to be abandon'd to atheiſm and infidelity, and to thoſe other "inferior ſubjects the ſlaves"? many of whom even in New-England are yet in a ſtate of Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm. Does not the royal Grantor ſay expreſly, "we think it our duty to promote the glory of God, by the inſtruction of <hi>our people</hi> in the chriſtian
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009360_0025_103211DA94D36FA8"/>religion?" Is there a ſingle word about the heathen bordering on our colonies? Why will he then force upon us a deſign which the charter does not mention?</p>
            <p>What is here ſaid is not intended to prove that the Society have not a power by their charter to propagate the Goſpel among the heathen, for they really have ſuch a power, and have accordingly made uſe of it, whenever opportunity has offer'd to do it with ſucceſs; and will continue to do ſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his endeavours to miſrepreſent, and leſſen the merit of their pious labours. But the author's intention is to ſhow the Dr. the ſophiſtry of his argument, and that the rule he lays down for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the charter, would, if admitted, exclude the Society from this good work, and conſequently that his argument by proving too much, proves nothing at all.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Society have by their charter, not only a legal power of propagating the Goſpel among ſuch of the King's ſubjects as are in danger of loſing their chriſtianity thro' atheiſm or infidelity, and among the heathen who have not ſo much as heard of the name of Chriſt: But (as miniſtring greatly to theſe purpoſes) of ſupporting the means of religion among thoſe who have already, or who incline to receive it according to the legal eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and proviſion of the church of England. In ſhort whatever legal means are found neceſſary or conducive to ſecure or propagate the profeſſion of chriſtian religion as it is eſtabliſhed in England, and all other his Majeſty's dominions (Scotland excepted) and made a part of the conſtitution of the Engliſh <hi>nation;</hi> the Society have a right by their charter to make uſe of, underſtood in that generous view, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally deſigned and intended by the Grantor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:009360_0026_103211DC3A7C84D8"/>
But to this the Dr. further objects, that the Grantor <q>King William himſelf was bred up in the calviniſtic principles and diſcipline, quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in ſome reſpects to the epiſcopal, and is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppos'd to have retain'd a regard for the principles of his education all along; tho' as King of England and head of that church, there was a neceſſity of his <hi>externally conforming</hi> to its rites and diſcipline</q>—The reader is deſired to ſtop here for a moment, and indulge his aſtoniſhment. Was this glorious deliverer then a finiſh'd hypocrite? Was he under a neceſſity of acting contrary to his conſcience? of conforming externally to the church of England while his heart was not in all this? What blacker picture could he have drawn of thoſe whom he calls "the infamous race of the Stewarts"<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Than. Serm. 1758 p. 48.</note> than he has here given of this excellent prince? A Prince for whom he pretends a reſpect, at leaſt as much reſpect as he is capable of paying to any crowned head: For he aſſures us in a very ſolemn manner, that <q>the greateſt part of mankind now are, and almoſt always have been oppreſſed by wicked tyrants, called civil rulers, Kings and Emperors <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid.

               </q> So this perhaps is to paſs for a light cenſure upon the memory of our glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer. And this ſuppoſitious reflection upon King William was introduced it ſeems to prove that he could not look upon the miniſtry in the church of England as orthodox, in oppoſition to thoſe who diſſent from the eſtabliſhment. But he might have ſound a better argument to prove that he could and did look upon it in that light; for certainly better evidence could not be given of his regard for the church of England, and his deſire to ſee it take
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009360_0027_103211DE219CA510"/>place and flouriſh in New-England, than his giving a hundred pounds ſterling per annum out of the privy purſe for ſupporting a miniſter of the church of England in Boſton, and his beſtowing a valuable library of books on King's chapel in that town; to which (tho' not immediately relative to N. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) gratitude will oblige all true ſons of the church of England in America to add, his royal foundation of a college at Williamſburg in Virginia for the ſame noble purpoſe. If the King himſelf could ſo liberally part with his own money to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what the Dr. calls the <hi>peculiarities of epiſcopacy;</hi> it can hardly be doubted but that he would readily encourage the charity of others in doing the like. So that it is not quite ſo "unnatural" as the Dr. ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines <q>to ſuppoſe that <hi>that</hi> noble ſpirited Prince had ſuch an intention.</q> Indeed it would be unnatural to ſuppoſe the contrary, viz. that in making a grant in favor of a corporation of the church of England, he ſhould make uſe of a word in ſome peculiar ſenſe of his own, and different form that in which he knew they had been accuſtom'd to underſtand it. It may therefore very reaſonably be admitted that by ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox miniſters in this charter, the Grantor did <q>intend thoſe of the Engliſh church, <hi>not</hi> in diſtinction from all other churches in the world,</q> but in diſtinction from all thoſe churches in the Engliſh dominions, (Scotland excepted) who diſſent from the legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional eſtabliſhment of England.</p>
            <p>As pertinent to what has been here ſaid, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſage is inſerted, with which Dr. Humphries worthily concludes his hiſtory of the Society. <q>In gratitude to the memory of the founder of this Society King William the third, it may not be improper to conclude this treatiſe with remarking
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009360_0028_103211DFA4AA4AA0"/>to the reader, the erecting of this corporation, was among the laſt public actions of his heroic life. After having reſcued the proteſtant religion in Europe, and ſaved the church of England here, he did by this laſt act, as it were bequeath it to his American ſubjects, as the moſt valuable legacy, and greateſt bleſſing.</q> But the Dr. adds— <q>to ſay that the Grantees underſtood the term orthodox in this narrow excluſive ſenſe, is to reflect upon their underſtandings.</q> As to their underſtandings, it would become him to ſpeak with reverence of them, as what he is not qualified to take the meaſure of: Nor is it any reflection upon them, that they ſhould underſtand the term <hi>orthodox</hi> in ſuch a limited ſenſe. For as the words orthodox and heterodox do in their literal ſignification import, the one a right, and the other a wrong or different opinion, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relative to religion, ſo, they who adhere to the legal eſtabliſhed proviſion, are uſually termed orthodox, or perſons who hold a right opinion, and they who diſſent from ſuch eſtabliſhment are ſaid to be heterodox, that is, perſons who hold a wrong or different opinion, whether their diſſent ariſes from doctrinal points, or ritual injuctions. Nor had the Dr. any occaſion to wonder that his antagoniſt ſhould underſtand the word <hi>orthodox</hi> as well capable of the ſenſe he had put upon it, ſince it is uſed in the ſame ſenſe in the hiſtorical account of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety as quoted by himſelf.<note n="†" place="bottom">

AND this ſeems to be a proper place to take notice of another miſtake that both the Dr. and his voucher have gone into, relative to eſtabliſhments. The Dr. does not indeed ſeem quite ſo clear as his voucher, that congregationaliſm or independency are eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in New-England; yet he has ſaid enough to ſhew his inclination that the reader ſhould believe it. Thus in his 16th page he calls the miniſters and churches of New-England, the "eſtabliſhed miniſters and churches;" and a notable proof of their eſtabliſhment he gives us at the 42d page, where he ſays, that the government of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay made a law for the ſupport of a learned and orthodox miniſtry, and this the Dr. calls a "civil eſtabliſhment of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion." I ſuppoſe the government will ſcarcely thank Him for this interpretation of that law, which really is charging them with invading the King's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and eſtabliſhing themſelves: No ſays the Dr. in the next page, for the <q>acts which relate to the ſettlement and ſupport of the goſpel miniſtry here, received the royal ſanction, and therefore our churches <hi>ſeem</hi> to have a proper legal eſtabliſhment.</q> I believe if the Dr. held an eſtate upon a title ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, as that of its being merely overlook'd, he would be ſolicitous of obtaining a better confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Indeed he is ſo modeſt as only to aſſert that "they <hi>ſeem</hi> to have a legal eſtabliſhment;" but ſince he knew that this was no eſtabliſhment at all; it was perhaps not quite ingenuous to tell his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that it <hi>ſeemed</hi> to be one.</p>
            <p>IN his 72d page he aſſerts, that the Church of England "is not eſtabliſhed here," which appears to be introduced as another reaſon why the New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land churches are eſtabliſhed. But now if it ſhould appear, that the church of England really is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009360_0030_103211E44485C6A0"/>here, and has been ſo from the firſt ſettlement of the country; and that the churches (as he affects to call them) of New England ſubſiſt here as the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing congregations do in England, upon no other foot than that of a toleration: I ſuppoſe the world will not look upon it very modeſt in him to ſpeak of the church of England in theſe colonies, as a <hi>party,</hi> a <hi>faction, little epiſcopal parties, ſmall diſaffected</hi> and <hi>diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parties.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Obſerv. p. 55. 56. 57. 110. and in many other places.</note>— It will be proper therefore to ſhew,

            <p>THAT the New-England churches had no eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment till the act of toleration took place, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from their own confeſſion; for ſuch I take to be their ſending an addreſs of thanks to King James the 2d. for a toleration of religion. Thus the affair is related by Dr. Douglaſs. <q>Anno 1687. The miniſters of Maſſachuſetts-Bay colony, jointly ſent an addreſs of thanks to K. James 2d. for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, or general toleration of religious opinions and congregations; this was ſent over and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to K.

                  <p>THE Lords Juſtices being informed from ſuch good hands, as make the truth of this advice not to be doubted, that at a general convention of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, from ſeveral parts of his Majeſty's province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, at Boſton, on the 27th of May laſt, a memorial and addreſs was framed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to you as Lieut. Governor and commander in chief, and to the council and houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives then ſetting, deſiring that the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would call the ſeveral churches in this province to meet by their paſtors, and meſſengers, in a ſynod, which memorial and addreſs, being accordingly preſented by ſome of the ſaid miniſters, in the name, and at the deſire of the ſaid convention, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in council, the 3d of June following; and there approved, but the houſe of repreſentatives put off the conſideration of it to the next ſeſſion, in which the council afterwards concurred.</p>
                  <p>Their Excellencies were extremely ſurprized, that no account of ſo extraordinary and important tranſaction ſhould have been tranſmitted by you, purſuant to an article in your inſtructions, by which you are directed upon all occaſions, to ſend unto his Majeſty, and to the commiſſioners for trade and plantations, a particular account of all your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and the condition of affairs within your
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009360_0032_103211E7A6A0EE68"/>government. <hi>As this matter doth highly concern his Majeſty's royal prerogative,</hi> their Excellencies referr'd the conſideration of it, to Mr. Attorney and Solicitor General, who after mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and making all proper enquiries, reported, <hi>That from the charter and laws of your colony, they cannot collect that there is any regular eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of a</hi> NATIONAL <hi>or provincial church there,</hi> ſo as to warrant the holding of convocations or ſynods of the clergy, but if ſuch ſynods might be holden, yet they take it to be clear in point of law, that his Majeſty's ſupremacy in eccleſiaſtical affairs, being a branch of his prerogative, does take place in the plantations, and that ſynods cannot be held, nor is it lawful for the clergy to aſſemble as in ſynods, without authority from his Majeſty." They conceive the above mentioned application of the ſaid Miniſters, not to you alone, as repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's perſon, <hi>but to you, and the council and the houſe of repreſentatives, to be a contempt of his Majeſty's prerogative, as it is a public acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that the power of granting what they deſire, reſides in the legiſlative body of the province, which by law is veſted only in his Majeſty.</hi> And the Lieut. Governor, council and aſſembly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddling therein, was an invaſion of his Majeſty's royal authority, which it was your duty as Lieut. Governor, to have withſtood and rejected, and that the conſent of the Lieut.

                  <p>Their Excellencies, upon conſideration of this opinion, of the attorney and ſolicitor general, which they have been pleaſed to approve, have commanded me to acquaint you with, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009360_0033_103211E99825F9F0"/>to you their ſurprize, that no account of ſo remarkable a tranſaction, which ſo nearly concerns the King's prerogative, and the welfare of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's province under your government, has been received from you, and to ſignify to you their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, that you do put an effectual ſtop to any ſuch proceedings, but if the conſent deſired by the miniſters above mentioned, for the holding of the ſynod, ſhould have been obtained, and <hi>this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſynod</hi> ſhould be actually ſitting, when you receive theſe their Excellencies directions, they do in that caſe, require and direct you, to cauſe ſuch their meeting to ceaſe, acquainting them that <hi>their aſſembly is againſt law, and a contempt of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's prerogative,</hi> and that they are forbid to meet any more; but if notwithſtanding ſuch ſignification, they ſhall continue to hold ſuch an aſſembly, you are then to take care that the principal actors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be proſecuted for a miſdemeanour. But you are to avoid doing any formal act to diſſolve them, leſt it be conſtrued to imply that they had a right to aſſemble. This Sir, is what I have in command from their Excellencies to ſignify to you.</p>
                  <p>And I muſt obſerve to you, that the precedent quoted in the above mentioned memorial of ſuch a ſynod being held 45 years ago, falls in with the year 1680, and that the former charter, upon which the government of your province depended, was repealed by ſcire facias in the year 1684, and the new charter was granted in the year 1691, from whence it appears, that if ſuch ſynod was holden as is alledged, it happened a ſhort time before the repealing of the old charter, but none has been ſince the granting the new one.</p>

LET us now compare Dr. Mayhew's opinion with that of the attorney and ſolicitor general as given us in the foregoing letter; and to make the matter more plain to the reader, I will place them oppoſite to each other (as they are truly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) in ſeperate columns thus,</p>
            <p>Dr. Mayhew's aſſertion that the New-England churches are eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed here.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The government of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay, in the 4th of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam and Mary, made a law for the ſupport of a learned and orthodox miniſtry; it is needleſs therefore to look any farther back, for a civil eſtabliſhment of religion here. Obſv. p. 42.</item>
               <item>2. The acts which relate to the ſettlement and ſupport of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſtry here, received the coyal ſanction, and therefore our churches ſeem to have a proper legal eſtabliſhment. P. 43.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Attorney and Solicitor General's opinion, and the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Lords Juſtices thereupon.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the charter and laws of your colony (viz. Maſſachuſetts Bay) they cannot collect, that there is any regular eſtabliſhment of a national or provincial church there.</item>
               <item>2. The acknowledgment of ſuch a power in the legiſlative body of the province is a contempt of his Majeſty's prerogative.</item>
            </list>
            <p>IT is really ſurprizing, that after ſuch a letter as this (of which it is ſuppoſed the Dr. could not be ignorant) he ſhould notwithſtanding aſſert that the New-England churches are eſtabliſhed. What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his argument for a civil or legal eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, founded on certain acts of aſſembly, not formally ſet aſide, and therefore ſuppoſed to be confirmed by royal ſanction, when the foregoing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter declares that the attributing ſuch a power to the legiſlative body here is a direct invaſion of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's prerogative. Whether the Dr. will incline to diſpute this point with the Lords Juſtices, and prove that the Attorney and Solicitor General did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the colony charter, as he has attempted to prove that the Society do not underſtand theirs, I am not able to ſay. I ſhall leave him to determine that matter with himſelf, as he ſhall think beſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:009360_0035_103211ED607C2980"/>
BUT perhaps the Dr. may be better ſatisfied by an argument in his own way.—He lays it down as a rule for interpreting the charter of the Society, that <q>nothing can be ſuppoſed the object or any part of the object of that inſtitution, but what plainly appears to be ſo, from the very words of the charter, even tho' it were certain that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom it was granted, had at the very time, ſome farther views and ends in obtaining it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which are expreſſed, or plainly implied; yet the words of the charter itſelf muſt determine and limit the ſenſe of the royal Grantor, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the legal power conferred—It was <hi>only</hi> for thoſe purpoſes that are particularly expreſſed, not any private or ſecret ones, which they might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have had in their own minds, that they were incorporated.</q> Let us now apply this rule to the charter granted to the Maſſachuſetts Bay. Nothing can be ſuppoſed the object or any part of the object of this conſtitution, but what plainly appears to be ſo from the very words of their charter, which very words muſt determine and limit the ſenſe of the Grantor. It was only for thoſe purpoſes that are particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed —Let the Dr. now read and examine the preſent colony charter, bearing date 1691, and point out to us the paſſage or paſſages where in expreſs words a power is granted of inſtituting an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical eſtabliſhment, or to uſe his own words, a civil eſtabliſhment of religion; but if nothing of this kind is to be found in it; if ſuch a power be neither the object, nor any part of the object of the colony charter, it is more than probable that there is no ſuch eſtabliſhment as the Dr. contends for exiſting.</p>
            <p>IF any thing further ſhould be thought neceſſary to confute the pretence of the New-England
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009360_0036_103211EF3B8E5A68"/>churches being eſtabliſhed in the colonies, I ſhall refer the reader to a letter ſent from her Majeſty and the Privy Council to the colony of Connecticut, Oct, 11th, 1705. See Doug. Sum. Vol. 2. p. 339.</p>
            <p>IT has been now ſufficiently proved that the New-England churches are not eſtabliſhed here. We will therefore inquire whether the church of England be not eſtabliſhed in the colonies.—This was before affirm'd.—I ſhall now attempt to prove it. One would imagine indeed that there ſhould be no occaſion to enter upon the proof of a thing ſo plain and evident as this is; ſince whatever difficulty there might be in determining this matter before, yet certainly there can be none at all ſince the union of the two kingdoms, <q>becauſe, ſays Dr. Douglas, by the act of union of Scotland and England, it is provided that the church of England govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the Engliſh colonies was for ever eſtabliſhed.<note n="†" place="bottom">Doug. Sammary, vol. 1. p. 440, 441.</note>
               </q> The ſame author obſerves in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, that <q>by the articles of union of the two nations of Great-Britain, May 1707, the church of England is eſtabliſhed in perpetuity, in all the territories at that time to England belonging.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Do. p. 443.</note>
               </q> I am a loſs how the Dr. ſhould overlook ſo plain a caſe as this, ſo as to deny the eſtabliſhment of the church of England in theſe colonites, and to affirm that of the New-England churches. Poſſibly the Dr. never examined the point himſelf, but took it upon truſt from his voucher.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' it is undeniably manifeſt that the church of England is eſtabliſhed in all the Engliſh colonies by the act of union before-mentioned; yet it may not be ſo clear, that this eſtabliſhment actually took place before that time; and altho' it is ſufficient to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009360_0037_103211F189A7C570"/>the preſent argument, that the church of England has been eſtabliſhed here from the time of the union aforeſaid; yet for the ſake of ſuch as have not had opportunity of examining this matter, I ſhall lay the caſe before the reader, as I find it already done to my hands by a learned and judicious writer, in a letter to the Rev. Mr. Thomas Foxcroft, printed in the year 1745.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THE chriſtian religion (ſays this ingenious author) as by its evidence and intrinſic excellency it recommended itſelf to the Engliſh government, ſo it became by law the religion of the Engliſh nation; and the church of England likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came by law their national church; and when any part of the Engliſh nation ſpread abroad into colonies, as they continued part of the nation, the law obliged them equally to the Church of England and to the chriſtian religion. And the ſtatutes for the eſtabliſhment of the ſervice ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and articles of this church, made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd before and at the union of the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ſettle and eſtabliſh it alike in <hi>the dominions</hi> of England, and in the realm it ſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>IN the reign of Edward VI. certain biſhops and learned men by the appointment of the King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd an order and rite of common prayer, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the ſacraments, in a book entitled, the book of common prayer, and adminiſtration of the ſacraments, and other rites and ceremonies, after the uſe of the church of England. In the 3d year of his reign, an act of parliament was made (2d and 3d of Edward VI. c. 1.) entitled the penalty for not uſing uniformity of ſervice and adminiſtration of ſacraments, whereby it was enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—That all miniſters in any pariſh church, or
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009360_0038_103211F3A674D940"/>other place withing the <hi>King's dominions,</hi> ſhould be bound to ſay and uſe the celebration of the Lord's Supper, and all their common and open prayer, in ſuch order and form as is mentioned in this book, and none other, or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>IN the ſixth year of his reign, this book of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, was by order of parliament (5th and 6th of Edward VI. c. 1.) explained and perfected, and a form of making and conſecrating, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons was added to it; and by an act of parliament (entitled, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of prayer, and adminiſtration of ſacraments ſhall be uſed in the church) it was enacted, that the former act ſhould ſtand in full force and ſtrength, for eſtabliſhing this book of common prayer, &amp;c. as it was for the former book, and that if any manner of perſon inhabiting within <hi>his Majeſty's dominions,</hi> ſhould willingly and witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear and be preſent at any other manner or form of common prayer, &amp;c. he ſhould ſuffer impriſonment, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IN the firſt year of the reign of Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth a few alterations and additions were made in this book of common prayer, and by an act of parliament (1 Eliz. c. 2.) entitled there ſhall be uniformity of prayer and adminiſtation of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it was enacted, that all miniſters in any pariſh church, or other place within the <hi>Queen's dominions,</hi> ſhould be bound to ſay and uſe the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lord's Supper, and adminiſtration of each of the ſacraments, and all the common and open prayer, in ſuch order and form, as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 5th and 6th of Edward the ſixth, with theſe alterations and additions, &amp;c. and that every perſon inhabiting within the <hi>Queen's Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009360_0039_103211F547790E30"/>dominions,</hi> ſhould diligently and faithfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reſort to the pariſh church, or ſome uſual place, where common prayer and ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God ſhould be uſed upon every ſunday, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IN the 13th year of Elizabeth, by an act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, entitled reformation of diſorders in the miniſters of the church: The preamble of which is, that the churches of the <hi>Queen's Majeſty's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,</hi> may be ſerved with paſtors of ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it was enacted that no perſon be admitted to any benefice with cure, except he ſhall firſt have ſubſcribed the 39 article.</p>
               <p>IN the 14th year of Charles the IId the book of common prayer, &amp;c. was by the appointment of the King reviewed, and in convocation altered and added to, and preſented to his Majeſty, and being approved and recommended by him to the parliament, was ſubſtituted in the place of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and the parliament by an act (entitled an act for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of public prayer, &amp;c.) reciting that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the 36th of the 39 articles, is in theſe words, viz. That the book of conſecration of Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and ordaining of prieſts and deacons, lately ſet forth in the time of King Edward the ſixth, and confirm'd at the ſame time by authority of parliament, doth contain all things neceſſary to ſuch conſecration and ordaining, &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoever are conſecrated, or ordered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rites of that book, ſince the 2d year of the aforenamed King Edward unto this time, or hereafter ſhall be conſecrated, or ordered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame rites, we decree all ſuch to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, orderly and lawfully conſecrated and ordered, enacted that all ſubſcriptions hereafter to be made
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009360_0040_103211F727DAA300"/>unto the ſaid articles—ſhall be conſtrued and taken to extend, and ſhall be apply'd for and touching the ſaid 36th article, and unto the book containing the form and manner of making, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, &amp;c. in ſuch fort and manner as the ſame did heretofore extend unto the book ſet forth in the time of King Edward the ſixth, mention'd in the ſaid 36th article. And by another paragraph in ſaid act, it is enacted, that the before-mentioned ſtatutes, for the uniformity of prayer and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of ſacraments, ſhould ſtand in full force and ſtrength to all intents and purpoſqdes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for the eſtabliſhing and confirming this book.</p>
               <p>IN the 5th year of the reign of Queen Anne, by an act of parliament (5. A. c. 5.) intitled, an act for ſecuring the church of England as by law eſtabliſhed, it was enacted that all acts of parliament then in force, for the eſtabliſhment and preſervation of the church of England, and the doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline and government thereof, ſhould remain and be in full force for ever; and that every King and Queen ſucceeding to the royal government of the kingdom of Great Britain, at his or her coronation ſhould take and ſubſcribe an oath to maintain, and preſerve inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the ſaid ſettlement of the church of England, and the doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, as by law eſtabliſhed within the kingdoms of England and Ireland, the dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the <hi>territories thereunto belonging.</hi> And by the act of union of England and Scotland (5. A. c. 8.) this act was made an <hi>eſſential and fundamental</hi> part of the union.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:009360_0041_103211F90AE4F0C0"/>
               <q>I have now cited ſeven ſtatutes for the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of the Church of England in the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.—Theſe ſtatutes are all now in force, and do equally eſtabliſh and confirm the Church of England, her worſhip, articles and ordination, in the plantations and in England it ſelf.</q> The force of the argument which has been drawn from them will doubtleſs prove ſatisfactory and convincing to every one who obſerves, that every ſubſequent ſtatute that has been cited refers to and confirms thoſe that preceeded, and by that means throw their united ſtrength upon the point here affirm'd; ſo that if plain direct poſitive acts of parliament have any force in framing and confirming an eſtabliſhment, the Church of England is beyond controverſy eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in all his Majeſty's colonies and plantations, and therefore in the Maſſachuſetts Bay and Connecticut.</p>
            <p>THE author does not recollect any thing that can reaſonably be alledged againſt this concluſion, unleſs the paſſage which was quoted before from the Lords Juſtices letter, viz. <q>that from the charter and laws of this colony it does not appear that there is any regular eſtabliſhment of a national or provincial church here,</q> ſhould be thought an objection. If this paſſage ſhould ſeem to any one, to exclude the plantations from any eſtabliſhment at all, whether of the church or congregational denomination: It may be anſwered; It is not the intention of the ſaid let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to aſſert that there is no eſtabliſhment of religion at all in the plantations; but that <hi>ſuch an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to be collected from any powers granted in the Maſſachuſetts charter, nor conſequently in the laws founded upon that charter.</hi> And ſince no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial power or privilege of this kind was conferr'd by the charter, it is evident that the ſtate of religion
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009360_0042_103211FB6DD8D100"/>in reſpect to eſtabliſhments muſt and does in fact reſt upon thoſe acts of parliament which relate to this ſubject, and eſpecially as they directly include all his Majeſty's dominions; it being moreover an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd maxim not only that all laws made in the plantations contrary to the laws of England are ipſo facto void, but alſo that where a caſe occurs for which the laws of any colony have made no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſuch caſe ſhall be determin'd by the laws at home. It appears then from all the acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ever were made relative to eſtabliſhments, that there is an eſtabliſhment of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the plantations, and that authority allow'd and ratify'd by the reigning prince, was the proper authority to make an eſtabliſhment. <q>The King (under God) is the ſupreme head of the church of England, and if he had not appointed an ordinary over New-England, it would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under his own immediate eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction as ſupreme head. But it is well known that his late Majeſty, in the firſt year of his reign, did impower the Biſhop of London, under the great ſeal, to exerciſe juriſdiction over the clergy in the plantations, which were not in any Dioceſs, but remained under the immediate juriſdiction of the King. <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Letter above-mentioned, 1745.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>WE may now quit the ſubject of eſtabliſhments, and proceed to conſider the Dr.'s fourth ſection, which contains ſundry "other things tending" (as he imagines) <q>to explain and confirm the ſenſe of the charter.</q> The firſt is, <q>the name by which this corporation is diſtinguiſhed,</q> viz. <hi>The Society for the propagation of the Goſpel.</hi> This has been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to before; it will only be neceſſary to add here,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009360_0043_103211FCF1D6E558"/>that the Society have in their conduct acted agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the import of this title, by ſending miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries into thoſe colonies which the Dr. allows to be proper objects of their inſtitution, by ſending others to the Indian natives, and by appointing catechiſts to the Negroes. In ſhort, they have ſo far comply'd with the import of this name or title, and with the deſign of their inſtitution, that the Dr. himſelf is forced to confeſs, however unwillingly, <q>that the Society have <hi>chiefly</hi> ſent their miſſionaries into thoſe Britiſh plantations where they were much needed, according to the true deſign of their inſtitution, and that they have thereby ſerved the intereſt of religion. <note n="†" place="bottom">Obſerv. p. 51.</note>
               </q> But then he ſays, <q>they have deviated from the plan of their charter in ſome other reſpects,</q> that is to ſay, they have ſometimes endeavoured to preſerve men from falling into infidelity by providing for them the means of religion,—forgive them this wrong—Doubtleſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry candid perſon will allow that their inſtitution admits of the preſervation as well as the extenſion of the goſpel, and whether the one or the other be done, it muſt be done agreeable to the particular profeſſion and ſentiments of thoſe who are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers of this work. The Dr. adds, <q>for ſeveral years, he thinks about eight or nine, after the Society was founded, they ſent no miſſionary into New-England, which may naturally be looked on <hi>(he ſays)</hi> as one argument that it was not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſidered among thoſe plantations which were ſuppoſed to ſtand in need of their charity.</q> But it is imagined that a better reaſon may be given why few or no miſſionaries were early ſent into New-England, and that is, that few or no ſocieties
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009360_0044_103211FF300361C0"/>or congregations, appeared at that time to aſk their charitable aſſiſtance. But afterwards frequent acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people of that communion from abroad, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the effect of reading and enquiry at home, joined with the enthuſiaſm which at times prevailed, eſpecially after Mr. Whitefields appearing among us, and which drove many of the more ſerious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate people into the boſom of the church; theſe things occaſioned ſuch an increaſe of the church of England, that the Society found it neceſſary, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a greater proportion of their aſſiſtance, as it was now earneſtly called for, and more apparently needed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next thing which the Dr. advances as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the deſign of the charter, is <q>
                  <hi>the common ſeal of the Society,</hi> which beſides a ſun in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the circle, has a ſhip within the circle under full ſail; on the prow of which ſtands a clergyman with a bible in his hand which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to a company of naked ſavages on the ſhore, thronging to receive the bleſſing, juſt over whom is a ſcroll implying theſe words <hi>come over and help us.</hi>
               </q> It is not eaſy to imagine what this proof was alledged for, ſince it either proves too much, or elſe nothing at all to his purpoſe. If it was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove that the <hi>ſole</hi> buſineſs of the Society ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their charter, was to carry the goſpel to the ſavages, this would directly contradict the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which declares the <hi>primary object of their inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to be the King's ſubjects,</hi> but if it was brought to prove that the converſion of the natives was one part of the deſign of their inſtitution, this is no more than what we allow, and is agreeable to the conduct of the Society as well as their charter. Taking therefore the deſign of the charter in that ſenſe, in which the ſociety have all along underſtood it, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009360_0045_10321200B4A1E850"/>agreeable to which they have practiſed, applying themſelves both to the King's ſubjects and the natives, and it very well agrees with the ſeal under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but if applyed wholly to the natives which is the uſe the Dr. ſeems to have bro't it for, inſread of agreeing, as he ſays it very well does, with the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it really is a flat contradiction to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next thing alledg'd by the Dr. in ſixing the ſenſe of the charter, is certain anniverſary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preached before the venerable Society, ſome paſſages of which he has quoted, in ſupport of his opinion; but this like the former inſtance produc'd by him, either juſtifies the Society, or elſe is nothing at all to the purpoſe. For does not the Dr. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf repreſent the deſign of their inſtitution to be that of preſerving and propagating chriſtianity among the King's ſubjects, and extending it alſo to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then? And has not this been the very practice of the Society from the beginning? And what do the anniverſary ſermons imply but certain exhortations to purſue the ſeveral objects of their inſtitution; thoſe which the Dr. has quoted inſiſt chiefly upon one topic, while other ſermons preached upon the ſame occaſion enlarge on ſome other branch of the general deſign? As to the particular paſſages cited by the Dr, he himſelf allows, that they do <q>rather coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, with the ultimate, than the more immediate deſign of the inſtitution, and ſo harmonize rather more perhaps with the ſeal and name of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, than with the charter.</q> What now are we to learn from hence, but that the ſeal and name of the ſociety, which a little before he had produced to explain and ſupport his ſenſe of the charter, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not harmonize with it at all, but only with the ſermons he has quoted. So all he had been offering
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009360_0046_103212029948CB28"/>before by way of proof, from the name and ſeal of the Society is now given up again, as being (what indeed it was) nothing to the purpoſe. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has a very ſtrange method of proving and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, of aſſerting and giving up again. Sure he could never expect to arrive at any ſolid concluſion, by this wanton method of arguing. The truth is, thoſe worthy gentlemen, who have preached the anniverſary ſermons before the Society, have not all of them conſined themſelves to the ſame topics, but as the inſtitution of the Society comprehended ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral objects, ſome have enlarged more particularly upon one object, and ſome upon another, as they ſeverally thought proper, but all within the general intendment and deſign of their charter; and if the Dr. had intended to have drawn an argument from theſe annual ſermons, in proof of the original deſign of their inſtitution, he ſhould have formed an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from them all, ſo far at leaſt as they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon different topics, and have given us the collective ſenſe of the whole. But this indeed would not have ſerved his turn; for he himſelf ſays <q>he is not inſenſible, that ſome of theſe ſermons, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially within the laſt twenty years, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in them of a much leſs catholic ſtrain;</q> that is to ſay, they do not ſo well ſuit his purpoſe; and in truth he has taken the liberty to treat them accordingly, that is with great indecency, as will appear to any one who conſults his 13th, 14th and 15th ſections, as well as many other paſſages of his book.</p>
            <p>The author has now gone thro' the Dr's repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Society's charter, together with the ſeveral arguments he has advanced, to ſupport the ſenſe he hath put upon it, and has endeavoured to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009360_0047_10321204758BF260"/>prove that they are altogether inconcluſive; whether he has ſucceeded or not, muſt be left to the judgment of the candid unprejudiced reader. In the mean time if the account which has now been given of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and inſtitution of the Society be juſt; all the Dr's accuſations of that venerable body, his charges of miſconduct, miſapplication of monies, and perverſion of the truſt which they have taken on themſelves, fall to the ground; and he has only to conſider what reparation he ought in conſcience to make, or endeavour to make, for the indecent liberties, and various abuſe he has been guilty of towards them.</p>
            <p>Here therefore the preſent examination ſeems to to conclude; but as there are yet many things in the Dr's book, which the author conceives to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely exceptionable, he thinks it proper to take notice of at leaſt ſome of them.</p>
            <p>It is a frequent ſubject of complaint with him, that the Society have not done enough towards the converſion of the Indians, tho' by their public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it appears that they have omitted nothing in their power to promote that good work; nor have they been entirely without ſucceſs. He is likewiſe much diſpleaſed, that more miſſionaries have not been ſent to thoſe colonies, whoſe religious ſtate he thinks to be but little removed from heatheniſm. What colonies he here refers to, we can be at no loſs about, ſince he excepts none but thoſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut and the Maſſachuſetts-Bay. He allows for inſtance that the Society might have ſupported miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the colony of Rhode-Iſland with propriety enough; and indeed they have done ſo, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might have done more than they have, if they had not met with too much oppoſition from a party ſpirit. For inſtance, The Society upon a repreſentation of the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009360_0048_1032120656A13E50"/>great neceſſity of a miſſionary in the Narraganſet, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in South and North Kingſton, at a time when there was no ſettled miniſter of any denomination; ſent thither Mr. Guy, Mr. Bridge, and afterwards Dr. Macſparran to officiate among them. To give a check to theſe gentlemens ſucceſs, and leſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſhould receive religion, as it is taught in the church of England; one Mr. Torrey was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched thither, who had ſo little pretenſions, and ſo few adherents, that he could not find five perſons to give him a call (which I think the platform requires) and yet is officiouſly continued there to this day, tho' his congregation, as I am informed by thoſe who live in the neighbourhood, uſually conſiſts of ſcarce twenty people.</p>
            <p>Again, The Society open'd a miſſion at Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about the year 1722 or 1723, where at that time there was no ſettled miniſter of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational perſuaſion. But for fear thoſe people ſhould receive the benefit of religion agreeable to the church of England, a congregational miniſter was ſoon ſent thither, and as it is ſaid, even forc'd upon the people, who refuſed to pay any thing towards his ſupport.</p>
            <p>Once more at Charleſtown in the Narraganſet, an attempt was made by ſeveral church families in that town, to eſtabliſh a miſſion for the benefit of themſelves, and the tribe of Indians in that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood (at that time about 400) to which attempt the Indians were ſo well diſpoſed, by the labours of Dr. Macſparran a neighbouring miſſionary, that the Sachem gave a piece of ground to erect a church upon, and a conſiderable quantity of land beſides, as a glebe for a miſſionary. Accordingly a church was ſet up, and the laudable deſign in a promiſing way, when one Mr. Parks was ſent thither, to give
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009360_0049_10321207D9970680"/>a check to the attempt, who by drawing off a party, and kindling a ſpirit of enthuſiaſm among both En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh &amp; Indians in that town, totally diſappointed and fruſtrated the above deſign.<note n="*" place="bottom">This liſt might have been greatly enlarged but it is an invidious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which the author by no means delights in; nor would have mentioned at all, if the Dr had not cry'd out ſo much about a party ſpirit, and ſaulted the Society for neglecting this colony.</note> Let the Dr. now reflect whoſe fault it is, that this colony has been no better provided with miſſionaries, and lay his hand upon his mouth, when it appears how indefatigable ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſhewn themſelves to fruſtate the Society's attempts, even in thoſe places where he allows they might laudably have employ'd their charity. Let it farther be obſerved in anſwer to the Dr's principal objection, viz. <q>that the Society do not allow a due proportion of their charity to the ſouthern <hi>heatheniſh</hi> governments, nor to the Indian miſſions.</q> As to the former, ſeveral of thoſe governments, <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> as they are, to their great honor be it ſpoken, have made a handſome proviſion among themſelves for the public worſhip of God, and therefore do no longer need the Society's help. And as to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he is certainly a very improper judge what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and diſcouragements they have met with in their attempts to convert the Indians; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaks at random, and with great want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when he ſays they have neglected that part of their inſtitution in order to propagate the church in N. England.</p>
            <p>The Dr's fifth ſection contains his account of the ſtate of religion in N. England, before and ſince the the incorporation of the Society. But this account in many things, can by no means be approved.</p>
            <p>It is not the author's intention to call in queſtion the religious character of the firſt adventure s to N.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009360_0050_1032120A1BBCEFD8"/>England, he doubts not in the leaſt but that they were ſerious well meaning people, and altho' labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſome miſtakes and prejudices, yet many of them perſons of great wiſdom and underſtanding as well as piety. Nor will it be diſputed that they made "early proviſion for the public worſhip of God":<note n="*" place="bottom">Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the mean time it may not be improper to take ſome notice of the great veneration the Dr. profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the memory of theſe our pious fore-fathers, who firſt came into this country, for the ſake of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying (as he ſays) purity of faith and worſhip. Could the Dr. have mentioned theſe good fathers without bluſhing, if he had reflected how widely he has departed from the faith which theſe good men profeſſed, and that as to the moſt eſſential doctrines of chriſtianity?<note n="‡" place="bottom">See his ſermons, on the terms of ſalvation—Of being found in Chriſt— Of juſtification by ſaith—and particularly his 2d ſer. on chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety —Compare theſe with the doctrines taught by the early writers and divines of N. England.</note> Or muſt we take his appeals and harrangues of this kind to be mere grimace, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a deſign calculated <hi>ad captum vulgi,</hi> to raiſe a ferment in the minds of the people, who cannot help retaining, and that very juſtly, a value for the memory of their progenitors? Whatever their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of liberty, or purity of religion amounted to, they certainly had no great opinion of <hi>the learned Socinus;</hi> they entertained thoſe <hi>orthodox</hi> opinions, at leaſt concerning the divinity of the Son of God, which the Dr. has treated in ſo bold, as well as lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous a manner; and had he lived in their days,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009360_0051_1032120BFB387A08"/>he muſt either have enlarged his creed, or ſelt the effects of their honeſt reſentment. But tho' he has no right to take ſhelter under the merit of thoſe good men who are ſuppoſed to have firſt come hither for the ſake of enjoying a pure religion according to their conſciences, ſince he is departed from that purity of ſaith, whatever it was, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, as far as darkneſs is from light. Yet becauſe this ſtale pretence concerning the deſign of the firſt adventurers as to religious matters is artfully and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly propagated among the common people who have not ſufficient opportunities of examining this matter, it will be neceſſary to give it a more particular conſideration.</p>
            <p>Dr. Douglaſs acquaints us that <q>Robert Brown, a hot-headed young enthuſiaſtical clergyman, began anno 1580, to preach againſt the ceremonies and diſcipline of the church of England; he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeacuted or baited and teazed by the biſhops courts, he with ſome diſciples left England, and formed a church at Middleborough of Zealand in the Dutch low countries; after ſome time this effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence or cbulition of youth ſubſided, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to England, recanted, and had a church of England cure beſtowed upon him, and died in that communion, anno 1630.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A congregation of theſe Browniſts was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Yarmouth 1602, being harraſs'd by the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church of England, with their paſtor they tranſported themſelves to Leyden in Holland; here they became more moderate under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their paſtor Mr. Robinſon; and from Browniſts changed their denomination to that of Independents: Being of unſteady temper, they reſolved to remove from amongſt ſtrangers after
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009360_0052_1032120DE3C764B0"/>ten years reſidence, to ſome remote country in ſome wilderneſs, where without moleſtation they might worſhip God in their own devotional way. <note n="†" place="bottom">Sum. Hiſt Polit. Vol I. p. 369. See alſo p. 53, 60.</note>
               </q> Dr. Douglaſs adds, that they <q>obtained an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from K. James I. for the free exerciſe of their religion in any part of America</q>; but in this article he is contradicted by Mr. Prince in his chronology; who ſays the utmoſt they could obtain was <q>that the King would connive at them, and not moleſt them, provided they carry peaceably: but to tolerate them by his public authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſeal would not be granted. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prince's Chronolo p. 57.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the firſt effectual ſettlement in N. England was clearly made upon a religious account: But as to the firſt ſettlers of the colony of the Maſſachuſetts Bay, underſtood as poſterior to, and diſtinct from that of Plymouth, they plainly acted as other men uſually do upon like occaſions, from hopes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their eſtates, and providing an ample inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance for their children. Having for theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes negotiated a ſettlement for ſome time, by a Governor and Company reſiding in England, they at length thought it moſt for the intereſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, that the ſeat of government ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the country they were ſettling. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Mr. Winthrop was choſen Governor, and he with his aſſociates embark'd on board ſundry ſhips, of which the Arabella was admiral, with a deſign to proceed to America.</p>
            <p>As it was now pretty generally known, that the Plymouth adventurers had ſet up a way of worſhip different from the public eſtabliſhment of the nation, it began to be ſuſpected and reported, that this new
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009360_0053_1032120FC7054978"/>company had a purpoſe of the ſame nature, as ſoon as they ſhould arrive in America. This came to the cars of Governor Winthrop and his aſſociates, while they lay wind-bound at Yarmouth, and it gave them great uneaſineſs, as well it might, to lie under the odium of this ſlander, and occaſioned their writing the following letter for their own exculpation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they put to ſea, viz.</p>

            <p>Previous to any application of the foregoing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it may be proper to obſerve, that Mr. Prince in his chronology gives teſtimony that theſe <hi>pious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were profeſſed members of the church of England.</hi> 
               <q>For the information (ſays he) of the preſent age as well as poſterity, they (this colony of pious people) were of a denomination ſomewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in thoſe early times from them of Plymouth—they were 'till now,</q> (that is, after their arrival in N.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From the foregoing letter and teſtimony it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that whatever the caſe was at other places, and with regard to other adventurers, the firſt ſettlers of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay at leaſt, thoſe pious good men, who left <q>the fair cities, villages, and delightful fields of Britain, for the then inhoſpitable ſhores,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009360_0055_10321213B2A36100"/>and deſarts of America</q> did not do it from any diſguſt they had taken at the eſtabliſhed religion of their country; but from quite other motives.—They poſitively declare their veneration for the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed church, that they <hi>eſteem it their honour to call her their dear mother,</hi> that they <hi>cannot part from the place of her ſpecial reſidence without much ſadneſs of heart, and many tears in their eyes,</hi> they acknowledge that <hi>the hope they have obtained in the common ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they received in her boſom, and ſuck'd from her breaſts.</hi> They declare <hi>they do not loath the milk with which they have been</hi> thus <hi>nouriſhed, but bleſs God for this their parentage and education,</hi> that <hi>their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions have been miſreported;</hi> that <hi>while they have breath, they will</hi> SINCERELY <hi>endeavour the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and abundance of her welfare, with</hi> THE ENLARGEMENT OF HER BOUNDS, <hi>in the kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſuch an explicit declaration as this, written and ſigned with their own hands, how can the Dr. pretend that theſe men were aggrieved at home, that they <q>came hither chiefly on account of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for non-conformity,</q> that <q>they fled hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hither as to an aſſylum from epiſcopal perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note n="*" place="bottom">Obs. p. 39.</note>?</q> Is the foregoing the language of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeacuted, of men ſuffering for conſcience ſake? In an honeſt and ſerious view, what foundation had he for calling upon people to <q>reflect on what their fore-fathers ſuffered from the mitred lordly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the fiſhermen of Galilee?</q> What truth in ſaying that this <q>occaſioned their flight into this weſtern world"? Did our pious fore-fathers throw themſelves into the arms of Savages and Barbarians, to be delivered from the unholy zeal
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:009360_0056_10321215922FBF18"/>and oppreſſions of theſe lordly men, countenanc'd by ſcepter'd tyrants?<note n="*" place="bottom">Obs. p. 155.</note>
               </q> And would they at the ſame time earneſtly aſk the aſſiſtance and prayers of theſe lordly oppreſſors, and openly acknowledge the ſpiritual benefits they had received from them? Read my dear countrymen, read the words of our pious fore-fathers, in the above letter, and compare them, with this author's licentious harangue, and pretended vindication of them, and ſee with your own eyes whether the ſpirit of the one and the other have the leaſt ſimilitude. In ſhort either theſe pious good men, were honeſtly attach'd to the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſerious members of her communion, or they were not; the Dr. affirms they were diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they themſelves declare, that they were faithful ſons and children of the church, <hi>educated in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, nouriſh'd at her breaſts, bleſſing God for this their education, promiſing to ſeek her welfare, with the enlargement of her bounds:</hi> From hence then one of theſe two things muſt unavoidably follow; either that they were dreadful prevaricators with God and man, or elſe that they are ſadly abuſed and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, when contrary to their own expreſs declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are ſaid to have been diſſenters, driven hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the oppreſſions and perſecution of the church of England. If the former was the caſe, let us no more boaſt of them as pious good men; If the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let the Dr. conſider, what recompence he can make to the memory of theſe men, for abuſing them with the opprobious charge of ſectariſm and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy.</p>
            <p>And this ſeems to be a proper place to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a reflection which the Dr. very liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon the eſtabliſhed church of England, which
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:009360_0057_10320CE1602493A0"/>he calls "a cruel perſecuting church"<note n="*" place="bottom">Obs. p 40</note> and ſays <q>the firſt ſettlers of the country were perſeacuted out of England by the eſtabliſhed church. <note n="§" place="bottom">p 46.</note>
               </q> And again, <q>is it not enough (ſays he) that they perſeacuted us out of the old world? will they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue us into the new?<note n="‡" place="bottom">p 156.</note>
               </q> And a few lines after he ſpeaks of the danger of being <q>conſumed by the flames, or deluged in a flood of epiſcopacy.</q> A ſtranger would perhaps be led by this manner of expreſſion to conceive, that not only fire and faggot were plentifully employed in England for extirpating diſſenters, but alſo that the Dutch method of knuting was uſed towards them for the ſame purpoſes. Theſe that have been mentioned are but a few, out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, very many bitter terms he has thought proper to beſtow upon a proteſtant church, univerſally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated abroad, and generally eſteemed the bulwark and glory of the reformation; a church remarkable for its tenderneſs, and kind reception of foreign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, when theſe have been obliged to fly from their native countries on account of real perſecution.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry the Dr. has made it neceſſary to enter upon a ſubject ſo invidious as this, and which lies ſo open to abundant recrimination. The author is unwilling to renew the memory of thoſe ſeverities, that were too commonly practiced by all parties in the laſt century, and which ſeem rather owing to the temper of the age, and the miſtaken maxims of policy then prevailing, than to have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of religious principles. The church of England, conſidered as ſuch, has nothing in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that either neceſſicates or warrants a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting temper; and if any improper ſeverities have at any time been uſed by the government, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting

Will the Dr. allow that if any of the denominations, Preſbyterian, Independent, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational, had now the power of government in their hands, they would put on the ſame oppreſſive temper?—ſurely he will not.—Nor does he find the church of England at this day practiſing any of thoſe ſeverities wherewith he labours to affright and prejudice people againſt her. No eſtabliſhment in the chriſtian world, is more gentle, or allows greater liberties to thoſe who diſſent from it, than the church of England. Even the Dutch, who are thought to afford as great liberty to conſcience as any chriſtian ſtate, are never known to admit any perſons into civil offices, who do not conform to the legal worſhip, which, altho' it be a reaſonable caution, is yet more than the Engliſh government are nice in exacting.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER may be the temper of particular men, it is pretty certain that at this time of day, all parties diſclaim thoſe ſeverities which have formerly been too much indulged; the people of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in particular, have ſpecial reaſon to be careful how they countenance thoſe who would promote ſuch a diſpoſition (to which ſome may think the Dr's manner of writing upon this occaſion has no ſmall tendency) leſt the ſame effect ſhould reſult from it, which has once been the conſequence of ſuch a conduct in the province of the Maſſachuſetts Bay; perſecution of their fellow chriſtians having been one principal article which occaſioned the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating their former charter.<note n="†" place="bottom">Sum. hiſt. &amp; pol. vol.

            <p>Now not to mention that the Church of England is already eſtabliſhed here, and teſts already ordained and in many caſes required, as they are in England; without any of thoſe frightful conſequences with which he labors to terrify the vulgar; let it only be obſerved that the plain import of this whole paſſage is to perſuade people to unite in excluding thoſe of the Church of England, not only from all poſts of honour and emolument, but even from the common rights and privileges of natural born ſubjects; a ſcheme ſo notoriouſly factious and unjuſt, ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently tending to divide and alienate the minds of his Majeſty's good ſubjects from each other, that all wiſe and good men muſt look upon it with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contempt.</p>
            <p>Dr. Douglaſs tells us in his Summary, that <q>by an ancient law of the Maſſachuſetts province, none were allowed to be freemen but thoſe who were church members, that is (ſays he) of the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or congregational religious mode; and that only freemen were capable of voting in civil aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</q> Upon which he remarks. <q>This was
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009360_0062_1032121EC77E8888"/>too narrow and conſin'd, perhaps more ſevere than ever was practiſed by the Church of England in its moſt bigotted and faulty periods. <note n="†" place="bottom">Sum. hiſt. &amp; pol. p. 432.</note>
               </q> To be ſure a greater infringement upon Engliſh liberty was never attempted; ſuch a law might well therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, as it ſoon was upon the King's letter in 1662.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Tho' the Dr. ſays no acts of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ever took place here, ſo far as he has learnt, p. 94 of Obſerv.</note> And yet this is the very thing which the Dr. in the foregoing paſſages ſeems deſirous of eſtabliſhing, not by a law indeed, the legiſlature are too wiſe and juſt to hearken to inſinuations ſo fatal to liberty, but by raiſing ſuch a violent ſpirit of oppoſition in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as may anſwer the ſame end.

It is not expected he ſhould reconcile them, the author would not put the Dr. himſelf upon ſo impoſſible a taſk as this.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the Church of England prevail in New England he is afraid we ſhould <q>all be taxed for the ſupport of <hi>Biſhops and their underlings.</hi>
               </q> This was certainly too weak an inſinuation for one who writes himſelf D. D. and rather diſcovers the writer's paſſion than his judgment. Even the loweſt of the people, are too much of <hi>phyloſophers and divines,</hi> to be taken in at this time of day, by ſuch mean artifice as this; but it was deſigned to beget a prejudice in the minds of the people againſt epiſcopacy, at which he takes all occaſions to expreſs his diſlike; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his beſt friends muſt wiſh that he had done no
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:009360_0063_103212219464CF58"/>more; but when he ſuffers himſelf to treat that whole venerable order, with an indecency of expreſſion, which would be quite unbecoming if it were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the loweſt of mankind, let the impartial reader judge from what temper it muſt proceed.</p>
            <p>THE Dr. could not be ignorant that epiſcopal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment generally obtained thro' all ages of the chriſtian church; that it takes place at this day in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the chriſtian world; that the proteſtant churches abroad, who are not ſo happy as to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this form of church government, do yet expreſs the higheſt reverence and eſteem of it; it would therefore doubtleſs have been more becoming to have expreſs'd his diſlike in terms of greater modeſty than he has uſually done in this and many other of his writings, of an order ſo generally held in vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Even the admired Calvin and Beza have highly applauded the epiſcopal hierarchy of England, as appears by their letter to Queen Elizabeth, the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, and others. They pray heartily to God for the continuance and preſervation of it, bewail their own unhappineſs in the want of it, and mention it as their unavoidable misfortune to be without it. As to Calvin, altho' he juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to that univerſal ſupremacy claimed by the ſee of Rome, as uſurping the prerogative of Chriſt, he would not believe that any man could oppoſe the epiſcopal hierarchy; but (ſays he, ſpeaking of the Romiſh church) <q>If they would ſhew us ſuch an hierarchy, in which the Biſhops might ſo preſide, as not to refuſe ſubjection to Chriſt, but depend upon him as their only head, and refer themſelves to him, then truly I will confeſs that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be anathematized, if any ſuch men ſhall be, who refuſe to reverence it, and ſubmit to it
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:009360_0064_103212235C9B5188"/>with the utmoſt obedience. <note n="†" place="bottom">Talem ſi nobis hierarchiam exhibeant, in quâ ſic emineant epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi, ut Chriſto ſubeſſe non recuſent, et ab illo tanquam unico capite pendeant, et ad ipſum referantur, tum verò nullo non ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themate dignos fatear, ſi qui erunt qui non eam revereantur, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâque obedientiá obſervent. Calvin de neceſſitate eccleſ. reform.</note>
               </q> To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo does Beza expreſs himſelf. <q>But if any there be (which truly you will ſcarce perſuade me to believe) who reject the whole order of Biſhops; God forbid that any man in his right mind ſhould aſſent to their madneſs. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Si qui ſunt autem (quod ſanè mihi non facilè perſuaſeris) qui om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem epiſcoporum ordinem rejiciant, abſit ut quiſquam ſatis ſanae mentis furoribus illorum aſſentiatur. Beza ad Tractat. de miniſt. ev. Grad. ab Hadrian. Sarav. Belga editam. c. 1.</note>
               </q> And particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that it was never his intention to oppoſe the hierarchy of the Church of England which <q>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bleſſing of God he deſires ſhe may enjoy, and wiſhes it may be perpetual. <note n="§" place="bottom">Fruatur ſanè iſtâ ſingulari Dei beneficentiâ, quae utinam ſit illi perpetua, ibid c. 18.</note>
               </q> If foreigners could ſpeak with ſo much reſpect and reverence of this vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable order; how great a want of decency does it imply in a ſubject of this nation, who owes his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and every privilege he enjoys to the indulgence of that very conſtitution which appoints them, how indecent is it, I ſay, to ſpeak of them in ſuch oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious terms as he has done in theſe obſervations, and in many other of his writings, of which the reader will hereafter find a ſpecimen?</p>
            <p>NOR is it the venerable order of Biſhops only, which this writer has treated with ſuch unbecoming freedom. Every part of the eſtabliſhed eccleſiaſtical conſtitution ſeems to provoke his diſpleaſure; but nothing raiſes his anger more, than that the Society ſhould encourage the uſe of the liturgy in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; his contemptuous ridicule of which, makes the greateſt part of his 14th ſection.</p>

THIS, ſo far as it is an argument has been urged by him, oftentimes before, and implies that he thinks the Society, have no right by their charter to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a public religion in New-England, eſpecially to the neglect of the Indians and the ſouthern <hi>heatheniſh</hi> governments; for if they have a right to ſupport re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in New-England at all, he allows it is natural to expect they ſhould do it in their own way, and according to their own ſentiments.<note n="†" place="bottom">Obſerva. p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> To this it has already been replied, that New-England containing a great many negro ſlaves that are ſtill heathen, a great many freethinkers and other miſbelievers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great number of people from Europe educated in, and ſeriouſly attach'd to the Church of England, is directly in the moſt literal ſenſe, one object of the Society's charity agreeable to their charter. And that they have alſo given their attention to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering heathen, and to thoſe other governments which he eſteems little better than heathen, in ſuch proportion as they (whom he allows to be proper judges in this caſe) have found encouragement to hope for ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>As to the liturgy conſidered in another light, and as the object of his particular averſion, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into any direct vindication of it; it may be no improper rebuke to his licentious freedom upon this ſubject, to remark, that the whole chriſtian church from the beginning has made uſe of liturgies in the public worſhip of God, as appears from the ſeveral forms of this kind which are ſtill extant: And the foreign reformed churches at this day, have not only each of them a public liturgy, but have given ample teſtimony to the excellency of that in

THE author has now gone thro' every thing in the Dr's book which he looks upon to be material, i. e. which relates to the profeſſed deſign, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal argument of it. If any thing has inadvertently eſcaped him, which the Dr. thinks to be of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to his main argument, upon proper notice of it, he will readily wait upon him agin. There are indeed ſundry incidental reflections to be met with, but as they are foreign to the general argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eſpecially as they have been honour'd with ſome proper remarks in a pamphlet lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at Portſmouth in New-Hampſhire, the author does not at preſent think it worth his while to take notice of them.</p>
            <p>To ſum up the argument on both ſides—The Dr's book is entitled <q>Obſervations on the charter and conduct of the Society, &amp;c. deſigned to ſhew their nonconformity to each other.</q> In proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this deſign the Dr. has given us his, or rather Mr. Hobart's ſenſe of the charter; this ſenſe he has endeavoured to ſupport, by adducing the title and ſeal, and ſundry ſermons of the Society in conſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. After which, comparing the conduct of the Society with the deſign of their inſtitution, as he has plann'd it, he ſinds them to be inconſiſtent, or to diſagree with with each other. This is a ſhort (and it is ſuppoſed) a juſt repreſentation of the Dr's management of the preſent argument, which if he had purſued in a modeſt manner, without ſcurrility or abuſe, no body would have blamed him? he would have been intitled to a modeſt and genteel reply. Whether he has obſerved this method, let the unprejudiced reader judge.</p>
            <p>THE preſent reply is intended to ſhew that the conduct of the Society is not inconſiſtent with their charter, nor yet with the title or ſeal, or the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:009360_0068_1032122AFB142D10"/>ſermons preached before them. To prove this the author has endeavoured to ſhew, Firſt, That the Society have always had ſuch means of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, both in reſpect to the true meaning of their charter, and alſo in regard to the ſtate of religion in the plantations, that it is morally certain they could not have been deceived in regard to theſe points. 2dly. The members of which that Society is compoſed, are in general perſons of ſo reſpectable a character, that it is utterly improbable they would act contrary to their inſtitution with deſign; and further that if they were inclined to do ſo, it would have been impoſſible to have ſucceeded in ſo iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous a purpoſe, becauſe their charter obliges them annually to ſubmit their whole tranſactions, to the examination of the Lord chancellor and chief juſtices of the King's bench and common pleas, who are purpoſely appointed by the Crown to ſee that the true intent and meaning of the grant be complied with. 3dly, The author has examined the charter itſelf, and compared the ſame with the actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Society, and finds that they have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the ſeveral objects therein recommended, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their title and ſeal, and to the general purport of their annual ſermons.</p>
            <p>In examining the charter he thinks it appears, that the Dr's interpretation of it cannot be juſt, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it renders it inconſiſtent with itſelf; ſo alſo his explanation of the ſeal and title of the Society militates with his interpretation of the charter, and ſerves to prove his miſtakes as to both. His quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the anniverſary ſermons of the Society, as they relate to one object only of their inſtitution, muſt be look'd upon as a partial repreſentation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they do not at all interfere with what is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:009360_0069_1032122CDF762748"/>to be the ſenſe of the charter, or with their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conduct, and conſequently are nothing at all to the purpoſe for which they were introduced.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the author has made a few caſual ſtrictures upon ſome of the Dr's incidental reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they happened to fall in the way of the principal argument; and he was the rather inclined to do this, becauſe the Dr's quarrel with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſeems really to take its riſe, not ſo much from any thing he ſaw amiſs in their conduct, as from his inveterate hatred, and unreaſonable diſpleaſure towards the church of England, which he ſlatters himſelf could not ſubſiſt long in the country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Society's countenance and ſupport. And yet in this perhaps he is miſtaken, ſince the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God has more ways than one of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting his own cauſe; ſo that if the Society ſhould think fit to withdraw their aſſiſtance (which they will hardly do the ſooner for ſuch obſervations as his) it is not doubted but that God would raiſe up other helps, or ſome way direct to ſufficient means for the preſervation of his church. It was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a wiſer man than perhaps cither of us, to the jewiſh council, when they were conſulting how they ſhould put a ſtop to the preaching of the apoſtles, and the early propagation of the goſpel; <q>Refrain from theſe men, and let them alone: for if this council, or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overthrow it; leſt haply ye be found even to fight againſt God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If the Society, either through miſrepreſentation, or by any other means, have been led into any miſtake in the management of any part of their truſt, no man will think that the Dr's indecent and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:009360_0070_1032122F24BAADF0"/>abuſive treatment of them is the way to incline them to amend it. Had it not been better to have improved upon the hint which he has quoted from biſhop Burnet, and by this means have excited their emulation? or as the biſhop expreſſes it "have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked them to jealouſly"? Mr. Hobart referring to the ſame paſſage mentions ſome great things that have been done in regard to the converſion of the Indians by the Society in Scotland for propagating chriſtian knowledge, (it is ſuppoſed by the care and management of their commiſſioners at Boſton) with a ſmall expence.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hobart's Iſt Addreſs p. 129.</note> Suppoſing the truth of this, (which the author has no inclination to call in queſtion) every good chriſtian will ſincerely rejoice at it, and pray God that they may ſtill meet with more abundant ſucceſs. But then would it not have been infinitely more uſeful, and have diſcovered more of a chriſtian ſpirit, if the Dr. inſtead of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Society for the propagation of the goſpel, had employed himſelf in giving a particular account of that other Society which has been thus remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſucceſsful, e. g. What has been their certain fund, what their caſual benefactions, from whom they receive their money, and how it is expended, what miſſionaries they employ, at what places they are fixt, and what are their reſpective ſalaries, and laſtly, what accounts have been received from them as to the fruit of their labours: Had he done this, in ſome ſuch plain open and honeſt method as the Society for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the goſpel have done, it might poſſibly not only have provoked them to emulation, but have opened to them ſome new or more effectual methods for rendring their pious deſigns ſucceſsful. Certain it is, that no Society, whether incorporated or merely
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:009360_0071_103212310E9B4DB8"/>voluntary, whoſe ſingle aim and intention it is to promote the glory of God, in enlarging the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Redeemer, have any reaſon to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of publiſhing their tranſactions to the world: On the contrary it ſeems to be a duty to do ſo, not only to prevent ſuſpicion of ill and improper deſigns, but alſo that their <hi>light ſhining</hi> out with a clear unſullied brightneſs <hi>before men,</hi> others may be induced either to join with them and ſtrengthen their hands, or be led to ſet on foot ſome other pious and charitable work of a ſimilar kind to the further advancement of God's glory.</p>
            <p>As to Indian converſions the author's opinion is, that the Rev. and worthy Mr. Wheelock's judicious ſcheme of educating ſuch of the younger Natives, as may be obtained, among the Engliſh at a diſtance from their own homes, and then ſending them back to their friends and countrymen, whether as miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries or otherwiſe; if it may be done in any conſiderable numbers, would have the beſt influence in civilizing the ſavage temper of thoſe people, and preparing them for the reception of the goſpel; This good deſign therefore, as it deſerves all encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, ſo it is pity but it ſhould be univerſally known. Mr. Wheelock has indeed publiſhed an open and undiſguiſed, as well as a modeſt account of his plan, and of the progreſs he has hitherto made in it, but ſince it has not yet circulated ſo far as it might be wiſhed, this little intimation is deſigned to promote its being more generally known.<note n="*" place="bottom">The pamphlet referr'd to is intitled, A plain and faithful narrative of the original deſign, riſe, progreſs and preſent ſlate of the Indian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſchool at Lebanon in Connecticut.

            <p>But to return from this ſhort digreſſion.—If the Dr. ſhould complain, or rather (ſince he has no
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:009360_0072_10321232A38D8060"/>right to complain) if his friends ſhould complain in his behalf, that in the foregoing remarks, the author has ſometimes uſed too great a ſeverity of expreſſion, let them conſider the provocation; let them reflect on the indecent language, and various abuſe, that the Dr. has poured out, not on ſingle perſons only, but upon public bodies, upon the moſt reſpectable characters, upon the eſtabliſhed religion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon thoſe who come over to, or embrace it in N. England in general as men void of all piety and geodneſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſ p 98.</note> upon the moſt ſacred doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of our holy religion—let them I ſay reflect upon theſe things, and then ſay whether there was not an occaſion for ſome kind of rebuke. The author is very far from being fond of harſh and ſevere epithets, he had infinitely rather examine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of controverſy with that <hi>meekneſs and fear</hi> which is preſeribed by the apoſtle; but even the meek and gentle ſpirit of the goſpel not only allows, but alſo requires in regard to ſuch licentious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as the Dr. has thought proper to uſe, that they ſhould be <hi>rebuked ſharply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any one ſhall ſtill think that the Dr's foible is repreſented in too ſtrong a light, that he has not been guilty of all that indecent abuſe in his writings with which he ſeems here to have been charged; let ſuch perſon examine the following ſpecimen taken from his own writings, moſt of them ſolemoly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the pulpit. It is hoped that it will ſerve to ſatisfy the moſt incredulous, and beſides it may ſerve <hi>to ſhew the Dr. to himſelf,</hi> and let him ſee how far he is departed, I will not ſay from the dignity of the ſacred office only, but from the ſpirit of the goſpel.</p>

            <p>THIS little contraſt is left to ſpeak for it ſelf; but as to the forgoing ſpecimen the author preſumes the Dr's. beſt friends, muſt ſeriouſly wiſh that he had expreſſed himſelf, not only with more decency and reſpect, but more agreeable to the temper of the goſpel: Others perhaps who have leſs tenderneſs for him, will alſo have leſs charity, and be liable to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he deceives himſelf, when he profeſſes a regard for that divine religion which diſclaims all evil ſpeaking, railing and reviling, and whoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal characteriſtic is love or benevolence, a principle which they may think he notoriouſly violates— Be that as it may, the author is of opinion that the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:009360_0080_10321242688805B8"/>Dr. has no room to complain of harſh or ſevere treatment, no not altho' it ſhould be more diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than any he has yet met with; unleſs he will be pleaſed for the future at leaſt to treat mankind with more reſpect than he has uſually done, not only in his book of obſervations but even in many of his ſermons.</p>
            <p>THE author cannot perſuade himſelf to conclude theſe reflections without expreſſing his aſtoniſhment, that any gentlemen, tho' of congregational princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and much more that the reverend gentlemen who are the ſpiritual guides of that denomination, overlooking the Dr's attempts to undermine the fundamental principles of their faith, ſhould expreſs their approbation of this his performance, which in the conduct of it diſcovers ſo little of the meekneſs and gentleneſs of the goſpel. Can you, gentlemen, be ſo far blinded by prejudice or a party ſpirit, as tamely to give up thoſe eſſential doctrines for which you have hitherto laudably contended, and which once you eſteemed your glory? Can you, I ſay, cheriſh and flatter the man, who has been labouring from pulpit and preſs to demoliſh the doctrines which your fore-fathers have handed down to you?

Will not ſtrangers, will not every one who ſhall read the errors which this gentleman has publiſhed, naturally conclude, that you, gentlemen, do abet and approve them, who have thus given your ſanction to this his laſt, but not leaſt injurious performance?—I ſpeak it with grief and concern, are you ſo carried away with a party ſpirit as to countenance ſuch abuſe and miſrepreſentation of the church of England, while you have not the courage to riſe up in defence of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the truth of his goſpel?—Remember who has ſaid, <q>he that is aſhamed of me and of my words, &amp;c. of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</q>

BUT to return from this digreſſion, if it may be called one.—Beſides the errors in doctrine hinted at in the foregoing remarks, the Dr's reflection upon the Song of Solomon is ſufficient to ſhow how eaſy it is for him to diſcard even the ſacred canon of ſcripture itſelf: Or perhaps it was introduced mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſake of the witticiſm. It would diſcover however both more wiſdom and ſeriouſneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his drollery for ſome leſs important ſubject. But no witticiſm, nor any thing elſe, will juſtify the pernicious tendency of the doctrine of annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to which he has given too much countenance in the following paſſage. Speaking of ſuch as die in their ſins; <q>The utmoſt they can hope for (ſays he) is to be annihilated after ſuffering unutterable torments: Tho' I do not aſſert, that they can, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcripture account, hope for ſo great a favor as even this would be, viz. to be utterly blotted out of being! However it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed that ſome expreſſions of ſcripture ſeem, at firſt view, to countenance this ſuppoſition. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ser. Vol. 1. p. 475.476. note.</note>
               </q> This will too greedily be catched at by thoſe who have lived in ſuch a manner, as to have no better hope in their death. It might not be amiſs for the Dr. to take a review of his works, and expunge this and many other paſſages which certainly have a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aſpect upon the religion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>BUT beſide the ill conſequences to religion, and eſpecially among the riſing generation, which may not improbably follow from the principles he is labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to propagate: If the government enjoy any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges by virtue of their charter, which they are fond of retaining; one may be confident that the ſpirit and temper of the Dr's writings, ſo far as it can be
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:009360_0083_10321248EDF7EDD8"/>ſuppoſed they are publickly countenanced, will be attended with no favourable impreſſions, where it is the intereſt of the province to ſtand in a favourable light. It were to be wiſh'd that this were more thought of by ſome well diſpos'd people, who do not appear to be aware of the conſequences, which ſuch improper liberties may produce in regard to the civil intereſts and privileges of that province.</p>
            <p>As the author firmly believes that this is not the general temper of people in the colonies, ſo it is hoped it will be received <hi>at home</hi> as the effect of this Gentleman's particular diſpoſition only, and that of two or three of his abettors.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the author apprehends he has now <hi>ſhewn</hi> the Dr. <hi>to himſelf</hi> (to uſe his own phraſe) and he hopes has alſo ſhewn him to other people.

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE great difficulty I labour under in writing, muſt be my apology for writing very briefly, and attending only to the moſt material things.</p>
            <p>It is too evident from the general current of Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s performance, That, it is his aim to beget a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and an odium in his readers, againſt his antageniſt, and againſt the church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Society, from conſiderations and reflections, either meerly perſonal, or lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous, and often trifling, and few of them, relating to the real merits of the cauſe; which is a practice quite unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a <hi>juſt</hi> writer, either in the critical, or moral ſenſe of that character.</p>
            <p>There is one grand impoſition upon his readers, which runs through the whole, and is, as it were, the burthen of his ſong, in which, there is not the leaſt truth, and for which, there never was the leaſt ground, or foundation, as ever I could learn, viz. That the chief view and endeavour of the Society has been to convert presbyterians and congregationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts to the church, to the neglect of Negroes and Indians, and the <hi>heatheniſh</hi> colonies, as he calls them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:009360_0085_1032124D0C80FD20"/>
If they, or their miſſionaries had done this, they would have had infinitely more reaſon, and right in what they did, than the diſſenters from the beginning had, in uſing all poſſible endeavours, to promote factions, and diſaffect people, to the eſtabliſhed church of <hi>England,</hi> in all quarters, and make all the proſelytes they could, from her commanion, to their confuſed parties and ſects, iſſuing in downright rebellion: So that this, is alledged with a very ill grace, by one, derived from, and who is a violent abettor of that party.</p>
            <p>It is true, every good churchman muſt rejoice, when any of our wandering brethren, who have been drawn away, from the boſom and communion of the church, or educated in prejudice againſt it, are reclaimed, and return to the unity of the church, and be glad to be inſtrumental, as God in his providence gives them opportunity, in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling any of them: But, as the Society was not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for that purpoſe, nor was it ever their principal aim. I believe very few inſtances, if any, can be produced, of any miſſionaries beginning with any diſſenter, with a view at reclaiming him to the church. I have been long know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the affairs of the Society, and know of no ſuch inſtances.</p>
            <p>We have indeed been treated bith great obloquy by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentors repreſenting us, as little better than roman catholics, &amp;c. On theſe occaſions we have defended ourſelves, as well as we could: and can any body blame us for it? And can any reaſonable perſon wonder if this ſhould ſometimes prove the occaſion of the converſion of ſome ſenſible honeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Or if the meer curioſity of others attending occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally on our beautiful and inſtructive ſervice, ſhould be the means of their being reconciled, when they ſee, that it does not conſiſt of extempore human invention, but is a wiſe and judicious collection from the holy ſcriptures? ſo that, their very love to the ſcriptures, has ſometimes led them to love the ſervice of the church.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, That Dr. <hi>Bray,</hi> the father of the Society, reported, that in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut,</hi> there was no occaſion for the Society to do any thing, as they were provided for, in the diſſenting way:—I anſwer, I knew Dr. <hi>Bray</hi> very well, he was doubtleſs a very good man, and I
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:009360_0086_1032124E91112BD0"/>agree to his report at that time, and ſhould have made the ſame report myſelf: There was then (except at <hi>Boſton,</hi>) but here and there a member of the church of <hi>England,</hi> ſcatrered about in theſe provinces; and according to the conſtitution of the Society, while there was no congregation of the church in thoſe parts, the Society had no occaſion to ſend any miſſionaries thither: But does it at all follow, that when there came to be ſuch numbers of conſcientious members of the church of <hi>England,</hi> as to make competent congregations for worſhip, being not well able to provide for a miniſter themſelves, that the Society had by their charter, no right and buſineſs, to aſſiſt in providing for them, meerly becauſe the diſſenters in thoſe provinces were already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for? Can any reaſon be given, why a conſcientious body of church people in theſe provinces, ſhould not be provided for, as well as in any other province?—You will ſay, let them go to meeting, I anſwer, many of them were ſo candid, as to go to the meetings, rather than no where, tho' it was very tedious and diſagreeable to them, till they grew in numbers, ſo as to make competent congregations.</p>
            <p>Yea, but it is repreſented, That the origin of the church, in theſe provinces, has been generally owing to faction, diſcontent with miniſters, and about rates, pews, and the like, and tho' the church is the eſtabliſhed religion of our mother country, and in the act of union, is, (as Dr. <hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs,</hi> his favourite author allows) eſtabliſhed in all the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; he is pleas'd in his great good manners, to ſpeak of her in theſe governments, under no better terms, than thoſe of party and faction.</p>
            <p>How much truth there may be in Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the origin of the church, at <hi>Newbury</hi> and <hi>Brain-tree,</hi> I am not able to ſay, and that ſome individuals have had little better motives in conforming, than thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I will not deny, and perhaps ſome of the miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries have not always acted prudently, and poſſibly ſome may have been in a few inſtances too forward; ſuch things are common to frail human nature; however, this I know, that the general rule and practice where I am acquainted, have been, to ſend male-contents, and perſons liable to cenſure, back, to make peace at home, before they came
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:009360_0087_103212509298AA78"/>over to us. But, ſuppoſe ſome things a little wrong, is it fit, that ſo reſpectable a body, as the Society or the church, ſhould be reproached, with the forwardneſs, or miſconduct, of a few individuals?</p>
            <p>Let me, however, give what I know to be generally a true account, of the origin of the church in theſe provinces.</p>
            <p>The true cauſes, and occaſions, of the being and growth of ſo many congregations of the church of <hi>England,</hi> in theſe provinces, are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. As the country continued to increaſe, and there were many acceſſions from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> there were among others, many of the eſtabliſhed church, who came over to ſettle in theſe colonies, as well as others, ſo that there was 50 years ago, ſcarce a town of conſiderable ſtanding, but what had ſome ſcattering among them, and in ſome there were ſeveral families: In <hi>Straiford,</hi> for inſtance, the firſt in <hi>Connecticut</hi> that applied to the Society; there were at the beginning of this century about fifteen families, and five or ſix more in the neareſt towns, that joined with them; and in 1722, when the firſt miſſion was eſtabliſhed, there were about thirty or forty; now, on ſuppoſition that the firſt who ſettled in theſe provinces were diſſenters generally, yet I know no reaſon why theſe lands ſhould be thought ſo ſacred to them, as to exclude the church, nor, why church people ſhould not be at liberty, to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in theſe colonies, as well as in any others? And if they do, who can deny, that they have as good a right to enjoy their way of worſhip as their neighbours? And if they need, and obtain any charitable aſſiſtance, can any thing but envy and malevolence, make ſuch a clamour againſt it? But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. So the caſe has been, ever ſince church people ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in theſe countries, many diſſenters have treated them with much clamour and contempt, and frequent diſputings have ariſen, which occaſioned many to procure books, wherewith to defend themſelves, ſuch as arch biſhop <hi>King</hi>'s inventions of men in the worſhip of God, the <hi>London</hi> caſes, <hi>Hoadley</hi> againſt <hi>Calamy,</hi> arch biſhop <hi>Potter</hi> on church government, and ſome <hi>Hooker</hi>'s eccleſiaſtical polity, and ſuch like. And their thus defending themſelves, occaſioned
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:009360_0088_10321252C6D21800"/>many inquiſitive candid diſſenters to read thoſe books, which reconciled them to the church; ſo that the diſſenters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by thus cenſuring, and diſputing, have occaſioned the increaſe of the church, and I hope it may be truly ſaid, in a judgment of charity, many both of the original church people, and of the proſelyted diſſenters have been ſincerely conſcientious.—Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> indeed, and ſome other diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, however differing in ſome things, as much, (if not more) among themſelves, as either of them from the church, ſeem ſo bigotted to their diſſenting principles, in one ſhape or other, and ſo full of themſelves, that they ſcarce know how to imagine, that church people, or any who differ from them, can be conſcientious; but ſurely, any candid and indifferent perſons, that know any thing of ſuch great and good men, as <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> muſt allow, that it is poſſible, for a church man, upon the foot of <hi>Hooker's</hi> eccleſiaſtical polity, and <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> demonſtration of epiſcopacy, (to ſay nothing of arch biſhop <hi>Potter</hi> and arch biſhop <hi>Sharp,</hi> and the many others) to be at leaſt as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious, as any diſſenters in their way upon the foot of any of their various principles.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Another thing and what has of late chiefly occaſioned the acceſſion of multitudes to the church, was, the wild en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm that long obtained among themſelves, on which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, their own managements were in many inſtances, ſo extravagant and ridiculous, as tended vaſtly more, to drive their people into the church, than any thing we ever did to draw them over to it.— Particularly, that monſtrous enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm that was at firſt mightily encouraged by themſelves fifteen or twenty years ago, in conſequence of Mr. <hi>White-field's</hi> rambling over the country, once and again, who was followed by a great many ſtrolling teachers, who propagated ſo many wild and horrid notions of God and the goſpel, that a multitude of people, were ſo bewilder'd that they could find no reſt to the ſole of their foot, till they took refuge in the church, as their only ark of ſafety. And many of theſe wild notions (to ſay nothing now of the oppoſite extreams of arianiſm, ſocinianiſm, and independent-whiggiſm) continue among great numbers to this day, and have occaſioned much hot contention among them in ſettling miniſters, and often
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:009360_0089_103212544A32CF30"/>the proſtitution of diſcipline upon the meaneſt trifles, which have occaſioned many people to conclude, that if they muſt ſeparate from their former brethren, who are in endleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and confuſion, their beſt way muſt be to retire into the church, which is in peace.—Now, theſe are all known facts: Is not Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> then very diſingenuous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them, and aſcribe the being and increaſe of the church, only to petts and quarrels about pews, rates, and ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling things, and to a meer ſpirit of faction?</p>
            <p>But, it is pretended, great miſcheifs have befallen the country by means of the church, (of which however, he gives no proof); to this I anſwer, certain it is, that great advantages have derived from it, even to the diſſenters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: it has occaſioned a great increaſe of knowledge, by their reading many of our excellent writers, from whom they have gained their beſt notion's, and much greater correctneſs, than they had, both in writing and ſpeaking; it has provoked them to emulation, and it is certain, that many of them have much better notions of God and the goſpel now, than they had before, and have much improved in the knowledge of the ſcriptures and the evidences of chriſtitanity.—Certain it is, that they are now, much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what they were, fifty years ago, and as certain that they are greatly beholden to the church, for every thing of this kind, wherein they excel themſelves.</p>
            <p>And beſides this, in proportion as they have become more acquainted with the church, they have much dropp'd their great prejudices againſt us, and malevolence, and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs towards us, and charity, and good neighbourhood have greatly obtained between us; ſo that, if it was not for now and then, ſuch abuſive and uncharitable ſcribblings of a few zealots, full of very injurious miſrepreſentations, we ſhould ſoon coaleſce, and come into a friendly, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent and chriſtian temper, of mutual forbearance towards one another, and be united in our common weal—I might add, that in truth the church has been ſo far from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the various contentions in which they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually engaged among themſelves, owing to the weakneſs of their conſtitution, and their republican ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and levelling principles, that, to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:009360_0090_10321256A7E8ACC0"/>it hath in many inſtances been a great check upon them, and much rather tended to heal and quiet, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate them—And as to immoralities, I am ſure, the church hath born as faithful a teſtimony againſt them, in every kind, as any of the diſſenters have done; ſo that, if immoralities have increaſed, it is not owing to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the church, but to the increaſe of mankind here, in proportion to which, from the nature of man, immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will abound; I believe however, it may be ſaid with truth, that in proportion to her numbers, the church can ſhew, at leaſt as many ſober, conſcientious chriſtians, as the meetings: I know it to be ſo, in many places where I am acquainted.</p>
            <p>Now, whether it was to give a ſpecimen of the Dr's ſine talent at ridicule and declamation, or, from a ſtudied deſign to fright his readers, with an hideous ſpectre, that he might create in them all the odium and antipathy he could againſt the church of <hi>England,</hi> or, whether it was a little fit of the old diſtraction, or, whether after all, the true and principal cauſe of his bitterneſs againſt that found branch of the chriſtian church may not ſtill be art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully concealed, I will not take upon me to ſay; but in page 155 you have a moſt hideous outcry, about perſecution, hierarchy, tyranny and the like terrible monſters, that made ſad work, it ſeems, an hundred, or an hundred and fifty years ago, from which, however he allows at laſt, we have now nothing to fear ſince the revolution, from our preſent mild princes, and moderate prelates.—Pray, good ſir, what then was the matter with you, when you made this tragical out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry? Did you deſign to ſet a mob upon us? or what?</p>
            <p>You know very well, that the conſtitution of the church is juſt the ſame now as it was then, and yet ſhe abhors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and tyranny now, (at leaſt) as much as you do: Why ſhould ſhe then be charged with the doings of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous courts, or ſome perſecuting individuals, ſo long ago? or how can ſhe be anſwerable for thoſe things, which for almoſt theſe hundred years have had no exiſtence, nor are ever like to exiſt again? or, what ſenſe or honeſty can there be, in raiſing theſe old ſpectres, long ſince vaniſhed and gone, never to revive, meerly to blacken the church,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:009360_0091_103212582A590C98"/>and render her odious to the preſent age while in truth the church is no more concerned in them, than your party, who you muſt needs know, have perſeacuted and tyranniz'd in their turn, as much, at leaſt, as ever the government who then profeſſed the church did: You know that perſecution and toleration are merely political things, in which the church, as ſuch, (being a ſpiritual ſociety, a kingdom not of this world,) is in no wife concern'd: The church is the ſame; it is the policy of the ſtate only, that hath altered, and I readily agree with you, that in putting an end to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, it hath altered much for the better.</p>
            <p>But the good Dr. is ſtill terribly diſtreſſed, about the hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, leaſt that ſhould obtain here, aſcending (as he ſays, in his fine florid way, a-la-mode de independent whig.) <hi>aſcending by various gradations from the dirt to the ſkies!</hi> But pray Dr, be ſober a little—We have no pope! There are with us but three orders, biſhops, presbyters and deacons, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the model of the pure primitive church, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leaſt ſtep was made towards popery. And we know that we have ſtronger evidence from the <hi>facts</hi> both of <hi>ſcripture</hi> and <hi>antiquity,</hi> for the moſt wiſe, apoſtolical, and conſequently divine eſtabliſhment of theſe three orders, than you have for infant baptiſm, and the firſt day ſabbath, of which you are with us ſo juſtly tenacious.—Your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning upon theſe points, and ours for epiſcopacy, from the original facts, is exactly the ſame, only we have vaſtly the advantage of you.—If our reaſoning for epiſcopacy muſt fall, your's on thoſe points muſt much more fall with it; as might be abundantly and inconteſtably ſhewn, if it was now before us.—And we do averr, we are certainly as conſcientious in our attachment to our epiſcopal form of church government, as you can be to your presbyterial, or whatever you call it.—In God's name, then, what reaſon can be given, why we ſhould not be allowed to enjoy our way, as well as you, your's? We do not envy you, why ſhould you envy and malign us?—</p>
            <p>Pray tell me ſir, why we ſhould not be allowed in this country, to be as perfect in our kind, as you, in your's? We do not want in the leaſt to moleſt or oppoſe you, in your way, why then ſhould you ſo vehemently oppoſe
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:009360_0092_1032125A98B7CA10"/>our being provided for in our's? You would think it a terrible thing indeed, (doubtleſs a degree of perſecution,) to be obliged to go a thouſand leagues for ordination, if it was your caſe: can you then have no feeling for us whoſe unhappy caſe it is? In truth ſir, we do not aim at any thing but to live with you in quiet and charitable neighbourhood: We have not the leaſt deſire of an epiſcopate that ſhould have any thing to do with you, or at all interfere with any of your proceedings, or, make any alterations among you, in church or ſtate: We only want biſhops, to ordain, and govern <hi>our own</hi> clergy, to viſit <hi>our</hi> churches, and to inſtruct and confirm <hi>our</hi> laity: And I deſire to know, what harm, ſuch an epiſcopate could do you? Nay; we do not inſiſt upon a biſhop's reſiding in either of your favourite govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Let him live in one of your heatheniſh provinces: We ſhould be content to wait upon him for orders, two or three hundred miles diſtant from you, rather than fail; Why then ſhould you have ſuch terrible apprehenſions?</p>
            <p>But the Dr. is moreover in a diſmal pannic, leſt the church's obtaining in this country, ſhould be of ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to it's political affairs.—But why ſhould he? Pray ſir be calm—Is not this our country, and the native country of moſt of us, as well as your's? Can it then be, that it ſhould not be as dear to us, as it is to you? Have we not all one common intereſt, as to our country's weal, being embark'd in the ſame bottom? It is not poſſible for us, each one judging for himſelf, to abound in his own ſenſe, as to matters of religion, and yet live in love, and be unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart and hand, in promoting the publick weal, and our common intereſts, wherein we are all agreed, and equally concern'd? I can ſee no manner of reaſon to the contrary, or any more danger, leſt we ſhould differ about theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs, than if we were all of the ſame ſentiments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: and have we not been as forward in our country's cauſe in the late trying times as any of you? Diſputes will ſometimes ariſe; But I cannot ſee, why they ſhould more in one caſe, than in the other? You need not be in the leaſt apprehenſive of the churches being any other wiſe eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than it is already, or that any teſts will obtain in ſuch a
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:009360_0093_1032125C8A6FD830"/>country as this.—Pray ſir be eaſy. We mean you no harm— If you would be only as charitable and peaceable toward us, and among yourſelves, as we are heartily diſpoſed to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, we might live very quietly and happily together, and there would be no occaſion for another <hi>Columbus,</hi> (as you cry out) to explore any other <hi>country</hi> for you. We are neither French, nor Indians, nor Serpents, nor <hi>Dragons:</hi> Why ſo dreadfully afraid of being <hi>conſumed by the flames,</hi> or deluged <hi>in a flood of epiſcopacy?</hi> I realy pity you, that you ſhould ſuffer your terrors and paſſions ſo miſerably to run away with you! I tell you again, dear ſir, we mean you no harm; we would only provide for our ſelves—Pray do not be ſo terribly frighted!—But O my country, dear <hi>New-England,</hi> ſuffer me to aſſure you, that you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more reaſon to be afraid of ſuch as are no friends to a co-eſſential trinity, and the divinity and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, (beſides other misbeliever's, and unbelievers, of which there are many.) than of thoſe who without cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or aiming to interfere with diſſenters, are only deſirous for themſelves to enjoy the church of <hi>England,</hi> in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity!—</p>
            <p>But the Dr. inſiſts that <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> come not within the Society's limits by the charter: I anſwer, this cannot be maintained, ſince they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the charter, unleſs it can be proved that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of the church for which the Society provides in thoſe colonies, would not in the ſenſe &amp; words of the charter, <hi>want,</hi> or be deſtitute of <hi>the adminiſtration of God's word and ſacraments,</hi> if the Society did not aſſiſt them: But this he does not, nor can he prove. Surely he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that King <hi>William,</hi> who introduced the toleration of diſſenters, would leave his loving ſubjects of the church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerated, and under the neceſſity of receiving God's word and ſacraments contrary to their conſciences, or of having none.—It muſt therefore be his meaning to provide, that his loving ſubjects of the church might enjoy God's word and ſacraments in theſe colonies, when ſuch there are in competent numbers, for congregations, as well as in other
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:009360_0094_1032125EAAB05458"/>colonies; and ſo the Society (who muſt be ſuppoſed to be at leaſt as good judges of the meaning of their charter, as Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>) have ever underſtood it, and when opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered, have practiſed accordingly, not for the purpoſe of converting diſſenters to the church, but of providing for conſcientious people of the church, and who without this proviſion would have been in danger of as great errors and abſurdities, as thoſe of popery,,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Beach</hi>'s Friendly Expoſtulation, juſt publiſh'd, page 30, 31, &amp;c.</note> and not without danger even of infidelity itſelf, into which I fear many of the diſſenters have been tempted by the abſurd notions of chriſtianity which have been diſſeminated amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>laſtly,</hi> the great objection is, that the Society neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the ſouthern colonies, Negroes and Indians.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, As to the ſouthern colonies, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Dr. muſt know, that in <hi>Virginia. Maryland</hi> and <hi>South Carolina,</hi> the church is well provided for by law, ſo that they are out of the queſtion—In <hi>South-Carolina</hi> they are withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their miſſions, as they become vacant.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>Georgia,</hi> and the <hi>Babama</hi> Iſlands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is made and making for them as faſt as may be, and as their occaſion and application call for. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to <hi>North Carolina</hi> (over which he drops a pious tear) as far as I can find, ever ſince their application to the Society, they have been providing for them as often as they have been applied to, and as faſt as they could find gentlemen to undertake miſſions, in thoſe tedious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy climates; and it appears from the abſtract of 1761, that a great progreſs there is made, and making, and the Society is very much engaged to provide for them, ſo that I imagine thoſe muſt have been diſſenters for whom he is ſo compaſſionate. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to <hi>Penſylvania. New-Jerſies</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> I believe no inſtance can be produced, where appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:009360_0095_1032126098D40888"/>has been made to the Society, that has ever been neglected. Indeed, I am ſorry to ſay, there are ſome few places, where no proviſion is made for religion, of any ſort, that have contracted ſuch an indifference to any at all, (two of which I myſelf have often urged and engaged my endeavours for them) that they could never be prevail'd upon to embody themſelves, to build a church, or take any ſtep towards applying to the Society for their aſſiſtance, who would undoubtedly do for them, even to the neglect of <hi>New-England.</hi> Now to ſuch I could wiſh the Society to ſend miſſionaries without being applied to, as they would to <hi>ab origine</hi> heathen, and I truſt they will do ſo, before long, if thoſe people do not apply.</p>
            <p>And now, as to <hi>Negroes,</hi> what could the Society do more than it does, and not without ſome conſiderable ſucceſs, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Abſtracts—Their miſſionaries every where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct as many as their maſters will ſend, and do inſtruct and baptize many, and have ſome communicants—They have ſeveral catechiſts, and Dr. <hi>Bray</hi>'s aſſociates, ſeveral ſchools (beſides that at <hi>Barbadoes</hi>) who conſtantly inſtruct their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with good ſucceſs; and they have ſent one worthy miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary to <hi>Cape Coaſt Caſtle,</hi> who laboured there, 'till his health and conſtitution were very near ruined.—And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to the Indians—Many miſſionaries have to my knowledge endeavoured to convert them, as they have had opportunity; and one in particular placed near a conſiderable clan of them, endeavoured to reconcile them to chriſtianity, 'till ſome diſſenters ſo prejudiced them againſt him, that he could do them no Good—And it is well known, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, (always ready to take every opportunity) has ſent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral miſſionaries to the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> one after another, from the beginning, and that the Rev. and worthy Dr. <hi>Barclay</hi> was very laborious, with good ſucceſs for ten years, inſtructed and baptized many, and had a conſiderable number of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. It is true, he laboured at firſt under ſome difficulty, for want of an interpreter; but it was not long before he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſo good ſkill in their language, as to preach and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſervice to their perfect underſtanding, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:009360_0096_10321262D658DB10"/>on with very good ſucceſs, till the laſt war, about 1745. threw them into ſuch confuſion, and the influence of popiſh miſſionaries, and the wicked inſinuations of a certain great man in thoſe parts, created ſuch a diſaffection in them, that his very life was in much danger; ſo that he was obliged to deſiſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">So partially and injuriouſly, not to ſay falſly, does Mr. Smith in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hiſtory of <hi>New York</hi> repreſent this affair.</note>—However, the Society has ſtill a number there not to be deſpiſed, and much more will ſoon be done; one thing they intend in order to it, is, to maintain a number of lads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at <hi>King's College</hi> in <hi>New-York,</hi> to be qualified for miſſionaries among them.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, It may be truly ſaid, what could the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety do more, that it has not done, and all intirely agreeable to the true intention and meaning of their charter. I cannot therefore, imagine but that the candid and ſerious, even among the diſſenters themſelves, muſt be ſenſible that Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> has moſt unjuſtly charged the Society, and that his own friends can ſcarcely be able to withold a bluſh for him, at his indecent, as well as injurious treatment of that venerable body, and of the church, which is a part of the national conſtitution; and alſo, at his mean and unworthy perſonal invectives againſt the modeſt and very deſerving gentleman, who has been the innocent occaſion of provoking his riotous pen.—But I muſt have done.—I would only add, that the worthy Dr. <hi>Wiggleſworth's</hi> letter in the 165th page of Dr. <hi>Mayhew's</hi> book, much deſerves the attention of the government both here and in England.—</p>
