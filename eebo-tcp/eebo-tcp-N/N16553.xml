            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THOUGHTS ON THE MANNERS OF THE GREAT.</head>
            <p>TO a large and honourable claſs of the community, to perſons conſiderable in reputation, important by their condition in life, and commendable for the decency of their general conduct, theſe ſlight hints are reſpectfully addreſſed. They are not intended as a ſatire upon vice, or a ridicule upon folly, being written neither for the fooliſh nor the vicious. The ſubject is too ſerious for ridicule; and thoſe to whom it is addreſſed are too reſpectable for ſatire. It is recommended to the conſideration of thoſe who, filling the higher ranks in life, are naturally regarded as patterns, by which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021271_0003_0FB2B3DB1B5B43F0"/>
the manners of the reſt of the world are to be faſhioned.</p>
            <p>The maſs of mankind, in moſt places, and in moſt conditions of life, is perhaps chiefly compoſed of what may be termed <hi>good kind of people;</hi> for perſons of very flagitious wickedneſs are almoſt as rare as thoſe of very eminent piety: to the latter of theſe, admonition were impertinent; to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it were ſuperfluous. Theſe remarks, therefore, are principally written with a view to thoſe perſons of rank and fortune who live within the reſtraints of moral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and acknowledge the truth of the Chriſtian religion: and who, if in certain inſtances they allow themſelves in practices not compatible with a ſtrict profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſeem to do it rather from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and want of reflection, than either from diſbelief of its doctrines, or contempt of its precepts.</p>
            <p>Inconſideration, Faſhion, and the World,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021271_0004_0FB2B3DC92903280"/>
are three confederates againſt Virtue, with whom even good kind of people often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to live on excellent terms; and the fair reputation which may be obtained by a complaiſant conformity to the prevailing practice, and by mere decorum of manners, without a ſtrict attention to religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, is a conſtant ſource of danger to the rich and great. There is ſomething almoſt irreſiſtibly ſeducing in the contagion of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral example: hence the neceſſity of that vigilance, which it is the buſineſs of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity to quicken by inceſſant admonition, and of the world, to lay aſleep by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual opiates of eaſe and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>A fair reputation is one of the moſt lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable objects of human ambition; yet even this really valuable bleſſing is ſometimes converted into a ſnare, by inducing a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous ſecurity as ſoon as it is obtained. A fatal indolence is apt to creep in upon the ſoul when it has once acquired the good
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021271_0005_0FB2B3DE03C5F140"/>
opinion of mankind, if the acquiſition of that good opinion was the ultimate end of its endeavours. Purſuit is at an end when the object is in poſſeſſion; for he is not likely to "preſs forward" who thinks he has already "attained."—The love of worldly reputation, and the deſire of God's favour, have this ſpecific difference, that in the latter, the poſſeſſion always augments the deſire; and the ſpiritual mind accounts nothing done while any thing remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
            <p>But after all, a fair fame, and the ſupport of numbers, is obviouſly a deceitful depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for as every individual muſt die for himſelf, and anſwer for himſelf, both theſe imaginary reſources will fail, juſt at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they could have been of any uſe. A good reputation, even without internal pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, would be worth obtaining, if the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of heaven were faſhioned after the manner of human courts of judicature. If at the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021271_0006_0FB2B3E4CCDA7B48"/>
general judgment we were to be tried by a jury of our fellow mortals, it would be but common prudence to ſecure their favour at any price. But it can ſtand us in little ſtead in the great day of deciſion, as it is the conſummation of infinite goodneſs, not to abandon us to the mercy of each other's ſentence; but to reſerve us for <hi>his</hi> final judgment who knows every motive of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action; who will make ſtrict inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into ſincerity of heart, and uprightneſs of intention; in whoſe eyes an ineffectual prayer, or a powerleſs wiſh, will outweigh the moſt ſplendid profeſſion, or the moſt dazzling action.</p>
            <p>We cannot but rejoice in every degree of human virtue which operates favourably on ſociety, whatever be the motive, or whoever be the actor; and we ſhould glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend every degree of goodneſs, tho' it be not ſquared by our own rules and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Even the good actions of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021271_0007_0FB2B3E6463FB370"/>
as are too much actuated by a regard to appearances, are not without their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial effects. The righteouſneſs of thoſe who occupy this middle region of morality certainly exceeds the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees; for they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exact in ceremonials, but in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects fulfil the weightier matters of law and conſcience. Like Herod, they often "hear gladly, and do many things."—Yet I am afraid I ſhall be thought ſevere in remarking that, in general, thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in the New Teſtament, of whoſe future condition no very comfortable hope is given, ſeem to have been taken, not from the profligate, the abandoned, and the diſhonourable; but from that decent claſs commonly deſcribed by the term of <hi>good ſort of people;</hi> that mixed kind of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in which virtue appears, if it does not predominate. The young Ruler was certainly one of the firſt of this order; and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021271_0008_0FB2B3E7C49C5410"/>
yet we are left in dark uncertainly, as to his final allotment. The rich man who built him barns and ſtorehouſes, and only propoſed to himſelf the full enjoyment of that fortune, which, perhaps, he had very fairly obtained, might have been, for all that appears to the contrary, a very good ſort of man: at leaſt, if we may judge of him by multitudes who live preciſely for the ſame purpoſes, and yet enjoy a good degree of credit, and are rather conſidered as objects of admiration than of cenſure.</p>
            <p>But the moſt alarming inſtance is that of the ſplendid, and not illiberal Epicure, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no enormities that have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us; for that he dined well, and dreſſed well, could hardly incur the bitter penalty of eternal miſery. That his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences were ſuitable to his ſtation, and his ſplendour proportioned to his opulence,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021271_0009_0FB2B3E962408E00"/>
does not exhibit any objection to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Nor does he appear to have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the crumbs which Lazarus ſolicited: on the contrary, it is probable that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his bounty drew the needy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner to his gate. Here is magnificence which is uncenſurable, and here is bounty which is meritorious. And yet this man, on an authority which we are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to queſtion, is repreſented, in a future ſtate, as <hi>lifting up his eyes, being in torments.</hi> His puniſhment ſeems to have been the conſequence of an irreligious, worldly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a heart corrupted by the ſoftneſſes and delights of life. It was not becauſe he was rich, but becauſe he truſted in riches; it was not that he was uncharitable, but that his charity wanted the principle which alone could ſanctify it. His views termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated here; this world's good, and this world's applauſe, were the motives and the end of his actions. He forgot God; he
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021271_0010_0FB2B3EAF442FF70"/>
was deſtitute of piety; and the abſence of this great and firſt principle of human ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rendered his ſhin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng deeds, however they might be admired among men, of no value in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>There is no error more common, or more dangerous, than that an unreſtrained indulgence of appetite is generally attended with a liberal, humane, and merciful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Nor is there any opinion more falſe and more fatal, or which demands to be more ſteadily controverted, than that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm and good-nature are natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary aſſociates. For after all that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt poets, and more corrupt philoſophers, have told us of the blandiſhments of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and of its tendency to ſoften the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and humanize the affections, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that nothing hardens the heart like exceſſive and unbounded luxury; and he who refuſes the ſweeteſt gratifications to his own voluptuouſneſs, will generally be ſound
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021271_0011_0FB2B3F1E5D6D038"/>
the leaſt ſuſceptible of tenderneſs for the wants of others. The cruelties at Rome bore an exact prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rtion to the diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at Capreae. And it is not leſs notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the Imperial fiddler became more barbarous, as he grew more profligate.—Proſperity, ſays the Arabian proverb, fills the heart till it makes it hard: and the moſt dangerous pits and ſnares for human virtue are thoſe, which are ſo covered over with the flowers of proſperous fortune, that it requires a cautious foot, and a vigilant eye, to eſcape them.</p>
            <p>Even Ananias and Sapphira were, I doubt not, well eſteemed in ſociety; for it was enough to eſtabliſh a very conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to ſell even part of their poſſeſſions for religious purpoſes: but what an alarm does it ſound to hypocriſy, that, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rewarded for what they brought, they were puniſhed for what they kept back! And it is to be feared, that this deceitful pair are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021271_0012_0FB2B3F40A5B8CE0"/>

A man may correct many improper practices, and refrain from many immoral actions, from merely human mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; but, though this partial amendment is not without its uſes, yet this is only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking ſymptoms, and neglecting the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſeaſe.

Our higheſt attainments, inſtead of bringing us "to the mark," only teach us to remove the mark to a greater diſtance, by giving us more humbling views of ourſelves, and more exalted conceptions of the ſtate which we are labouring after. Though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs towards perfection may be perpetual in this world, the actual attainment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a better. And this reſtleſs deſire of a happineſs which we cannot reach, and this lively idea of a perfection which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain, are among the many arguments for a future ſtate, which ſeem to come lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhort of abſolute demonſtration.</p>
            <p>But I muſt remember, that this is not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021271_0014_0FB2B3F6D36BAA18"/>
a ſermon, but a mere ſuperficial eſſay. I am neither an old man a clergyman, nor a methodiſt, ſo that it is at leaſt <hi>poſſible</hi> that I may be neither actuated by moroſeneſs, ſelf intereſt, nor enthuſiaſm. I live much in the world, and have as much ſatisfaction in its lawful pleaſures, and permitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, as other men. I endeavour to cultivate the greateſt candour for the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and affection for the perſons of all my fellow creatures. I am charmed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, generoſity, and integrity, even in worldly men. But one virtue muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon another. Charity muſt not ſupplant faith. If a man be generous, good-natured, and humane, it is impoſſible not to feel for him the tenderneſs of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but if, at the ſame time, he be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, intemperate, or profane, who ſhall dare to ſay he is in a ſafe ſtate? Good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and generous ſentiments, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make a man a pleaſant acquaintance;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021271_0015_0FB2B3F86247E8D0"/>
but who ſhall lower the doctrines of the Goſpel, to accommodate them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of men? Who ſhall bend a ſtrait rule, to favour a crooked practice? Who ſhall controvert that authority which has ſaid, that <hi>without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May I venture to be a little paradoxical; and while ſo many grave perſons are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting on the miſchiefs of vice, may I be permitted to ſay a word on the miſchiefs of virtue; or, rather, of that ſhining coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, which while it wants the ſpecific gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, has much of the brightneſs of ſterling worth? Never, perhaps, did any age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more beautiful declamations in praiſe of virtue than the preſent; never were more poliſhed periods rounded in honour of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. An ancient Pagan would imagine that Aſtrea had returned to take up her abode in our metropolis; a primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian would conclude, that <q>righteouſneſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021271_0016_0FB2B3F9CE543E50"/>
and peace had there met together.</q> But how would they be ſurpriſed to find that the obligation to theſe duties was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought binding on their eloquent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiaſts! that univerſal benevolence may ſubſiſt with partial injuſtice, and boundleſs liberality with ſordid ſelfiſhneſs! that one may ſeem eager in redreſſing the injuries of half the globe, without deſcending to the petty detail of private virtues; and burn with zeal for the good of millions one never ſaw, and yet ſpread vice and ruin through the little circle of one's own perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence!</p>
            <p>When the general texture of an irregular life is ſpangled over with ſome conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal pleaſing qualities; when gaiety, good humour, and a thoughtleſs profuſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence throw a luſtre round the faultieſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, it is no wonder that common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers are blinded into admiration: a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe generoſity dazzles <hi>them</hi> more than all
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021271_0017_0FB2B3FB4FD661E0"/>
the duties of the decalogue. But though it may be a very uſeful quality towards ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the election of a borough, it will contribute but little towards making ſure the calling and election to the kingdom of heaven. It is ſomewhat ſtrange that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance ſhould be the great criterion of goodneſs with thoſe very people who are themſelves the victims to this idol; for the prodigal pays no debts if he can help it: and it is notorious, that in one of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt and moſt popular comedies which this country has ever produced, thoſe very paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which exalt liberality at the expence of juſtice, were nightly applauded with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic rapture by thoſe deluded tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom, perhaps, that very ſentiment helped to keep out of their money.</p>
            <p>But there is another ſort of faſhionable character, whoſe falſe brightneſs is ſtill more pernicious, by caſting a ſplendour over the moſt deſtructive vices. Corrupt manners,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021271_0018_0FB2B3FCC9824BB0"/>
ruinous extravagance, and the moſt fatal paſſion for play are ſometimes gilded over with many engaging acts of charity, and a general attention and reſpect to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of Chriſtianity. But this is degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the venerable image and ſuperſcription of religion, by ſtamping them on baſer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal than they were ever intended to impreſs. The young and gay ſhelter themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch examples, and ſcruple the leſs to adopt the bad parts of ſuch mixed charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when they ſee that an immoral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is ſo compatible with a religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            <p>But I digreſs from my intention; for it is not the purpoſe of this addreſs to take notice of any actions which the common conſent of mankind has determined to be wrong; but of ſuch chiefly, as are practiſed by the ſober, the decent, and the regular; and to drop a few hints on ſuch leſs obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offences as are in general,</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:021271_0019_0FB2B40155386368"/>
Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne.</q>
            <p>Nor will the bounds which I have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed myſelf allow of my wandering into a wide and general field of obſervation.</p>
            <p>The idea of the preſent ſlight perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was ſuggeſted by reading the King's late excellent proclamation againſt irreligion and immorality. Under the ſhelter of ſo high a ſanction it may not be unſeaſonable to preſs on the hearts of the better diſpoſed, ſuch obſervances as ſeem to be generally overlooked, and to remark ſuch offences as commonly elude cenſure, becauſe they are not commonly thought cenſurable.</p>
            <p>It is obvious to all ſerious perſons, that that branch of the divine law, againſt which the better kind of people treſpaſs with the leaſt ſcruple, is the fourth commandment. Many who would ſhudder at the violation of the other nine, ſeem without ceremony to expunge this from the divine code; but by what authority they do this, has never
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021271_0020_0FB2B402CDC0C080"/>
been explained. The Chriſtian legiſlator does not ſeem to have abridged the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; and there is no ſubſequent authority ſo much as pretended to by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>
            <p>It is not here intended to take notice of ſuch flagrant offences as lie open to the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of higher tribunals; or to pollute this paper with deſcanting on the holders of card aſſemblies on Sundays, the frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of taverns and gaming houſes; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Sunday newſpapers; the proprietors of Sunday ſtage coaches; and others, who openly inſult the laws of the land; laws which will always be held ſacred by good citizens, even were not the law of God antecedent to them.</p>
            <p>Many of the order whom I here addreſs are perſons of the tendereſt humanity, and not only wiſh well to the intereſts of virtue, but are favourably diſpoſed to advance the cauſe of religion; nay, would be extremely
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021271_0021_0FB2B40545911450"/>
ſtartled at not being thought ſincerely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: yet from inconſideration, want of time, want of ſelf-examination, want of ſuſpecting the deceitfulneſs of the human heart, ſometimes allow themſelves in inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and negligences, which materially affect their own ſafety, and the comfort of others.—While an animated ſpirit of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſeems to be kindled among us; while there is a general diſpoſition to inſtruct the ignorant, and to reform the vicious; one cannot help regretting that theſe amiable exertions ſhould be counteracted, in ſome degree, by practices of a directly oppoſite tendency; trifling in their appearance, but ſerious in their effects.</p>
            <p>There are ſtill among us petty domeſtic evils, which ſeem too inconſiderable to claim redreſs. There is an aggrieved bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of men in our very capital, whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hardſhips ſeem ſcarcely to have been
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021271_0022_0FB2B4068F261128"/>
taken into conſideration, I mean the HAIR DRESSERS, on whom</p>
            <q>The Sunday ſhines, no day of reſt to them.</q>
            <p>Is there not a peculiar degree of unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in exerciſing ſuch cruelty on the ſouls of men, whoſe whole lives are employed in embelliſhing our perſons? And is it quite conceivable how a lady's conſcience is able to make ſuch nice diſtinctions, that ſhe would be ſhocked at the idea of ſending for her mantuamaker, or milliner, her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, or maſon, on a Sunday, while ſhe makes no ſcruple regularly to employ a hair dreſſer?</p>
            <p>Is it not almoſt ridiculous to obſerve the zeal we have for doing good at a diſtance, while we neglect the little, obvious, every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, domeſtic duties, which ſhould ſeem to ſolicit our immediate attention? But an action ever ſo right and meritorious, which is only to be periodically performed,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021271_0023_0FB2B408067C2FD0"/>
at diſtant intervals, is leſs burthenſome to corrupt nature, than an undeviating atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch ſmall, conſtant, right habits as are hoſtile to our natural indolence, and would be perpetually vexing and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelf-love. The weak heart indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges its infirmity, by allowing itſelf inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate omiſſions, and habitual neglects of duty; repoſing itſelf for ſafety, on regular, but remote returns of ſtated performances. It is leſs trouble to ſubſcribe to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel in foreign parts, than to have daily prayers in our own families: and I am perſuaded that there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of well-meaning people who would gladly contribute to a miſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Japan or Otaheite, to whom it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver occurred, that the hair dreſſer, whom they are every Sunday detaining from church, has a ſoul to be ſaved; that the law of the land cooperates with the law of God, to forbid their employing him;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021271_0024_0FB2B409B02ACB98"/>
and that they have no right, either legal or moral, to this portion of his time. The poor man himſelf, perhaps, dares not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, for fear he ſhould be deprived of his employment for the reſt of the week. If there were no other objection to a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable Sunday among the great and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, methinks this ſingle one might ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; would not a devout heart be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to rob a fellow creature of his time for devotion, or a humane one of his hour of reſt?</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange that there ſhould be ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſiſtency in human conduct, that the ſame perſons ſhould gladly contribute to ſpread the light of Chriſtianity in another hemiſphere; while, by their example, they actually obſtruct the progreſs of it at home. But it is, I doubt not, much oftener ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the imperceptible influence of cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and habit, than to a decided ill inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides, it may be in morals as it is
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021271_0025_0FB2B40CEBD74058"/>
in optics, the eye and the object may come too cloſe to each other, to anſwer the end of viſion. There are certain faults which preſs too near our ſelf-love to be even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to us.</p>
            <p>There is an evil newly crept into poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſociety, and it comes under a maſk ſo ſpecious, that they are chiefly good ſort of people who are allured by it; I mean SUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAY CONCERTS. Many, who would be ſtartled at a prophane, or even an idle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, think that the name of <hi>ſacred muſic</hi> ſanctifies the diverſion. But if thoſe who live in eaſe and affluence do not make theſe petty renunciations of their own ways, and their own pleaſure, what criterion have we by which to judge of their ſincerity? For as the goodneſs of Providence has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them from painful occupations, they have neither labour from which to reſt, nor buſineſs from which to refrain.—A little abſtinence from pleaſure is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021271_0026_0FB2B410318EDBF0"/>
evidence of their obedience to the divine precept.</p>
            <p>I know with what indignant ſcorn this remark will, by many, be received: that much will be advanced in favour of the ſanctity of this amuſement. I ſhall be told that the words are, many of them, extracted from the Bible, and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is the divine Handel's. But were the angel Gabriel the poet, the archangel Michael the compoſer, and the ſong of the Lamb the ſubject, it would not abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that ſtatute of the Moſt High, which has ſaid, <q>Thou ſhalt keep holy the Sabbath-day, and thy SERVANT, and thy CAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE, ſhall do no manner of work.</q>—I am perſuaded that the hallelujahs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would make no moral muſic to the ear of a conſcientious perſon, while he reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that multitudes of ſervants are waiting in the ſtreet, expoſed to every temptation; engaged, perhaps, in prophane ſwearing,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021271_0027_0FB2B41105842F88"/>
and idle, if not diſſolute converſation: and the very cattle are deprived of that reſt which the tender mercy of God was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed, by an aſtoniſhing condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to include in the commandment.</p>
            <p>But I will, for the ſake of argument, ſo far concede as to allow of the innocence, and even piety of Sunday concerts: I will ſuppoſe (what, however, does not always happen) that no unhallowed ſtrains are ever introduced; that ſome attend theſe concerts with a view to cultivate devout affections; that they cheriſh the ſerious impreſſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the muſic, and retire in ſuch a frame of ſpirit as convinces them that the heart was touched while the ear was grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Nay, I <hi>would</hi> grant, if ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion would be accepted, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals were filled up with converſation, "whereby one may edify another:"—Yet all theſe good effects, allowing them real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have been produced, will not remove
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021271_0028_0FB2B412922A5C30"/>
the invincible objection of an EVIL EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AMPLE; and what liberal ſpirit would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any reaſonable ſacrifice of its own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſo important a motive? Your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have been accuſtomed to conſider a concert as a ſecular diverſion; if you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, continue it on a Sunday, will not they alſo expect to be indulged on that day with their common amuſements? St. Paul, who was a very liberal thinker, believed it prudent to make frequent ſacrifices of things indifferent in themſelves. He was willing to deny himſelf a harmleſs and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gratification, <hi>even as long as the world ſtood,</hi> rather than ſhock the tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men of leſs underſtanding. Where a practice is neither good nor evil, in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it is both diſcreet and generous to avoid it, if it can be attended with any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible danger to minds leſs enlightened, and to faith leſs confirmed.</p>
            <p>But, religion apart, I have ſometimes
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021271_0029_0FB2B41591D19D70"/>
wondered that people do not yield to the temptation that is held out to them, of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from diverſions one day in ſeven, upon motives of mere human policy; as voluptuaries ſometimes faſt, to give a keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reliſh to the delights of the next repaſt. For pleaſure, like an over-fed lamp, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the exceſs of its own aliment. But the lovers of pleaſure are not always prudent, even upon their own principles: for I am perſuaded that the world would afford much more real ſatisfaction than it does, if we did not preſs, and torture, and ſtrain it, to yield what it does not contain. Much good, and much pleaſure, it does liberally beſtow; but no labour, or art, can extract from it that elixir of peace, that divine eſſence of content, which it is not in its nature to produce. There is good ſenſe in ſearching into every bleſſing for its <hi>hidden</hi> properties; but it is folly to ranſack and plunder it for ſuch as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021271_0030_0FB2B4171A623A08"/>
of all ages tells us are <hi>foreign</hi> to it. We exhauſt the world of its pleaſures, and then lament that it is empty; we wring thoſe pleaſures to the very dregs, and then complain that they are vapid.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, probably, be accuſed of a very narrow and fanatical ſpirit, in animadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a practice ſo little ſuſpected of harm as the frequenting of public walks and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on a Sunday: and certainly, there cannot be an amuſement more entirely harmleſs in itſelf. But I muſt appeal to the honeſt teſtimony of our own hearts, if the <hi>effect</hi> be favourable to ſeriouſneſs. Do we commonly retire from theſe places with the impreſſions which were made on us at church in their full force? We entered theſe ſprightly ſcenes, perhaps, with a ſtrong remaining tincture of that devout ſpirit which the public worſhip had infuſed into the mind. But have we not felt in gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diminiſh? Have not our powers of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021271_0031_0FB2B418D71AB410"/>
reſiſtance grown inſenſibly weaker? The doctrines, which in the morning appeared the ſober dictates of reaſon, now ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably rigid; and truths, which were then thought incontrovertible, now appear impertinent. To anſwer arguments is much eaſier than to withſtand allurement. The underſtanding may controvert a ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling propoſition with leſs difficulty than the ſliding heart can reſiſt the infection of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing gaiety. To oppoſe a cold and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative faith to the illuſion of preſent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is to fight with inadequate weapons: it isreſiſting <hi>arms</hi> with <hi>rules;</hi> it is combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a temptation with an idea. Whereas, he who engages in the Chriſtian warfare, will find that his chief ſtrength conſiſts in knowing that he is very weak; that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from danger is his higheſt glory, and to decline the combat his trueſt courage.</p>
            <p>Whatever indiſpoſes the mind for the duty of any particular ſeaſon, though it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021271_0032_0FB2B41A1250A110"/>
ſame ever ſo innocent a form, cannot be perfectly right. If the heart be laid open to the incurſion of vain imaginations, and worldly thoughts, it matters little by what gate the enemy entered. If the effect be injurious, the cauſe cannot be quite harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. It is the perfidious property of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pleaſures, that, though they ſeem not to have the ſmalleſt harm in themſelves, they imperceptibly indiſpoſe the mind to every thing that is good.</p>
            <p>Many readers will be apt to produce againſt all this preciſeneſs, that hackneyed remark which one is tired of hearing, that Sunday diverſions are allowed publicly in many foreign countries, as well in thoſe profeſſing the reformed religion, as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. But the corruptions of one part of the Proteſtant world are no reaſonable juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the evil practices of another. Error and infirmity can never be proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of imitation. It is ſtill a remnant of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021271_0033_0FB2B41BA3326FE0"/>
the old leaven: and as to pleading the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Roman Catholic countries, one bluſhes to hear an enlightened Proteſtant juſtifying himſelf by examples drawn from that benighted religion.</p>
            <p>Beſides, though I am far from vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the amuſements permitted on Sundays in foreign countries, by allowing that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed cuſtom, and long preſcription, have the privilege of conferring right; yet ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners may, at leaſt, plead the ſanction of cuſtom, and the connivance of the law. While in this country, the law of the land, and eſtabliſhed uſage, concurring with ſtill higher motives, give a ſort of venerable ſanction to religious obſervances, the breach of which will be always more liable to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction than in countries where ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny motives do not concur.</p>
            <p>I am not an advocate for the ſeverity of a Jewiſh, or the moroſeneſs of a puritani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſabbath. I am likewiſe far from inferring

In arts and letters<note n="*" place="bottom">When Pliny the younger was accuſed of deſpiſing the degenerate eloquence of his own age, and of the vanity of aſpiring at perfection in oratory, and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to become the rival of Cieero; inſtead of denying the charge, he exclaimed with a noble ſpirit, STULTISSIMUM credo, ad imitandum non OPTIMA quaeque proponere.</note> the moſt conſummate models are held out to imitation. We never hear any body cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned againſt becoming too wiſe, too learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or too rich. Zeal, in buſineſs, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted commendable; in friendſhip it is amiable; in all the periſhing concerns of earthly things it is extolled as exhibiting marks of a ſprightly temper, and a vigorous mind. Strange! that to be "fervent in ſpirit," ſhould only be diſhonourable in that ſingle inſtance which ſhould ſeem to demand unremitting diligence, and unextinguiſhed warmth.</p>
            <p>But after all, is an exceſſive and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate zeal the <hi>common</hi> vice of the times?
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021271_0037_0FB2B42490F3C860"/>
Is there any <hi>very</hi> imminent danger that the enthuſiaſm of the great ſhould tranſport them to dangerous and inconvenient exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Are our young men of faſhion ſo <hi>very</hi> much led away by the ardour of piety, that they require to have their imaginations coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the freezing maxims of worldly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Is the ſpirit of the age ſo <hi>very</hi> much inclined to catch and to communicate the fire of devotion, as to require to be damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by admonition, or extinguiſhed by ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule? When the inimitable Cervantes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the wild notions and romantic ideas which miſled the age in which he lived, he did wiſely, becauſe he combated an actually exiſting evil; but in this latter end of the eighteenth century, there ſeems to be little more occaſion (among perſons of rank, I mean) of cautions againſt enthuſiaſm than againſt chivalry; and he who declaims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt religious exceſſes in the company of well-bred people, ſhews himſelf to be as
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021271_0038_0FB2B42622037560"/>
little acquainted with the manners of the times, as he would do who ſhould think it a point of duty to write another Don Quixote.</p>
            <p>Among the devices dangerous to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſafety, certain favourite and ſpecious maxims are not the leaſt ſucceſsful, as they carry with them an impoſing air of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent candour, and always ſeem to be on the popular ſide of good nature. One of the moſt obvious of theſe is, that method of reconciling the conſcience to practices not decidedly wicked, and yet not ſcrupulouſly right, by the qualifying phraſe, <hi>that there is no harm in it.</hi> I am miſtaken, if more innocent perſons do not inflame their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reckoning by this treacherous apology than by almoſt any other means. Few are ſyſtematically, or premeditatedly wicked; or propoſe to themſelves, at firſt, more than ſuch ſmall indulgences as they are perſuaded <hi>have no harm in them.</hi> But this latitude is
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:021271_0039_0FB2B42CA282BF50"/>
gradually and imperceptibly enlarged. As the expreſſion is vague and indeterminate; as the darkeſt ſhade of virtue, and the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhade of vice, melt into no very incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous colouring; as the bounds between good and evil are not always ſo preciſely defined, but that he who ventures to the confines of the one, will find himſelf on the borders of the other; every one furniſhes his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition; every one extends the ſuppoſed limits a little farther; till the bounds which fence in permitted from unlawful pleaſures are gradually broken down, and the marks which ſeparated them imperceptibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>It is, perhaps, one of the moſt alarming ſymptoms of the degeneracy of morals in the preſent day, that the diſtinctions of right and wrong are almoſt ſwept away in polite converſation. The moſt ſerious offences are often named with cool indifference; the moſt ſhameful profligacy with affected
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021271_0040_0FB2B42EF61A7AA8"/>
tenderneſs and indulgent toleration. The ſubſtitution of the word <hi>gallantry</hi> for that crime which ſtabs domeſtic happineſs and conjugal virtue, is one of the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all the modern abuſes of language. Atrocious deeds ſhould never be called by gentle names. This muſt certainly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, more than any thing, to diminiſh the horror of vice in the riſing generation.—That our paſſions ſhould be too often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on the ſide of error, we may look for the cauſe, though not for the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the unreſiſted propenſities of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: but that our <hi>reaſon</hi> ſhould ever be employed in its favour, that our <hi>converſation</hi> ſhould ever be taught to palliate it, that our <hi>judgment</hi> ſhould ever look on it with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, has no ſhadow of excuſe: becauſe this can pretend to no foundation in nature, no apology in temptation, no palliative in paſſion.</p>
            <p>However defective, therefore, our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021271_0041_0FB2B42FCDFF2910"/>
may be; however we may be allured by ſeduction, or precipitated by paſſion, let us beware of lowering the STANDARD OF RIGHT. This induces an imperceptible corruption into the heart, ſtagnates the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt principle of action, irrecoverably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſes the ſenſe of moral and religious obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and prevents us from living up to the height of our nature. It cuts off all communication with virtue, and almoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the poſſibility of a return to it. If we do not riſe as high as we aim, we ſhall riſe the higher for having aimed at a lofty mark: but where the RULE is low, the practice cannot be high, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the propoſition is not proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true.</p>
            <p>Nothing more benumbs the exertions of ardent youthful virtue, than the cruel ſneer which worldly prudence beſtows on active goodneſs; and the cool deriſion it expreſſes at the defeat of a benevolent ſcheme, of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021271_0042_0FB2B432E3B841B0"/>
which malice, rather than penetration, had foreſeen the failure. Alas! there is little need of any ſuch diſcouragements. The world is a climate which too naturally chills a glowing generoſity, and contracts an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded heart. The zeal of the moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine is but too apt to cool, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the moſt diligent, to ſlacken of itſelf: and the diſappointments which Benevolence encounters in the failure of her beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed projects, and the frequent depravity of the moſt choſen objects of her bounty, would ſoon dry up the ampleſt ſtreams of charity, were they not ſed by the living fountain of religious principle.</p>
            <p>I cannot diſmiſs this part of my ſubject without animadverting on the too prompt alacrity, even of worthy people, to diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, in public and general converſation, inſtances of their unſucceſsful attempts to do good. I never hear a charity ſtory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be related in mixed company, that
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021271_0043_0FB2B43448ABF0B0"/>
I do not tremble for the cataſtrophe, leſt it ſhould exhibit ſome mortifying diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which may deter the inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced from running any generous hazards, and excite harſh ſuſpicions, at an age, when it is leſs diſhonourable to meet with a few caſual hurts, and tranſient injuries, than to go caſed in the cumberſome and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable armour of diſtruſt. The liberal ſhould be particularly cautious how they furniſh the avaricious with creditable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for ſaving their money, as all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the mortifications of the humane are added to the armoury of the covetous man's arguments, and produced, as defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive weapons, upon every freſh attack on his heart or his purſe.</p>
            <p>But I am willing to hope that that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs which we ſo often meet with in perſons of advanced years, is not always the effect of a heart naturally hard. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthropy is very often nothing but abuſed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021271_0044_0FB2B4361A812800"/>
ſenſibility. Long habits of the world, and a melancholy conviction how little good he has been able to do in it, hardens many a tender hearted perſon. The milk of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kindneſs becomes ſoured by repeated acts of ingratitude. This commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an indifference to the well-being of others, and a hopeleſſneſs of adding to the ſtock of human virtue and human happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This uncomfortable diſeaſe is very fond of ſpreading its own contagion, which is a cruelty to the health of young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infected virtue.—For this diſtemper, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by a too ſanguine diſpoſition, and grown chronical from repeated diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there is but one remedy, or rather one prevention: and this is a genuine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of piety. He who is once convinced that he is to aſſiſt his fellow creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the will of God, and one of the conditions of obtaining his favour, will ſoon get above all uneaſineſs when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021271_0045_0FB2B4380F0EF718"/>
does not anſwer his expectation. He will ſoon become only anxious to do his duty, humbly committing events to higher hands. Diſappointments will then only ſerve to refine his motives, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his virtue. His charity will then become a ſacrifice leſs unworthy of the altar on which it is offered. His affections will be more ſpiritualized, and his devotions more intenſe. Nothing ſhort of ſuch a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous piety can preſerve a heart hackneyed in the world from relaxed diligence, or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal deſpair.</p>
            <p>People in general are not aware of the miſchief of judging of the rightneſs of any action by its proſperity, or of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of any inſtitution by the abuſe of it. We muſt never proportion our exertions to our ſucceſs, but to our duty. If every laudable undertaking were to be dropped becauſe it failed in ſome caſes, or was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed in others, there would not be left an
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021271_0046_0FB2B43B8C4046B8"/>
Alms-Houſe, a Charity-School, or an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital in the land. And if every right prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice were to be diſcontinued becauſe it had been found not to be ſucceſsful in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, this falſe reaſoning, puſhed to the extreme, might at laſt be brought as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for ſhutting up our churches, and burning our bibles.</p>
            <p>But if, on the one hand, there is a proud and arrogant diſcretion which ridicules, as Utopian and romantic, every generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the active and the liberal; ſo there is on the other, a ſort of popular bounty which arrogates to itſelf the excluſive name of <hi>feeling,</hi> and rejects with diſdain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of an higher principle. I am far from intending to depreciate this humane and exquiſitely tender ſentiment, which the beneficent Author of our nature gave us, as a ſtimulus to remove the diſtreſſes of others, in order to get rid of our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs. I would only obſerve, that where
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021271_0047_0FB2B43C961722D8"/>
not ſtrengthened by ſuperior motives, it is a caſual and precarious inſtrument of good, and ceaſes to operate, except in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſence, and within the audible cry of miſery. This ſort of feellng forgets that any calamity exiſts which is out of its own ſight; and though it would empty its purſe for ſuch an occaſional object as rouſes tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient ſenſibility, yet it ſeldom makes any ſtated proviſion for miſeries, which are not the leſs real becauſe they do not obtrude upon the ſight, and awaken the tenderneſs of immediate ſympathy. This is a mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical charity, which requires ſprings and wheels to ſet it a going; whereas, real Chriſtian charity does not wait to be acted upon by impreſſions and impulſes.</p>
            <p>Another cauſe which very much intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates well-diſpoſed people, is their terror, leſt the character of piety ſhould derogate from their reputation as men of ſenſe.—Every man of the world naturally arrogates
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:021271_0048_0FB2B43E0568EB10"/>
to himſelf the ſuperiority of underſtanding over every religious man. He, therefore, who has been accuſtomed to ſet a high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue on his intellectual powers, muſt have made very conſiderable advances in piety before he can acquire a magnanimous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to this uſurped ſuperiority; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can ſubmit to the parſimonious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotment of wit and learning, which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him by the ſupercilious hand of worldly wiſdom. But this attack upon his pride will be the beſt touchſtone of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. If his advances have not been ſo conſiderable, then, by an hypocriſy of the leaſt common kind, he will be induſtrious to appear leſs good than he really is, leſt the detection of his ſerious propenſities ſhould draw on him the imputation of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary parts or low attainments. But the danger is, that while he is too ſedulouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on maintaining his pretenſions as an ingenious man, his claims to piety ſhould
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:021271_0049_0FB2B44114367FE0"/>
daily become weaker. That which is long ſuppreſſed is too frequently extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For this reaſon, principally, it is to be regretted that religious converſation ſhould be ſo carefully baniſhed from polite company. Were it otherwiſe, young and baſhful piety, inſtead of being afraid to ſhow its head, would be cultivated, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and encouraged. For while we are beings compounded of paſſion as well as intellect, the devotion of the generality is not ſo purely ſpiritual as not to ſtand in need of every external and collateral help. Fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is too apt to be extinguiſhed without the aid of ſuch material fuel as is poſſeſſed of igneous particles.</p>
            <p>Nothing perhaps more plainly diſcovers the faint impreſſion which religion has real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made upon our hearts, than this diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, even of good people, to ſerious converſation. Let me not be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; I do not mean the wrangle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:021271_0050_0FB2B442F45BAFC0"/>
I do not mean the gall of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; I do not mean the fiery ſtrife of <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> than which nothing can be leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to good nature, good manners, or good ſociety. But it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was not thought ill-bred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet that the eſcapes of the tongue ſhould now and then betray the <q>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart:</q> that when ſuch ſubjects are caſually introduced, a diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging coldneſs did not inſtantly take place of that ſprightly animation of countenance which made common topics intereſting. If theſe outward and viſible ſigns were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocai, we ſhould form but moderate ideas of the inward and ſpiritual grace. It were to be wiſhed, that ſuch ſubjects were not thought dull <hi>merely</hi> becauſe they are good; that they had the common chance of fair diſcuſſion; and that parts and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were not aſhamed to exert themſelves on occaſions where both might appear to ſo
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:021271_0051_0FB2B444C808EA50"/>
much advantage. If the heart were really intereſted, could the affections forbear now and then to break out into language? Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, phyſicians, merchants, lawyers and ſcholars keep up the ſpirit of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by mutual intercourſe. New lights are ſtruck out, improvements are ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, emulation is kindled, love of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is inflamed, miſtakes are rectified, and deſire of excellence is excited by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. And is piety alone ſo very eaſy of acquiſition, ſo very natural to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearts, or ſo certainly progreſſive of itſelf, as to require none of the helps which are indiſpenſable on all other ſubjects?—Travellers, who are to viſit any particular country, are full of earneſt inquiry, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reſearch; they think nothing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent by which their future pleaſure or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage may be affected. Every hint which may procure them any information, or caution them againſt any danger, is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021271_0052_0FB2B4475C383A58"/>
received; and all this, becauſe they are really in <hi>earneſt</hi> in their preparation for this journey; and do fully <hi>believe,</hi> not only that there is ſuch a country, but that they have a perſonal intereſt in the good, or evil, which may be found in it.</p>
            <p>A farther danger to good kind of people ſeems to ariſe from a miſtaken idea, that only great and actual ſins are to be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt. Whereas, ſins of omiſſion make up, perhaps, the moſt formidable part of <hi>their</hi> catalogue of offences. Theſe generally ſupply in number what they want in weight, and are the more dangerous for being little oſtenſible. They continue to be repeated with leſs regret, becauſe the remembrance of their predeceſſors does not, like the remembrance of formal, actual crimes, aſſume a body and a ſhape, and terrify by the impreſſion of particular ſcenes and circumſtances. While the memory of tranſacted evil haunts a tender conſcience
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021271_0053_0FB2B449C51066E8"/>
by perpetual apparition; omitted duty, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no local or perſonal exiſtence, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recorded by ſtanding acts and deeds, and having no diſtinct image to which the mind may recur, ſinks into quiet oblivion, without deeply wounding the conſcience, or tormenting the imagination. Theſe omiſſions were, perhaps, among the <q>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins,</q> from which the royal peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſo earneſtly deſired to be cleanſed: and it was worthy of the moſt ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that theſe are the offences againſt which the Goſpel pronounces very alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denunciations. It is not leſs againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ative than actual evil, that affectionate exhortation, lively remonſtrance, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parable, are exhauſted. It is againſt the tree which bore NO fruit, the lamp which had NO oil, the unprofitable ſervant who made NO uſe of his talent, that the ſevere ſentence is denounced; as well as againſt <hi>corrupt</hi> fruit, <hi>bad</hi> oil, and talents
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:021271_0054_0FB2B44AD97B48F0"/>
               <hi>ill</hi> employed. We are led to believe, from the ſame high authority, that omitted du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and neglected opportunities, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh no inconſiderable portion of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condemnation. A very awful part of the deciſion, in the great day of account, ſeems to be reſerved merely for omiſſions and negatives. Ye gave me NO meat; ye gave me NO drink; ye took me NOT in; ye viſited me NOT<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the puniſhment attending poſitive crimes, as being more naturally obvious, more logically conſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quent, it was not, perhaps, thought ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inſiſt.</p>
            <p>Another cauſe, which ſtill further impedes the reception of religion even among the well-diſpoſed, is, that garment of ſadneſs in which people delight to ſuppoſe her dreſſed; and that life of hard auſterity, and pining abſtinence, which they pretend ſhe enjoins her diſciples. And it were well if this were only the miſrepreſentation of her declared
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021271_0055_0FB2B44C630F3070"/>
enemies; but, unhappily, it is the too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent miſconception of her injudicious friends. But ſuch an overcharged picture is not more unamiable than it is unlike; for I will venture to affirm, that Religion, with all her beautiful and becoming ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, impoſes fewer ſacrifices, not only of rational, but of pleaſurable enjoyment, than the uncontrolled dominion of any one vice. Her ſervice is not only perfect ſafety, but perfect freedom. She is not ſo tyrannizing as Paſſion, ſo exacting as the World, nor ſo deſpotic as Faſhion. Let us try the caſe by a parallel, and examine it, not as affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our virtue, but our pleaſure. Does Religion forbid the cheerful enjoyments of life as rigorouſly as Avarice forbids them? Does ſhe require ſuch ſacrifices of our eaſe as Ambition? or ſuch renunciations of our quiet as Pride? Does Devotion <hi>murder ſleep</hi> like Diſſipation? Does ſhe deſtroy Health like Intemperance? Does ſhe annihilate
<pb facs="unknown:021271_0056_0FB2B44E40E6E948"/>
Fortune like Gaming? Does ſhe imbitter Life like Diſcord; or abridge it like Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Does Religion impoſe more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance than Suſpicion? or half as many mortifications as Vanity? Vice has her martyrs: and the moſt auſtere and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Aſcetic (who miſtakes the genius of Chriſtianity almoſt as much as her enemies) never tormented himſelf with ſuch cruel and cauſeleſs ſeverity as that with which Envy lacerates her unhappy votaries.—Worldly honour obliges us to be at the trouble of reſenting injuries; but Religion ſpares us that inconvenience by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to forgive them; and by this injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſults our happineſs no leſs than our virtue; for the torment of conſtantly hating any one muſt be, at leaſt, equal to the ſin of it.—If this eſtimate be fairly made, then is the balance clearly on the ſide of Religion even in the article of pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It is an infirmity not uncommon to good
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:021271_0057_0FB2B44F4EE85C48"/>
kind of people, to comfort themſelves that they live in the exerciſe of ſome one natural good quality, and to make a religious merit of a conſtitutional happineſs. They have alſo a ſtrong propenſity to ſeparate what God has joined; belief and practice; the creed and the commandments; actions and motives; moral duty and religious obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Whereas, you will hardly find, in all the New Teſtament, a moral, or a ſocial virtue that is not hedged in by ſome religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous injunction: ſcarcely a good action en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined towards others, but it is connected to ſome exhortation to perſonal purity.—All the charities of benevolence are, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſo agreeable to the natural make of the heart, that it is a very tender mercy of God to have made that a duty, which, to finer ſpirits, would have been irreſiſtible as an inclination; and to annex the higheſt future reward to the greateſt preſent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But in order to give a religious ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021271_0058_0FB2B450C3D1C880"/>
to a ſocial virtue, the duty of viſiting the fatherleſs and widow in their affliction, is inſeparably attached to the difficult and ſelf-denying injunction of keeping ourſelves unſpotted from the world. This adjunct is the more needful as many are apt to make a kind of moral commutation, and to allow themſelves ſo much pleaſure in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for ſo much charity. But one good quality can never ſtand proxy for another. The Chriſtian virtues derive their higheſt luſtre from aſſociation: they have ſuch a ſpirit of ſociety, that they are weak and imperfect when ſolitary; their radiance is brightened by communication, and their natural ſtrength multiplied by their alliance with each other.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied that good ſort of people ſometimes uſe religion as the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous uſe phyſic. As the latter employ medicine to make health agree with luxury, the former conſider religion as a medium
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021271_0059_0FB2B455384CC010"/>
to reconcile peace of conſcience with a life of pleaſure. But no moral chemiſtry can blend natural contradictions; the world will ſtill be uppermoſt, and religion will diſdain to coaleſce with its antipathy.</p>
            <p>Let me not be ſuſpected of intending to inſinuate that religion encourages men to fly from ſociety, and hide themſelves in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes: to renounce the generous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duties of active life, for the viſionary, cold, and fruitleſs virtues of an Hermitage, or a Cloyſter. No: the miſchief ariſes not from our living in the world but from the world living in us; occupying our hearts, and monopolizing our affections. Action is the life of virtue, and the world is the nobleſt theatre of action. Perhaps ſome of the moſt perfect patterns of human conduct may be found in the moſt public ſtations, and among the buſieſt orders of mankind. It is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a ſcene of trial, but the glory of the triumph is proportioned to the peril of the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021271_0060_0FB2B45611A87260"/>
conflict. A ſenſe of danger quickens cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, and makes virtue more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. Lot maintained his integrity in a great city, proverbially wicked, and forfeited it in the boſom of retirement.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid that worldly good ſort of people are a greater credit to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, by exhibiting more cheerfulneſs, gaiety, and happineſs, than are viſible in ſerious Chriſtians. If this aſſertion be true, which I very much ſuſpect, is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the apparent eaſe and gaiety of the former may be derived from the ſame ſource of conſolation which Mrs. Quickly recommends to Falſtaff, in Shakeſpeare's admirable picture of the death-bed ſcene of that witty profligate? <q>He wiſhed for comfort, quoth mine hoſteſs, and began to talk of God; now I, to comfort him, begged him he ſhould not think of God: it was time enough to trouble himſelf with theſe things.</q> Do not many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021271_0061_0FB2B4584CEE6108"/>
themſelves by drawing water from theſe dry wells of comfort? and patch up a precarious and imperfect happineſs in this world, by diverting their attention from the concerns of the next?</p>
            <p>Another obſtruction to the growth of piety, is that unhappy prejudice which even good kind of people too often enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt thoſe who differ from them in opinion. Every man who is ſincerely in earneſt to advance the intereſts of religion, will have acquired ſuch a degree of candour, as to become indifferent by whom good is done, or who has the reputation of doing it, provided it be actually done. He will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to increaſe the ſtock of human virtue and happineſs, by every poſſible means. He will whet and ſharpen every inſtrument of goodneſs, though it be not caſt in his own mould, or faſhioned after his own pattern. He will never conſider whether the form ſuits his own particular taſte, but whether
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021271_0062_0FB2B45B9F85F628"/>
the inſtrument itſelf be calculated to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the work of his maſter. It is a teſt by which he will be able to judge of his own ſincerity, if the delight he feels at hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a meritorious action ſuffers no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it was performed by one who differs from him in his religious, or even his political, ſentiments.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude theſe looſe and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical hints with a general addreſs to thoſe who content themſelves with a decent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the doctrines, inſtead of a diligent diſcharge of the duties of Chriſtianity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and forgive me:—you are the people who lower religion in the eyes of its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021271_0063_0FB2B45D87D5D430"/>
the predictions they diſbelieve. But you, like an inadequate and faithleſs prop, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the edifice which you pretend to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.—When an acute and keen-eyed infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del meaſures your lives with the rule by which you profeſs to walk; he finds ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle analogy between them, the copy is ſo unlike the pattern, that this inconſiſtency of yours is the paſs through which his moſt dangerous attack is made. And I muſt confeſs, that, of all the arguments, which the malignant induſtry of infidelity has been able to muſter, the conduct of profeſſing Chriſtians ſeems to me to be the only one which is really capable of ſtaggering a man of ſenſe.—He hears of a ſpiritual and ſelf-denying religion; he reads the beatitudes; he obſerves that the grand artillery of the Goſpel is planted againſt pride. He then turns to the tranſcript of this perfect origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; the lives which pretend to be faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. There he ſees, with triumphant
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:021271_0064_0FB2B4602A0C05D8"/>
deriſion, that pride, ſelf-love, ſelf-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, unbounded perſonal expence, and an inordinate appetite for pleaſure, are reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vices in the eyes of many of thoſe who acknowledge the truth of the Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. He weighs that meekneſs to which a bleſſing is promiſed, with that arrogance which is too common to be very diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. He compares that non-conformity to the world, which the Bible makes the criterion of a believer, with that rage for amuſement which is not conſidered as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputable in a Chriſtian. He oppoſes the ſelf-denying and lowly character of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our faith with the ſenſual practices of his followers. He finds little reſemblance between the reſtraints preſcribed, and the gratifications indulged in. What conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt a ſpeculative reaſoning ſceptic draw from ſuch premiſes? Is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch phraſes as a broken ſpirit, a contrite heart, poverty of ſpirit, refraining
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021271_0065_0FB2B4624B5E0CA8"/>
the ſoul, keeping it low, and caſting down high imaginations, ſhould be to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever "fooliſhneſs," when ſuch humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting doctrines are a "ſtumbling block" to profeſſing Chriſtians, who cannot always cordially reliſh a religion which profeſſedly tells them it was ſent to ſtain the pride of human glory, and to exclude boaſting?</p>
            <p>But though the paſſive and ſelf-denying virtues are not high in the eſteem of good ſort of people, yet they are peculiarly the evangelical virtues. The world extols bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant actions; the Goſpel enjoins good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and right motives: it ſeldom inculcates thoſe ſplendid deeds which make heroes, or thoſe ſounding ſentences which conſtitute philoſophers; but it enjoins the harder taſk of renouncing ſelf, of living uncorrupted in the world, of ſubduing beſetting ſins, and of not thinking of ourſelves more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than we ought. The acquiſition of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was the precept of other religions, the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021271_0066_0FB2B463851744B8"/>
contempt of it is the perfection of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
            <p>Let us then be conſiſtent, and we ſhall never be contemptible, even in the eyes of our enemies. Let not the unbeliever ſay that we have one ſet of opinions for our theory, and another for our practice; that to the vulgar
<q>
                  <l>We ſhew the rough and thorny way to heav'n,</l>
                  <l>While we the primroſe path of dalliance tread.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It would become our characters as men of ſenſe, of which conſiſtency is a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal proof, to chooſe ſome rule and abide by it. An extempore Chriſtian is a ridiculous character. Fixed principles will be followed by a conſiſtent courſe of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; while indeciſion of ſpirit will produce inſtability of conduct. If there be a model which we profeſs to admire, let us ſquare our lives by it. If the Koran of Mahomet, or the Revelations of Zoroaſter, be a perfect
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021271_0067_0FB2B46653279080"/>
guide, let us follow one of them. If either Epicurus, Zeno, or Confucius, be the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar object of our veneration and reſpect, let us faſhion our conduct by the dictates of their philoſophy; and then, though we may be wrong, we ſhall not be abſurd. But if the Bible be in truth the word of God, as we profeſs to believe, we need look no farther for a conſummate pattern. Let us then make it the rule of practice here, if it is indeed to be the rule of our judgment hereafter.</p>
            <p>But I am willing to flatter myſelf that the moral and intellectual ſcene about us begins to brighten. I indulge myſelf in moments of the moſt enthuſiaſtic and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful viſion; taking encouragement from that glorious prophecy, that <q>of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his government there ſhall be no end.</q> A prediction which ſeems to be gradually accompliſhing: and in no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more, perhaps, than in the noble
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021271_0068_0FB2B468700E2B78"/>
attempt about to be made for the abolition of the African ſlave-trade. For what event can human wiſdom foreſee more likely to contribute to <q>give the SON the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion,</q> than the ſucceſs of ſuch an enterprize, which will reſtore the luſtre of the Chriſtian name, too long ſullied with oppreſſion, cruelty, and injuſtice?</p>
            <p>A good ſpirit ſeems to be at work. A catholic temper is diffuſing itſelf among all ſects and parties: and enlightened candour, and a liberal toleration were never more prevalent; good men combat each other's opinions with leſs rancour, and better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. We have many public encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; we have a pious king; a wiſe and virtuous miniſter; many reſpectable, and not a few ſerious, clergy. (May their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber daily increaſe!) Among theſe ſome of the firſt in dignity are the firſt in conduct.

An increaſing deſire to inſtruct the poor, to inform the ignorant, and to reclaim the vicious, is ſpreading among us. The late Royal Proclamation affords an honourable ſanction to virtuous endeavours, and lends nerves and ſinews to the otherwiſe feeble exertions of individuals, by inforcing laws wiſely planned, but hitherto feebly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In ſhort, there is a good hope that we ſhall more and more become that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py people who have the Lord for their God: that as proſperity is already within our walls, peace and virtue may abide in our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
            <p>But vain will be all endeavours after <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> and <hi>ſubordinate</hi> amendment. Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation muſt begin with the GREAT, or it will never be effectual. <hi>Their</hi> example is the fountain from whence the vulgar draw their habits, actions, and characters. To expect to reform the poor while the opulent are corrupt, is to throw odours into the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:021271_0070_0FB2B46B4B645220"/>
ſtream while the ſprings are poiſoned.—Even the excellent inſtitution of Sunday ſchools for training religious ſervants, will avail but little, if, as ſoon as the perſons there educated, come into the families of the great, they behold practices diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to the inſtructions they have been imbibing. If they fall into the houſes of the profligate, they will hear the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which they have been taught to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, derided; if into mere worldly fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they will ſee them neglected; and to the eſſential principle of vital Chiſtianity, oblivion is ſcarcely leſs fatal than contempt.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, the rich and great will not, from a liberal ſpirit of doing right, abſtain from thoſe offences, for which the poor are to ſuffer fines and impriſonments, effectual good cannot be done. It will ſignify little, to lay penalties on the horſes of the drover, or on the waggon of the huſbandman, while the chariot wheels of the great, roll

with inceſſant motion: and the ſacred day on which the ſons of induſtry are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by royal proclamation to deſiſt from travelling, is for that very reaſon ſelected for the journeys of the great, and preferred, becauſe the road is encumbered with fewer interruptions. But will it not ſtrike every well-meaning Sunday traveller with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous remorſe, when he reflects that he owes the accommodation of an unobſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted road to the very obedience which is paid by others to that divine and human law which he is in the very act of violating?</p>
            <p>Will not the common people think it a little inequitable that they are abridged of the diverſions of the public-houſe and the gaming yard on Sunday evening, when they ſhall hear that many houſes of the firſt nobility are on that evening crowded with company, and ſuch amuſements carried on as are prohibited by human laws even on common days? As imitation, and a deſire

of being in the faſhion, govern the lower orders of mankind, it is to be feared that they will not think reformation reputable, while they ſee it <hi>recommended</hi> only, and not <hi>practiſed,</hi> by their betters. A precept coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted by an example, is worſe than fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it is ridiculous: and the common people will be tempted to ſet an inferior value on goodneſs, when they find it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected from the lower ranks. They cannot ſurely but ſmile at the diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſuperiors, who, while they ſeem anxiouſly concerned to ſave others, are ſo little ſolicitous about their own ſtate. The ambitious vulgar will hardly reliſh a ſalvation which is only intended for Plebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians; nor will they be apt to entertain ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exalted notions of that promiſed future reward, the road to which they perceive their betters are ſo much more earneſt to point out to <hi>them,</hi> than to walk in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

It was not by inflicting pains and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties that Chriſtianity firſt made its way into the world: the divine truths it incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated received irreſiſtible confirmation from the LIVES, PRACTICES, and EXAMPLES, of its venerable profeſſors. Theſe were arguments which no popular prejudice could reſiſt, no Jewiſh logic refute, and no Pagan perſecution diſcredit. Had the primitive Chriſtians only <hi>praiſed</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated</hi> the moſt perfect religion the world ever ſaw, it could have produced but very ſlender effects on the faith and manners of the people, if the jealous and inquiſitive eye of malice could have detected that the DOCTRINES they recommended had not been illuſtrated by the LIVES they led.</p>

               <head>POSTSCRIPT, TO THE SECOND EDITION.</head>
               <p>THE public favour having already brought this little Eſſay to another edition, the author has been ſedulous to diſcover any particular objections that have been made to it. Since the preceding ſheets were printed off, it has been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by ſome very reſpectable perſons who have honoured this ſlight performance with their notice, that it inculcates a too rigid auſterity, and carries the point of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Sunday much too far; that it takes away all the uſual occupations of the day, without ſubſtituting any others in their ſtead: and that it only pulls down a wrong ſyſtem, without ſo much as attempting to build up a right one. The author begs leave to obſerve in his own defence, that
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:021271_0075_0FB2B4741ADED478"/>
in animadverting on error, he purpoſely avoided inſiſting on obvious duty. To tell people what they already know to be right was leſs the intention of this addreſs, than to obſerve upon practices which long ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit had prevented them from perceiving to be wrong. Senſible and well-meaning perſons can hardly be at a loſs on a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which has exhauſted precept, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried exhortation. To have expatiated on it, would only have been to repeat what is already known and acknowledged to be right, even by thoſe whom the hurry of engagements will not allow to take breath one day in a week, that they may run the race of pleaſure with more alacrity on the other ſix. But, probably, it is not the duties, but the amuſements appropriated to the day, about which the inquiry is made. It will, perhaps, be found that the intervals of a Sunday, regularly devoted to all its reaſonable and obvious duties, are
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:021271_0076_0FB2B4758E4EBC28"/>
not likely to be ſo very tedious, but that they might be eaſily and pleaſantly filled up by cheerful, innocent, and inſtructive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Human delights would be very circumſcribed indeed, if the practices here noticed as erroneous, included the whole circle of enjoyment. Are the pleaſures of retirement, the pleaſures of friendſhip, the pleaſures of intellect, and the pleaſures of beneficence, to be eſtimated as nothing?</p>
               <p>There will not be found, perhaps, a ſingle perſon who ſhall honour theſe pages with a peruſal, who has not been repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly told, with an air of impoſing gravity, by thoſe who produce cards on a Sunday evening, <hi>that it is better to play than to talk ſcandal.</hi> Before this pithy axiom was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, it was not perhaps ſuſpected that Sunday gaming would ever be adduced as an argument in favour of morals. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entering into the comparative excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe two occupations, or preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021271_0077_0FB2B4771581D430"/>
to determine which has a claim to pre-eminence of piety, one may venture to be thankful that theſe alternatives do not ſeem to empty the whole ſtock of human reſource.</p>
               <p>People in the gay and elegant ſcenes of life are perpetually complaining that an extenſive acquaintance, and the neceſſity of being conſtantly engaged in large circles and mixed aſſemblies, leave them little lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for family enjoyment, ſelect conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and domeſtic delights. Others, with no leſs earneſtneſs, lament that the hurry of public ſtations, and the neceſſary demands of active life, allow them no time for any but frivolous reading. Now the recurrence of one Sunday in every week, ſeems to hold out an inviting remedy for both theſe evils. The ſweet and delightful pleaſures of family ſociety might then be uninterruptedly enjoyed, by the habitual excluſion of trifling and idle viſitors, who
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:021271_0078_0FB2B4795AA015F8"/>
do not come to ſee their friends, but to get rid of themſelves. Perſons of faſhion, living in the ſame houſe, and connected by the cloſeſt ties, whom buſineſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure keep aſunder during the greateſt part of the week, would then have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſpending a little time together, and of cultivating that friendſhip for each other, and that affection for their children, to which the preſent manners are not <hi>very</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. As to the other ſet of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers, thoſe who can find no time to read; this interval naturally preſents itſelf; and it luckily happens, that ſome of the moſt enlightened men the world ever ſaw have, not unfrequently, devoted their rare talents to ſubjects peculiarly ſuited to this day; and that not merely in the didactic form of ſermons, which men of the world affect to diſdain; but in every alluring ſhape which human ingenuity could aſſume. It luckily happens, among a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:021271_0079_0FB2B47AD207FB68"/>
inſtances, that the deepeſt metaphyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,<note n="*" place="bottom">Locke, Newton, Milton, Butler, Addiſon, Bacon, Boyle.</note> the greateſt aſtronomer, the ſublimeſt poet, the accuteſt reaſoner, the politeſt writer, the moſt conſumate philoſopher, and the profoundeſt inveſtigator of nature, which this, or perhaps any country has produced, have all written on ſuch ſubjects as are analogous to the buſineſs of this day. Such authors as theſe, even wits, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and men of the world, muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it is not bigotry to read, nor enthuſiaſm to commend. Of this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious groupe only <hi>one</hi> was a clergyman, which to a certain claſs of readers will be a ſtrong recommendation: though it is a little hard that the faſtidiouſneſs of modern taſte ſhould undervalue the learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labours of divines, only becauſe they are <hi>profeſſional.</hi> In every other function, a man's compoſitions are not the leſs eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
