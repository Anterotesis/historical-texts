            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THAT our laws do not operate with ſufficient force, is a truth too glating to eſcape obſervation. It is ſeen, felt, and lamented by every ſincere lover of his country. Different cauſes, no doubt, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>operate to produce this effect. To inveſtigate all theſe, does not fall in with my preſent deſign, though it might be of ſingular ſervice to the ſtate. For as in the human, ſo in the body politic, the cauſe of a diſeaſe being once diſcovered, the remedy is more eaſily preſcribed, and the deliterious effect more ſucceſsfully counteracted. It is more to my purpoſe to obſerve, that the general neglect of religion which prevails among us, is one great, if not the chief cauſe, why our laws are ſo feeble in their operation. Immorality is the natural conſequence of impiety. An irreligious, will always be an immoral, people; and among ſuch, good and wholeſome laws can never be executed with punctuality</p>
            <p>Some of our laws may be erroneous or defective, and not framed with a ſufficient regard to the ſpirit of the people; and this hath been aſſigned by ſuperficial thinkers as the only reaſon why they are not carried into execution. This, I think, is a great miſtake. Our laws though they may partake of that imperfection which is the common mark of all human productions, are in general ſalutary, and calculated to promote our political happineſs. Here lies the grand defect; a defect which is not to be attributed ſolely or even principally to the badneſs of our laws, but to ſome other cauſes. Whatever theſe may be, the effect is ſufficiently alarming, and threatens a ſpeedy diſſolution of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let our laws be ever ſo good, if they are not properly executed, our government can be of no long duration.</p>
            <p>A tranſient view of thoſe ſtates and kingdoms, which have made the moſt ſtriking figure in the hiſtory of the world, and which have been moſt renowned for the felicity of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021418_0003_0FB3EE702BBA4E30"/>
always conſidered as a matter of great importance to civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>The greateſt politicians and moſt celebrated legiſlators of antiquity depended much on this to give ſanction to their laws, and make them operate with vigour and facility.</p>
            <p>If we carefully conſider the nature of religion and of civil government, we will be led to conclude, that in this they did not act at random; but from the moſt profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human nature, and the dictates of the ſoundeſt policy. The manners of the people, though ſo little attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by our legiſlators, are confeſſed by all to be of the utmoſt conſequence in a commonwealth. The moſt profligate politician can expatiate on the neceſſity of good morals; but we hear little of religion from our moſt reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſtateſmen. When the diſcuſſion is of politics, ſhe is generally kicked out of doors, as having nothing to do either with morality or civil policy. The inſeparable connection between this daughter of heaven and her genuine offspring morality, is forgotten, and her influence on civil ſociety almoſt wholly overlooked.</p>
            <p>For the better arrangement of our thoughts on this exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſubject, we ſhall—</p>
            <p n="1">I. Conſider religion under its more general notion, as comprehending the belief of a deity, a providence, and future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We ſhall conſider the chriſtian religion in particular; and, as we paſs along, endeavour to ſhow the influence of both on civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>That religion is of great importance to ſociety is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged. Aſſuming this for granted, let us proceed to enquire how it operates to produce thoſe effects which are confeſſed to be of ſuch ſingular ſervice. It is a common obſervation, that we are ſo formed as to be greatly influenced by whatever works upon our hopes or our fears. Now it is by taking hold on theſe that religion produces thoſe ſalutary effects of which we now ſpeak; thus reſtraining men from vice by the dread of puniſhment, and alluring them to virtue by the hope of reward. Theſe are the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021418_0004_0FB3EE71AA49CA58"/>
or if you pleaſe, paſſions, in human nature, which firſt prompted men to enter into the ſocial union; fear of violence from each other, and hope of ſecurity by aſſociation. And it is only by working on theſe paſſions, that the union of men in the ſocial ſtate can be rendered permanent, and laws operate with that energy which is neceſſary to obtain their end.</p>
            <p>They who firmly believe that there is a God who governs the world, who ſees all their actions, and who will certainly reward virtue and puniſh vice, muſt undoubtedly be influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by this belief; and reſtrained, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, from evil, and excited to good.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed indeed, that there are too many who profeſs to believe the doctrines of religion, who ſeem to be very little influenced by them. Hurried away by the violence of their paſſions, they frequently tranſgreſs the bounds which religion preſcribes, and prefer the gratification of preſent appetite to the enjoyment of future good. But we muſt not hence conclude, that religion is in no degree a curb to the licentiouſneſs of men. They who in ſome inſtances act thus contrary to their principles, would go much further, were they void of thoſe principles, and the reins laid o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the neck of appetite. It will not follow, that becauſe religion does not reſtrain from immorality totally and univerſally, therefore it is no reſtraint at all. By the ſame way of reaſoning, we might prove, that civil laws lay no reſtraint upon men, becauſe they do not entirely reſtrain all men, at all times and in all inſtances.</p>
            <p>In order that we may be more fully convinced of the utility, and even neceſſity of religion, to the well-being, we might venture to ſay, to the very exiſtence of civil ſociety, it will be neceſſary a little to enquire into the eſſential defects of the beſt conſtituted government poſſible.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the end of civil ſociety and the evils it was deſigned to remedy, we will be convinced from its very nature, that it cannot reach that end, nor guard againſt thoſe evils, without the aid of religion. Let it ſuffice to obſerve, that <hi>ſecurity</hi> of <hi>life, liberty</hi> and <hi>property,</hi> is the preciſe and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021418_0005_0FB3EE732C719810"/>
ſpecific end of the ſocial compact. Other advantages it brings with it, and anſwers many other valuable purpoſes. But the evils for which it was deſigned as a remedy, are injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, violence, rapine, mutual ſlaughter and bloodſhed. The manner in which men aim at the cure of theſe evils, is by laws enacted with common conſent, enforced by a ſanction, and committed to the magiſtrate to be ſtrictly and impartially carried into execution.</p>
            <p>That civil government may fully and completely obtain its end, it is neceſſary that its laws ſhould have ſuch a ſanction, and operate in ſuch a manner, as to prevent or puniſh all crimes whatſoever, which may be injurious to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or tend to its diſſolution. It will, I ſuppoſe, be readily granted on all hands, that there never were, nor ever will be, laws ſo ſanctioned as to operate in this manner. Hence appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the inſufficiency of civil ſociety to anſwer its end.</p>
            <p>The two great ſanctions of all laws have been generally reckoned <hi>reward</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and indeed without theſe two ſanctions, every one muſt ſee, that government cannot, in any tolerable degree, anſwer its end, or laws operate in ſuch a manner as is neceſſary to ſecure its very exiſtence. But civil ſociety, without the ſupport of religion, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtitute of one of theſe ſanctions; and can apply the other but in a very partial manner, and under great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Civil ſociety wholly wants the <hi>ſanction</hi> of <hi>reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an age and place ſo highly enlightened in the nature and principles of ſound policy, I ſhall not enter into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal proof, that reward is not, and cannot be the ſanction of civil ſociety, conſidered in itſelf. It will be ſufficient juſt to obſerve, "that no ſtate whatever can poſſeſs a fund large enough to reward all its ſubjects for obedience to the laws, unleſs it be firſt drawn from them by a tax, to be paid back to a reward." Government can indeed, and it hath been the cuſtom in all governments, to reward particular ſubjects for eminent ſervices; but every one muſt ſee, that this is ſomething very different from the idea of reward conſidered as the ſanction of civil laws. A reward barely for obedience

               </gap> wiſe ſubject expects, and no ſociety can<note n="*" place="bottom">It may perhaps be ſaid that protection is the reward conferred on every individual for his obſervance of the laws. And here I imagine, if any where, it is that ſo many have fallen into a miſtake in this matter. To this it may be briefly replied, that protection is a debt due from <hi>all</hi> to <hi>every individual,</hi> for that portion of his natural liberty which he hath given up in the original compact. If protection, in ſtrict propriety of ſpeech, be reward, then with drawing it muſt be puniſhment, which it is not invariably, but only accidentally. The conſequence of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing protection is, or at leaſt always ought to be, baniſhment. But baniſhment is not always a puniſhment. It becomes ſo only by accident. It is ſo intentionally, but not always conſequentially. Puniſhment is not of the eſſence of baniſhment; for it would be eaſy to put a caſe where baniſhment muſt be conſidered, not as a puniſhment, but a very great bleſſing. This ſhows that protection conſidered as reward, is not the ſanction of human laws in the ſame ſenſe that puniſhment is, to which it ought to be properly oppoſed, if indeed it be the ſanction of reward.</note> beſtow. Without entering any further into this ſubject, we ſhall take it for granted that civil ſociety, in itſelf, totally wants one of thoſe ſanctions which are neceſſary to enforce its laws. That this is a very great and eſſential defect, will, we hope, be allowed by every competent judge. How, and in what degree religion ſupplies this defect, will be ſeen hereafter. At preſent let us a little enquire,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Into the effects of puniſhment conſidered as a ſanction. This is the proper and only ſanction of civil laws. But how imperfectly it can be enforced by ſociety will appear from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Civil government cannot puniſh ſecret crimes.</p>
            <p>That theſe abound in every ſociety, is matter of univerſal experience; that they are injurious to it, is too plain to admit of the leaſt doubt; that they are even multiplied by it, a little attention to human nature, will evince. When men are reſtrained from open tranſgreſſion, by the terror of laws and the dread of puniſhment, it is natural for them to fly to the covert of ſecrecy, that they may evade the laws, and eſcape with impunity. They know that civil judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures take cognizance only of thoſe crimes which are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021418_0007_0FB3EE76ED384758"/>
and if they can only conceal their guilt from the eyes of men, they are ſure to eſcape that puniſhment which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the ſanction of human laws. This will deter them from open violence, but at the ſame time, ſpur them on to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ret craft and ſtratagem. This will lead them to ſtudy and improve all the latent arts of miſchief and malice: and the very ſecurity which ſociety affords, by throwing men off their guard, gives deſigning villains an opportunity of practiſing theſe with greater ſucceſs. I crave the readers particular attention to this circumſtance, as it is of the firſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the point in hand, and in the cleareſt manner ſhows the neceſſity of religion in civil government.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Civil ſociety not only cannot puniſh ſecret crimes, but, in ſome caſes, cannot adequately puniſh even ſuch as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So inordinate are the appetites of men, and ſo violent the impulſe of the ſenſual paſſions, that the ſevere puniſhment of one crime, would ſometimes, open a door to others of a more attrocious nature and pernicious tendency. We give only one inſtance of this kind. The judicious reader may, if he be ſo diſpoſed, ſupply others of a ſimilar nature.

Imperfect rights, by ſome termed the duties of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect obligation, ſuch as gratitude, hoſpitality, charity, &amp;c. are not the proper objects of civil laws. They cannot conveniently reach theſe, nor enforce the obſervance of them by penal ſanction. We have no laws among us to puniſh the neglect of theſe duties; and civil ſociety, at leaſt in its
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021418_0008_0FB3EE77A9A773C0"/>
legiſlative capacity, takes no notice of them. For this, I ſuppoſe, two reaſons may be given.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The violation of theſe is not ſuppoſed ſo immediately and directly to ſtrike at the exiſtence of the ſocial union, as the violation of the duties of perfect obligation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There can be no preciſe and fixed rule laid down for the regulation of mens conduct with reſpect to theſe duties.</p>
            <p>Of all the imperfect rights, gratitude approaches neareſt to thoſe which are of complete obligation None of all thoſe duties which cannot be properly exacted by law, admits of ſuch accurate and determinate rules: But altho' the crime of ingratitude may be more eaſily aſcertained than any other of the ſame claſs, the ſlighteſt conſideration will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that no law can be framed by the wit of man for the puniſhment of it, which will not be looſe, vague and liable to a thouſand exceptions. And if this be the caſe with ingratitude, much more with the others. We may therefore conclude without heſitation, that human laws cannot enforce the duties of imperfect obligation. Now, altho' the violation of theſe duties may not ſo directly tend to the diſſolution of ſociety, nor bring on ſuch rapid deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the neglect of thoſe which are called <hi>perfect rights,</hi> it is clear, that it muſt gradually ſap the foundations of government, and deſtroy that union and concord ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to its well-being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If then civil laws, by their proper power cannot provide for the obſervance of the duties which are of ſuch great moment to ſociety, it muſt be acknowledged a great deficiency. Thus it appears, that civil ſociety totally wants <hi>one</hi> of thoſe ſanctions which have been always reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned its two grand p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have not made the calculation, but believe he is near the truth. And we may add, that it can provide for theſe few but very imperfectly. Let us now enquire how religion ſupplies theſe deficiencies.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt natural and obvious notions of the deity is, that he abhors vice and delights in virtue, will puniſh
<pb facs="unknown:021418_0009_0FB3EE792B792A68"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and reward the other. They who firmly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> properly attend to this important religious truth, muſt, without doubt, be greatly influenced by it. When they call to mind that they are accountable creatures, and muſt be happy or miſerable hereafter, according as they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here, this will doubtleſs be a powerful motive to ſhun vice and purſue virtue. Religion holds up to all her ſincere votaries, a reward, than which nothing can be greater, more noble, and better ſuited to influence the mind. The proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of an happineſs the moſt exalted in its nature, the moſt exquiſite in degree, and eternal in duration, muſt ſtrongly allure thoſe to whom the deſire of happineſs is natural. Such, in the opinion of ſome of the wiſeſt and beſt of the heathens, is that felicity which awaits the virtuous man after death. This is the reward which religion promiſes, and which the good man expects to enjoy as the recompence of his virtue and piety.</p>
            <p>Without determining whether the hope of reward, or the dread of puniſhment, moſt influences the actions of men, in general, we may ſafely affirm, that on minds of a particular caſt, the former works much more powerfully than the latter. Men of great and haughty ſouls, of elevated and daring ſpirits, revolt againſt every thing that wears the appearance of compulſion. They ſcorn to be overawed by the fear of puniſhment; and conſider it as a motive fit only to operate upon little minds, and timorous ſpirits. The dread of civil laws, and even the terrors of religion, can have but little effect upon ſuch men; but they may be eaſily wrought upon by the proſpect of a reward ſuited to the greatneſs of their minds. The religioniſt, tho' he may not be prompted to yield obedience to the wiſe and ſalutary laws of his country, by the hope of a reward from his fellow citizens, expects ample retribution from him who knows the ſincerity and uprightneſs of his conduct. He looks for no reward from man, but expects it from him who is the rewarder of all thoſe who walk in the paths of virtue. As the laws in every well conſtituted and wiſely governed ſtate, will, as far as they reach, ever coincide with the eternal laws of the deity, he

                  <p>Human laws are meaſures in reſpect of men whoſe actions they muſt direct, how-be-it ſuch meaſures they are, as have alſo their higher rules to be meaſured by, which rules are two, the law of God and the law of nature; ſo that laws human, muſt be made according to the general laws of nature, and without contradiction to any poſitive law of ſcripture, otherwiſe they are ill made.

                  <p>This was alſo the opinion of Mr. Locke, who quotes this very paſſage of Hooker in his treatiſe on government. If ſome of our laws, in the ſtate of South Carolina, were brought to this teſt, I think they would be found not exactly agreeable to thoſe two rules; and therefore not good.</p>
               </note> Deeply impreſſed with this awful ſanction of the deity, powerfully influenced by the hope of that reward which is the conſequence of obedience to his laws, he will practiſe juſtice in all its various branches. This important virtue is the proper object of laws, both human and divine; and abſolutely neceſſary, not only to the welfare, but alſo to the very exiſtence of civil government. Even a ſociety of robbers, according to a trite obſervation, cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome degree of it. Whatever, therefore, hath a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to lead men to the practice of this cardinal virtue, muſt be peculiarly advantageous to civil ſociety. Now certainly that man who acts under the influence of religious motive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and principles, who conſiders the laws of juſtice as the laws of God, who, he believes, will reward him for obedience and puniſh him for diſobedience, is more likely to practiſe juſtice, than one who is influenced only by human authority, and the terror of human laws, which he can often evade, and ſo eſcape unpuniſhed. It is eaſy to determine which of theſe will be moſt faithful to his truſt, moſt honeſt and upright in his dealings, moſt careful to ſhun every thing that may be injurious to his neighbour, in perſon, character, or property.</p>
            <p>But further: religion will not only lead thoſe who are influenced by it to the exerciſe of juſtice in it's various branches; but will induce them to the exact performance of all thoſe duties of imperfect obligation which human laws cannot enforce. The civil magiſtrate takes no notice of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021418_0011_0FB3EE7C39591F30"/>
and can neither reward the performance, nor puniſh the neglect of them; but the laws of God extend to them; and religion as ſtrongly exacts them as the duties of perfect obligation. The religious man conſiders them as truly binding, as the moſt obvious dictates of juſtice. He as much expects to be rewarded for the one, as the other. This will lead him to pay the moſt ſacred regard to the duties of gratitude, humanity, hoſpitality, charity,—in a word, to all thoſe kind and beneficent offices, which are ſo eſſentially neceſſary to the welfare of the community; tho' they are not, and indeed cannot be, the proper objects of human laws. We think it unneceſſary to enlarge upon the duties juſt now mentioned, by ſhewing how much the careful performance of them tends to ſtrengthen and confirm the ſocial union. The ſlighteſt conſideration will immediately convince us, of what vaſt importance they are to ſociety, and how much they promote peace, love, harmony, and conſequently felicity, in the ſocial ſtate. We need only conceive what would be the conſequence of the total neglect of theſe duties, to be fully convinced of their u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ility. What a ſhocking and deplorable ſcene of malice, hatred, ſtrife, cruelty, miſery, and diſtraction, opens upon the mind, on the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſuppoſition. And yet civil ſociety, as hath been obſerved, cannot enforce theſe duties, the practice of which is ſo neceſſary to its happineſs, and the neglect of which endangers its very exiſtence. If then religion enforces theſe duties, and leads men to the performance of them, it will certainly follow, that it is uſeful to the ſtate. Thus religion like a powerful ally, comes in to the aid of civil government, and by eſtabliſhing the ſanction of reward, which it wholly wants, ſupplies its defects.</p>
            <p>But, in order more fully to demonſtrate how religion ſupplies the defects of civil ſociety, let it be obſerved, that it not only furniſhes the ſanction of reward, which it ſo much needs, but alſo ſuperadds a new ſanction of puniſhment, which co-operates with, and gives additional energy to human laws. The reader will pleaſe to remember, that we have already ſhewn, that civil ſociety can apply the ſanction of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021418_0012_0FB3EE7E6CFA7720"/>
only in a very low and limited degree. Some crimes are ſecret and cannot be puniſhed by civil laws, becauſe they lie wholly beyond their reach. Others are of ſuch a nature, that the ſevere puniſhment of them opens an avenue to thoſe of a more atrocious nature. But this is not the caſe with the ſanction of puniſhment which religion eſtabliſhes. It applies to all crimes whatſoever, let their nature or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be what they may. Men may eſcape the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which civil ſociety decrees, by concealing their crimes; but they cannot thus elude that which religion holds out to all thoſe who violate her laws. They who believe that God governs the world in wiſdom and righteouſneſs, and that his providence extends to all his creatures, muſt alſo believe, that he is omniſcient, and, of conſequence, perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all their actions and intentions. All who have a firm perſuaſion and proper impreſſion of this great religious truth, will be ſenſible, how vain it is to attempt to cover their crimes from him, whoſe all ſeeing eye penetrates the inmoſt receſſes of their hearts. Religion teaches, that all the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the wicked, tho' they may eſcape the obſervation of men, lie open to the deity, whoſe "eyes are like a flame of fire;" and who will in due time inflict that puniſhment which they juſtly deſerve. As the proſpect of impunity invites men to evil, ſo the certainty of puniſhment tends to reſtrain them from it, eſpecially if the puniſhment be unſpeakably great and dreadful. And ſuch, both chriſtians and heathens, have agreed to repreſent the puniſhment of vice in a future life. If then the dread of a puniſhment certain, terrible, and everlaſting, can have any influence on the minds of men, religion muſt be a powerful reſtraint, not only from open, but ſecret crimes. Where crimes are ſecret, or of ſuch a nature as not to be cognizable by human judicatures, the ſanction of civil laws ceaſes to operate, and is no longer of any ſervice to reſtrain from tranſgreſſion. Here religion comes in moſt opportunely to the aſſiſtance of civil ſociety, by impreſſing the idea of a future ſtate, an omniſcient tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and a puniſhment which the guilty cannot poſſibly avoid. On the other hand where the crime is open, and liable to be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021418_0013_0FB3EE7FEA520F88"/>
by human laws, the ſanction of religion falls in with, and ſtrengthens that of human laws, by holding out a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much more certain, as well as more formidable, than man can inflict.</p>
            <p>Men may be guilty of the blackeſt ingratitude, and, in general, totally neglect the duties of imperfect obligation, without incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring the leaſt danger from the civil powers. But altho' civil government ordains no penalties in this caſe, religion does; and thus furniſhes a remedy for that material defect. The man who lives under the belief and impreſſion of religion, looks upon himſelf accountable at the bar of the omniſcient for the neglect of thoſe duties. Tho' he is under no terror from the laws of men, he fears that future vengeance which awaits the guilty beyond the grave.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected againſt the above reaſoning,— That religion is not ſo uſeful and neceſſary as hath been repreſented—That tho' civil ſociety labours under great deficiencies, there are other ways by which they may be ſupplied. It may be ſaid, that the regard which men have to their own intereſt, their own temporal happineſs and ſecurity, will naturally lead them to pay a ſtrict regard to the laws of ſociety, and alſo to perform thoſe duties which laws cannot enforce, as well as to avoid thoſe crimes which they cannot puniſh—That the happineſs of every individual in ſociety is involved with, and depends upon the happineſs of the whole. That every one may ſee, that without obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to good and wholeſome laws, government muſt be rent into pieces, and he himſelf ſhare in the common ruin. And further, that the omiſſion even of thoſe duties which civil laws do not require, and the commiſſion of thoſe crimes which they cannot puniſh, muſt be injurious to the welfare of the ſtate, and conſequently to his own happineſs;—therefore a regard to his own intereſt, and temporal proſperity, muſt induce him to perform thoſe duties, and ſhun thoſe crimes.</p>
            <p>To all which we beg leave to reply;—that it may be readily granted, without any diſadvantage to the argument, that the conſiderations mentioned, will have their weight with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

of human nature to ſuppoſe, that thoſe things have any conſiderable influence on the bulk of mankind. They think but little of ſuch matters. They are not diſpoſed to attend to ſuch far-fetched deductions, nor to refine even thus far. Such kind of reaſonings, tho' obvious enough to thoſe who have attended to the nature and influence of civil ſociety, to them appears not a little intricate and perplexed. There is not perhaps a people on the face of the earth, more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the nature of civil government, than the Americans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and yet I ſuppoſe it may be modeſtly affirmed, that by far the greater part of them, reflect but little, how ſociety procures thoſe bleſſings which they enjoy; becauſe they are not immediately and directly the conſequence of it. The groſs of the common people are too much occupied about other matters, to examine remote conſequences, or trace their preſent happy and flouriſhing circumſtances to ſo diſtant a ſource as civil ſociety. They generally attribute theſe to their own prudence, induſtry and addreſs, without looking any further. For the moſt part they are purſuing their own private and ſeparate intereſt, little ſolicitous about the public good, tho' they may at the ſame time be promoting it. They ſeldom reflect, that they are a part of a whole, with which they are obliged to ſtand or fall; or conſider, that their happineſs depends upon that of the community of which they are members. Men who are immured in their ſtudies, and converſant chiefly with books, may wonder how people can be ignorant of theſe things: but let them travel through our country, and converſe with thoſe of the lower rank, who make the bulk in every government, and they will find great numbers, and thoſe not the worſt citizens, much like the ſimple Hibernian, who when he was informed the ſhip was ſinking, made this reply; "what do I care, I am only a paſſenger." In order, therefore, that the groſs of the people may diſcharge their duty as good citizens, ſome more obvious and immediate motive is neceſſary to ſupply the imperfection of civil laws;—ſome principle of action which comes more directly home to them, and affects them more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately as individuals. Such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of religion, which teaches,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021418_0015_0FB3EE8300250878"/>
the virtuous ſhall be rewarded, and the vicious puniſhed in a future ſtate. This leading principle, which ſeems in a great meaſure natural to the mind of man, will have a much greater influence on the generality of mank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd, and do more to ſupply the defects of civil ſociety than all the reaſonings in the world, which, tho' they may be juſt, are but little attended to by moſt men.</p>
            <p>The whole of what is urged in the objection, under the notion of motive, may be reſolved into the principle of ſelf-love; which when duly modified, properly directed, and wiſely regulated, is no doubt, favourable to civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But who does not ſee, that the love of ſelf is almoſt always inordinate in the purſuit of preſent good, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a blind and furious impulſe to preſent gratification, breaks thro' all the fences of law, and leads men to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of violence and injuſtice. Indeed, to counteract and reſtrain the exceſs of this paſſion, and correct the evils which ariſe from it, is the very deſign of the civil compact. <hi>This</hi> government attempts, by laying hold on this ſame principle, the ſtrongeſt in human nature, and endeavouring to prevent its ill effects, by giving it an oppoſite direction. This it can do but very imperfectly by its own proper power; and therefore ſtands in need of aid from ſome other quarter. Here religion affords the neceſſary aſſiſtance; for by incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating a future retribution, and thus exciting the hopes and the fears of men, ſhe oppoſes ſelf-<hi>love</hi> to <hi>ſelf-love.</hi> My meaning is, that ſhe oppoſes the love of ſelf as deſiring future good, and ſhunning future evil, to the love of ſelf conſidered as purſuing the unlawful gratification of preſent irregular ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etite. The language of civil laws is, "if you tranſgreſs, through an inordinate love of ſelf, you ſhall be puniſhed:" which very threatening is an application to the ſelfiſh principle, ſelf-love always leading men to avoid that which they reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in its nature evil. The language of religion is "if you carefully obſerve the wiſe and ſalutary laws of your countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and faithfully diſcharge the duties of a good citizen, you ſhall have an ample reward; but if hurried away by the impulſe of ſelfiſh paſſions, you violate the laws, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021418_0016_0FB3EE85295592D0"/>
the rights of your fellow-citizens, the moſt dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment awaits you." It is eaſy to ſee how far the language of both coincides. They only differ in this, that the one reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es further than the other. The one denounces puniſhment, but promiſes no reward; the other not only promiſes a reward, but threatens a more dreadful puniſhment. Civil laws lay hold, more eſpecially, on mens fears; religion both on their hopes and their fears. Both addreſs themſelves to the ſelfiſh paſſions; both oppoſe ſelf-love to ſelf-love, in the ſenſe already explained. But grant all that is ſuppoſed in the objection, it will by no means overthrow our argument. We have no where aſſerted, that there are no other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in human nature, beſides religion, which tend in any degree to remedy the imperfections of ſociety; but only, that religion is the moſt proper and natural remedy. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may any how ſerve as a foundation of moral obligation, if indeed there may be any ſuch foundation diſtinct from the will of the <hi>ſupreme,</hi> as the <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> the <hi>eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of things; theſe, as far as they lead men to approve and practiſe virtue, and ſhun vice, tend to promote the happineſs of ſociety. If a principle of honor and ſhame, a regard to character and dread of contempt and diſgrace, induce men to virtuous actions, and reſtrain them from the contrary, they muſt be conſidered as contributing in ſome degree to ſupply the defects of civil laws. I am, however, perſuaded, that upon a careful examination, theſe will be found not to have all that influence ſome may imagine. They are not a little precarious, and depend much upon time, place, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cuſtom and faſhion. What is reckoned honorable at one time and place, is not reckoned ſo at another. Cuſtom and faſhion, which exerciſe a kind of deſpotiſm over us in matters of leſs conſequence, introduce very conſiderable changes even in moral ſentiments and conduct. That rigid virtue and auſterity of manners which ſo ſtrongly marked the riſe of the Roman republic, would have appeared ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and contemptible, when that empire began to decline. That ſtyle of manners which was reckoned honorable, and procured the higheſt veneration in Cromwell's time, was the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021418_0017_0FB3EE86A84616D0"/>
object of ſcorn and deriſion, under the voluptuous reign of the ſecond Charles. Cuſtom hath reconciled many of the Carolinians and Georgians to a treatment of their ſlaves which a Pennſylvanian looks upon with horror; it is a cuſtom among ſome ſavage nations to expoſe infants; and this practice prevailed among the Athenians and ſeveral other Grecian ſtates, tho' civilized in a very high degree. And to increaſe our wonder, it was defended and inculcated by their greateſt philoſophers. We look upon this cuſtom with the utmoſt abhorrence, we conſider it as the higheſt pitch of barbarity, and the moſt ſhocking violation of the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and humanity; but among them, it was no way diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and paſt without blame or cenſure. After all, from the inſtances given above, we muſt not conclude, as ſome have done, that there is no other difference in moral actions and ſentiments than that which ariſes from education, cuſtom, or opinion. The foundations of morality are more deep and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than to be overthrown ſo eaſily as ſuch men imagine. There are ſome actions and characters to which no education or cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom whatever can reconcile men. Cuſtom can never bring us to approve of ingratitude and treachery; and to look upon them as honorable and worthy of praiſe as gratitude and faithfulneſs. Becauſe men in ſome particular inſtances, thro' the influence of cuſtom or education, act contrary to what we reckon the plain rules of morality, it will not follow that theſe rules have no other foundation. This would prove too much; for by the ſame method of arguing, we might prove, that there is no ſuch thing as a principle of reaſon in men; becauſe in millions of inſtances, cuſtom and education lead them to act contrary to its plain dictates. Let the <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> the <hi>eſſential difference,</hi> the principles of <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>ſhame,</hi> have all the weight which can with any ſhow of reaſon be allowed them, enough will ſtill be left for religion. With all the aſſiſtance which theſe can afford, human laws will be found but a weak fence againſt the violence and injuſtice of men.</p>

            <p>It is well known that three different opinions have been advanced on this head: ſome founding it on the <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> others on the <hi>eſſential difference</hi> of things, and others on the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Strictly ſpeaking, perhaps this laſt only, can properly oblige <hi>men.</hi> But in order to maintain this, it is not neceſſary to exclude the other two from all influence on morality. Where is the abſurdity of allowing all three a ſhare in leading men to the practice of virtue? Without determining any thing poſitively concerning this matter, we have endeavored to prove, that religion cannot be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as unneceſſary, even on the principles of thoſe who are moſt ſtrongly attached to the <hi>moral ſenſe</hi> and the <hi>eſſential difference.</hi> Theſe two have indeed, of late, been the hobby-horſes of their reſpective patrons. They make the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal figure in the writings of moſt of our modern moraliſts, not to ſay divines. The <hi>will</hi> of God, or what comes nearly to the ſame thing, <hi>religion,</hi> which is indeed the only proper and ſtable foundation of morality, is either wholly excluded, or brought in only by the bye, as a matter of little or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Theſe ſine-ſpun ſyſtems, however much they may diſplay the ingenuity of their authors, have but very little tendency to promote virtue, and reform the manners of the people; and therefore can be of little ſervice to ſociety. It is not eaſy to ſee how the <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> or the <hi>eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> or both taken together, when conſidered as wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from religion, if indeed they can be ſo conſidered, can properly eſtabliſh the ſanction of future reward and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This we have ſhewn is of the greateſt moment to civil government; and hence ariſes the ſingular utility of religion.</p>
            <p>The abſtract beauty of virtue may operate upon profound reaſoners,—that pleaſure which ariſes from thoſe actions which the moral ſenſe approves, may have its weight with men of elegant minds and delicate ſentiments; but neither of them will have much effect upon the great body of mankind. They will be always found to operate but very faintly upon
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021418_0019_0FB3EE89AA3D5EA8"/>
               <hi>many,</hi> who have, generally, "quick ſenſes, ſtrong paſſions and groſs intellects." This ſingle obſervation ſhows of how little conſequence they are, when compared with religion, which is calculated to operate upon the bulk of the common people in every ſociety.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, tho' we ſhould grant that other things co-operate with religion in ſupplying the defects of civil ſociety, we need not fear to conclude, that this is the moſt proper, and at the ſame time, the moſt powerful remedy.</p>
            <p>Before we conclude this part, it will be neceſſary to add a few words concerning the uſe of oaths, which <hi>may</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a diſtinct argument, to prove the influence of religion on civil ſociety. Solemn oaths, as far as I can learn, have obtained in all civilized nations. It is well known, what amazing force and influence they had upon the Romans in the virtuous period of their republic. In the greateſt extremity, and moſt preſſing dangers, theſe were their <hi>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> reſort. We have inſtances enow of this in their hiſtory. Let one ſuffice in this place: After the battle of Cannae, the people were ſtruck with ſuch a panic terror, that they talked of removing to Sicily. But Scipio had the addreſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an oath from them, that they would not leave Rome. The dread of violating this oath overwhelmed all other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. "Rome," ſays the excellent Monteſquieu, "was a ſhip held by two anchors, religion and morality, in the midſt of a furious tempeſt."</p>
            <p>If Mr. Locke, and the American politicians, argue right, all legitimate government is originally founded on compact. This compact is uſually ratified by ſolemn oaths. The chief magiſtrate, who is inveſted with the ſupreme executive power, is bound by oath, faithfully and impartially to execute the laws, and govern agreeably to them. In like manner, every citizen is bound to aid and ſupport him, as far as he acts conformably to his ſolemn engagement. Among us, it is well known, that all civil officers from the governor down to the conſtable, are obliged by oath, to the diſcharge of their reſpective truſts. The policy, and even neceſſity of all this, is very obvious; for altho' our civil
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021418_0020_0FB3EE8B2BACE880"/>
officers are amenable for their conduct, and liable to be puniſhed upon conviction, this can be no ſecurity againſt clandeſtine fraud. Here the religion of an oath is neceſſary, to reſtrain the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from thoſe ſecret <hi>mal-practices,</hi> which, however injurious to the public, cannot be legally detected. The ſecurity of life and property depends, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, upon oaths The innocent cannot be abſolved, nor the guilty puniſhed without them. In the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant judicial proceedings, the verdict ultimately reſts upon their validity. Take away the uſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> theſe religious affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and our courts of judicature muſt ceaſe, or be almoſt entirely uſeleſs. In a word civil government can by no means be carried on without them. If oaths be thus neceſſary to the adminiſtration of government, religion muſt be ſo; for where there is no religion, there can be no oath. Take away the belief of a deity, a providence and future ſtate, and there is an end of all oaths at once. In every oath a deity is invoked, as a witneſs and avenger, if we deviate from the truth. The atheiſt, therefore, cannot be bound by it. He who believes there is no providence or future ſtate, can be in no dread of puniſhment, either in this or a coming world, if he can only elude human judicatures. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt free thinker, or moſt abandoned proſtigate in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, would place very little dependence on the oath of one who believes there is neither God nor devil, heaven nor hell. Civil laws do indeed hold out a ſevere puniſhment to deter men from perjury; but as it is one of thoſe crimes, of which a perſon can ſeldom be legally convicted, ſuch laws ſtrike but little terror, and are of very little ſervice. The perjured villain may repeat his crime an hundred times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger from human laws. If therefore, the laws of religion have no hold upon him, his oath is perfectly inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, eſpecially, where he is under temptation to depart from the truth. We may therefore venture to affirm, that the obligation of oaths is properly founded on religion; and that whatever weight we allow them above a ſimple affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ariſes from a ſuppoſition, that the <hi>deponent</hi> believes there is a God. the <hi>rewarder</hi> of truth and the <hi>avenger</hi> of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021418_0021_0FB3EE8CA5B41D68"/>
perjury, to whom he makes a ſolemn appeal. This ſingle conſideration, were there no other arguments, is ſufficient to evince the utility, and even the neceſſity of religion to civil ſociety. For if government cannot be carried on without the uſe of oaths, and the validity of theſe depend upon religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the conſequence is unavoidable, that civil ſociety cannot ſubſiſt without religion. We proceed to the ſecond head of argument.</p>
            <p>In order to ſhow the influence of the chriſtian religion on civil ſociety, it will be neceſſary to conſider—the doctrines it teaches—the worpſhip it enjoins—and the precepts it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates. The two firſt, ſhall be treated briefly; the laſt requires a more ample diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Of the doctrines which chriſtianity teaches.</p>
            <p>Under this head it will not be neceſſary to treat all the doctrines of our religion, but only thoſe which more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and directly tend to the benefit of ſociety. Such are thoſe concerning the nature of the deity, his providence, and a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments.</p>
            <p>In thoſe ſacred writings which contain our religion, we have ſuch a repreſentation of the nature and attributes of the great firſt cauſe, as gives us the moſt grand, noble and worthy conceptions of him. The divine character as there drawn, is ſuited to inſpire ideas at once the moſt auguſt and awful, the moſt venerable and lovely. His irreſtible power, inflexible juſtice and tremendous majeſty; his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite knowledge and immaculate purity, tend to fill us with the moſt profound awe and reverence; to deter us from every thing that may provoke him, and conſequently to reſtrain us from every kind of immorality. Theſe perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the deity leave the impenitent and perſiſting rebel no hope of eſcaping the righteous vengeance of heaven. His diffuſive benevolence, the riches of his goodneſs, the extent of his mercy, his patience and readineſs to pardon the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and returning ſinner, are calculated to inſpire us with ſentiments of love and gratitude, encourage us to renounce our vicious practices, and hope in his mercy. In a word, the due conſideration of his attributes, as repreſented in our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021418_0022_0FB3EE8EF91EC998"/>
religion, neceſſarily tends to reſtrain us from all vice, and excite us to walk in the paths of piety and virtue; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to promote our happineſs as ſocial beings.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed, even by thoſe who are inclined to think moſt favourably of the ancient Heathens, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they generally entertained very groſs and unworthy notions of their deities; and ſuch as plainly tended to corrupt their morals, and encourage them in an indulgence of the ſenſual paſſions, very pernicious to civil ſociety. Their Gods, as the poet well expreſſes it, were
<q>
                  <l>"Gods partial, changeful, paſſionate, unjuſt,</l>
                  <l>"Whoſe attributes were rage, revenge or luſt."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The amorous intrigues, the rapes, quarrels, thefts, &amp;c. for which they were celebrated, are juſtly reckoned ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous among mortal men. There was ſcarcely any vice, the practice of which was not countenanced by ſome of their deities, male or female. Indeed when we conſider the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities aſcribed to the gods of the Heathens, it is ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they were not more corrupt and diſſolute in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. There muſt have been ſome powerful antidote in their civil inſtitutions, which counteracted the influence of religious errors ſo deſtructive of all morality. The idea which chriſtianity gives us of the infinite purity of that God whom we worſhip, has a quite contrary tendency. In a word, the perfections of the deity held up to view in divine revelation are ſuch, that the ſerious conſideration and devout contemplation of them, muſt neceſſarily fill us with an abhorrence of all impurity and vice of every kind. The more nearly we reſemble him, and the more perfectly we imitate him, the more virtuous we are, and the more diſpoſed to diſcharge all the ſocial duties.</p>
            <p>The doctrines, which chriſtianity teaches concerning the divine providence, give us the moſt exalted conceptions of the deity. They are perfectly conſonant to, and indeed the neceſſary conſequence of, his attributes. What a ſublime idea does it give us of the great Jehovah, when we conſider him as "ruling in the army of heaven, and amongſt the inhabitants of this lower world;" exerciſing an abſolute
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021418_0023_0FB3EE9076337530"/>
ſupreme and univerſal dominion over all his creatures; ſuſtaining them by his power, directing them by his wiſdom, and ſupplying them by his bounty? The God whom we are taught to worſhip, is no local deity like thoſe of the Heathens, preſiding over this or that portion of nature; the guardian of this or that particular city or country, inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this or that particular river, grove or mountain. He fills the vaſt and complicated machine of the univerſe, touches every ſpring, moves every wheel, and adjuſts every motion. <hi>He</hi> is the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>untain not only of being, but of all operation; the ſource of all that beauty, order and harmony which are diffuſed over the wide creation, and fill the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beholder with ſuch inexpreſſible delight. His provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence extends to the leaſt as well as the greateſt of his works. None of his creatures, however inſignificant, eſcape his notice: he regards them all with an equal and impartial eye. They are all the objects of his parental care, all the ſubjects of his governing power and wiſdom. With what beauty and emphaſis does the inſpired poet ſet forth the exuberant goodneſs of the creator, in the ample proviſion he makes for the various tribes of animals which inhabit this ſpacious earth? "The lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works. The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou giveſt them their meat in due ſeaſon. Thou openeſt thy hand and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing." But although his benificence is extended to all his creatures, thoſe who devote themſelves to his ſervice are the objects of his peculiar care. "The young lions may lack and ſuffer hunger; but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing. Their bread ſhall be given them, their water ſhall be ſure." He who "feeds the young ravens that cry and clothes the graſs of the field," will much more give his own ſervants food to eat and raiment to put on.</p>
            <p>When the devout chriſtian contemplates the providence of God in this view, and conſiders all things as under the government, and at the ſovereign diſpoſal of a being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely juſt, wiſe and powerful, whoſe goodneſs, like an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing

               </gap>berty, is perhaps, of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance than is generally imagined. Diſcontentment with our preſent condition, envy of wealth and power, and an immoderate fondneſs of change, are the ſource of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evils in ſociety. At leaſt, it is certain they were ſo in the republic of Rome, which was continually embroiled by the fierce diſputes between the Patricians and the Plebeans. And, if I miſtake not, much of the preſent uneaſineſs, ſtrife, and political contention in South Carolina, may be traced to the ſame ſource. If every citizen, with a chriſtian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, would acquieſce in that wiſe plan of providence, which ordains a certain ſubordination of rank and office in the political body; and conſider that in this very thing the beauty, order, and even the excellence of ſociety, very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

raiſing up with one hand, they are pulling down with the other. They would reckon it an unpardonable outrage for any one even to inſinuate, that they are not faſt friends of government; and yet make no ſcruple of ridiculing the moſt ſacred and important truths of religion; and by their looſe, immoral lives, and the poiſon of their example, are ſapping one of the principal pillars on which it reſts.

Would men become better members of ſociety, if all the ſentiments of religion, which as a great polititian obſerves, "are perhaps the only motive of honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the greateſt part of mankind," were utterly aboliſhed? It hath been often obſerved, that theſe ſage unbelievers, who think themſelves too knowing to be carried away with the religious tales of a future ſtate, are well enough pleaſed, that the vulgar ſhould think there is ſome truth in them.

Is it not plain, that norwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their loud talk againſt religion, they conſider it as one of the ſtrongeſt ſences of virtue? If it be ſo neceſſary in females, why not in the other ſex? Have men no need of this additional motive to a life of virtue and probity?

If theſe gentlemen look upon the doctrine of a future ſtate, though falſe, to be uſeful in ſociety, where is their civil prudence, when they are endeavouring to turn it into ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, and eraſe it from the minds of men? Suppoſe them to be a ſet of refined ſpirits, who have a juſt and noble taſte, and are capable of being enamoured with virtue for her own ſake; and of ſhunning vice merely on account of its innate deformity, what is to be done with the bulk of mankind,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021418_0033_0FB3EE9F75CAB0E0"/>
who have no ſuch taſte? Who purſue virtue chiefly for her dower, and ſhun vice on account of that future puniſhment which attends it? What a deluge of luſt and fraud, and violence, would quickly overſpread our country, were <hi>they</hi> all brought to be thorough-paced infidels! In a word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever regard theſe men may profeſs to virtue, I can ſcarcely think them in earneſt, when they ridicule religion in order to promote it.—This by the way.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if the Elyſium and Tartarus of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, were of that importance to ſociety, which the ancient lawgivers and politicians ſuppoſed, much more muſt the chriſtian doctrines of heaven and hell, which are founded in truth, and free from all fiction and fable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Of the worſhip which chriſtianity enjoins.</p>
            <p>That worſhip which the chriſtian religion requires, is pure, ſimple, ſpiritual, and perfectly conformable to the nature of its object. God is a ſpirit, and therefore we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to "worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth." A ſupreme and unfeigned love, a ſincere and ardent gratitude, a ſolemn awe and reverence, an humble confidence and entire reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his will, are the leading diſpoſitions he requires in his worſhippers. The ſupreme excellence of his nature, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ranſcendent glory of his attributes, which far ſurpaſs the moſt exalted conceptions of men and angels, render him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of our ſupreme love. His overflowing bounty, the riches of his grace, the number and greatneſs of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, demand our higheſt and warmeſt gratitude. His awful glory and tremendous majeſty call for holy fear and dread. His power, wiſdom, truth and juſtice, ſhould inſpire us with confidence, and lead us to acquieſce with abſolute ſubmiſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n all his righteous diſpenſations. In the proper exerciſe of theſe diſpoſitions, conſiſts that internal worſhip which our religion enjoins. The external part conſiſts in the outward expreſſions of theſe inward diſpoſitions by ſuch words, actions and at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itudes as are moſt proper to convey the ſentiments of the heart. And our religion teaches us that theſe outward expreſſions are no further acceptable to the deity than as they are connected with, and flow from
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021418_0034_0FB3EEA0ED53F160"/>
thoſe internal diſpoſitions which he requires. To "draw near to God with our lips, when our hearts are far from him," is hypocritical and odious in his ſight. To exhibit outward expreſſions of love, reverence, gratitude, &amp;c. where there is nothing of theſe diſpoſitions at heart, is only a ſolemn farce, a piece of profane mockery; and ſo far from pleaſing God, it is an abomination to him. He requires "truth in the inward parts." A pure, ſincere, humble, and upright heart is the object of his higheſt approbation. If this be wanting, nothing elſe can be acceptable. All the eſſential parts of chriſtian worſhip are appointed by God himſelf, who beſt knows what is agreeable to his own nature, and ſuited to our condition. They all tend to ſuggeſt ſpiritual ideas, to detach the mind from objects of ſenſe, and fix it on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant realities of an inviſible world. Among ſome deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of chriſtians indeed, much external ſhow, many pompous rites and ceremonies, much ſolemn farce and mummery, have been introduced into their religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But theſe ought to be conſidered as mere human inventions, contrary to the primitive ſimplicity, and oppoſite to the genuine ſpirit and deſign of chriſtian worſhip, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by its author. Theſe additaments, which like ſo many excreſcences, mar the comelineſs and deſtroy the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of our religious worſhip, are to be placed to the account of ſuperſtition, which is ever apt to mingle itſelf with religion.</p>
            <p>The religious worſhip of a people, eſpecially the public part of it, will always have a conſiderable influence on their morals; and this influence will be good or bad according to the nature of their worſhip. If that be pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, rational and agreeable to the nature of a holy being, it will lead to purity of morals, and therefore promote the happineſs of civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If the contrary, the effect will be directly oppoſite. In the public worſhip which genuine chriſtianity preſcribes, every part is calculated to inſpire us with an averſion from vice, and a love of piety and virtue Our prayers, when aſſembled for public worſhip, are a ſolemn addreſs to that pure and immaculate being, who is the author of life and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021418_0035_0FB3EEA26825ADF0"/>
the fountain of all our bleſſings. In theſe we recognize his glorious perfections, expreſs our dependence on him, and return the tribute of our gratitude for his great and manifold mercies. Here we confeſs the evil of ſin, plead for the pardon of it through the merits of a redeemer, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the obligations we are under to renounce it, and live ſober, righteous, godly lives. It is not neceſſary to take up the readers time in ſhowing how well ſuited all theſe things are to impreſs the heart with pious ſentiments, and fortify the mind wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h freſh reſolutions againſt whatever is oppoſed to the nature of that holy being to whom our prayers are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. If this part of chriſtian worſhip be performed in a proper manner, it cannot fail to have an influence on our moral temper and practice, as favourable to ſociety as it is extenſive. To return to thoſe vicious practices, the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unreaſonable nature of which we have been juſt confeſſing, and from which we have been juſt praying to be delivered, has ſomething in it very abſurd and ſhocking to an ingenuous mind.</p>
            <p>That part of our worſhip which is more particularly deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned to celebrate the praiſes of our creator, has the ſame moral tendency. In this the charms of muſic and poetry are added to heighten our devotion, to awaken the ſoul, enflame the heart, and raiſe our affections to that pitch of ardour and elevation which is juſtly due to the object of our adoration. Our ſongs of praiſe are adapted to heighten our conceptions, and give us the moſt exalted thoughts of God. The more our views of the divine perfections are enlarged, the more intenſely will the pure flame of divine love burn in our hearts: and if it be true, that love aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the object beloved, the more we love the more we will reſemble the deity. The more we will reſemble him in his moral attributes, the more we muſt abhor ſin, that abominable thing which he hates. The more deeply his image is ingraved on our hearts, the more we will be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to imitate his infinite benevolence; and of conſequence to promote the happineſs of our fellow-citizens, by the ſteady practice of every ſocial duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:021418_0036_0FB3EEA3E7CA4F50"/>As to thoſe grave religious diſcourſes which are delivered in our chriſtian aſſemblies, they are ſo evidently calculated to promote virtue and combat vice, that little need be ſaid concerning them. While the miniſters of our religion purſue the original deſign of their inſtitution, and live and preach as chriſtianity requires, their public inſtructions and ſolemn admonitions will always tend to facilitate the deſigns of a wiſe and ſalutary policy. If they follow the example, and pay a due regard to the precepts of their heavenly maſter, their diſcourſes muſt neceſſarily be adapted to make men wiſer and better. In theſe the pure and heavenly doctrines of our religion are explained and preſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, her precepts incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and her laws and ſanctions vindicated. Here the eternal world is laid open, and all the intereſting and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant realities of a future ſtate unfolded.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, eternal happineſs and eternal miſery, with the grandour and ſolemnity of thoſe ſcenes which bring on the general conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, are held up to view. The lovely and alluring form of virtue and religion, the guilt and deformity of vice, the unſpeakable eternal felicity which attends the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and the everlaſting miſery which is the conſequence of the other, are ſet before our eyes. Such pictures as theſe, executed by the bold and correct hand of a maſter, and exhibited in thoſe rich and ſtrong colourings which the glowing pencil of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration ſupplies, muſt have a great influence on the morals of a people. In the compaſs of nature, there are no other topics better adapted to rouſe and fix the attention of men, to ſeize the imagination, alarm the conſcience, excite their hopes and fears, and conſequently to reclaim them from vice and impiety to the love and practice of univerſal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>To what hath been ſaid concerning our religious worſhip, it may be proper to add, that even the poſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed to promote purity of heart and life. The rite of baptiſm points out the neceſſity of inward moral purity, and lays us under an expreſs and ſolemn obligation to renounce the deeds of darkneſs, and conſecrate ourſelves
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021418_0037_0FB3EEA5696C5AD8"/>
to the ſervice of God, by a life of piety and virtue. The Euchariſt is a commemoration of the ſtupendous and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled love of God, in giving his ſon to redeem our ſinful race, to reſtore us from the ruins of our fall, and open the gates of the heavenly paradiſe. In this memorial of the ſufferings and death of our compaſſionate Redeemer, we have the moſt ſtriking diſplay of the immaculate holineſs of God, and of his infinite oppoſition to ſin, which required ſo coſtly a ſacrifice. Here too, we oblige ourſelves in the moſt ſolemn and explicit manner, to depart from all iniquity, and lead a holy life, by practiſing piety towards God, as well as juſtice and charity towards our fellow-men. Pliny tells us, that the primitive chriſtians uſed to meet together, and bind themſelves by a ſolemn oath (ſacramento) "that they would not ſteal, nor rob, nor be guilty of a breach of faith." This might have taught him, that chriſtianity was at leaſt favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>morals,</hi> and ought to have ſheathed the perſecuting ſword of civil government. What can be more proper than this holy inſtitution, to keep alive a ſenſe of religion in the hearts of men; to root out from their minds all hatred and malice, and unite them in the bonds of love and friendſhip?</p>
            <p>If an affecting view of the moſt aſtoniſhing and unmerit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love, exhibited to our ſenſes by the moſt apt and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſymbols, can excite our love; if the richeſt bleſſings which heaven could beſtow, can awaken our gratitude; ſurely this holy feaſt upon the ſacrifice of our Redeemer, muſt have a powerful influence upon our lives. If the moſt ſolemn vows and oaths of fidelity to the great captain of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have any force to bind chriſtians, the ſacred engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we come under by taking this ſacrament, muſt be a ſtrong ſecurity againſt the allurements of vice, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual excitement to perſevere in the paths of virtue. Thus every part of chriſtian worſhip, as preſcribed by its divine author, leads to, and enforces purity of manners, and ſerves to reſtrain men from thoſe vicious courſes, which, in the natural ſtream of things, tend to the deſtruction of civil government. Had we time to enter into a minute compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the chriſtian with other religions, its ſuperior excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021418_0038_0FB3EEA6E7A5F6A0"/>
in this reſpect would appear in the ſtrongeſt light. It cannot be denied, that the worſhip of thoſe heathen nations who have been moſt renowned for their civil policy, not only in many inſtances encouraged, but even conſiſted in the groſſeſt immoralities. This was the caſe among the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Greeks, and Romans. To ſay nothing of the human ſacrifices which they offered up to appeale their angry deities, what were their <hi>myſteries,</hi> but <hi>myſteries</hi> of iniquity? In the celebration of theſe, the fouleſt crimes were perpetrated, and the moſt flagitious luſts indulged, under the covert of darkneſs. Bacchus, Venus and Cupid, were worſhiped with the moſt impure and abominable rights. Female proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, luſt, drunkenneſs, and the wildeſt riot, were not only concomitants, but eſſential conſtituents of their worſhip. The civil magiſtrates of Rome were fully ſenſible of the neceſſary tendency of theſe enormities to corrupt the morals of the people, and of the political evils which flowed from theſe polluted ſources. Accordingly, they endeavoured to obviate them, by enacting ſevere laws for the regulation of the myſteries; but finding theſe inſufficient, the <hi>Orgia</hi> were finally aboliſhed throughout Italy by a decree of the ſenate, A. U. 568. The Eleuſinian myſteries, which were reckoned more pure, continued till the reign of the emperor Theodoſius, and then underwent the fate of all human inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am not ignorant, that ſome chriſtian writers have ſuppoſed the heathen myſteries, particularly the Eleuſinian, to have been originally pure, and deſigned by the civil magiſtrate to correct the pernicious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the commonly received mythology on the morals of the people. The fathers condemn them as impure, and immoral in their original inſtitution; and inſiſt much on the ſhocking enormities practiſed in them under the veil of night. Le Clerk is, I believe, the only author, who contrary to all evidence from antiquity, and for no other reaſon, that I can ſee, but to gratify his ſpleen againſt the fathers, contends that they never were corrupted at all Whatever was the original ſtate of the myſteries, it is enough for me, that in time they became ſuch as they are repreſented above. This is abundantly evident from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then writers themſelves, who complain of their corruption; and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by thoſe chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who contrary to the fathers, have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable opinion of them in their firſt inſtitution.

"The morality of the Goſpel," ſaid the dying Monteſqueiu, "is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing, and the moſt valuable preſent that could poſſibly have been received by man from his creator"</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that thoſe duties which we owe to each other in the ſocial ſtate are dictated by reaſon, and ſo a part of natural religion; and that chriſtianity is therefore of little conſequence in this reſpect; I will not now diſpute the fact, but muſt take the liberty to deny the conſequence. Though it ſhould be granted, that chriſtianity neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins nor forbids any thing in moral practice, which natural religion does not enjoin or forbid, it will not hence follow that chriſtianity is uſeleſs. Thoſe moral duties which our religion inculcates, are indeed agreeable to reaſon, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021418_0040_0FB3EEA9EA2B0370"/>
appear to have a fitneſs and propriety in them, and on this account may be reckoned a part of natural religion. But who will dare to affirm that the whole ſyſtem of what we call NATURAL RELIGION, could be reaſoned out by the moſt enlightened of mortals, without, any aſſiſtance from divine revelation? And even ſuppoſing this were poſſible, there is no ground to believe, that men in general could make the diſcovery in this way; or if they could, there is not the leaſt probability that they would, conſidering their negligence and inattention to ſuch things. Many amongſt us are ignorant of ſome very important duties of natural religion, though revealed to them, and repeatedly inculcated upon them in their bibles. What muſt we then ſuppoſe would be the caſe, if they were left to inveſtigate theſe duties by an intricate chain of reaſoning? It ought alſo to be conſidered, that Chriſtianity is a very important confirmation of natural religion. Here the concluſions of reaſon are corroborated, and rendered more certain by the additional evidence of divine teſtimony. Thoſe miracles and prophecies which were deſigned as a proof of the Chriſtian diſpenſation, are alſo a proof of the truth of natural religion. Thus the dictates of natural light are ratified, if I may ſo expreſs it, by the ſtamp of divine authority, and their truth proclaimed by a voice from heaven. Hence we ſee that the chriſtian ſyſtem of morals is to be conſidered, not barely as the deductions of reaſon; but the deductions of reaſon confirmed by an expreſs revelation from God himſelf, and inculcated by his authoritative command; and therefore ought to have greater weight with us than the meer concluſions of fallible reaſon. Suppoſe a man able to demonſtrate, which I ſuppoſe may be done, though perhaps by few, that it is his duty to love his enemies, would he not reckon it a great confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his concluſion, if at the end of his demonſtration, he ſhould diſcover, that this duty was expreſsly revealed and peremptorily commanded by God himſelf? Would not his reaſonings be much more ſatisfactory to himſelf, and more likely to influence his practice? It hath been often urged, and therefore we ſhall not here inſiſt upon it, that the moſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021418_0041_0FB3EEAB64FF7750"/>
enlightened of the heathens were much in the dark with reſpect to many of thoſe moral duties; the reaſonableneſs and propriety of which are evident to thoſe inſtructed by Chriſtianity. And it is worthy of remark, that theſe very heathens were, perhaps, more indebted to divine revelation than ſome of its enemies are willing to admit. Were this a proper place to enter into ſuch a ſubject, it might be made more than probable, that had they been left to meer reaſon and the light of nature, their morals would have been much more deficient than they are. But our profeſſed deſign will not allow us to enlarge upon theſe things. The few hints thrown out may ſuffice to ſhow, that it does not in the leaſt derogate from the importance of Chriſtianity in the view we are now conſidering it, that its moral precepts coincide with the great <hi>Pandect</hi> of Nature. On the contrary, when theſe precepts thus conformable to the light of nature, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It may perhaps be expected, that in treating this part of my ſubject, I ſhould draw a compariſon between Chriſtian and heathen morality; but as this hath been often done, and the ſuperior excellence of Chriſtian morals fully ſhown, I ſhall content myſelf with treating ſome of thoſe moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſtianity, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h appear to have the moſt direct influence on ſociety. Some occaſional remarks concerning the errors and deficiencies of the heathen moraliſts will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fall in as we paſs along.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That benevolent diſpoſition which Chriſtianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, has a direct tendency to promote the peace and happineſs of men in a ſtate of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity is beyond compariſon the pureſt and moſt extenſive ſyſtem of benevolence which hath ever been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the world. It every where breathes the ſpirit of love, and inculcates the laws of kindneſs and humanity. That good will towards men which it requires is univerſal,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021418_0042_0FB3EEACE63EA640"/>
and embraces the whole human race. It is not confined to the narrow circle of friends and relations, but extends even to enemies. The precept of our Savior which requires us to love, do good to, and pray for our enemies, is peculiar to Chriſtianity; at leaſt we do not find it ſo expreſsly taught, and particularly enforced, by any other religion. The Jews entertained an implacable hatred againſt all thoſe who were not of their own nation and religion. Their male-volence to all but their own brethren, was ſo remarkable, that the heathens have taken notice of it. "Their fidelity," ſays Tacitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, "is inviolable, and their pity ready towards each other; but to all others they bear a mortal hatred." The apoſtle Paul, a more impartial judge, gives them the ſame character. "They pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men." They even thought themſelves at liberty to indulge their malice againſt private enemies of their own nation. Though the precepts of their law, rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, were far from allowing ſuch a malevolent diſpoſition, it is certain that by their corrupt interpretations, they drew this inference from them. And it muſt be confeſſed, that the god-like duty of loving our enemies, was not ſo clearly revealed, and ſo expreſsly inculcated, under the Jewiſh, as under the Chriſtian diſpenſation. Here we have it enforced by the nobleſt of all conſiderations, namely, the reſemblance it gives us to the deity, who indiſcriminately ſhowers down the common bleſſings of his providence, both on his friends and enemies. The bloody and vindictive ſpirit of the Mahometan religion is well known. Grotius has empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically characterized it in a few words. "Mahometis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio in armis nata, nihil ſpirat niſi arma, armis propagatur." "The religion of Mahomet originated in arms, breathes nothing but arms, is propagated by arms." The civil inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Greeks, particularly thoſe of Sparta, were principally directed to war. Conqueſt, rapine, blood-ſhed, triumph, were their chief aim. To rob and plunder their neighbors was ſo far from being reckoned infamous among them, that they gloried in it. And it is worthy of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that theſe inſtitutions were admired by their phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021418_0043_0FB3EEAE684EE0D0"/>
and approved by their oracles. Ariſtotle is not aſhamed to affirm, "That war with barbarians is natural." The Romans were little better than the robbers and butchers of the world. Their fame, wealth, power, and grandeur, aroſe principally from the conqueſt and ſpoils of thoſe whom they made or found their enemies. They were ſo infamous for their unjuſt wars and public robberies, that Cicero himſelf ſcruples not to declare, "that if every one had his own, they muſt return to their old cottages." In a word, the many inſtances of flagrant injuſtice and cruelty publicly approved both by the Greeks and Romans, ſhow, that they had ſcare any idea of that univerſal benevolence, that humane, gentle and peaceable diſpoſition, which the precepts of our religion ſo ſtrongly recommend and enforce<note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt be confeſſed, that Chriſtian nations have, in many inſtances, ſhown too little regard to the ſpirit of their religion, in the wars they have commenced and carried on. They have often been cruel and unjuſt, contrary to that humane and peaceable diſpoſition enjoined by the goſpel. It cannot, however, be denied, that Chriſtianity hath had a conſiderable influence on men, and laid them under great reſtraints in this reſpect. The hiſtory of Europe evidently ſhows how much it tends to check the ferocity and ſoften the rugged manners of thoſe nations who embrace it. If I miſtake not, it produced a remarkable change on the Roman empire. We do not find the ſame cruel and ſanguinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition prevailing after it became Chriſtian. War is diveſted of half its horrors by the mild and gentle ſpirit of Chriſtianity.</note>. War was their trade, and their religion reſtrained them from nothing which they imagined might extend their empire and increaſe their power. Some of the heathen moraliſts have told us that faith is to be kept with an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>emy; and that injuries ſhould be forgiven, on the repentance and acknowledgement of the offender; but I do not recollect that one of them before the Chriſtian aera, requires men to love thoſe who are in a ſtate of actual enmity with them. To do good to ſuch, to pray for them, and promote their happineſs, is a pitch of philanthropy, to which Chriſtianity alone teaches us to aſpire. How much ſuch a diſpoſition tends to the peace and happineſs of men in the ſocial ſtate, is obvious at firſt view. Love is the great cement of ſociety, and a principal bond of union among its members. As
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021418_0044_0FB3EEAFEA9CFF20"/>
malice, hatred, envy, and all the inimical paſſions, naturally tend to diſunite men, and deſtroy that concord, which is the greateſt ſtrength and ſecurity of government; ſo mutual love ſweetly and powerfully attracts and binds them to each other. He who loves his neighbor as himſelf, and ſincerely deſires his happineſs, needs no other motive to excite him to the moſt exact and careful performance of all the ſocial duties. A heart overflowing with benevolence to our fellow-men will be a more powerful reſtraint from injury, and a ſtronger excitement to beneficence, than all the terror of civil laws. This noble and generous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple will operate uniformly and efficaciouſly; and by an internal, ſecret impulſe, direct and ſpur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us on to a careful obſervance of all the laws of kindneſs and humanity. Prompted by an ardent wiſh to promote the happineſs of all around us, we will perform every kind office with a pleaſure and facility unknown to a narrow and ſelfiſh mind. We will often forget or over-look our own intereſt to oblige a friend, to vindicate the innocent, relieve the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed and ſuccour the miſerable. He who is conformed to the temper, governed by the precepts, and influenced by the example of the benevolent Jeſus, will, like the good Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, pour balm even into the wounds of an enemy; will feed him when hungry, cloath him when naked, return him good for evil, and bleſſing for curſing. In a word, that unbounded benevolence which Chriſtianity requires, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily leads to the performance of all the duties of charity, hoſpitality, gratitude, mercy and compaſſion, which we have ſhown human laws cannot enforce, and which are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs neceſſary to the peace and happineſs of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Let it be further obſerved here, that Chriſtianity not only enjoins meekneſs and benevolence, but expreſsly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns a contrary diſpoſition. A malicious and vindictive temper is directly oppoſite to the precepts of the goſpel. Hear the apoſtle Paul on this ſubject, "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourſelves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is mine; I will repay, ſaith the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021418_0045_0FB3EEB1D5177D88"/>
Lord. Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink; for, in ſo doing, thou ſhalt heap coals of fire upon his head." This is perfectly conſiſtent with the precepts and example of his meek and heavenly maſter, who teaches us to expect forgiveneſs only, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that we forgive others. "But if you do not forgive neither will your father, who is in heaven, forgive your treſpaſſes." The ſame precept and example is illuſtrated and enforced, with incomparable ſtrength and beauty, in the parable of the debtors and creditors, Mat. 18. from the 23d verſe to the cloſe.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh doctors, by ſtretching the law of retaliation for perſonal injuries beyond its original deſign, gave too much countenance to private revenge. They enjoined it upon men as their duty to inſiſt upon retaliation; and even went ſo far as to pronounce it lawful, in many caſes, for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſon to avenge himſelf, provided his revenge did not exceed the due meaſure. This was an evident abuſe of the law, which only empowered the judges to give an eye for an eye, or a tooth for a tooth, if the injured party demanded it. Our ſavior teaches a more excellent morality, and a more heroic pitch of meekneſs and patience. "Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth; but I ſay unto you, that you reſiſt not evil; but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other alſo; and if any man will ſue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo." Here our Saviour not only condemns the corrupt gloſſes of the Jewiſh Doctors; but, as is plain from the general ſtrain of his language, forbids Chriſtians ſome things which were permitted to the Jews under a more imperfect diſpenſation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Tertull.

Some of them approve of revenge, others condemn it<note n="*" place="bottom">Socrates, Plato, Maximus, Tyrius, Seneca, and ſome others of leſs note, condemn revenge; particularly the laſt, who ſeems to have had the fulleſt and cleareſt notions on this ſubject, for which he was perhaps indebted to Chriſtianity, Ariſtotle is plainly on the other ſide, and Tully, as is uſual with him, wavers. In his offices and his oration for Ligarius, he ſpeaks much in favor of clemency and a mild forgiving ſpirit; but, in one of his epiſtles to Atticus, he thus lays open his heart: "Odi hominem et odero: utinam ulciſei poſſem."</note>. In this, as well as in moſt other points of morality, they were much divided, and advanced ſentiments repugnant to each other. How well ſoever ſome of them may have ſpoken on this ſubject, it is plain that our duty in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect is pointed out by Chriſt and his apoſtles with much greater clearneſs and preciſion, and enforced with an energy and authority, much better adapted to influence the minds of men, than in any of their writings. How favorable this influence is to civil ſociety, and how commodiouſly it falls in with the intention of human laws, will appear from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Private revenge is utterly repugnant to the principles, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the nature and end of civil ſociety, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned by the laws of all wiſely conſtituted and well regulated governments<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The judgement of zeal among the Jews and the law reſpecting the avenger of blood, may perhaps be reckoned exceptions. As to the firſt, I am clear, it was not founded on ſcripture, in that latitude the Jews ſuppoſed. This I think muſt be evident to any one who reads the account given of it by Philo and Joſephus. To what execrable purpoſes it was applied, appears plain from the many attempts made on the life of our Savior, the ſtoning of Stephen, and the diabolical conſpiracy againſt the apoſtle Paul; for in theſe and many other inſtances which might be mentioned, it appears to me moſt probable, that they proceeded under this pretence. The law concerning apoſtates to idolatry, which the Jews tell us was firſt executed by Phineas, gave riſe to the judgment of zeal. But it cannot be made appear from that law, as it lies in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that even idolaters were to be put to death without a previous trial: an enquiry was to be inſtituted, and witneſſes ſummoned. The caſe of Phineas was extraordinary; and whatever opinion we form of it, could not be deſigned by God to authorize every Jew to put to death, without delay, or any form of legal proceſs, thoſe who did or ſaid any thing diſhonorable to his religion. As to the Jewiſh law which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a relation to take vengeance on the man-ſlaver, it was greatly moderated, and the ſanguinary effects of it guarded againſt by the aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums appointed for ſuch as had been guilty of accidental homicide; for the avenger of blood was not at liberty to attack the homicide in his ſanctuary. The deſign of it was not to encourage men in a vindictive temper; but to inſpire them with a horror of bloodſhed; for by the riſk which they ran from the relations of the ſlain, and the hardſhip of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of a fellow citizen. However, if any one think this an exception to the above general aſſertion, I will not obſtinately contend the matter here, for I am ready to allow there are ſome exceptions. The laws of Sparta gave the <hi>Ephori</hi> the right of putting perſons to death without a trial. By a law of Solon, a huſband who caught his wife in adultery, was at liberty to ſlay the adulterer on the ſpot. In ſome governments maſters and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nts have been allowed the power of life and death over their ſlaves and children. But whether theſe laws were wiſe and ſalutary in any government, is a matter I very much doubt. They are, I think, reprobated by all Chriſtian ſtates.</p>
                  <p>To prevent objections, I would further obſerve on this ſubject, that there are ſome extraordinary caſes in which the laws of England admit an extra-judicial remedy, and allow a redreſs of injury by the mere act of the party injured. Among theſe judge Blackſtone reckons ſelf-defence, recaption, abatement of nuiſances, diſtreſs for rent and cattle <hi>damage-feaſant,</hi> with ſome others. The firſt of theſe is for the prevention rather than redreſs of wrong; for if the defender go further than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for defence and prevention, the law conſiders him as an aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. The laſt is not ſo properly redreſs as the means of obtaining redreſs in a legal way; unleſs it be where the <hi>diſtreſs</hi> is retained for compelling ſatisfaction. Recaption indeed is, in a proper ſenſe, redreſs; and removal of nuiſances ſeems deſigned both for redreſs and prevention. Yet, even in theſe, the perſons aggrieved act under the reſtraint and direction of law. Recaption muſt be without force or terror; nuiſances muſt be removed peaceably and without any riot. But notwithſtanding theſe and ſome other inſtances, in which, on account of ſome peculiar circumſtances, a well regulated ſociety may permit a kind of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial redreſs, I have not ſcrupled to affirm in general, that in a ſtate of civil ſociety, men are not at liberty to miniſter redreſs to themſelves; and I have inſiſted the more largely on this, becauſe ſince the cloſe of the war, I find many of my countrymen too much diſpoſed to take the puniſhment of offenders into their own hands—a mode of proceeding which directly tends to diſſolve our government, and reduce us to a ſtate of nature.</p>
               </note>. No man in a ſtate of civil ſociety
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021418_0047_0FB3EEB468514DE8"/>
at liberty to retaliate an injury, or take ſatisfaction of an offender by his own hand, and in a private way. In a well
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:021418_0048_0FB3EEB5E5F75C40"/>
regulated government the power of judging and puniſhing in our caſe is taken from us. Laws are framed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the criminality of injuries done by one individual to another, and to fix the kind of puniſhment to be inflicted. Theſe laws are put into the hands of perſons ſuppoſed to be indifferent, to be carried into execution; and to theſe we are to appeal for redreſs of injuries. According to the principles of civil ſociety therefore, it is criminal to take the puniſhment of an offender into our own hands, though we be never ſo much wronged. The wiſdom and neceſſity of this plan is obvious. One principal reaſon why men cannot ſubſiſt in a ſtate of nature, is their propenſity too highly to reſent, and too ſeverely to puniſh, every real or imaginary injury. Men are very improper judges in their own caſe. That pride, that ſelfiſhneſs, and falſe opinion of their own importance, which is natural to them, render them wholly unfit to determine the real demerit of injuries done to themſelves. It is ſcarcely poſſible for any man entirely to diveſt himſelf of all partiality in a caſe where he is nearly concerned. Men of the moſt fair and upright minds are generally prejudiced in favor of their own relations and connections; much more then muſt they be partial to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and this partiality utterly diſqualifies them from being proper judges, where they are parties.— Hence we ſee the impropriety of allowing men in a ſtate of civil ſociety to judge in their own caſe, and retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate as they may think proper. This is the buſineſs of the common judge conſtituted by ſociety, and to be done agreeably to certain fixed laws, framed by common conſent, for the redreſs of injuries. To this judge therefore, and theſe laws, we muſt appeal when we are injured. He, therefore, who takes upon him to retaliate an injury as he thinks fit, and to puniſh the offender without ſuch appeal, is guilty of an outrage on civil government, and ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the laws of ſociety. The reader will pleaſe to

Men of a revengeful and malicious diſpoſition may find a thouſand ways to gratify their reſentment and ruin their neighbors, without the leaſt danger of puniſhment from human laws. An innocent man may be robbed of his eſtate, and what is much more valuable, of his reputation, without being able to obtain the leaſt legal redreſs. In a word, infinite miſchief may be done to ſociety by deeds of revenge, which the laws of man can neither take cognizance of nor puniſh. But Chriſtianity forbids all ſuch acts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the temper from which they ariſe, and refers the puniſhment of them to that almighty and omniſcient Being, to whom belongeth vengeance.</p>
            <p>He who hath felt the power of religion on his heart, and governs his life and temper by the precepts of the goſpel, carefully watches againſt every emotion of revenge; much more then will he guard againſt ſuffering it to break our in thoſe actions which may be injurious to his fellow-citizens, even though he may have the proſpect of eſcaping with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity

from men. He delights in the proſperity, not in the pain and miſery of others; and feels himſelf conſtrained by an obligation more powerful than all laws, to ſhun whatever may be hurtful to his neighbor, and detrimental to the public tranquility. When he contemplates the example of the meek and lowly Jeſus, who, "When he was reviſed, reviled not again;" and who poured our an ardent prayer for his enemies, even when they were ſhedding his blood; how does it animate him to ſubdue his reſentment, and crucify every inimical paſſion! He does not ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported with wrath on every ſlight affront; but bears injuries with pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, conquers by yielding, and ſhows himſelf ſuperior to his enemies by a meek, humble and forgiving ſpirit. If, at any time, he ſees it abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for his own ſecurity, and the preſervation of peace and good order in ſociety, to reſent injury, he will do it from a ſenſe of duty, and not to gratify a malicious and vindictive temper. He will not attempt to redreſs injuries by taking private vengeance on the aggreſſor; but appeal to the laws for his vindication: and even in this, he will diſcover a meek and quiet ſpirit, which ſhows, that he is not prompted by a deſire of revenge, but a regard to juſtice and public good. If redreſs cannot be obtained in this way, he ſuffers wrong, and appeals to him who will ſooner or later vindicate the innocent and puniſh the guilty.</p>
            <p>If we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll thus conformed to the precepts of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, what a happy ſociety would we be! We would not ſee ſuch fierce contentions, ſo much ſtrife and animoſity, ſo many inſtances of mutual injury and revenge, ſo much legal wrangling, and ſo many tedious and expenſive law ſuits. If men who call themſelves Chriſtians, would conſider the happy tendency, and liſten to the rational dictates, of their religion, we would not ſee ſuch tragical effects from ſlight affronts and petty provocations; nor hear of ſo much blood wantonly laviſhed, by that barbarous, <hi>Gothic</hi> cuſtom of <hi>Duelling,</hi> which prevails among ſome of our high-ſpirited gentlemen. This cuſtom, ſo pernicious to civil ſociety, and ſo directly oppoſite to the mild ſpirit of our religion, would
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:021418_0051_0FB3EEBA6665AE70"/>
be totally aboliſhed. I have been often ſurprized that men who pique themſelves on their humanity and politeneſs, never reflect, that this practice is no refinement of modern times, but was brought into Europe by thoſe fierce northern boors, who over-ran the Roman empire. The civilized heathens, the polite Greeks and warlike Romans, were ſtrangers to this abſurd, barbarous cuſtom. They reckoned it glorious to die for their country; but never ſacrificed each other in cold blood to the little punctilios of honor. The prevalence of this practice in Chriſtian countries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the laws of religion, as well as reaſon and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is one of the ſtrongeſt proofs of the amazing force of cuſtom on the human mind.</p>
            <p>To conclude this particular,—as Chriſtianity ſurpaſſes all other religions in that meek, gentle and forgiving ſpirit which it requires: ſo it muſt be, of all others, the beſt adapted to preſerve peace among men, and promote the happineſs of civil ſociety.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That ſtrict regard to juſtice which the precepts of Chriſtianity enjoin, is of the greateſt importance to civil government.</p>
            <p>The practice of juſtice is eſſential, not only to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but to the exiſtence of civil ſociety. The ſocial union cannot ſubſiſt without ſome degree of it. It is the proper, and in a large ſenſe, one might venture to ſay, the only object of civil laws. But although human laws are, in a manner, wholly occupied in preventing or puniſhing injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, there are innumerable inſtances of it, which they can by no means reach. Experience daily teaches us, how eaſy it is for men of craſty and deſigning natures to evade the force of laws. The moſt flagrant acts of injuſtice may be committed, and the moſt ſcandalous fraud carried on, under umbrage of the beſt human laws. An artful villain may rob the widow and the fatherleſs, and be guilty of the moſt cruel oppreſſions; and yet "ſo deeply intrench himſelf behind the <hi>letter</hi> of the <hi>law,</hi> and ſo well fortify himſelf with <hi>caſes</hi> and <hi>reports,</hi> that there is no coming at him." It is needleſs to enlarge here. Every one who will give himſelf
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021418_0052_0FB3EEBBE605C3C0"/>
the trouble of thinking on this ſubject, muſt be ſenſible, that the commerce of men in a ſtate of ſocie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, admits of ſo many different modifications, and that ſo many unexpected circumſtances often ariſe, from the various methods of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and transferring property, that no laws can be framed ſo as to comprehend every caſe which may occur. This ſhows the imperfection of civil laws, even with reſpect to thoſe things which are moſt in their power; and at the ſame time demonſtrates the importance of religion to enforce the obſervance of ſtrict juſtice.</p>
            <p>The precepts of Chriſtianity require the ſtricteſt regard to juſtice in all its branches. All thoſe acts of fraud and injuſtice which are prohibited by the laws of ſociety, are alſo prohibited by the precepts of our religion. The Chriſtian, therefore, who is influenced by thoſe precepts, is under a two-fold obligation to reſtrain him from all acts of injuſtice: one ariſing from the laws of his country, the other from the laws of his religion; and the latter not only tends to facilitate the execution of the former, but often prevents the neceſſity of their exertion. He who is bound by the obligation of religion, ſuperadded to that of human laws, is more likely to practiſe the rules of juſtice, than he who is influenced only by a regard to thoſe laws.</p>
            <p>But this is not all: Our religion goes further, and extends to all thoſe acts of injuſtice, which are beyond the reach of human laws, and cannot be puniſhed by them. That theſe are numerous, even where juſtice is moſt carefully and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially adminiſtered, is matter of univerſal experience. And that they are injurious to civil government, by creating the bittereſt animoſities among fellow-citizens; ſtirring up ſtrife, malice, hatred, and ſo deſtroying that mutual love and confidence, which are neceſſary to hold men together in the ſocial ſtate, is too plain to need any proof. As far, therefore, as Chriſtianity reſtrains men from theſe acts of injuſtice, ſo far it muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end to the benefit of ſociety.</p>
            <p>The precepts of Chriſtianity, which reſpect the practice of juſtice, are given in the moſt univerſal terms—"What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are juſt;" theſe the Chriſtian is commanded to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021418_0053_0FB3EEBD63F1D7E0"/>
practiſe. "All things, whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them." This precept of our Savior, on account of its excellence, is called the <hi>golden rule.</hi> It is conciſe and eaſily remembered, plain and eaſily underſtood; comprehenſive, and <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> applies to all men, at all times, and in all circumſtances. It is a portable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, if I may ſo expreſs it, which every man may carry in his own breaſt. It is an unanſwerable appeal to the feelings of every man, and carries immediate conviction to the mind; enforcing and awakening, by the authority of heaven, thoſe natural ſentiments of juſtice, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on our hearts. He who believes the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and duly feels the force of theſe and ſuch-like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our religion, will pay a ſacred regard to the practice of juſtice in its various branches. He will be honeſt and upright in all his dealings, faithful to his truſt, and give to every man his due. Where the laws are ſilent, he finds a rule of right and ſtandard of equity in his own breaſt, which points out the fair line of conduct he ought to purſue. He will not impoſe upon the ignorance and ſimplicity, or take advantage of, the open and unſuſpecting temper of his neighbor. He does nor lie in wait to ſeize every open door, which the imperfection of civil laws may give him, to invade the property of others. It is not enough for him that he can evade the force of civil laws, and eſcape puniſhment from men, while the laws of religion and his own conſcience co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>emn him of injuſtice. His fair, open and upright mind, abhors all thoſe little low acts of chicane and knavery, which they who regulate their conduct only by human laws ſo often employ, to over-reach, rob and ruin the honeſt and the unwary. He has a higher ſtandard, and a more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate rule of action, which reſtrains him from all unfair and fraudulent dealings, all diſhoneſt ſhifts and unequitable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges If ſuch a temper as this were generally prevalent amongſt us, what a deſirable effect would it have! How much would it tend to promote peace and concord; and of conſequence the happineſs of our ſtate! We would not then ſee ſo many diſputes about property, and ſo much
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:021418_0054_0FB3EEBEE4CC8840"/>
money given to the gentlemen of the bar, to decide our quarrels; nor hear ſo many curſes poured our upon them. If the precepts of Chriſtianity had that influence upon us, which their excellence naturally leads us to expect, there would be little need of that order of men, who are now ſo generally, I will not ſay how juſtly, the objects of envy and execration among us. Were I permitted to ſpeak my mind freely on this ſubject, I would ſay, that generally ſpeaking, people ought to blame themſelves for ſuffering theſe men to drain them of their caſh. If they were of that temper which becometh Chriſtians, they would not ſo frequently fall into contentions, or take ſome other method of compromiſing them, which might be more cheap and eligible. They might refer the deciſion of them to a few honeſt and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial neighbors, who are acquainted with the merits of the cauſe; which they are often obliged to do, after they have ſpent their time, and emptied their purſes by a tedious ſuit at law.</p>
            <p>But I have not room here to point out the many happy conſequences which would flow from that ſtrict regard to the practice of juſtice, which our religion inculcates. Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the judicious reader to trace them in his own mind, we proceed to make ſome obſervations concerning that religious adherence to truth, which the precepts of Chriſtianity enjoin. This is an important branch of juſtice, and very properly comes in here.</p>
            <p>How excellent ſoever the rules which the heathen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts have laid down for the practice of juſtice, they appear to have been very defective in this particular. It is not eaſy indeed to reconcile them to each other, or even to themſelves, on this point. Plato in ſome places condemns lying; in others, he ſeems plainly to approve of it. But the moſt general opinion, as far as I can find from their writings, was, that lies are admiſſible, where there is a proſpect of advantage<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"He may lie," ſays Plato, "who knows how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <p>"There is nothing comely in truth," ſays Maximus Tyrius, "but when it is profitable. And ſometimes a lie profits and truth hurts men." Plato and the Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es framed a kind of Jeſuitical diſtinction on this head, making a difference between lying in words and in the ſoul, or with aſſent to a falſhoud The wiſe man was admitted to lie craftily and with a proſpect of gain; but not to embrace falſhood through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. What a door ſuch doctrines open to fraud and deceit, and how deſtructive they are of confidence among men, is ſufficiently evident.</p>
               </note>. At leaſt, all their moſt eminent
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021418_0055_0FB3EEC0665DFDB0"/>
philoſophers held it as an undoubted maxim, that it was lawful, and even a duty, to lie for the public good. Cicero is ſo clear in this, upon the authority of Plato, that he pronounces it <hi>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as,</hi> a horrid wickedneſs, not to do it. This concluſion ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe from another equally falſe, namely, that <hi>truth and general utility do not coincide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtianity grants no ſuch licence, but condemns every ſpecies of falſhood, and inculcates the moſt ſacred regard to truth in all circumſtances whatſoever. "Lie not one to another. Putting away lying, ſpeak every man the truth with his neighbor." I ſuppoſe it will be readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that a ſtrict adherence to truth, eſpecially in ſuch promiſes and declarations as reſpect the intereſt of others, is of no ſmall conſequence to ſociety. It certainly tends to beget and maintain that mutual confidence which hath been always reckoned one principal bond of the ſocial union.— This is evident from the pernicious effects which we daily experience from an oppoſite conduct. Nothing hath a greater tendency to plant diſtruſt and ſuſpicion in the hearts of men, deſtroy mutual love, and ſtir up malignant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the practice of falſhood and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. It is therefore of the greateſt importance in ſociety, that men ſhould be laid under all poſſible reſtraints in this reſpect. If they were left at liberty to depart from the truth in ſome particular caſes, and on ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſions, for their own advantage, or even for the good of others, what would be the conſequence? Would it not neceſſarily tend to annihilate all faith in every ſuch caſe? If men univerſally thought it lawful to lie in certain given circumſtances, no one would be credited in thoſe circumſtances; becauſe he would not be conſidered, as
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:021418_0056_0FB3EEC1E747E880"/>
any obligation to ſpeak the truth. All faith in the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of others depends on the ſuppoſition of a general obligation to truth. Take away this ſuppoſition, and there is at once an end of all confidence. So that lying, in all ſuch circumſtances, would defeat its own purpoſe, and would be no advantage, either to ourſelves or others. It ought therefore to be reckoned a peculiar excellence of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that its precepts afford not the leaſt encouragement to ſuppoſe it allowable, in any caſe whatſoever, to ſwerve from the truth. Had Chriſtianity granted any ſuch permiſſion, it might be made an objection againſt it, as giving counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to a practice detrimental to civil government.</p>
            <p>If the religious obſervance of truth, in our ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, be of ſo much importance in ſociety, much more muſt this be the caſe in our ſolemn oaths. Here alſo the excellence of Chriſtian morality is apparent. "O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laws," ſaith the learned Grotius, "forbid perjury, but this requires us to abſtain even from an oath without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and ſo to cultivate truth in all our words, that an oath may not be required of us." The precepts of Chriſtianity are ſo ſtrict in this particular, that ſome Chriſtians of weak and ſcrupulous minds, have ſuppoſed they prohibit all oaths. But this is a very erroneous concluſion. It might be eaſily ſhown, were it thought neceſſary, that they contain no ſuch prohibition. Thoſe who raiſe ſuch ſcruples, little conſider how much they wrong Chriſtianity. It would be a ſad reflection on our religion, if it condemned the uſe of ſolemn oaths, which are ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the adminiſtration of government, and one of the beſt means for the ſpeedy deciſion of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which tend to the deſtruction of ſociety. But though Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity does not forbid us to ſwear in a ſolemn manner, when legally called to it, it enjoins great caution in this matter; and teaches us not to be precipitate in making ſuch a ſolemn appeal, where the importance of the caſe does not evidently demand it. Thus the precepts of our religion conduct us ſafely between two extremes, guarding us on the one ſide from perjury, and on the other from that ſuperſtitious timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity which would lead us to omit a duty that we owe to ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:021418_0057_0FB3EEC3645F0CE8"/>Perjury is, in itſelf, a crime ſo horrid, and at the ſame time ſo pernicious to government, that it ought to be guarded againſt with the utmoſt care. It is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore, that men ſhould be reſtrained from every thing that tends this way. Lying, profane ſwearing, and even a needleſs and too frequent uſe of lawful oaths, have this tendency: and as all theſe are prohibited by the precepts of Chriſtianity, thoſe precepts muſt be one of the greateſt ſecurities againſt perjury; and of conſequence ſingularly uſeful to government. A little attention to human nature may convince us that a needleſs repetition of oaths, tends to leſſen their ſolemnity. By being often uſed they become familiar, and are not attended with that awe and reverence which ought to ſtrike the mind in a tranſaction ſo very ſolemn. And when men are but little impreſſed with a ſenſe of the majeſty and preſence of the Deity, they will not pay that ſacred regard to truth, which might otherwiſe be expected. Hence flows a political maxim of no ſmall utility in government; namely, that oaths ſhould be admitted in as few caſes as poſſible, and adminiſtered with all thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſolemnity which are beſt adapted to fill the mind with awe and reverence."<note n="*" place="bottom">I have often obſerved with much concern, the method in which juries are qualified in our courts of juſtice. No good reaſon, I think, can be given for the uſual practice of ſwearing them previouſly to every trial. It appears to me a needleſs repetition of oaths, which neceſſarily takes off from their ſolemnity. Would it not be much more eligible to qualify our juries once for all, at the commencement of the ſeſſion? I take the liberty alſo to obſerve here, that oaths are not adminiſtered in our courts with that ſolemnity which their nature requires. The clerk, with a vacant face and careleſs air, chymes over the words of the oath, without any emphaſis of expreſſion, or ſolemnity of manner, ſuitable to the occaſion. The ſame marks of negligence and inattention may be often obſerved in the countenance of the deponent. To a ſpectator there appears nothing ſerious, nothing ſolemn in the whole tranſaction. One great cauſe of this I take to be a too frequent and unneceſſary uſe of oaths, which tends to turn them into meer farces. Theſe obſervations may perhaps be thought trifling by ſome; but to a thinking perſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>othing will appear ſo which ſerves to guard againſt perjury.</note> As to the abſurd and impious practice of PROFANE SWEARING, which ſo much prevails
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021418_0058_0FB3EEC4EB121B98"/>
amongſt us, it evidently tends to baniſh all fear of God from the minds of men, and of conſequence leads directly to perjury. The leaſt reflection may convince us of this. It is reaſonable to expect, that an impious wretch who is daily invoking the vengeance of Heaven on himſelf and others, and who confirms every petty aſſeveration, whether true or falſe, by the addition of the <hi>ſacred name;</hi> is it reaſonable, I ſay, to expect that ſuch an one ſhould have a proper ſenſe of the ſolemnity of an oath, or any ſuitable dread of perjury? Muſt it not be allowed that, other things being equal, the teſtimony of a man who makes conſcience of taking God's name in vain, has much greater weight, and deſerves more credit? It is, in a manner, ſelf-evident, that an habitual profanation of God's holy name by impious oaths and curſes, muſt tend to leſſen that awe and reverence of him, which is one of the ſtrongeſt guards againſt perjury, and conſequently muſt be in a high degree injurious to civil ſociety. Hence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of reſtraining and puniſhing it by civil laws. If this practice were only an offence againſt God, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſhould be referred to him alone; but as it is not only a daring impiety, but alſo productive of effects baneful to the ſtate, and detrimental to public good, the civil magiſtrate ought to take notice of and reſtrain it by civil penalties. Indeed, every man who wiſhes well to his country ſhould make it his buſineſs to diſcountenance this vice, which is now become ſo common amongſt us. It is the <hi>opprobrium</hi> of South Carolina; and together with our other national crimes, likely to call down the vengeance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon us. If gentlemen, whoſe wealth and rank give them reſpectability, would conſpire, and by their influence and example, diſcountenance this <hi>dialect</hi> of <hi>devils,</hi> it might, in a great meaſure, be baniſhed from among us. But while men of the firſt figure, whoſe commanding manners have ſuch a mighty influence on all the inferior ranks, lead the way; and thoſe who have a principal hand in making and executing our laws, are too often chargeable with a breach of them by the practice of common ſwearing, we are not to expect much effect from the operation of our laws againſt
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021418_0059_0FB3EEC6EB4D57A8"/>
profaneneſs. Indeed theſe laws are ſo ſeldom put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they might almoſt as well be expunged from our code. If a juſtice of the peace, in compliance with his oath, ſhould attempt to puniſh profane ſwearing, he would, in many parts of our ſtate, make himſelf ridiculous. It is with regret I mention theſe things. But they are as true, as they are lamentable; and in the mind of every thoughtful man, who wiſhes well to religion and his country, portend no ſmall evils. In truth, if the principles and precepts of religion are not ſufficient to reſtrain men from falſhood, profanity, perjury, and other enormities of this nature, we cannot expect much aid from civil laws, which, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted ever ſo faithfully, can ſeldom puniſh crimes of this ſort. However, if men have ſo far thrown off all fear of God, that no ſenſe of religion can deter them from this da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they profeſs themſelves lovers of their <hi>country</hi> and friends to <hi>public happineſs,</hi> let them act a conſiſtent part, from political motives if no other, and diſcountenance a practice which tends to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That temperance and moderation which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſtianity require, are of great importance to civil ſociety, and evidently tend to promote public good.</p>

It is too plain to need any proof, that by far the greater part of thoſe evils which diſturb ſociety, flow from the inordinate appetites and ungoverned paſſions of men.

The principal deſign, therefore, of civil laws, is to check the fury of exorbitant appetite, reſtrain the unruly paſſions, and keep them within the bounds which reaſon and common good require. How imperfectly they anſwer this deſign, and how much they need the aid of religion for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the experience of all ages is a ſufficient proof. All the reſtraint which civil government can lay upon the paſſions, is by prohibiting and pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhing ſome of their moſt dangerous effects: but religion, by enjoining a due govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our appetites, teaches us to eradicate from our minds the very cauſe of thoſe effects. <hi>That</hi> only lops off ſome of the moſt noxious branches; <hi>this</hi> ſtrikes at the root: <hi>that</hi> only counteracts or diverts the ſtreams; <hi>this</hi> dries up the fountain.</p>
            <p>Temperance is a very comprehenſive virtue; and, as enjoined by Chriſtianity, not only requires a certain mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking;</hi> but in all thoſe affections, purſuits and enjoyments, which are liable to become faulty by exceſs. He who profeſſes to govern his life by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the goſpel, muſt be temperate in all things. His moderation muſt be conſpicuous to all, and viſible in the whole of his deportment. Thus exhorts the inſpired Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: "Let your moderation be known to all men." But though our religion ſo ſtrictly prohibits all kinds of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, it allows us a free uſe of the gifts of Providence, and deprives us of no pleaſure or enjoyment, which is not injurious to ourſelves, or prejudicial to others. The Stoic Philoſophers, who have ſaid ſo many excellent things on temperance, and whoſe morality, in the opinion of Jerome, came neareſt to the Chriſtian, abſurdly taught that the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021418_0061_0FB3EEC966A64980"/>
paſſions ought to be wholly eradicated. According to them, all the tender emotions of love and pity, all the ſweet ſenſibilities, and melting affections of nature, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, as unworthy of a philoſopher. Thus, before men can become wiſe and virtuous, they muſt diveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all the tender feelings of humanity, and be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into ſtatues. How much more excellent and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable the precepts of Chriſtianity! They require us not to eradicate, but to govern and regulate our paſſions, in ſuch a manner, as is moſt worthy of the dignity, and moſt conducive to the perfection and felicity of rational creatures. They point out the objects on which we ought to fix them, the degree in which they ſhould be indulged, and ſhow their due balance and ſubordination. Were it poſſible for men to bring themſelves to that total inſenſibility, which was the pride and boaſt of the Stoic, it would deprive them of a great part of that happineſs which they derive from a reciprocal exchange of kind affections and mutual offices of love, which conſtitutes one of the principal bonds, as well as chief felicities of ſocial life. How well ſoever the doctrines of the Stoics in general were calculated to form the good citizen, the <hi>dogma</hi> we are now ſpeaking of, not to mention other parodoxes which they held, was far from being favorable to ſociety. Had the <hi>retortion</hi> of nature permitted their much deſired <hi>apathy,</hi> they would have made very aukward members of the community. Reaſon is too weak to rouſe men to that vigor and activity, which are neceſſary for the diſcharge of the ſocial duties. The impulſe of the paſſions is therefore requiſite, and they are implanted in us for this purpoſe. The veſſel which is ſtripped of its ſails, though the rudder be ever ſo good, is not likely to reach the port. What fails are to a ſhip, paſſions are to the man. Let them be under the conduct of reaſon; give them the due tone; keep them within the bounds of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which Chriſtianity preſcribes, and they will invariably tend to ſocial happineſs. Thus tempered and reſtrained, they are a principal ſource of ſocial enjoyment, give the neceſſary ſpring and energy to civil life, and impel us only
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021418_0062_0FB3EECAE7624680"/>
to ſuch actions and purſuits, as ſerve at once to promote both private and public good. Hence we ſee how far the morality of the goſpel ſurpaſſes that of the <hi>Porch,</hi> the moſt celebrated, and indeed the moſt perfect, to be found among the heathen ſages. It is more conformable to the conſtitution of our nature, better adapted to our preſent condition, and hath a greater tendency to promote the ends of civil government.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it will be readily acknowledged, that drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gluttony and lawleſs luſt, not to mention many other evil conſequences which flow from them, enervate the body, debaſe the mind, and tend to unfit us for the diſcharge of thoſe duties which we owe to ſociety. As far, therefore, as the precepts of Chriſtianity reſtrain men from theſe vices, ſo far they muſt be uſeful to government. We have no laws, at leaſt none which operate, for the puniſhment of drunkenneſs, though it is detrimental to the ſtate, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing diſeaſes, deſtroying the health and vigor of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and reducing thouſands of families to want and miſery. As to thoſe againſt uncleanneſs, they are ſo ſeldom carried into execution, that we might almoſt as well be without them. If, therefore, men are under no reſtraint from religion, they are left at full liberty to abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe vicious courſes A regard to credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or a dread of infamy, cannot reſtrain men from ſuch practices, where they are ſo common as not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful; and where the number of tranſgreſſors exempts them from cenſure or reproach. How far this is the caſe in many parts of our ſtate, I leave others to ſay; and only remark, that the abominable mixture of colors in our capital, as well as in ſome other places, and the ſcenes of lewdneſs, riot and debauchery, common in town and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are too plain a proof of our diſſolute manners, and a melancholy preſage of approaching ruin. I am ſenſible we have no ſmall number amongſt us, and thoſe too of high rank and conſiderable political influence, who make light of theſe crimes; but it is not the leſs true, that they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with effects highly dangerous to government, and open a wide door to a group of political evils, which menace
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021418_0063_0FB3EECCE1031490"/>
deſtruction to our country. Whatever men of looſe morals may think of theſe things, to thoſe who conſider their pernicious tendency, they are ſufficiently alarming, and clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y of a reformation. All that <hi>can,</hi> ought to be done by civil laws for this purpoſe; but I am perſuaded that nothing but a ſenſe of religion, and a regard to the precepts of Chriſtianity, will prove effectual.</p>
            <p>But, not to dwell any longer on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe inſtances of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, which are a reproach to reaſon, and transform men into brutes; we proceed to obſerve, that the moderation which Chriſtianity enjoins in the purſuit of wealth greatly tends to the advantage of ſociety. Avarice is inſatiable, and productive of infinite miſchief in government. The moſt numerous and flagrant acts of injuſtice, and the moſt atrocious crimes, even murder itſelf, may be often traced to an immoderate deſire of riches, as their ſource. Experience confirms the aſſertion of the Apoſtle, "The love of money is the root of all evil." As an immoderate love of wealth, therefore, is one principal ſource of thoſe crimes which plainly tend to the ſubverſion of ſociety, it is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it ſhould be curbed; and whatever hath a tendency to keep it in proper bounds, muſt be ſubſervient to public good. Chriſtianity gives us ſuch a ſtriking picture of the empty and unſatisfying, as well as dangerous, nature of riches, as cannot fail to have a mighty influence on the minds of all thoſe who have a cordial belief of its truth. He who has a full conviction that "a man's life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth," and pays a due regard to thoſe divine precepts, which forbid us to ſet our hearts on earthly poſſeſſions, will be moderate in his purſuit of riches. Senſible of their uncertain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring nature, he will be under little temptation to uſe fraud or violence in order to acquire them. Contented with food and raiment, he is not anxious to amaſs great wealth; and if God ſhould pleaſe to proſper his moderate care and diligence, and bleſs him with abundance, he has a heart open to diſtreſs, and is ready to pity and relieve the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Senſible that he is only a ſteward of the good things
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:021418_0064_0FB3EECDE91D11F8"/>
God hath given him, and that he muſt be accountable for the uſe he makes of his eſtate, he is careful not to conſume it in luxury, nor make it the fuel of luſt. He keeps the golden mean between the miſer and the prodigal; not hoarding up uſeleſsly, nor ſpending profuſely, but contributing according to his ability in promoting ſuch deſigns as are uſeful to the public; feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, or inſtructing the ignorant. Such is the temper of the man formed upon the precepts of the goſpel: and how admirably it is adapted to promote the peace and happineſs of ſociety, is too plain to need illuſtration. If this Chriſtian moderation were more prevalent among us, how many acts of extortion, oppreſſion, fraud and rapine; how much ſtrife and contention, envy and emulation, would it prevent? It would be a much ſtronger ſecurity againſt theſe and a thouſand other irregularities, than the dread of human laws, though framed with the higheſt wiſdom, and executed with the greateſt punctuality.</p>
            <p>But further; Chriſtianity is not more favorable to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by moderating our love of riches, than by enjoining an honeſt care and diligence as the means of acquiring a comfortable ſubſiſtence. Idleneſs, ſloth and negligence, in our ſeveral occupations, are as expreſsly condemned by our religion, as a too eager and violent purſuit of the world. Thus we are guarded againſt two extremes equally perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to ſociety. Extreme poverty and want ſtimulate men to theft, robbery and many other diſhoneſt practices, highly injurious to the community. Thoſe who are extremely poor, and thoſe who are extremely rich, are generally the moſt vicious: and though their vices may be of different kinds, they are equally oppoſite to public good. The <hi>mean</hi> in life is moſt deſirable: and this is generally the reſult of that moderate care and diligence which the precepts of Chriſtianity require. They who are placed between the extremes of want and abundance, are generally the beſt members of ſociety, moſt happy themſelves, and contribute moſt to the happineſs of others. Over-grown eſtates are ſeldom acquired or enjoyed, in a manner wholly conſiſtent with Chriſtianity. They are often a curſe and incumbrance

            <p>This naturally leads us to take notice of the influence which Chriſtianity has, in moderating our pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uit of thoſe things which are reckoned <hi>comfortable, elegant</hi> and <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> in civil life.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſy, preciſely to aſcertain, how far Chriſtianity permit us to indulge to the enjoyment of thoſe things which are not neceſſary to the ſupport of nature; or to what degree we may innocently gratify an elegant taſte, in magnifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed out an <hi>abuſe,</hi> whenever the gifts of Providence were uſed further than is neceſſary for the bare ſuſtenance of life. It is needleſs to ſhow the abſurdity of this notion, and how little ground Chriſtianity affords for ſuch a ſuppoſition. The <hi>bare neceſſary</hi> is reckoned ſufficiently beggarly among us: and we have much more reaſon to guard againſt exceſs and intemperance, than a rigid auſterity and ſuperſtitious abſtinence. Though our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Creator "hath given us richly all things to enjoy," and Chriſtianity permits us to uſe the comforts, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, and even the elegancies of life, it requires a certain temperance and moderation in the enjoyment of theſe things. To ſuppoſe otherwiſe would be unreaſonable, and contrary to the ſpirit and general ſtrain of its precepts. To uſe the gifts of Providence to our own injury, in perſon or fortune, or to the injury of others to whom we ſtand related, or are obliged
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021418_0066_0FB3EED0E95D7270"/>
to aſſiſt, is prohibited by Chriſtianity. This, as I take it, is a pretty accurate definition of <hi>luxury,</hi> which is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly vicious, and as contrary to the precepts of our religion, as it is pernicious to civil ſociety. When a man indulges himſelf in ſumptuous fare, ſo as to enervate his body and debauch his mind; when he grat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fies his taſte for elegance, grandeur and magnificence, in building, furniture, dreſs, equipage, &amp;c. to ſuch a degree, as to embarraſs his eſtate, plunge himſelf in debt, and bring his family to beggary, he certainly paſſes the bounds of moderation. Imprudence is too ſoft a name for ſuch a conduct. It is highly criminal. For by acting in this manner, he not only injures himſelf; but is chargeable with great injuſtice to others. Had he kept within the bounds which religion, and even reaſon, preſcribes, he might have lived comfortably, though perhaps not ſplendidly, and beſtowed liberally to thoſe, who reduced by unavoidable misfortu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, had a right to ſhare in his bounty. The man who regulates his mode of living by a ſtrict and conſcientious regard to the precepts of the goſpel, will always endeavor to manage his affairs with ſuch econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that his expences may not exceed his income. Though he may have a taſte for the <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>elegant</hi> in life, he will not always gratify it, even when in his power; but often ſacrifice the <hi>pleaſures of imagination</hi> to the more ſublime and God like pleaſure of relieving the real wants of the poor and needy Although his eſtate may permit, and rank require him to live in a magnificent and ſplendid manner, he will ſtudy moderation and ſimplicity, as far as poſſible without in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021418_0067_0FB3EED2671B69E0"/>
to the detriment of civil ſociety. All who conſider the fatal effects and dangerous tendency of luxury, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Chriſtianity in this view is of great importance to the ſtate. In all rich and flouriſhing republics, <hi>ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary laws</hi> have been generally thought neceſſary; but they ſeldom fully anſwer the end deſigned by them. A ſtrict regard to that moderation which Chriſtianity requires, would have much greater influence, and lay a more effectual curb on luxury, than the moſt rigorous ſumptuary laws. How much we need the influence of religion in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is too plain to admit of a doubt. If luxury be an "abuſe of the gifts of Providence," there is certainly a great deal of it among us. Our progreſs in this vice ſince the cloſe of the war, has been ſo amazingly rapid, that I could not believe it, were I not convinced by my own ſenſes. The nature of our government, the loſſes we have ſuſtained, and the debts we have contracted, in the courſe of a bloody and deſolating war, call for the ſevereſt oeconomy and the moſt exact frugality; and yet ſuch is the profuſion, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and extravagance, which generally prevail among our citizens, that a ſagacious politician would be alomſt tempted to pronounce us in the laſt ſtage of political cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. As a free and independent ſtate, we are but in infancy; and yet we have many flagrant marks of a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic in rapid decline. "We have luxury and avarice," no uncommon conjunction; "public poverty, and private opulence"<note n="*" place="bottom">"Nos habemus luxuriam arque avaritiam; publice egeſtatem, privatim opulentiam." Rome had exiſted 600 years before the patriot could ſay this: In the early ages of the commonwealth, it was quite otherwiſe: "Patriae enim rem unuſquiſque, non ſuam augere propere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; pauperque in divite, quam dives in paupere imperio, verſari male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat." Valerius Max. Such is the diſpoſition which ought to prevail among <hi>us</hi> in this early ſtage of our republic: but how far it is otherwiſe, no one can be ignorant, who is capable of the ſmalleſt obſervation.</note>. Profaneneſs, riot, diſſipation and debauchery have, in many places, arrived to a height which is really aſtoniſhing. If, in the courſe of a few years, we are ſo far gone in theſe vices, who can look forward, only one
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021418_0068_0FB3EED3E63D6208"/>
century, without trembling for poſterity? The unſettled condition of our government, and the warm political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions which take place amongſt us, are the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of our preſent ſituation; and neither very ſurpriſing, nor much to be dreaded; but our rapid progreſs in luxury, which will naturally increaſe with our wealth and commerce, is an alarming circumſtance, and a ſure harbinger of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ruin. We already begin to feel the fatal effects of our prodigality and extravagance. It is known to all, what great numbers of our citizens are involved in debt. Not a few of them are ſo irrecoverably ſunk, that they have relinquiſhed all hopes of payment. This is generally reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned no ſmall evil; and is, at this moment, the ſource of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſcontent and uneaſineſs in the ſtate. Whence ariſes this evil ſo much complained of? We may, I think, pronounce without heſitation, that <hi>an immoderate deſire of high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive living</hi> is the principal and moſt general cauſe. Our citizens ſeem to be ſeized with a general emulation to ſurpaſs each other in every article of expence. Thoſe who poſſeſs affluent fortunes lead the way, and ſet the example. Others, whoſe eſtates are not ſufficient to bear them out, madly adopt the ſame expenſive ſyſtem, and in order to ſupport it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract debts which they have no rational proſpect of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All they ſeem to wiſh, is to obtain credit, to figure away, and make a brilliant appearance at the expence of others. It is too plain, many of them enter into engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without the moſt diſtant proſpect of complying with the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. They make no efforts for this purpoſe; but plunge deeper and deeper into the vortex of extravagance. If they can only indulge their fondneſs for pleaſure, ſhow and vanity, and ſhine upon the property of the honeſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, they care not what becomes either of their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or their country. Rich and ſumptuous fare, expenſive diverſions, coſtly entertainments, the pomp, parade and ſplendor of dreſs and equipage: theſe are the things which have involved thouſands; and among other miſchiefs, have obliged our legiſlature to ſtop the courſe of juſtice; or, at leaſt, to clog it in ſuch a manner, that an honeſt creditor
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:021418_0069_0FB3EED566478B98"/>
may ſtarve, before he can re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>over his juſt due. Indeed there are a number of theſe deſperate debtors, who ſeem determined to hazard every extreme rather than diſcharge their juſt debts: for they are ſenſible, if they do this, they muſt retrench from their luxury, and many of them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beggary. At a certain period of the Roman republic, it was common for a bold tribune, who aimed at popularity, to propoſe a total abolition of all debts: and if the ruinous ſcheme of credit be continued as in times paſt, I ſhall not be at all ſurprized, if ſuch a motion ſhould be made in our aſſembly. Something which appears to me nearly tantamount, hath already been done.—A <hi>paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> on the footing ſome plead for, would produce nearly the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>The weight of our taxes is alſo a matter of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; and none complain more heavily, than thoſe who live moſt prodigally. You may hear a man <hi>curſing</hi> our aſſembly, and exclaiming againſt the tax when the very <hi>ſilver</hi> on the <hi>trappings of his horſe</hi> would pay his proportion of it. He can find money to eat and drink, and dreſs like a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; he has guineas upon guineas to ſtake at a horſe race or a gaming table: but not a farthing to pay his tax. Is it at all ſtrange, that men of this caſt cannot pay their public or private debts? If they would only retrench from their ſuperfluities, and be frugal and induſtrious; if they would live within the limits of their income, and obſerve thoſe bounds of moderation which common prudence, reaſon and religion require, moſt of them would find little difficulty in paying their taxes. Their extravagant taſte for high and expenſive living, is the principal reaſon, why they <hi>cannot,</hi> or rather <hi>will not,</hi> diſcharge their public dues. Every one who conſiders the heavy debts we have incurred by the war, muſt be ſenſible that a weighty tax is neceſſary<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe who complain of the weight of our taxes, readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the juſtice of diſcharging the debts contracted by the war; but at the ſame time alledge, that very little of our money is applied this way—that our civil liſt, which, ſay they, is enormous, ſwallows up the greater part; and, in general, that thoſe who have the managament of our finances, laviſh out the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ublic money without any regard to that ſevere oeconomy which our preſent ſituation requires. I do not take upon me to ſay, this is the caſe; but if it be, it is a ſtill further proof, that the political grievances we labor under, are the conſequence of extravagance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prodigality and luxury. If the ſalaries of our civil officers be too high, the evil may be eaſily traced to luxury as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal cauſe. If our aſſembly deal out the public money unneceſſarily, and in ſuch a manner as proves detrimental to the ſtate, what is this but public profuſion and extravagance?</note>. Honor, juſtice and our own real intereſt equally require, that this

Let us, for a moment, admit the ſuppoſition, that the doctrines of Chriſtianity were firmly believed, cordially embraced, and its precepts dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently practiſed, by all our citizens; and it may eaſily be conceived what a happy effect it would have.

            <p>If religion be of that importance to the ſtate which we have been endeavoring to prove, it certainly merits the public attention; and thoſe who are engaged in the arduous and important taſk of government, ought to avail themſelves of its force, to give vigour to the operation, and facilitate the execution of wiſe and wholeſome laws. The moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent of my readers will perhaps blame me for taking ſo much pains to prove what very few either doubt or deny. To this I can only ſay, that how well ſoever the truths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon are known and believed, it is clear they have been too much over-looked: and if what hath been offered may ſerve, in any meaſure, to draw the public attention to this important object, I ſhall not regret the labor I have beſtowed. All our politicians will readily grant, that the morality of the people is a matter of no ſmall moment, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in republics; but many of them ſeem to forget the inſeparable connection between religion and morality. They appear not ſufficiently ſenſible, how impoſſible it is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve purity of morals among the people at large, even in the lax political ſenſe of that expreſſion, without a ſenſe of religion. A complete morality, independent of all religion, is merely viſionary, and never, in fact exiſted. It is the dream of theory ſpinners, and the unmeaning language of pidling profligate politicians. The neceſſity of morality to the commonwealth being once granted, the neceſſity of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:021418_0073_0FB3EEDB68D19D90"/>
religion will unavoidably follow; and certainly that which is neceſſary, not only to the <hi>well-being,</hi> but to the very <hi>exiſtence</hi> of civil ſociety, muſt be worthy the attention of civil rulers. Without entering into any diſpute concerning the power of civil magiſtrates <hi>circa ſacra,</hi> we lay it down as certain, that they may do much for the ſupport and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of religion, without the leaſt encroachment on the prerogative of him who is the ſupreme head of the church. They may, and ought to do much, by their pious example, which in perſons of high rank and au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hority has an amazing weight and influence. They may without any invaſion of the rights of conſcience, take meaſures for the inſtruction of ſubjects in the important doctrines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſtianity, which ſo evidently tend to the ſafety of the body politic. If meaſures of this nature were ever neceſſay in any government, they are ſo in South-Carolina. The greater part of our citizens are ignorant of religion to to a degree which is equally aſtoniſhing and deplorable. Whole ſettlements may be found, where but very few can ſo much as read the ſcriptures. There are ſome hundreds, one might venture to ſay, ſome thouſands of young perſons growing up among us, almoſt as ignorant of the God who made them, as the Hottentots of Africa. Inſtructed in no one duty which they owe, either to God or man, is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe, they will ever make good citizens or uſeful members of the community? Brought up, as many of them are, in the moſt abject poverty and the moſt crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal idleneſs, and taught no kind of employment by which they can procure an honeſt ſubſiſtence, muſt we not expect they will prove peſts of ſociety? Reſtrained by no obligations of virtue or religion, ſtimulated by want, and ſharpened by keen neceſſity, they are expert only in ſtealing, and in time, will, no doubt, make dextrous horſe-thieves. Do we not find in fact, that thoſe ſettlements, where idleneſs, ignorance and irreligion moſt prevail, are at once the ſeminaries and aſylums of public offenders? Here the laws are not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at all, or with the greateſt difficulty; and in ſome of them the people are ſcarcely one degree above downright
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:021418_0074_0FB3EEDCE3FA4420"/>
barbariſm. Is there any other method to bring them out of this ſtate, and make them honeſt and worthy citizens, but by diffuſing knowledge among them, and inſtructing their children in the principles of religion and morality? And is not this an object worthy of the public attention? Aſide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the ſouls of men, which ſhould ſtrongly operate with thoſe who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, our own peace and happineſs, as a political body, evidently require it. If parents either cannot, or will not provide for, and educate their children, in a proper manner, it would certainly be juſt and expedient, to take them out of their hands, and have them brought up in ſuch a way, as might afford ſome rational proſpect of their being uſeful to ſociety. This would be, at once, an act of charity and compaſſion to the children, and highly beneficial to the state.</p>
            <p>One principal reaſon why ignorance is ſo prevalent among our citizens, is the want of public teachers, properly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to inſtruct them in the doctrines and precepts of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. If our country were properly ſupplied with able, pious and faithful miniſters, it would doubtleſs be one of the moſt promiſing means to diffuſe religious knowledge, ſtem the torrent of vice, and promote the practice of piety and virtue. Without attempting to prove, I make no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple boldly to affirm, that the preaching of the goſpel in its genuine purity and ſimplicity, is the moſt powerful mean to reform the manners of men. If ſo, is it reaſonable to expect, that a reformation will take place, while this mean is neglected? Can we rationally hope, that a ſenſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will be kept alive in the hearts of men, when there are none amongſt them, whoſe ſtated buſineſs it is to explain its doctrines and inculcate its precepts? It is the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great Author of our religion, that there ſhould be ſuch an order of men. And when they conduct themſelves with that gravity and dignity which become their office; when they are zealous, active and diligent in preaching, inſtructing, reproving, and, by their holy and exemplary lives, give weight and influence to their doctrines, we are authorized to expect the moſt ſalutary effects from their
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:021418_0075_0FB3EEDE665C4448"/>
miniſtrations. Had we a ſufficient number of ſuch clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fixed in the different parts of our ſtate, it would be a ſingular bleſſing, and greatly facilitate the execution of our laws. Were this the caſe, we might expect, that our citizens would be more generally enlightened in the nature and end of government, and the ſeveral duties they owe to ſociety, more ſenſible of the neceſſity of order in the body politic, and of ſubmiſſion to all thoſe civil ordinances which are ſubſervient to the common good. Virtue would be more countenanced and promoted, vice more diſcouraged, and a ſtronger curb laid on the licentious and profane.</p>
            <p>But how are ſuch clergymen to be obtained? how ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported? "Hoc opus, hic labor." We do not take upon us to dictate. We point out the influence of religion on civil ſociety, the need we have of that influence, and give one reaſon why we are ſo deficient in the knowledge and practice of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>It may, however, be obſerved, that the moſt probable means of furniſhing our country with uſeful paſtors, is to promote learning, and educate pious and promiſing youth among ourſelves. The encouragement of literature on this, and many other accounts, ſhould be conſidered as a very capital object of public attention in South-Carolina. It is neither for our honor, nor our intereſt, to have our learned departments filled up with foreigners. How far this is the caſe, none can be ignorant. To ſay nothing of the inundation of Phyſicians from Great-Britain, Ireland and the northern ſtates, we have not ſo much as one learned clergyman amongſt us, who is a native of South-Carolina. Of the few miniſters who are ſettled in our ſtate, the greater number are illiterate. Some of theſe are no doubt uſeful: but if their learning equalled their piety and zeal, they would certainly be much more ſo; and religion would be more ſolid and rational, than it is at preſent in many places. The moſt able and judicious of theſe illiterate preachers, are ſenſible of the diſadvantages they labour under, and lament their want of a liberal education; but at the ſame time, urge the difficulty of obtaining it, and the deplorable
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:021418_0076_0FB3EEDFE646EB70"/>
ignorance which prevails, as their excuſe for aſſuming the character of public inſtructors. And in truth, conſidering the ſtate of learning among us, and the ſcarcity of religious teachers, this argument appears to me to have no ſmall weight. If ſuch preachers were capable of nothing further than to inculcate the doctrine of a future ſtate, and preſs upon men the neceſſity of moral and ſocial duties, even this would be of no ſmall utility to the ſtate. It requires but little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to inſtruct many of our citizens, and they who can only read the ſcriptures in their own language, may do much good in many parts of our country, by teaching the groſsly ignorant, and reforming the notoriouſly vicious. After all, it muſt be confeſſed, that they would be much more uſeful, were their knowledge more enlarged, and their education more liberal: and if a method could be fallen upon to make learning cheap and convenient, this would be more generally the caſe. This is the point at which we ought to aim, and the moſt ſpirited efforts ſhould be made for this purpoſe. While learning continues ſo expenſive, as it is at preſent amongſt us, we cannot expect it to become general. The more opulent only will be able to give their ſons a liberal education; and there is little probability, that any conſiderable number of theſe will devote themſelves to the ſervice of the church<note n="*" place="bottom">As our form of government tends to an ariſtocracy, if learning were properly diffuſed, it might, I think, ſerve to counteract this tendency in ſome meaſure. In a republic, offices of high truſt and preferment ought to be rotatory, and diffuſed as much as poſſible. If learning be confined to a few of the moſt wealthy, it will naturally tend to keep theſe offices in a few hands; the conſequence of which will be, that the rich and learned <hi>few</hi> will rule and oppreſs the poor and ignorant <hi>many.</hi> Every proud politic <hi>ariſtocrat</hi> knows, that if he can keep a people in poverty and ignorance, he can <hi>ride</hi> them at pleaſure, and will therefore ſtrenuouſly oppoſe every attempt of the legiſlature to put learning upon ſuch a footing, that it may be acquired by thoſe of lower rank.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is the opinion of many, that the beſt way to ſupply ourſelves with clergymen, is to encourage their emigration from Great-Britain and Ireland. In our provincial ſtate this plan was not altogether ineligible; but, in our preſent circumſtances, I think there are ſtrong political objections
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021418_0077_0FB3EEE166A0CF28"/>
againſt it. An important revolution hath taken place. We are now an independent people, and have rejected the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great-Britain, as equally odious and intolerable, Thoſe men, whom it is propoſed to bring in amongſt us, are the ſubjects of king George III; and in juſtice to them, it is to be ſuppoſed, loyal ſubjects. Their education has a deep tincture of the government under which they have lived. They have been brought up with that predilection for monarchy, and that ſuperſtitious reverence for royalty, and the high-ſounding title of <hi>king,</hi> which is uſual in regal governments. Can we reaſonably expect that men of this deſcription will generally have the ſame ſtrong attachment to our country the ſame high reſpect to our republican forms of government, as thoſe who are educated among us, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe the principles and ſpirit of freedom and independence with the milk of their mothers? Have we any ground to hope, that they will ſhow the ſame zeal for the ſupport and proſperity of our free conſtitutions, as the natives of America, whoſe fathers have ſuffered ſo much for their eſtabliſhment?</p>
            <p>Some of theſe gentlemen, who have ventured to croſs the water ſince the the eſtabliſhment of peace, and are now in queſt of ſettlements amongſt us, make no ſcruple to declare their hatred and contempt of our government; and expreſs their great regret that the revolution ever took place. "Better," ſay they, "we had ſtill continued our connection with England; we would have now been a much more happy people." That they ſhould hold ſuch language, is not all ſurpriſing. It is the natural reſult of their education, and the prejudices which hang about them in favor of a kingly government: and how plainly it tends to embroil our government, and facilitate our return to a ſervile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on Great-Britain, is ſufficiently obvious. Others, who have more prudence, and better know how to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves to their intereſt, are ſilent on the matter. Few, if any of them, diſcover that cordial approbation of our government, or intereſt themſelves in our welfare with that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>r which we find in true republicans. Indeed, it would be unſeaſonable to expect it. Suppoſe 40 or 50 of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:021418_0078_0FB3EEE2EB4AA828"/>
theſe foreign clergymen ſettled in different parts of our ſtate; ſuppoſe them to be as reſpectable as men of their function ought to be, and to have that influence on the minds of their people, which is neceſſary to render them uſeful, it is eaſy, I think, to ſee what might be the conſequence to the ſtate. How weak ſoever this objection may appear to ſome, it ſhows at leaſt, that in a political view, it is moſt eligible to have a clergy well affected to our government: and the moſt probable method of obtaining ſuch, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote learning in our own country.</p>
            <p>As to the method of ſupporting our clergy, it ſeems to be the moſt general opinion, eſpecially among thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called Diſſenters, that it ſhould be by the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of the people. And indeed no other mode ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more eligible, where people are generally ſenſible of the utility of religion, and diſpoſed to contribute according to their abilities for its ſupport. It ought however to be conſidered, that in many parts of our ſtate, the people are ſo totally ſunk in vice and ignorance, that they have ſcarcely any idea of the neceſſity and importance of religion; and conſequently will not exert themſelves, either to obtain or ſupport public teachers. And yet, theſe are the people who moſt need inſtruction. What is to be done in this caſe? Can nothing, conſiſtent with juſtice and the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, be attempted by civil authority to oblige perſons of this deſcription to contribute to the ſupport of religion? If religion be of that utility to government, which we have been endeavoring to ſhow, it will certainly follow, that every citizen reaps advantage from it in a political view; and therefore ought to contribute for its ſupport. Nor is there any more injuſtice in obliging him to this by law, than in obliging him to pay a public tax for the ſupport of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: becauſe religion is abſolutely neceſſary to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and were it not for this, he would be deprived of thoſe benefits which he enjoys from the ſocial union. We may therefore venture to affirm, that every member of civil ſociety ought, and may be juſtly obliged by law, to pay ſomething for the ſupport of religion. Nor will there be
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:021418_0079_0FB3EEE467D1EC88"/>
any juſt cauſe of complaint on the ſcore of conſcience, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided every one be left at liberty to pay to whatever deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the clergy he pleaſes. We do not take upon us to affirm that ſuch a law ought to be made: ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties would probably ariſe in the execution of it. We only ſhow, that ſuch a law would have nothing in it unjuſt, were it thought expedient. If properly executed, it would, I think, have at leaſt one good effect; it would excite people to make ſome efforts to obtain fixed clergymen among themſelves. It is eaſy to foreſee, that avarice on the one hand, and contempt of religion on the other, will rake up many objections againſt this plan: but as we only juſt throw out the hint, and are far from being ſanguine on the matter, we ſhall not, at preſent, take any notice of theſe. There is, however, one objection which, with me, has no ſmall weight, and which, no doubt, will operate ſtrongly with all thoſe who wiſh well to religion. If the law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed could be ſo framed and executed, as to afford ſupport and encouragement only to the pious, ſober and diligent of all denominations, it would certainly be of ſingular ſervice to the ſtate; but the great danger is, that thoſe of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite character would probably be ſupported and encouraged. Could matters be ſo managed, as to guard againſt this, I ſhould not heſitate a moment to pronounce ſuch a law highly expedient and ſalutary. This may perhaps be difficult, and could I think it abſolutely impracticable, I would be one of the laſt men in South-Carolina to propoſe, or conſent to, a law of this nature. It would be an intolerable hardſhip indeed, to be obliged to give our money for the maintenance of idle, ignorant or vicious eccleſiaſtics. But however true this may be, if thoſe who ſo violently oppoſe every other mode of ſupporting religion but by voluntary contribution, would properly conſider the ſituation of our country, and what vaſt numbers there are amongſt us, who neither do nor will aſſiſt in maintaining the teachers of religion, unleſs they be compelled by law; if, I ſay, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe, and many other things, which might be urged, they would not wholly reprobate every attempt to encourage
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:021418_0080_0FB3EEE662B953F8"/>
religion at the public expence. We have the beſt religion in the world. There is no other ſo well adapted to the genius of a free and independent people, ſo favorable to liberty and the natural rights of men: nor is there any other which ſo commodiouſly falls in with that form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we have pitched upon, the ſupreme end and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tyranny and oppreſſion of every kind are condemned by the precepts, and utterly repugnant to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity. It muſt be corrupted, abuſed and perverted, before it can be brought to ſpeak the language of deſpotiſm, and give countenance to arbitrary power. There is not a deſpotic government on the face of the earth, where it prevails in any conſiderable degree of purity. We ought not, therefore, to ſpare a little coſt and pains to ſupport and encourage a religion ſo friendly to equal government and laws; and which ſo directly tends to promote the great deſigns of the American revolution. A ſufficient number of uſeful paſtors might be ſupported with but very little expence to the public. I am none of thoſe who wiſh to heap wealth upon eccleſiaſtics, and make them wholly independent of the people. This would be highly impolitic, and the ready way to deſtroy their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, by making them proud, luxurious, indolent and negligent of their duty. But they certainly ought to have what is ſufficient to keep them above that contempt, which, unhappily among us, is too often connected with a certain degree of honeſt poverty.

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:021418_0081_0FB3EEE768A9C658"/>
other ways, we cannot reaſonably expect, that many of them will prefer an employment, from which they can look for little elſe in this world, but poverty and contempt. This is very much the caſe at preſent, eſpecially amongſt thoſe formerly called Diſſenters, many of whom ſeem to expect, that men will ſacrifice every earthly conſideration to the deſire of ſaving ſouls. It would be well, if they could find a ſufficient number of this temper; but as Chriſtianity requires no ſuch ſacrifice, and gives thoſe who preach the goſpel a right to live by the goſpel, few, I believe, will think it their duty to relinquiſh this right, and engage in a work at once ſo arduous and painful, without ſome hope of a comfortable ſubſiſtence. If, therefore, we would enjoy thoſe advantages which flow from religion, we muſt give proper encouragement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o its miniſters; and ſupport them in ſuch a manner, that the proſpect of extreme indigence, may not deter them from entering into the ſacred office. And if our citizens had a proper ſenſe of the importance of religion, even in a political view, they would think it no great hardſhip to contribute their part for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>What others think of it, I know not; but to me it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clearer than the ſun, that we never can be a great, happy or reſpectable people, while religion is generally deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed and neglected among us. A general corruption of morals, will always be the conſequence of a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of religion. The more irreligious a people are, the more vicious; and the more vicious, generally ſpeaking, the more miſerable. However ſlowly vice may operate, in the end it brings ſure and inevitable perdition on the body politic. I hear ſome of my countrymen bewailing our political factions and civil diſſenſions; others lamenting the precarious ſtate of our trade, the ſcarcity of money and the weight of our taxes; but, I confeſs, none of all theſe appears to me half ſo alarming as our rapid progreſs in vice. Faction, tumult and inteſtine commotions, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to certain acute and violent diſeaſes, which, though for a ſhort time, they cruelly ravage the human frame; yet, where the conſtitution is good, a criſis is frequently made,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:021418_0082_0FB3EEE8E9080B28"/>
the diſorder thrown off, and the body reſtored to its priſtine health and vigor: but vice, like a deadly poiſon, ſometimes ſlow, but always ſure in its operation, infects every member of the political body, corrupts the whole maſs, and iſſues in certain deſtruction. Many, who wiſh well to their country, are greatly alarmed with the dread of an ariſtocracy, and ſeem to think, that nothing is ſo much to be feared, as the undue influence of a few wealthy and aſpiring gentlemen in the lower parts of our ſtate, who, they imagine, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining to ſeize our liberties, and engroſs all the power into their own hands. I will not affirm that we are in no danger from this quarter. Our government naturally tends to an ariſtocracy; and we cannot be too careful to guard againſt the encroachments of power, and watch over thoſe privileges which we have ſo dearly purchaſed. But truſt me, my dear countrymen, it is not a matter of much moment to a people ſunk in vice, what their form of government is. None can make them happy. There is a certain point of moral corruption, to which if we once arrive, we can no longer exiſt as a republic. A revolution muſt then of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence take place, and ſome other kind of government better ſuited to our circumſtances, and the ſpirit of the people, be adopted. There is a degree of vice which utterly debaſes human nature, and renders men incapable either to think, or judge, or act for themſelves. When they come to this, they are prepared for ſlavery, and it is neceſſary, perhaps beſt for them, to have a maſter. The hiſtory of the moſt noted republics ſhows how vain muſt be all the efforts of a few virtuous men, to ſupport our conſtitution and preſerve our liberty, when once that virtue, which is the baſis of freedom, and the very ſoul of a democracy, is no more. When Caeſar paſſed the Rubicon, he ſaw that Rome muſt have a maſter; and why not Caeſar as well as another? The virtuous and gallant ſpirit of Brutus could not brook this maſter. He thought that by ſacrificing the tyrant, he could aboliſh the tyranny, and reſtore the republic; but he found himſelf miſtaken. The ſacrifice was not acceptable to the people The Roman ſpirit was departed; and inſtead

of reſuming their liberty, they ungratefully roſe up againſt their deliverers. A ſecond triumvirate was formed, worſe than the firſt; and the lords of the world ſervilely ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their liberties into the hands of a boy. We are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this; but it was perhaps the beſt thing they could do, as circumſtances then ſtood.</p>
            <p>There is, therefore, no other way to preſerve our liberty, but by preſerving our virtue.</p>

            <p>Suffer me then, my dear countrymen, to addreſs you with all ſeriouſneſs on this ſubject. After having diſplayed ſo much virtue and valor, in the courſe of a moſt arduous and trying ſtruggle; and at laſt, through the ſignal interpoſition of Heaven, brought our affairs to ſuch a happy iſſue, what a reproach will it be to us, if by ſuffering ourſelves to be effeminated with luxury, and plunged in vice, we tarniſh all that glory which we have acquired, and loſe the fruits of ſo much blood and treaſure! Would you preſerve thoſe liberties, which have been bought with the blood of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of your brave countrymen? Be virtuous. Would you riſe to that ſummit of glory and felicity which was the end of your ſeparation from Great-Britain? Promote re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and endeavor to ſtem that torrent of vice which threatens to break in upon us, and blaſt all thoſe ſanguine hopes, which animated us to do and ſuffer ſo much in the cauſe of freedom. Let the rich and the great uſe their influence to encourage purity of morals, and inſpire their fellow-citizens with thoſe ſentiments of religion and virtue, which are ſo abſolutely neceſſary to our political welfare.

                        <p>Do you profeſs yourſelves lovers of your country? Do you deſire its proſperity? Do you wiſh to ſee the laws reſpected and good order preſerved?

Lead the way then; ſhow us a pattern we may dare to imitate; and uſe that influence and authority which Heaven has put into your hands, ſo that you may be a "Terror to evil-doers, and a praiſe to thoſe that do well."

The longer I conſider the ſubject, the more fully I am convinced of the fatal effects of vice, and the abſolute neceſſity of piety and purity of morals, in order to make us a great and a happy people: and there is no other way in which you can more effectually promote the proſperity of your country, than by the practice of theſe. Do you love your country? Do you wiſh to diſcharge the debt you owe to ſociety? Do you deſire to be happy here, and enjoy eternal felicity hereafter? Show your reſpect for that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion you profeſs; and endeavor to conform your lives to the precepts of Chriſtianity.

                        <p>The God of Heaven hath favored us, in common with the other States of America, with many ſingular bleſſings.

But if we forget the kind hand which covered us in the hour of danger, and conducted us through a ſea of troubles to the calm haven of peace and ſecurity; if we abuſe the gifts of Providence, turn our liberty to licentiouſneſs, and provoke the vengeance of Heaven by our daring impiety, and ſhocking immoralities; what can we expect, but that a righteous God will give us up to the fatal conſequences of our own vices, and inflict upon us that puniſhment which we juſtly deſerve? Hath he ſo viſibly and remarkably interpoſed in our behalf; wrought ſo many ſignal deliverances for us, and poured out ſo many bleſſings upon us; and ſhall we, by our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and abuſe of his diſtinguiſhing mercies, provoke him to withdraw them from us, and hold us up to the world as a monument of what an impious and ungrateful people may expect from his hand?
