            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE FRONTISPIECE</head>
            <p>EXHIBITS a view of what is represented in the last scene of the fourth act of the Tragedy.</p>
            <p>The principal figure on the fore-ground is the corpse of Montgomery, with the arm thrown back and stretched at full length, in the casual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which one slain in battle may be supposed to have fallen. Near him, is the body of Macpherson, and at some distance on the left, that of Captain Cheeseman, slain at the same instant, by one discharge of grape shot. In the next view we have Major Burr, Aid-de-Camp, standing over the mangled remains of these gallant heroes, in the attitude of addressing them, in the language of funeral eulogium. On his right is Colonel Campbell, who having commanded a retreat, returns to the fatal spot and counsels Major Burr to retire with him, pointing to the city of Quebec, whence Maclean is supposed to issue with his forces in order to surround them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we see the Ghost of General Wolfe, appearing from the banks of the St. Lawrence river, and approaching half inveloped in a cloud; his left hand on the wound which he received in his breast, and his right hand, the wrist of which appears to be bound up, addressed to Major Burr, while he laments with him the tragic scene before them, but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels the happy resentment and opposition to the British tyranny which it will naturally produce in the minds of the Americans. He also antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates the pleasing view of the certain overthrow of the British arms, and the final glory of an Independent Empire in America.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I EMBRACE the opportunity of this publication, to express my veneration of your character; not from any of those smaller motives which are attributed to Authors in their dedications; but simply, because it is my "delight to do you honour."</p>
            <p>Indeed every friend of virtue and of mankind, must esteem a Gentleman, who, from the beginning, has so warmly asserted the cause of liberty, and hence may be reckoned in the number of those pure patriots, who with underived heat and lustre, first shone out in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the British counsels. For I count them but a second class of men who have slowly taken fire at the patriotism of their neighbours. They may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve true praise, yet they have not attained to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the "first worthies."</p>
            <p>Every officer and soldier who has fought under your command, since the commencement of the war, speaks of your nobleness of spirit, your frank demeanor, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and generous deportment, with a warmth of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation which only true love and real admiration
<pb facs="unknown:015249_0006_0F9883AAB9611E10"/>
could inspire. The inhabitants of Philadelphia attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to you, under GOD, and the good conduct of General WASHINGTON, the salvation of their city. For perhaps no other person could so effectually have roused the Militia of the Pennsylvania State to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the hardships of a campaign, in the depth of winter, even though the object of their enterprize was noble, the repelling the British forces from the banks of the Delaware.</p>
            <p>I shall not detain you longer from more important services, but take my leave by wishing you a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of life beyond the AEra of the war, that you may behold the matured Blessings of that Liberty and Glory, which you have so gallantly assisted to establish.</p>
            <closer>

            <head>THE AUTHOR TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>IT is my request that the following Dramatic Composition may be considered only as a school piece. For though it is written according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed rules of the Drama, with the strictest atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the unities of time, place, and action, yet it differs materially from the greater part of those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern performances which have obtained the name of Tragedy. It is intended for the private entertainment of Gentlemen of taste, and martial enterprize, but by no means for the exhibition of the stage. The subject is not love but valour. I meddle not with any of the effeminating passions, but consecrate my muse to the great themes of patriotic virtue, bravery and heroism.</p>
            <p>With respect to the particular merit of the piece, I have only to say, that I flatter myself it would have been more deserving of attention, had it been drawn up in less haste. It is found by all who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it, that at least one year is necessary to the composition of a good Tragedy. The following was made out at different intervals in the space of a few weeks, and therefore, according to the rule before-mentioned, it must be supposed to come far short of perfection. Writing in this way is my amusement not my business. But here it may be observed, that no man pays attention to the time spent in composing, but to the merit of the performance when it makes its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. Could not I have kept this small affair to myself some time longer, if after that period, it would have been in my power to have produced it more elegant and pleasing? I answer, that one
<pb facs="unknown:015249_0008_0F9883AC3A9B8658"/>
great foundation of the merit of any performance is its being seasonable. An oration, eulogium, or production of any kind, in honour of our brave countrymen who have fallen, or of those who do yet contend in the glorious cause of freedom, is likely to do greater good and will be more acceptable at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, than hereafter when the foe is intirely repulsed and the danger over.</p>
            <p>For this reason I submit it in its present state to the candid and generous, with my promise, that when it shall be in my power to afford time to revise and amend it, I will endeavour to give it to the World in a Second Edition, more <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>finished.</hi>

                              <p>The Honorable the Continental Congress, appear to have been so struck, with this fact, which was amply authenticated to them, in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from His Excellency General Schuyler, as to have caused is to be published a second time, for the consideration of every American. What indeed could serve, to give us a more horrible idea, of the diabolical spirit of tyranny, than to have, presented to our view, General Carlton, or his officers, by his direction, convening the Indians, at Montreal; roasting an ox, and inviting them, under that symbol, to partake of a Bostonian? I know this may be called an Address to the Savages, in their own dialect, which is by strong imagery and visible representation; but certainly it is a style of figurative language, which only the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of an arbitrary and cruel Englishman, could in our age have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                              <p>The Poet Eschylus, painting a transaction, which happened, in the barbarous times of Greece, though he had at his command the whole tribe of Furies, Demons, and triple-headed Monsters, with which the antients had stored their infernals; yet could draw nothing from them, so black and terrible, as a representation of this nature. Little did he think, that what he then, in the heat of poetic fury, had conceived, would one day be reduced to matter of fact and plain practice, by those who call themselves a civilized people. In a dramatic piece, styled The Seven Commanders at Thebes, we have the description.</p>
                              <lg>
                                 <l>The seven dark Chiefs, in gloomy a titude,</l>
                                 <l>Stood round; and o'er the brazen shield, they slew,</l>
                                 <l>A sullen bull; then plunging deep their hands</l>
                                 <l>Into the foaming gore, with oaths invoked,</l>
                                 <l>Fierce war, mad fury, and blood-thirsting rage.</l>

                              <p>This would seem to be the very original whence General Carlton, had copied the idea of his cantico; so true is it that the same black passions, will in every age, produce the same dark thoughts and purposes.</p>

                        <l>With horrid passion, of inhuman war,</l>

                        <l>By that fell Demon, whom he hates and prays,</l>

                        <l>March to the Palace gate, and with a feint,</l>

                        <l>Along the precipice, and that sad stream,</l>

                        <l>You say, this day, we shall attack Quebec?</l>

Of freer nature; still at their command,</l>
                        <l>We must resign it, and content ourselves,</l>
                        <l>With some peculium, slave-like article,</l>

                        <l>Yes, as the culprit Gibeonite, the Jew,</l>

                        <l>Where you shall meet an Englishman, tell this,</l>

                        <l>Will they devour me, who have fought for them?</l>
                        <l>Let not soft mercy, turn your weapon's edge.</l>
                        <l>Fight valiantly—in every charge be first:</l>

                        <l>Your father's reputation. Go my son,</l>

                        <l>Let me deserve it, and go forth with you.</l>
                        <l>Some may be found, who would prefer this post,</l>
                        <l>Which, I shall hold, reluctantly. No Sir;</l>
                        <l>If, I have merited one thought from you,</l>
                        <l>Of praise, or confidence, in this long march,</l>

                        <l>I would go forth, and mingle in the attack,</l>

                        <l>In some few moments, when the early day,</l>
                        <l>Shall mix its breaking with departing shades,</l>
                        <l>And give a dubious light. This interval,</l>
                        <l>In conversation, we may here, exhaust.</l>
                        <l>Far other thought, O Campbell, fill'd my mind,</l>
                        <l>When first, a soldier, on the Abraham's heights,</l>
                        <l>I stood in arms. Then, in Britannia's cause,</l>
                        <l>I drew my sword, and charg'd the rival Gaul.</l>
                        <l>I felt for her a patriot's generous heat;</l>
                        <l>And step'd exultingly, when fair Quebec,</l>
                        <l>Saw British standards on her rocky walls.</l>
                        <l>Full, in my memory, I retain the view;</l>
                        <l>Each circumstance, as if but yesterday.</l>
                        <l>Here Monckton stood; there Townshend rang'd himself;</l>
                        <l>And here, great Wolfe, in noble strength of soul,</l>
                        <l>Array'd the battle, and the men in arms.</l>
                        <l>O mighty Wolfe, if yet, thy warlike shade,</l>
                        <l>Revisitest these heights, and rocky streams,</l>
                        <l>Be witness here, in this unnatural strife,</l>
                        <l>Where a mad mother doth her children stab.</l>
                        <l>You, when you fought, did not unsheath your sword</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="27" facs="unknown:015249_0030_0F9883BCB91EB228"/>
against your countrymen, and younger sons;</l>
                        <l>Did not excite, with cruel artifice,</l>
                        <l>The wild-wood Savage of the gloomy hill,</l>
                        <l>To drink Bostonian blood. No mighty shade;</l>
                        <l>Britannia then was free herself; her King,</l>
                        <l>Call'd not for butchers, to secure his sway</l>
                        <l>Tyrannical, and to be held with blood.</l>
                        <l>Unhappy reign of an inhuman George!</l>
                        <l>I saw it early, and withdrew myself,</l>
                        <l>To sweet retirement, on the Hudson's banks,</l>
                        <l>And am persuaded, that had mighty Wolfe,</l>
                        <l>Surviv'd his victory, his native isle,</l>
                        <l>O'er-run with parasites, that drink the looks</l>
                        <l>Of flatter'd Majesty, and base-born Lords,</l>
                        <l>Would have disgusted him. This western land,</l>
                        <l>With shades, and solitudes, and wood-crown'd hills</l>
                        <l>Had better pleas'd. He could have lov'd her glades,</l>
                        <l>O'er-hung with poplars, and the bending beech,</l>
                        <l>Fan'd by the Zephyr's gale. He could have lov'd,</l>
                        <l>The budding orchard, and the oak-tree grove,</l>
                        <l>And thought, no more, of luxuries enjoy'd</l>
                        <l>With prostitution of the free-born mind.</l>
                        <l>If Wolfe had liv'd, would he have drawn his sword,</l>
                        <l>In Britain's cause—in her unrighteous cause,</l>
                        <l>To chain the American, and bind him down?</l>
                        <l>O no, his soul, by Nature elegant,</l>
                        <l>With liberal sentiment and knowledge, stor'd,</l>
                        <l>Would not have suffered it; I rather think,</l>
                        <l>Nay, I well know it, that himself had led,</l>
                        <l>Perhaps, once more, an army to Quebec,</l>
                        <l>To drive these tyrants out. He had obey'd,</l>
                        <l>Rather, the dictates of an upright soul,</l>
                        <l>Than the commandment of a tyrant King.</l>
                        <l>But now the time, that we draw forth in arms,</l>
                        <l>Revolves to us. Then, through the standing tents,</l>
                        <l>

                              <p>It may be thought by some grave people, that the speech put into the mouth of Gen. Carlton, is inconsistent with his Excellency's character, who is in realty, as they believe, a mild and good-natured gentleman.</p>
                              <p>I honestly confess I have not had the happiness of a very intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his Excellency, either in England or America, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot say, certainly, what he may be in his more sober hours, when the moon and the evil spirit of tyranny ceases to act upon him. In this, however, I am clear, that at least once or twice in his life, he has discovered in his language, some degree of venom and malignity. His speech, in this place, is little more than a bare translation of his most famous proclamation, and his answer to the letter of the Congress ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to him, concerning his treatment of the prisoners in Canada. We can easily remember the good-natured epithets bestowed upon us in those very extraordinary compositions. Rebels, traitors, plunderers, murderers, paricides, lawless, faithless, perjured, base, ungrateful, bloody-minded men, were the smooth terms he made use of. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, in his opinion, were a contemptible set of men, with whom no exchange of prisoners was to be made, from whom no flag was to be received. Nay every letter of theirs, or writing of any kind, was to be rejected with disdain, or burned by the hands of the common hangman.</p>

For this reason I have been sometimes uneasy, least these words put into the mouth of General Carleton, should seem to give a colouring to his character, beyond the real complection of his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's conduct. But I find my conscience pretty much at ease in this matter, when I give my memory time to recollect the inhumanity of the officers and soldiers under his command to our prisoners, from the moment our affairs began to be on the decline in Canada. While the issue of the siege was yet doubtful, he affected to speak with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and, as some have told us, buried with the honours of war the corpse of Montgomery. As soon, however, as fortune began to shine fully out upon him, he grew warm in her rays, and like the viper in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, drew unusual poison from the more than usual heat, until his spirit in its every thought and purpose became virulent, and like the nature of a Devil, capable of feeding on the misery of mankind. I have conversed with those who saw the scalps warm from the heads of our countrymen. I have had the relation from their mouths who beheld the fires lighted up, and heard, with a soul paining sympathy, the horrid shrieks and gloomy howlings of the Savage tribes in the execution of the poor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who according to the threat of Carleton, were burned on an island in the river St. Lawrence, after our unfortunate surrender at the Cedars.</note> If we prevail, and drive them from the walls.

            <head>An ODE, in Honour of the <hi>Pennsylvania Militia,</hi> and the small Band of Regular <hi>Continental Troops,</hi> who, under General WASHINGTON, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Campaign in the depth of Winter, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> 1777, and repulsed the British Forces from the Banks of the <hi>Delaware.</hi>

               <l>NOW the foe had pierced far;</l>
               <l>Ireful in vindictive mood:</l>
               <l>Where the mighty Delaware,</l>
               <l>Pours his full resounding flood.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All behind, a bleeding soil;</l>
               <l>Every pleasant seat laid waste:</l>
               <l>Where the soldier rov'd for spoil,</l>
               <l>Or deflower'd the virgin chaste.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But, before, in prospect, lies</l>
               <l>Pennsylvania's happy State;</l>
               <l>Where the blooming arts arise;</l>
               <l>And the smiling Muses wait.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Satan, when from hell he came,</l>
               <l>Saw the new-created earth,</l>
               <l>And with hate's eternal flame,</l>
               <l>View'd its origin and birth.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus the British chiefs, that pain</l>
               <l>Feel which stings with keenest smart,</l>
               <l>When black malice swells the vein,</l>
               <l>Or pale envy checks the heart.</l>

Hear me, ye sons of that degenerate race,</l>

                  <l>The sacred preachers and the hoary sage,</l>
                  <l>The tender virgin and the matron's age,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>ON the white rocks which guard her coast,</l>
                  <l>Observant of the parting day,</l>
                  <l>Whose orb was half in ocean lost,</l>
                  <l>Reclin'd Britannia lay.</l>
                  <l>Wide o'er the wat'ry waste</l>
                  <l>A pensive look she cast,</l>
                  <l>And scarce could check the rising sigh,</l>
                  <l>And scarce could stop the tear, which trembled in her eye.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>"Sheathe, sheathe the sword, which thirsts for blood,</l>
                  <l>(She cry'd) deceiv'd, mistaken men!</l>
                  <l>Nor let your parent, o'er the flood,</l>
                  <l>Send forth her voice in vain.</l>
                  <l>Alas! no tyrant she;</l>
                  <l>She courts you to be free:</l>
                  <l>Submissive hear her soft command,</l>
                  <l>Nor force unwilling vengeance from a Parent's hand."</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Hear her, ye wise, to duty true,</l>
                  <l>And teach the rest to feel;</l>
                  <l>Nor let the madness of a few</l>
                  <l>Distress the public weal!</l>
                  <l>So shall the opening year assume</l>
                  <l>Time's fairest child, a happier bloom;</l>
                  <l>The white-wing'd hours shall lightly move,</l>

                  <l>Indignant scans the view;</l>
                  <l>Yet she disdain'd to heave a sigh,</l>
                  <l>Or drop a single tear from her enraged eye.</l>

                  <l>Old Freedom's sons disdain to yield,</l>
                  <l>Tho' they have sued in vain!</l>
                  <l>In truth no Rebels we,</l>
                  <l>Who live but to be free;</l>
                  <l>Who ne'er denied your mild command</l>
                  <l>But scorn the unjust vengeance of a Tyrant's hand.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Learn to be wise, and learn to know,</l>
                  <l>What all the world must own,</l>
                  <l>Your blessings from our blessings flow,</l>
                  <l>While commerce guards the throne.</l>
                  <l>Learn this, and let each future year</l>
                  <l>More radiant than the rest appear:</l>
                  <l>Let peace and plenty smile again,</l>
                  <l>And let fair freedom shine;</l>
                  <l>Thine was the fault, Britannia, then</l>
                  <l>Be reparation thine."</l>
