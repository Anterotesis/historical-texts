            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ORATION, DELIVERED AT <hi>BENNINGTON Auguſt</hi> 16th, 1799.</head>
            <p>ON an occaſion like the preſent, and in all aſſemblage like that before which I now ſtand, I am conſcious that great application to a ſubject is neceſſary, in order to inſtruct, and great ingenuity, in order to entertain. With reſpect to the firſt, that neceſſary proportion of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention due from the conductor of an extenſive, and in the preſent criſis, by no means enviable public buſineſs, from the father of a large and in no wiſe opulent family, (lately bereſt of its beſt ſupport, a remembrance of whoſe virtues calls the daily ſigh, and forces the nightly tear from my widowed recollection) will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim me not to have been capable of paying on the preſent occaſion. Should
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035599_0004_1005FC2FD0A15EB8"/>I fail in the ſecond reſpect, the ſhortneſs of my time for preparation, taken into view with my earneſt and ſincere wiſh to pleaſe, will make a large draught in my favor, on your well known and ofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced candor and generoſity.</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with theſe ideas, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, without further apology, to lay the thoughts and reſearches of a few leiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure hours before you, hoping to afford in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to ſome, to give pleaſure to others, and, if poſſible, to avoid offence to any.</p>
            <p>A worthy young gentleman of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity, when lately conducting a periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal publication, in a neighboring ſlate, devoted one quarter of it to beautiful col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections and original offays, calculated to raiſe the geni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and to mend the the heart; and adopted as it; motto, that beautiful and poetical ſentiment, "I have here made a noſegay of culled flowers, and bring nothing of my own but the thread that ties them." Unhappily for him, his culled flowers, or their appendages, ſmelt too ſtrongly like the cultivation of 1777 to ſuit the vicinity he had choſen for his reſidence. How it may fare with my
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035599_0005_1005FC315B7A0EC0"/>preſent effay, is not a matter of very great anxiety to me, want of leiſure having forced me to make very large, and even literal extracts, from various authors. If therefore, I can produce a fair claim to a handſome "ſtring to tie them," the praiſe of having judiciouſly ſelected and arranged important political truths (in the opinion of the preſent company) my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition will be fully gratified.</p>
            <p>An ingenious anonymous author, who wrote about the beginning of the preſent revolutionary war in Europe, remarks, "That the world has for ages been flooded by the blood of its inhabitants, thro' the caprices of tyrants, under the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kings, Emperors, Popes, &amp;c. and the miſery of millions demands of wiſdom, where is the power which eſtabliſhes and connects all the orders of a community, and on which they all depend? Where is the centre to which every thing tends, the principle from which all is derived the ſovereign that can do everything? Who can point out to us the form, the organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of that moral perſon, a ſociety or community, to which unity is neceſſary and of which liberty is the effect?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:035599_0006_1005FC32E6B7D998"/>
Theſe are indeed momentuous queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions: Satisfactory anſwers to them is not intereſting to a bare neighborhood, to a ſtate, or to a kingdom, but is of the moſt intimate concern to the world, and of the highest importance to the great family of man.</p>

            <p>It is, perhaps, of as great importance to the exiſtence and well being of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican governments, as any one principle whatever, that the public voice ſhould have a mode of expreſſing itſelf, and that ſuch mode ſhould form the baſis of every political conſtitution: For the ſupreme power itſelf can never be deputed, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſovereignty reſides in the body of the people, and he who wiſhes to ſubvert it, is a traitor to the commonwealth of freedom.</p>

            <p>Superſtition has been involved in the conſtitutions, and predominated in the governments of the world univerſally; ſometimes acting as an inſtrument, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as a director, and forever ſheltered from the aproach of reaſon, by its aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſanctity, and the ſuppoſed expediency of ſuporting the very conſtitutions, which it was ever ſecretly, and ſurreptitiouſly undermining.</p>
            <p>The Romiſh impoſture was perhaps the moſt remarkable in this reſpect of any upon record in the annals of modern hiſtory. It approached civil government in the garb of lowly meekneſs and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted

            <p>But the world became alarmed, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions revolted againſt the ſacred impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet melancholly to relate, they preſerved a ſacerdotal egg, in every neſt, which under one ſhape or other has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ghoſtly monſter, a little nicer but as ſatal quite to prey upon the vitals of liberty; until the eſtabliſhment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual governments in America, under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions which rejected prieſt-craſt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as a ſtate engine, gave an exalted leſion to mankind, and leaves religion ſubject to the diſcernment of every mind, as the great parent of the world, and him who taught as never man before or ſince taught men, has leſt that intereſting facred buſineſs.</p>

            <p>In conſonance to this idea, ſays the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of independence, written by the immortalized patriot Jefferſon, againſt whom the malevolence of toryiſm has ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpent its ſhafts in vain.
