            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT a time when the rights of men are deeply and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly violated, it certainly behoves every member of the community to stand forth, and as there may be, and no doubt are many sober and conscientious people, who at heart are real friends to their country and wish well to its cause, yet through a modest deference toward those in authority, or for fear of acting inconsistent with their religious profession, are, amidst a variety of sentiments, somewhat at a loss what step to take in these times of public difficulty: The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extract from the <hi>select</hi> works of William Penn, as lately re-printed in London by order of the people called Quakers, it is thought may be a means of removing from their minds those scruples which may have suspended their judgments, and held them in uncertainty; as we may hereby see, that a declaration and <hi>publick</hi> vindication of the people's natural and legal right to <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>property inviolate,</hi> was not inconsistent with the judgment, or contrary to the practice of this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally approved, wise, learned, prudent and pious man, who living much nearer a past aera of national difficulty than the present, and at a time when liberty to dissenters was not fully established, nevertheless was not restrained from asserting with manly and Christian boldness, what he was convinced to be the truth, uninfluenced by human fear, human favour, or any apprehension of offence to God.</p>

            <p>These laws are either fundamental, and so immutable; or more superficial and temporary, and consequently alterable.</p>
            <p>By Superficial Laws, we understand such acts, laws or statutes, as are suited to present occurrences, and emergencies of state; and which may as well be abrogated, as they were first made, for the good of the kingdom: For instance, those statutes that relate to victuals, cloaths, times, and places of trade, &amp;c. which have ever stood whilst the reason of them was in force; but when that benefit, which did once redound, fell by fresh accidents, they ended, according to that old maxim, <hi>Cessante ratione legis, cessat lex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Fundamental Laws I do not only understand such as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately spring from <hi>Synteresis.</hi> (that eternal principle of truth and sapience) more or less disseminated through mankind, which are as the corner-stones of humane structure, the basis of reasonable societies, without which all would run into heaps and confusion; to wit, <hi>Hones<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">I. An ownership, and undisturbed possession: That what they have, is rightly theirs, and nobody's else.</p>

               <p>The Saxons brought no alteration to these two fundamentals of our English government; for they were a free people, governed by laws, of which they <hi>themselves</hi> were the makers: That is, there was no law made without the consent of the people, <hi>de m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

First, That something was theirs, that <hi>no body else</hi> could dispose of. Secondly, That they had <hi>property</hi> by their own law, therefore they had a share in making their own laws. Thirdly, That the law was umpire between king and people; neither of them ought to <hi>infringe:</hi> This, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This second fundamental of our English Government, was no incroachment upon the Kings of more modern ages, but extant long before the Great Charter made in the reign of Henry III. Even as early as the Britains themselves; and that it continued to the time of Henry III. is evident from several instances.</p>
               <p>Caesar, in his commentaries, tells us, that it was the custom of the British cities, to elect their General, or Commander in Chief,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014360_0009_0F95DD5A60A938A8"/>
in case of war. Dion assures us, in the life of Severus the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that in Britain the people held a share in power and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is the modestest construction his words will bear. And Tacitus, in the life of Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ippa, says, "They had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, and that one great reason of their overthrow by the Romans, was, their not consulting with, and rely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng upon their Common Council." Again, both Beda, and Mat. Westminster tell us, that the Britains summoned a Synod, chose their modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and expelled the Pelagian creed. All which supposes POPU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAR ASSEMBLIES, with power to order national affairs.</p>
               <p>And indeed the learned author of the British Councils gives some hints to this purpose, that they had a Common Council, and called it Kyfr-ythen.</p>
               <p>The Saxons were not inferior to the Britains in this point, and story furnisheth us with more and plainer proofs. They brought this LIBERTY along with them, and it was not likely they should lose it, by transporting themselves into a country where they also found it.

               <p>That it was a British custom I will not affirm, but have some reason to suppose: For if the Saxons had brought it with them, they would also have left it behind them, and in all likelihood there would have been some footsteps in Saxony of such a law or custom, which we find not. I will not enter the lifts with any about this: This shall suffice me, that we find it early among the Saxons in this country, and if they, A FREE PEOPLE in their own country, settling themselves here as a new planted colony, did supply what was defective in their own government, or add some new freedom to themselves, AS ALL PLANTLRS ARE WONT TO DO, which are as those first and corner stones, THEIR POSTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY, with all care and skill, are to build upon, that itself will serve my turn to prove it a fundamental: That is, such a first principle in our English Government, by the agreement of the people, as ought not to be violated.

               <p>Be that as it will, juries the Saxons had; for in the laws of King Etheldred, about three hundred years before the entrance of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Duke, we find enacted, <hi>in singulis centuriis,</hi> &amp;c. thus Englished, <q>In every Hundred let there be a Court, and let twelve ancient Freemen, together with the Lord of the Hundred, be sworn, that they will not condemn the Innocent, or acquit the Guilty.</q> And so strict were they, of those ages, in observing this fundamental way of judicature, that Alfred put one his judges to death, for passing sentence upon a verdict (corruptly obtained) upon the votes of the jurors, three of twelve being in the negative.

amicably, that saith, "Let there be tweve men of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. six English and six Welsh, and let them deal justice both to English and Welsh.</p>
               <p>Also in those simple times, if a crime extended but to some shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful punishment, as pillory or whipping (the last whereof, as usual as it has been with us, was inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hitherto stories tell us of trials by juries, and those to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, in general terms, of freemen: But <hi>per pares,</hi> or by equals, came after, occasioned by the considerable Saxons neglecting that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and leaving it to the inferior people, who lost the bench, their ancient right, because they were not thought proper company for a judge or sheriff: And also from the growing pride of the Danes, who slighted such a rural judicature, and despised the fellowship of the mean Saxon freemen in public service. The wise Saxon King perceiving this, and the dangerous consequence of submitting the lives and liberties of the inferior (but not less useful) people to the dictates of any such haughty humour; and on the other hand, of subjecting the nobler sort to the suffrage of the inferior rank, did, with the advice of his Wittangemote, or Parliament, provide a third way, more equal and grateful, and by agreement with Gunthurn the Dane, settled the law of Peers, or equals; which is the envy of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the famous privilege of our English people: One of those three pillars the fabric of this ancient and free government stands upon.</p>
               <p>This benefit gets strength by time, and is received by the Norman Duke and his successors; and not only confirmed in the lump of other privileges, but in one notable case, for all, which might be brought to prove that the fundamental privileges mentioned in the Great Charter, 9 of Hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By all which it is, I hope, sufficiently and inoffensively manifested, that these three principles, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

No grant of new rights, but a new grant, or confirmation rather, of ancient laws and liberties, violated by King John, and restored by his successor, at the expence of a long and bloody war; which shewed them as resolute to keep, as their ancestors had been careful to make those excellent laws.</p>
               <p>And so I am come to the Great Charter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I stand amazed, how any man can have the confidence to say, these privileges were extorted by the Barons wars, when the King declares, that what he did herein was done freely: Or that they were new privileges, when the very tenor of the word proves the contrary: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here are the three fundamentals comprehended and expressed, to have been the RIGHTS and PRIVILEGES of ENGLISHMEN.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Ownership, consisting of LIBERTY and PROPERTY. In that it supposes Englishmen to be free, there's liberty; Next, that they have freeholds, there's property.</p>

How any representative, that has not only a mere trust to preserve fundamentals, the people's inheritance; but that is a representative that makes laws by virtue of this fundamental law, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the people have a power in legislation (the second principle proved by me) can have a right to REMOVE or DESTROY that fundamental? The fundamental makes the people free, this FREE PEOPLE makes a representative; Can this creature unqualify its creator? What spring ever rose higher than its head? The representative is, at best, but a true copy, an exemplification; the FREE PEOPLE are the original, not cancellable by a transcript: And if that fundamental which gives to the people a power of legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, be not nullable by that representative, because it makes them what they are; much less can that representative disse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

application, as well as making of the law, the other two are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; open to daily invasion, should it be our infelicity ever to have a violent Prince. For as PROPERTY is every day exposed where those that have it are destitute of power to hedge it about by law-making; so those that have both, if they have not a share in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the law, how easily is that hedge broken down?</p>
               <p>And indeed, as it is a most just and necessary, as well as ancient and honourable custom, so it is the Prince's interest: For still the people are concerned in the inconveniencies with him, and he is freed from the temptation of doing arbitrary things, and their importunitie; that might else have some pretence for such addresses, as well as from the mischiefs that might ensue such actions. It might be enough to say, that there are above fifty statutes now in print, besides its vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable antiquity, that warrant and confirm this <hi>legale judicium parium suorum,</hi> or the trial of Englishmen by their equals.</p>
               <p>But I shall hint at a few instances: The first is, the Earl of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster, in the 14th of Edw. II. adjudged to die without lawful trial of his Peers: And afterwards Henry, Earl of Lancaster, his brother, was restored. The reasons given were two: First, Because the said Thomas was not arraigned and put to answer. Second, That he was put to death without answer, or lawful judgment of his Peers. The like proceedings were in the case of john of Gaunt, <hi>p.</hi> 39 <hi>coram Rege.</hi> And in the Earl of Arundel's case, Rot. Parl. 4. Edw. 3, N. 13. Also in Sir John Alee's case 4. Edw. III. N. 2. Such was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction committed on the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>astings in the tower of London, by Richard III. But above all, the attainder of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, who was attainted of high treason, as appears Rot. Parl. 32, Hen VI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. of which saith Chief Justice Cook, as I remember, "Let oblivion take away the memory of so foul a fact, if it can; if not, however, let silence cover it."</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there was a statute obtained in the 11th of Hen. VII. in defiance of the Great Charter, which authorised several exactions, contrary to the <hi>free custom</hi> of this realm: Particularly in the case of juries, both assessing and punishing, by justices of assize and of the peace, without the fining and presentment of twelve freemen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Dudley were the great actors of those oppressions; but they were hanged for their pains, and that illegal statute repealed in the 1st of Hen. VIII. ch. 6.</p>
               <p>The consequence is plain; that fundamentals give rule to acts of Parliament, else Why was the statute of the 8th Edw. IV. ch. 2. Of liveries and information, by the discretion of the judges, to stand as an original, and this of the 11th of Hen. the VII. repealed as ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal? For, therefore, any thing is unlawful, because it transgresseth a law. But what law can an act of Parliament transgress, but that which is fundamental? Therefore trial by juries, or lawful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of equals, is by acts of Parliament confest to be a fundamental part of our government. And because Chief Justice Cook is so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

esteemed an oracle of the law, I shall in its proper place present you with his judgment upon the whole matter.</p>
               <p>V. These fundamentals are UNALTERABLE by a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which were the result and agreement of English freemen, collectively, the ancienter times not being acquainted with repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives: For the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Also that of King Ina, the Common Council, of the Elders and people of the whole kingdom: That is, the most or generality of the freemen of the kingdom; for all might come that pleased. It is not to be doubted but this continued after the Norman times, and that at Running Mead, by S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And so careful were the representatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the time of Edward III. of suffering their liberties and free customs to be infringed, that in matters of extraordinary weight, they would not determine, till they had first returned to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with their several counties or boroughs that delegated them.

but to hear and determine the same by their discretions; inflicting such penalty as the statutes, not repealed, imposed These, and other like oppressions and exactions, by the mean of Empson and Dudley, and their instruments, brought infinite treasure to the King's coffers, whereof the King himself, at the end, with great grief and compunction repented, as in another place we have observed.</p>
               <p>"This statute of the 11th of Hen.

               <p>I am sure, there is nothing I have offered in defence of English law-doctrine, that riseth higher then the judgment and language of this great man, the preservation and publication of whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, became the care of a great Parliament. And it is said of no inconsiderable lawyer, that he should thus express himself in our occasion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "The laws of England were never the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of any conqueror's sword, or the <hi>placita</hi> of any King of this nation; or, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and justice for their INVIOLABLE maintenance. I shall now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer some more general considerations for the PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY, and therein hint at some of those mischiefs that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low spoiling it, for conscience sake, both to Prince and People.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The reason of the alteration of the law, ought to be the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity of continuing it; but there can never be so much as the least inconveniency in continuing that of LIBERTY AND PROPERTY; therefore there can be no just ground for INFRING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING much less ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ogating the laws that secure them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. No man in England is born SLAVE to another; neither hath one right to inherit the sweat of the others brow, or reap the benefit of his labour, BUT BY CONSENT; therefore NO MAN should be deprived of his PROPERTY, unless he injure another man's, and then by legal judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Where LIBERTY and PROPERTY are VIOLATED, there must always be a state of force: And though I PRAY GOD that we never need those cruel remedies, whose calamitous effects we have too lately felt, yet, certainly, SELF-PRESERVATION is of all things dearest to men; insomuch that being not conscious to themselves of having done an ill thing, they, to defend their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forfeited privileges, chearfully hazard all they have in this world: So very strangely vindictive are the sons of men, in maintenance of their rights. And such are the cares, fears, doubts and inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities of that administration, as render empire a SLAVERY, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014360_0023_0F95DD4E886523B0"/>
dominion the worst sort of bondage to the possessor. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, nothing can give greater chearfulness, confidence, securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honour to any Prince, than ruling by law; for it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of title with power, and attracts love as well as it requires duty.</p>
               <p>Give me leave, without offence (for I have God's evidence in my own conscience, I intend nothing but a respectful caution to my superiors) to confirm this reason, with the judgment and example of other times. The Governors of the ELEANS held a STRICT HAND over the people; who, despairing of relief at h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>The state of SPARTA was grown powerful, and opprest the Thebans; They though but a weak people, whetted by despair, and the prospect of greater miseries, did, by the Athenians, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliver themselves from the Spartan Yoke.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any other considerable reason given for the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the CARTHAGINIAN state, than avarice and severity. More of this is to be found in Rawleigh's history of the world, l. 3 who hath this witty expression in the same story, l. 5. of a severe conduct. When a forced government, saith he, shall decay in strength, it will suffer, as did the old lyon, for the oppression done in his youth; being pinch'd by the wolf, goar'd by the bull, and kick'd also by the ass: The senseless mob.</p>

Truly, this is to justify what we condemn in Roman Catholicks. It is one of our main objections, that <hi>their church assumes a power of imposing religion,</hi> thereby denying men the liberty of walking by the rules of their own reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and precepts of holy writ: To whom, we oppose both. We say, the church is tyed to act nothing contrary to reason; and that holy writ is the declared law of Heaven, which to maintain, power is given to the true church. Now let us apply this argument TO OUR CIVIL AFFAIRS, and it will certainly end in a reasonable limitation of our legislators, that they should not impose that upon our understandings, which is inconsistent with them to embrace; nor offer any THE LEAST VIOLATION TO COMMON RIGHT. Do the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists say, Believe as the Church Believes? Do not the Protestants, and which is harder, legislators say so too? Do we say to the Romanists, at this rate, your obedience is blind, and your ignorance is the mother of devotion? is it not also true of our selves? Do we object to them, This makes your religion uncertain, one thing to day, and another to-morrow? Doth not our own case submit us to the like variation IN CI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILS? Have we not long told them, that under pretence of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, and not controuling her power, she hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a superstructure inconsistent with that foundation she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to build upon. And are not we the men IN CIVILS, that make our privileges rather to depend upon men, than laws, as she doth upon Councils, not Scripture? If this be not POPERY IN TEMPORALS, what is?</p>

               <p>The law <hi>gives</hi> no property, but <hi>protects</hi> the Possessor in it against violence. The first <hi>property</hi> a man hath, is his <hi>person, life and liberty;</hi> and as these are from God, and the right of all men, so he has provided means for the support of them unto all. The means of support of person and life, is food and raiment, arising either naturally from the fruits of the earth, spontaneously growing, animal creatures, or by the personal labour or industry of man. Cain, 'tis said, was a tiller of the ground, and Abel, a keeper of sheep. When Cain had cleared and cultivated a piece of ground and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated useful things thereon, <hi>that</hi> and those became the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Cain,</hi> by his personal labour, in which the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason will protect him against any thing but personal violence; and Abel, taking under his care and management some of the creatures he found most proper for his use and purpose, they became his property, by his care, labour, and pains, in which he was protected by the same law, and all just laws are no other than right reason declared by way of compact upon that principle of reason constituent of our <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But when the earth was filled with violence, God, by the element of water, destroyed the world, save <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, by whom he replenished it.

               </p>
               <p>In the Lord's absence, lamentable injustice, cruelty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulness, TYRANNY and OPPRESSION hath been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in civil state upon the inhabitants, and the "poor creatures have been held in great SLAVERY by their rulers; and all this he hath suffered, not as tho' he gave toleration for it, for his messengers and his witness in people's consciences have been reproving their ungodly ways." ALACK, I must be plain with you, my Lord hath been utterly exiled and greatly dishonoured by <hi>reason of such proceedings,</hi> as have been in this nation for these many years, through the corruption of all sorts of men <hi>in place and power;</hi> and tho' there was in this nation a day of great troubles, and wars, and contentions, and the wasting of much blood and earthly treasures, none of these things, I must tell you, fell without the ordering of my Master's hand. Wherefore, that you may be warned, I advise you to relieve the oppressed, break down all unjust laws, AND SET ALL PEOPLE FREE from unjust burthens, and let all oppression cease both in <hi>Church and Civil State,</hi> and all unjust judges and evil men in power, let all these be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the nation clean quitted and discharged even from all men and laws whatsoever, that have held <hi>under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> the persons, estates and consciences of the good people of this land, and let the nation be corrected, and all orders and places of men, and laws, and decrees, be purified; and let just, righteous and meek men, and such as have the fear and wisdom of God in them, without acceptation of birth, or otherwise, let such men have the power and judgment committed to them, to determine in things <hi>between man and
