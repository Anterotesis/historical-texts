            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
                  <p>AS I am of the Opinion, that little Manuals of the Sciences, if they could be well done, would be of good Uſe to young Beginners; what I aim at in this little Tract, is to be as uſeful to them as I can, in the Studies of <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks,</hi> and this in order to the more particular Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Morals,</hi> by giving as clear Definitions as I am able in few Words, of the principal Matters and Terms whereof thoſe Studies conſiſt; which I have endeavoured to do, in an Order of Thoughts, gradually ariſing one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a Manner as inſtructive as could well be, in ſo ſhort a Compaſs. I have alſo propoſed to ſhew how theſe Studies, taking their Riſe from the firſt Beginnings of Senſe, proceed on through the other Studies, to raiſe the Mind gradually to its higheſt Perfection and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>THO' I would not be too much attached to any one Author or Syſtem, excluſive of any others; yet whoever is verſed in the Writings of Biſhop <hi>Berkeley,</hi> will be ſenſible that I am in a particular Manner beholden to that excellent Philoſopher for ſeveral Thoughts that occur in the following Tract. And I cannot but recommend it to any one that would think with Exactneſs on theſe Subjects, to peruſe all the Works of that great and good Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (as well as thoſe of <hi>Locke, Norris,</hi> or <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch</hi> and <hi>Cambray</hi>) if it were for no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at leaſt for this, that they will, in the beſt Manner lead him to think cloſely, and to think for himſelf. And I was the rather willing to publiſh this <hi>Logick,</hi> becauſe I think <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Part of that Science, and that I apprehend it a great Damage to the Sciences that the old <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks</hi>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:006859_0006_102A867873A8DE68"/>
are ſo much neglected, and that they might be rendered the more pleaſant and uſeful by joining with them ſome Improvements of the Moderns.</p>
                  <p>THIS little Tract I have introduced with a ſhort <hi>General View</hi> of the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> wherein young Students may at once behold, as it were in Miniature, the Objects, Boundaries, Ends and Uſes of each of the Sciences; their Foundation in the Nature of Things; the natural Order wherein they lie, and their ſeveral Relations and Connections, both with Reſpect to one another, and to the general End, viz. <hi>our Happineſs,</hi> purſued thro' them all.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſeems to me as uſeful in the Inſtruction of young Beginners in the Sciences, as it is in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Geography</hi> to exhibit, firſt of all, a general Map of the whole terraqueous Globe, in order to a more particular Deſcription of the ſeveral Countries and Kingdoms in the following Maps; or in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> to give firſt a general Delineation of the whole Syſtem of the World, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the ſeveral particular Planets in the following Schemes. For, as in the <hi>natural World,</hi> one cannot have a juſt Notion of any particular Country, without conſidering its Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in relation to the whole Globe, nor of any particular Globe, without conſidering its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with reſpect to the whole Syſtem; ſo in the <hi>intellectual World</hi> (if I may ſo call it) neither can one have a juſt Notion of any particular Science, without conſidering it as it ſtands related to the whole <hi>Circle of Learning,</hi> and the general End purſued through the Whole. And ſuch a ſhort Draught may alſo be of ſome Uſe to Students, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and methodize their Thoughts, and enlarge their Minds, and at the ſame time engage their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Induſtry in the Purſuit of their Studies.</p>

LEARNING implies the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of every Thing uſeful to our Well-being and true Happineſs in this Life, or our ſupreme Happineſs in the Life to come. And as our <hi>Happineſs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Enjoyment of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> by the right Exerciſe of our Underſtandings, Affections, Wills and active Powers, it muſt take in every Thing that relates both to <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Practice, i. e.</hi> both to <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Art;</hi> for <hi>Science</hi> is the Knowledge of Truth conſidered ſpeculatively, and <hi>Art</hi> is the Knowledge of Truth conſidered as directive of our Practice for the attaining our true Good or Happineſs. And all the various

Parts of Learning may be reduced to theſe two, <hi>Philology,</hi> or the Study of <hi>Words</hi> and other Signs, and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or the Study of the <hi>Things</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. (I.) AS the Underſtandings of young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for the firſt fifteen or ſixteen Years of their Life, are not ripe enough to enter into the ſublimer Studies of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> it is neceſſary that during this Stage they ſhould be chiefly employ'd in the Study of <hi>Philology,</hi> or the Languages, to which ſhould be added the firſt Things in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> both which are moſt level to their juvenile Capacities, as they chiefly depend on the Imagination and Memory, which in Youth are moſt vigorous and tenacious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. (1.) WITH regard to Language, they muſt be early initiated in the Rudiments of <hi>Grammar,</hi> or the Rules of <hi>Speech,</hi> relating both to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Connection of Words, and this both in their Mother Tongue, and other Languages, eſpecially the <hi>French, Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in which let them go as far as may be in this firſt Stage of Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. (2.) AS ſoon as they have got a good No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>pure Speech</hi> by the Study of <hi>Grammar,</hi> let them learn the Nature of <hi>figurative Speech</hi> in <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> And from thence, as they go on to read the Claſſicks, let them learn the Uſe of the various Tropes and Figures in <hi>Oratory,</hi> which is the Art of true Eloquence, and explains the Topicks of Invention, the Rules of Diſpoſition or Order, and of Elocution or Delivery. And,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. (3.) AS they go on to read the ancient Hiſtorians, let them apply themſelves to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> conſidered as the Art of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and juſt Narration of true Matters of Fact
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:006859_0010_102A8680D2CBD808"/>
for the Benefit of Poſterity. And that they may underſtand the Ancients the better, they ſhould read the beſt modern Writers of Hiſtory, which that they may read with Advantage, they ought to have ſome eaſy Inſtruction in <hi>Geography</hi> and <hi>Chronology,</hi> and make uſe of the beſt ancient and modern Maps of thoſe Places, and Tables of thoſe Times, to which their Books relate, which will render what they read the more intelligible, and take the deeper Impreſſion on their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vide</hi> Magazine for <hi>October,</hi> 1748.</note> "Hiſtory is a large Field, in which they will ſee the wonderful Series of Providence; ſtrange Turns of Fortune, ſurprizing Occurrences, and an amazing Variety of Accidents; fooliſh Mortals labouring for Trifles, contending eagerly for Things they would be much happier without; ſome curſed in having their Wiſhes, raiſed to the utmoſt Height of Power and Grandeur, only to be thrown down thence with the greater Obloquy and Contempt; others pleaſing themſelves with their Obſcurity, and laughing at the Noiſe and Buſtle that ſurrounds them." All which tend to give the Youth a good Inſight into human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and lead them to true Wiſdom in their own Conduct.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. (4.) AS they go on to read the Poets, they ſhould get ſome Knowledge of <hi>Poetry,</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Art, being a juſt and lively Deſcription of Things or Perſons, either real or imaginary, with an Elevation and Dignity of Thought, and with the Advantages of Numbers and Harmony, and every Kind of Ornament that Language is capable of, which will qualify them the better to entertain themſelves with thoſe great Maſters of Wit and Eloquence. "There is ſomething
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:006859_0011_102A86834681F078"/>
charming in Verſe; ſomething that ſtrikes the Ear, moves the Soul, rouſes the Paſſions, and engages the Affections," while it fills the Soul with the moſt uſeful Inſtructions, attended with the moſt exquiſite Delight. "It ſeems to have been the firſt Way of Writing, and in ſome Countries even older than Letters, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to have been the Voice of infant Nature in her early Bloom and native Sweetneſs. In it the Ancients explained their Sentiments, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Laws, and delivered their Precepts of Morality in Fable; the People liked the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which came to them attended with Delight; and as they heard them with Pleaſure, ſo they retained them with Eaſe." To this Head of Language belongs the <hi>Art of Criticiſm,</hi> which teaches the true Force of Words and Phraſes, the Nature of Stile, and a true Taſte, ſo as to make a right Judgment of the Beauties and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of any Performance in either of theſe Kinds of Writings.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. WHILE Youth are acquainting themſelves with the Rudiments of <hi>Eloquence, Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> they ſhould alſo be learning the firſt and eaſieſt Things in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> (which indeed, as well as Words, do in ſome Meaſure belong to the Doctrine of Signs) eſpecially Things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Practice, both in <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> which will very much tend to engage and ſtrengthen their Attention, enlarge their Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ripen their Minds. And ſomething of <hi>natural Hiſtory,</hi> with the Arts of <hi>Drawing</hi> and <hi>Muſick,</hi> if they have a Taſte for it, will be very pleaſant and uſeful Amuſements. And theſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which they have begun in this firſt Period, and (it is to be hoped) made a conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:006859_0012_102A868646396DF8"/>
in, muſt be afterwards continued and carried to further Perfection, and made their Diverſion at Turns, while they</p>
                  <p n="8">8. (II.) PROCEED, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to the further Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their Underſtandings and active Powers, in the ſublimer Studies of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which is the Study of Truth and Wiſdom, or the Knowledge of <hi>Things,</hi> as being what they really are, together with a Conduct correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereunto, in the Purſuit of true Happineſs; to which they muſt go on when they are ſixteen or ſeventeen Years old. "And what concerns us in theſe more exalted Studies is, that we be very exact and careful to attend more to Things than Words, and endeavour to make ſuch Things our own as will prove real Accompliſhments to our Minds, and duly regulate both our Tempers and Manners; and ſuch are the Knowledge of GOD and <hi>ourſelves,</hi> for <hi>Philoſophia eſt Rerum Divinarum Humanarumque Scientia,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it, and comprehendeth every Thing, both ſpeculative and practical, upon theſe large and comprehenſive Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. THE firſt, which relates to GOD, takes in the whole Creation; the full Extent of Being; for by the Contemplation of the Effects we ariſe to the Cauſe. "And as by conſidering that wonderful and amazing Power, that All-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending Wiſdom, that inimitable Beauty, that ſurprizing Harmony, that immutable Order, which abundantly diſcover themſelves in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Government of the Univerſe, we are led to their divine Original, who is the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted Source, the glorious Fountain of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;" ſo by making due Reflections on the Operations of our own Minds, and the large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:006859_0013_102A8687D35EE0A8"/>
of our intellectual Faculties and their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; their ſeveral diſtinct Exertions, and their Subſerviency to each other; the free Activity of our Souls, and the various Paſſions that put them on Action for attaining our ſeveral Ends; and the various Ways wherein they exert themſelves, and exerciſe their Dominion over our Bodies; we may attain, in ſome good Meaſure, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ourſelves, as well as of GOD, our chief Good, and the certain Means we muſt uſe, and the Method we muſt take to ſecure our true Happineſs in the Enjoyment of Him, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and one another. In order to the raiſing our Minds to theſe ſublime Speculations, and to regulate our Actions in theſe noble Purſuits, it is neceſſary that we be able to form to ourſelves clear Ideas and Conceptions of thoſe <hi>Beings</hi> or Things on which we contemplate, whether <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> or <hi>Spirits:</hi> To the Attainment of which,</p>
                  <p n="10">10. (1.) <hi>LOGICK,</hi> or the Art of Reaſoning, is very requiſite, the Foundation of which is <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks,</hi> or the <hi>Philoſophia prima,</hi> which, by ſome, hath been called <hi>Ontology,</hi> and is the nobleſt and moſt elevated Part of Science. It begins with ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects, and from them takes its Riſe to Things purely intellectual, and treats of <hi>Being</hi> abſtracted from every particular Nature, whether <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of all the general Diſtinctions, Connections and Relations of Things, whether ſenſible or intellectual, and ſo lays a Foundation for clear and juſt Reaſoning, while we proceed upon ſtable and unerring Principles. Which Foundation being laid, <hi>Logick</hi> teacheth us the Rules of thinking regularly, and <hi>reaſoning</hi> juſtly, whereby we learn to diſtinguiſh <hi>Truth</hi> from <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood,</hi> and proceed from Things <hi>ſimple</hi> to Things
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:006859_0014_102A8689C8126030"/>
                     <hi>compound,</hi> and from Things precarious and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent</hi> to Things <hi>neceſſary,</hi> ſtable and eternal, which therefore will reſult in the cleareſt and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Views, both of all other Things, and of the adorable Excellencies of the divine Nature, that our little Minds are capable of.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. (2.) FROM theſe general Principles and Laws of Reaſoning, we proceed to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, firſt in the Study of <hi>Quantity</hi> in general, whether <hi>Number</hi> or <hi>Magnitude,</hi> in the ſublimer <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> or the Arts of Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And here again opens a noble Scene of eternal Truth, in the Demonſtration of a vaſt Number of Theorems and Problems, both <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical</hi> and <hi>Geometrical,</hi> to which <hi>Algebra</hi> is wonderfully ſubſervient, in the Contemplation both of <hi>Lines, Surfaces</hi> and <hi>Solids,</hi> in all their endleſs Varieties and Proportions; which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to proceed with the greater Advantage in the Study of Nature, and without which we cannot read with Underſtanding the beſt Things that have been written on that Subject. This Sort of Study hath likewiſe a direct Tendency to lead us to an admiring Senſe of the Deity, in whoſe infinite Treaſures of eternal Truth, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe Connections and Demonſtrations, who hath made all Things in Number, Meaſure and Weight. To this Head belong, <hi>Trigonometry, Geodaeſia, Stereometry,</hi> the Doctrine of the <hi>Sphere</hi> and <hi>Cylinder,</hi> and of <hi>Conic Sections</hi> and <hi>Fluxions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. (3.) FROM the Contemplation of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> we go on next to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it in <hi>Concrete,</hi> or in the Objects of Senſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> as blended with the other ſenſible Qualities, in the endleſly various Bodies that compoſe this mighty Frame of Heaven and

Earth, and the Principles and Laws of Motion, on which their Phaenomena depend, which are the Subjects of <hi>Phyſicks</hi> or <hi>natural Philoſophy:</hi> The Foundation of which is <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> which explain the Nature of <hi>Bodies</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and the <hi>Forces</hi> by which they move; and demonſtrate the various Laws of their <hi>Motion.</hi> To which belong <hi>Staticks, Hydroſtaticks</hi> and <hi>Pneumaticks.</hi> Upon which we proceed in <hi>Geology,</hi> or <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, to contemplate this <hi>Globe of Earth,</hi> in all its Parts and Furniture; the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fire, Air, Water and Earth; the Stones, Mines, Minerals, Meteors, Plants, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and particularly the wonderful Structure of our own Bodies. Here therefore belong, <hi>Opticks, is Muſick, Geography, Navigation</hi> and <hi>Commerce; Lithology, Metallology</hi> and <hi>Meteorolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Agriculture, Chemiſtry</hi> and <hi>Botanics, Anatomy, Surgery</hi> and <hi>Medici<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> and every Thing uſeful in Life. And, laſtly, from the Earth we launch forth into the vaſt and unmeaſurable Aether, and in <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> we contemplate the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> both fixed and erratick; and particularly our <hi>Sun,</hi> with his ſplendid Chorus of <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Comets,</hi> with their Orbits, Magnitudes and Denſities, and the Laws of their Motions in the Tides of their Fluids, and their diurnal and annual Revolutions: To which belong <hi>Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> and <hi>Dialling.</hi> And the <hi>Facts</hi> in all <hi>Nature</hi> are related in <hi>Natural Hiſtory.</hi> "All which open upon us an amazing Scene, in which Nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays her ſurprizing <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and invites us heedfully to conſider her wonderful Productions, and trace out infinite Wiſdom, Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thro' the immenſe Spaces, from the Heights above to the Depths below, from the glorious

Orbs which roll over our Heads, to the minuteſt Inſects that crawl under our Feet, and even Things either vaſtly minute or diſtant that eſcape the Ken of our naked Eye. From all which we are led to behold, acknowledge, admire and adore the great Author of all Things." And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares us,</p>
                  <p n="13">13. (4.) TO proceed a Step higher, and from the <hi>Senſible</hi> or <hi>Natural World,</hi> to go on to the Contemplation of the <hi>Intelligent</hi> or <hi>Moral World;</hi> from the World of <hi>Bodies,</hi> to the World of <hi>Spirits,</hi> which, as ſuch, being intelligent and moral Agents, are the great Subject of <hi>Ethics,</hi> or <hi>moral Philoſophy.</hi> The Foundation of which is <hi>Pneumatology,</hi> or the Doctrine of <hi>Spirits;</hi> in which, we begin with our own Souls, their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Operations, both perceptive and active; and thence proceed to other Orders of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and ſo gradually riſe to the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Contemplation of the DEITY, the great Father of Spirits, and the ſupreme Lord and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the whole Creation, which is called <hi>Theology.</hi> And when we have learn'd juſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Him and ourſelves, we from thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively deduce the great Principles of that Duty which we owe to Him, ourſelves and one another (which opens another glorious Scene of eternal Truth) the Performance of which, doth, in the Nature of it, tend to our higheſt Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Happineſs.

                  <p n="14">14.

of Truth, which is the Buſineſs of that Science which is called <hi>LOGIC,</hi> or <hi>The Art of Thinking</hi> or <hi>Reaſoning;</hi> the Foundation of which is the <hi>Philoſophia prima,</hi> which is alſo called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſics</hi> and <hi>Ontology,</hi> or <hi>the Doctrine of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notion of Being, with its various Properties and Affections,</hi> and <hi>thoſe applied in general both to Body and Spirit.</hi> And as <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> are nearly allied, being in effect but the ſame Thing under different Conſiderations; this will pave the Way towards the Attainment of that ſupreme Good, in the Choice and Enjoyment of which conſiſts our higheſt Happineſs; the particular Conſideration of which is the Buſineſs of <hi>Ethics,</hi> or <hi>Moral Philoſophy,</hi> which is <hi>the Art of purſuing our higheſt Happineſs by the univerſal Practice of Virtue.</hi>

ourſelves, or rather feel ourſelves to be, fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhed with thoſe Objects and Powers, and under thoſe Confinements and Limitations, under which it hath pleaſed our great Creator to place us in this preſent State.</p>
                     <p n="3">§ 3. WE are, at preſent, <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Minds</hi> connected with groſs, <hi>tangible Bodies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Body and Mind.</note> in ſuch a Manner, that as our Bodies, can perceive and act nothing but by our Minds, ſo, on the other Hand, our Minds perceive and act by Means of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Organs. Such is the preſent Law of our Nature, which I conceive to be no other than a meer arbitrary Conſtitution or Eſtabliſhment of Him that hath made us to be what we are.—And accordingly I apprehend that the Union between our Souls and Bodies, during our preſent State, conſiſts in nothing elſe but this Law of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the Will and perpetual <hi>Fiat</hi> of that infinite Parent Mind, who made, and <hi>holds our Souls in Life,</hi> and <hi>in whom we live, and move, and have our Being,</hi> viz. That our Bodies ſhould be thus acted by our Minds, and that our Minds ſhould thus perceive and act by the Organs of our Bodies, and under ſuch Limitations as in fact we find ourſelves to be attended with.</p>

whether ſenſible or intellectual, in the eternal Mind, conformable to which all Things exiſt; or the abſtract Eſſences of Things, as being Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals or <hi>Archetypes</hi> in that infinite Intellect, of which our Ideas or Conceptions are a Kind of Copies.—But perhaps, for the more diſtinct un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ourſelves upon this Subject, it may be beſt to confine the Word <hi>Idea</hi> to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Objects of Senſe and Imagination, which was the original Meaning of it; and to uſe the Word <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Conception,</hi> to ſignify the Objects of Conſciouſneſs and pure Intellect, tho' both of them may be expreſſed by the general Term <hi>Thought;</hi> for theſe are ſo entirely, and <hi>toto Coelo</hi> different and diſtinct one from the other, that it may be apt to breed Confuſion in our Thoughts and Language, to uſe the ſame Word promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for them both; tho' we are indeed general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to ſubſtitute ſenſible Images and the Words annexed to them, to repreſent Things purely intellectual; ſuch, for Inſtance, are the Words, <hi>Spirit, Reflect, Conceive, Diſcourſe,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. OUR Minds may be ſaid to be created meer <hi>Tabulae raſae;</hi> i. e.

with that great Parent Mind, to whoſe inceſſant Agency they are entirely paſſive, both in all the Perceptions of Senſe, and in all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Light by which they perceive the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the pure Intellect.—Notwithſtanding which, it is plain from Experience, that in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe Perceptions they are entirely at Liberty to act, or not to act, and all their Actions flow from a Principle of Self-exertion.—But in order the better to underſtand theſe Things, I muſt more particularly define theſe Terms.— And, as all the Notices we have in our Minds derive to them originally from (or rather by Means of) theſe two Fountains, <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs,</hi> it is neceſſary to begin with them.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. BY <hi>Senſe,</hi> we mean, thoſe Perceptions we have of Objects <hi>ab extra,</hi>

IN the Perception of theſe Ideas or Objects of Senſe,<note place="margin">In which we are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</note> we find our Minds are meerly paſſive, it not being in our Power (ſuppoſing our Organs rightly diſpoſed and ſituated) whether we will ſee Light and Colours, hear Sounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are not Cauſes to ourſelves of theſe Perceptions, nor can they be produced in our Minds without a Cauſe; or (which is the ſame Thing) by any imagined unintelligent, inert, or unactive Cauſe (which indeed is a Contradiction in Terms) from whence it is Demonſtration that they muſt derive to us from an Almighty, intelligent active Cauſe, exhibiting them to us, impreſſing our Minds with them, or producing them in us; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as I intimated) it muſt be by a perpetual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of our Minds with the DEITY, the great Author of our Beings, or by His perpetual Influence or Activity upon them, that they are poſſeſſed of all theſe Objects of Senſe, and the Light by which we perceive them.</p>
                     <p n="8">§ 8. THESE Ideas or Objects of Senſe are commonly ſuppoſed to be Pictures or Repreſentations of Things without us,<note place="margin">Ideas of Senſe not Pictures, but the real Things.</note> and indeed external to any Mind, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that of the Deity himſelf, and the Truth or Reality of them is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to conſiſt in their being exact Pictures of Things or Objects without us, which are ſuppoſed to be the real Things.—But as it is impoſſible for us to know what is without our Minds, and conſequently, what thoſe ſuppoſed Originals are, and whether theſe Ideas of ours are juſt Reſemblances of them or not; I am afraid this Notion of them will lead us into an inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Scepticiſm. I am therefore apt to think that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006859_0030_102A86F3605ADA28"/>

as 2+2=4 and any two <hi>Right Angles</hi> are equal to each other, having the ſame, or an equal Number of Parts or Degrees. On the contrary, we ſay Things are <hi>Unequal,</hi> when one is <hi>Greater,</hi> and the other <hi>Leſs,</hi> as 3 is more than 2, a <hi>Right Angle</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> than an <hi>Acute,</hi> and <hi>leſs</hi> than an <hi>Obtuſe,</hi> &amp;c.

we call an <hi>Individual,</hi> whether it be a <hi>Body,</hi> or a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in order the better to think and ſpeak of it, we give it a proper Name, as, to this <hi>Man</hi> the Name of <hi>John,</hi> to that, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> to this <hi>Horſe,</hi> the Name <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> to that <hi>Dog,</hi> the Name <hi>Argus,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p n="27">§ 27. IT is of great Importance, in order to think clearly and juſtly,<note place="margin">Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Spirits.</note> to take Care that we have as exact a Notion as poſſible of all thoſe Properties in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kind of Being, that do eſſentially diſtinguiſh one from another, that we may make our <hi>Definitions</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> juſt, and avoid as far as poſſible, that Perplexity of Thought and Expreſſion which ariſeth from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding one Thing with another.

of the Exiſtence of Spirits than of Bodies, nor have we a leſs clear Notion of the one than the other. I am as intuitively certain of my own Exiſtence by Conſciouſneſs, as of the Exiſtence of Bodies by Senſe, and am as demonſtratively ſure of the Exiſtence of other Spirits, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the eternal Parent Mind, as I am of any Thing imaginable, whatſoever: Nay (as I ſaid) upon due Conſideration, it will appear that the Evidence and Reality here hath much the Advantage. And I do as clearly and perfectly know what I mean, when I ſay <hi>I</hi> or <hi>myſelf,</hi> as when I ſay <hi>my Body;</hi> and have as clear a Notion of the Meaning or Conceptions annexed to the Words, <hi>Senſe, Imagination, Conſciouſneſs, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Reaſon, Pleaſure, Averſion, Activity, Self-exertion,</hi> &amp;c. as of the Meaning or Ideas annexed to the Words, <hi>Extenſion, Figure, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, Motion, Colour, Sound, Heat, Cold, Sweet, Bitter,</hi> &amp;c.

VII. § 16.) <q>As the Mind is better acquainted with ſome Sort of Objects which are earlier ſuggeſted to it, ſtrike it more ſenſibly, or are more eaſily comprehended than others, it is naturally led to ſubſtitute theſe Objects for ſuch as are more ſubtil, fleeting or difficult to conceive. Nothing, I ſay, is more natural than to make the Things we know, a Step to thoſe we do not know; and to repreſent and explain Things leſs familiar, by others that are more ſo. Now it is certain we imagine before we reflect, and we perceive by Senſe before we imagine, and of all our Senſes, the Sight is the moſt clear, diſtinct, various, agreeable and comprehenſive. Hence it is natural to aſſiſt the Intellect by Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Imagination by Senſe, and the other Senſes by Sight. Hence Figures, Metaphors and Types. We illuſtrate ſpiritual Things by corporeal; we ſubſtitute Sounds for Thoughts, and written Letters for Sounds; Emblems, Symbols and Hieroglyphics, for Things too obſcure to ſtrike, and too various or too fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be retained: We ſubſtitute Things ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable for Things intelligible; ſenſible Things for imaginable; ſmaller Things for thoſe too great to comprehend eaſily, and greater Things for ſuch as are too ſmall to be diſcerned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly; preſent Things for abſent; perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for periſhing; and viſible for inviſible. Hence the Uſe of Diagrams: Hence Right
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006859_0072_102A87C11BEB5AA8"/>
Lines are ſubſtituted for Time, Velocity and other Things of very different Natures. Hence we ſpeak of Spirits in a figurative Stile, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Operations of the Mind by Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Terms borrowed from ſenſible Things, ſuch as, <hi>apprehend, conceive, reflect, diſcourſe,</hi> and the like. And hence thoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories which illuſtrate Things intellectual by Viſions exhibited to the Fancy.</q>—Hence alſo it is that we conceive and ſpeak of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by <hi>Analogy</hi> from the greateſt Perfections in ourſelves, ſuch as <hi>Knowledge, Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, Goodneſs,</hi> &amp;c. which we ſubſtitute to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his infinite Perfections, removing all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation and Imperfection.—And hence it is that in the Revelation which God hath made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Diſpenſations towards Mankind, he cloaths himſelf with human Parts and Paſſions, in order to render himſelf in ſome Meaſure intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, and moreover, teacheth us, what (to all practical Purpoſes, which are chiefly aimed at) it concerneth us to know of him and his Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with us, by Things and Relations familiar among our ſelves, ſuch as, the Sun, Light and Life, <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit, Mediator, Redeemer, Prieſt, Propitiation, King, Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. All which gracious Accommodations to our low Capacities, we muſt always ſo underſtand and explain as to imply nothing contradictious or unworthy of his infinite Excellency, implied in either his natural or moral Perfections.—Thus much of the Mind's <hi>ſimple Apprehenſion</hi> of its Objects, and their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ariſing from our comparing them one with another, and the Manner of our conceiving and expreſſing them.</p>

And when any Propoſition is ſupported with all the Reaſons it is, in the Nature of it, capable of, and there remains no ſufficient Reaſon to doubt of the Truth of it, we are then ſaid to have a <hi>moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> and our Aſſent to it is called a <hi>Perſuaſion,</hi> which implies a ſettled Acquieſcence of the Mind in the Truth of it.</p>

That <hi>thoſe Things which agree or differ in a Third, muſt agree or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer between themſelves;</hi> this is called <hi>Sagacity.</hi>— To which Purpoſe it is neceſſary that we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to conſider the Whole of Things, and as far as we can, make ourſelves Maſters of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and in many Caſes it may be of good Uſe to have Recourſe to the ſeveral Topicks above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the ſecond Chapter, Cauſes, Effects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And as all our Reaſoning takes its Riſe from ſelf-evident Propoſitions, we muſt ſee to it, that the Connexion between them and thoſe we would prove, be made as clear and evident as poſſible before we proceed to a Concluſion.

Repugnancy between themſelves: This is called <hi>Illation.</hi>—Thus, ſuppoſe the Queſtion were, <hi>Whether Virtue be more valuable than Riches?</hi>—I firſt conſider the Nature of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> in all their Properties and Relations; I compare them with each other, and particularly with regard to our <hi>Happineſs,</hi> which alone can render any Thing more or leſs valuable to us; and then, from that general ſelf-evident Propoſition, That, <hi>what moſt contributes to our Happineſs is moſt valuable,</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, That, <hi>ſince Virtue conduceth vaſtly more to our Happineſs than Riches,</hi> it muſt upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>be vaſtly more valuable.</hi>

the other, or of all the reſt, if there be more than two; or the taking away of the latter, or all the reſt, if more than two, muſt infer the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the former; as, <hi>Every Man ſerves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God or Mammon:</hi> Peter <hi>ſerves God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot ſerve Mammon:</hi> or, Judas <hi>ſerves Mammon, therefore cannot be a Servant of God.</hi> And to give an Inſtance where there are more than two, <hi>Every Action is either good, bad or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; but to relieve a poor Man is a good Action;</hi> therefore it is <hi>neither bad nor indifferent;</hi> or, it is <hi>neither bad nor indifferent;</hi> therefore <hi>it is a good Action.</hi>

ſelf-exiſtent, or have derived from meer Chance; but it could neither be ſelf-exiſtent nor derive from Chance; therefore it muſt have been created by God. Sorites</hi> is a Method of arguing in a Series of Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo connected together, that the Predicate of the firſt becomes the Subject of the ſecond, and ſo on, till we come to a Concluſion, in which the Predicate of the laſt Propoſition appears from thoſe intermediate Propoſitions to be connected with the Subject of the firſt. For an Example of the <hi>Sorites,</hi> we may ſet down the following Way of Reaſoning, to prove the natural Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Soul is a conſcious, intelligent, active, ſelf-exerting Being.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A conſcious, intelligent, active, ſelf-exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Being, as ſuch, is intirely of an oppoſite and different Nature and Kind from that of Bodies, and therefore can have nothing common with them but bare Exiſtence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Being that, as ſuch, is intirely of a different Nature from Bodies, and hath nothing beſides Exiſtence common with them, can have no corporeal Properties and Affections, ſuch as ſolid Extenſion, Continuity of Parts, and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Diſcerpibility.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Being that, having no corporeal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and ſo does not conſiſt of ſolid extended Parts, diviſible or diſcerpible, cannot be naturally liable to a Diſſolution.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. What is not, in the Nature of it, liable to a Diſſolution, muſt be naturally immortal. <hi>Ergo,</hi>

THOUGH the Rules given above, if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended to,<note place="margin">Of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms.</note> would effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſophiſtical Reaſoning; yet it may not be amiſs to add a few Words concerning what are called <hi>Sophiſms</hi> or falſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings; among which, the chief are, 1. That which is called <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> which is, when the Diſpute proceeds upon a Miſtake, occaſioned by not attending to the true Meaning or State of the Queſtion. 2. <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> which is, when in pretending to argue, the Thing is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted which was to be proved; this we call Begging the Queſtion. 3. <hi>Fallacia qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor terminorum,</hi> which is, when the intermediate Term bears a different Senſe in the Minor, from the Senſe in which it was uſed in the Major. 4. <hi>Non Cauſa pro Cauſa,</hi> which is, when that is, by Miſtake, taken for a Cauſe, which was not the Cauſe; as, when a Perſon receives his Health conſequent to the uſing ſuch a Medicine, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it to that, when perhaps it might really be owing to a Medicine which he had uſed before. And 5thly, the laſt I ſhall mention, is that which ariſeth from what is called the <hi>Aſſociation of Ideas,</hi> where becauſe ſuch Ideas are connected meerly by Cuſtom, we are apt to conceit they are connected in Nature, as Terrors with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. On which Account it is of great Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Education, to take Care that no Ideas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come aſſociated by Habit or Cuſtom but thoſe that are connected in Nature; and on the other Hand, that thoſe Ideas that are really connected in Nature be aſſociated by Habit or Cuſtom, that a Senſe of their Connection may operate with the greater Force in the Conduct of Life. And thus much for <hi>Syllogiſm.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</note> which is only a regular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in connecting a large Series of Reaſonings or Inſtructions on any Subject, and therefore truly belongs to this Part of Logick which treats of Reaſoning. For in delineating a whole Science, or treating on any large Subject, it is neceſſary to purſue it thro' a long Chain of Reaſoning, or a whole Series of Propoſitions mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually related; in which it is of great Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, both for the clearer underſtanding it, and the better remembering it, that we carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Order that Nature itſelf points out to us; ſo as to begin with what is plain and ſimple, and thence to proceed gradually to what is more compounded and obſcure; ſo ordering and rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Things through the whole Proceſs, that what goes before may continually reflect Light upon what is to follow, and pave the Way to it; and taking the utmoſt Care to preſerve Evidence, or at leaſt the higheſt poſſible Degree of Probability in every Step, till we arrive at the higheſt Truth and Good, or the Concluſion we aim at.—In order to which, the beſt Thing we can do, is to obſerve diligently the Manner in which the beſt Writers proceed, in treating on any Subject they propoſe to handle, and particularly, the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, and Moraliſts.—Now, I ſay, ſuch a Series of Reaſonings we call <hi>Method;</hi> which, if it begin with Effects, and ariſeth to the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Cauſes, or with particular Facts, Parts or Properties, and ariſeth gradually to the Whole, and to general Principles, and Concluſions, it is called the <hi>Analytical Method.</hi>—But if it begin with Cauſes already diſcovered, and deſcend to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:006859_0091_102A883629491398"/>
Effects, or with general Principles, and deſcend, by the Application of them, to the Illuſtration or Proof of Particulars or Facts, it is called the <hi>Synthetical Method.</hi>—The firſt is uſed in ſearching and diſcovering Truth; the ſecond chiefly in teaching it in the moſt compendious Manner, when it is diſcovered.</p>

That we habitually conſider the Knowledge of <hi>Truth,</hi> as being the higheſt Perfection and Happineſs of our Minds, which therefore ſhould be our grand Purſuit, ſeparate from every other Conſideration. 2. That accordingly we poſſeſs ourſelves of an ardent and diſintereſted Love of Truth, for its own intrinſic Excellency; and of the utmoſt Averſion to all Falſhood and Deceit, or being any ways miſled or impoſed upon by falſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and deluſive Appearances. 3. That in order to this, we honeſtly endeavour as much as poſſible to diveſt ourſelves of all ſiniſter Views and Prejudices, in favour of any vulgar Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pre-conceived Schemes, or worldly Intereſts, and guard ourſelves againſt every untoward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite or Paſſion, that may darken or byaſs our Minds, and ſo keep them as calm as poſſible, and open and ready to the Impreſſions of the naked Truth. 4. In order the better to come at Truth, we muſt endeavour to conſider, with the utmoſt

Attention, the Things themſelves, with all their various Relations and Connections, diveſted of the Deluſions and Ambiguities of Words, which are many times apt to miſlead us. 5. And laſtly, we muſt enlarge our Views as much as poſſible, ſo as to take the Whole of Things into our Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, without which we cannot make any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judgment of what relates to Particulars. If we would faithfully obſerve theſe and the like Rules for the Conduct of our Underſtandings, and at the ſame time, be, above all Things, concerned to do our Duty, and to know the Truth, with this honeſt View, to be governed by it in Heart and Life, with all Humility, and <hi>without Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality or Hypocriſy,</hi> we ſhould not be in Danger of being miſled into any great or dangerous Miſtakes, but ſhould attain to know the Truth, <hi>and the Truth would make us free.</hi>—And thus much for the ſeveral Objects and Operations of the Underſtanding, which are the Subject of <hi>Logicks.</hi>

according to what was obſerved above (Chap. I. § 12.) we are to treat, 1. Of our <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi> or <hi>diſaffecting</hi> Things, according as they appear good or bad. 2.

joined with a <hi>Conſciouſneſs</hi> of its Perceptions.— Warmth and Hunger, and probably ſome Pains, are, perhaps, all the Senſations it hath before its Birth; and when it comes into the Light of this World, it is directly impreſſed with the Senſe of Light and Colours, as well as Sounds, Taſtes, Odours, and frequent uneaſy and painful Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which ſtill more and more awaken its Conſciouſneſs; and every freſh Notice of Senſe and Conſciouſneſs, ſtill goes on to excite its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and engage its Attention. And being a perfect Stranger to every Thing about it, it hath every Thing to learn; to which it diligently applies itſelf, as its Conſciouſneſs more and more awakens, upon the Repetition, every Moment, of freſh Impreſſions of Senſe; till, by Degrees, having a great Number of Feelings, Taſtes, Odours, Sounds, and viſible Objects, frequently repeating their ſeveral Impreſſions, its conſcious Memory ſtill enlarging, it begins, by Means of the intellectual Light, with which it finds its Conſciouſneſs attended, gradually to collect and recollect the ſeveral Relations and Connections it obſerves to obtain among its various Ideas: And at length, when it is in Eaſe, it diſcovereth a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Curioſity and Delight in obſerving theſe Connections, as well as being impreſſed with new Ideas.</p>
                     <p n="2">§ 2. IT hath been made very evident both by Reaſoning and Experiment,<note place="margin">Of its Learning, Connexions and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</note>

that the one hath the Nature of a Language with Regard to the other, and that the Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them is to be learned only by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as that between Words and the Things ſignified by them:" And particularly, that as all viſible Objects or Ideas are only in the Mind; ſo a Man born blind, and made to ſee, which muſt alſo be the Caſe of Infants, can have at firſt no Notion of Diſtance, nor of any Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Things viſible and tangible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that both Diſtance and that Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be learn'd by long Trial and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It muſt, therefore, be a Matter of great Exerciſe of Thought in an infant Mind to learn this Connection, and particularly, to learn the Notion of the various Diſtances and Situations of Things tangible, by its Obſervations on the various Degrees of Strength or Weakneſs, of Vividneſs or Faintneſs of the Light reflected from them, in the Things viſible conſtantly connected with them. And, at the ſame time that it hath theſe Things to learn, which muſt be a laborious Work, as being the ſame Thing with learning a Language, it is alſo learning the Names of Things, and the Connection and Uſe of Words, which is another Language. And, as if all theſe were not Taſk enough, it hath all this While, to be learning how to uſe its Limbs; its Hands in handling, its Tongue, and other Organs of Speech, in making and imitating Sounds, and its whole Body in all its Exertions, and particularly, at length, the Poize of its Center of Gravity, and the Uſe of its Feet in walking.</p>
                     <p n="3">§ 3. ALL theſe Things require a great deal of earneſt Application, and the Exerciſe of much Thought and Experience: So that it ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006859_0102_102AABBA25562AA0"/>
that thoſe little Creatures, from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, do conſider, reflect and think a prodigious deal more than we are commonly apt to imagine;<note place="margin">Of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Children, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard due to them.</note> and I do not ſee how we can avoid admitting that the Soul's Capacity is as great from the firſt Moment as ever it is. For it is plain, from what hath been ſaid, that they learn two diſtinct Languages within the two firſt Years of their Life to a good Degree of Perfection; I mean the Connection between tangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and viſible Objects, and between both of them and Words, and beſides this, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Degree of Dexterity in the Uſe of their Limbs, which is, doubtleſs, a great deal more than they ever learn in ſo much Time afterwards. And conſequently the Reaſon why there appear ſo many little, low, weak and childiſh Things in them, which we are apt to deſpiſe and think them beneath our Notice, is not for want of good Senſe and Capacity, but meerly for want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Opportunity for intellectual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements. Hence alſo it appears, that we ought to think little Children to be Perſons of much more Importance than we uſually appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them to be; and how indulgent we ſhould be to their inquiſitive Curioſity as being Strangers; with how much Candour, Patience and Care, we ought to bear with them and inſtruct them; with how much Decency, Honour and Integrity, we ought to treat them; and how careful it concerns us to be, not to ſay or do any Thing to them, or before them, that ſavours of Falſhood or Deceit, or that is in any Kind indecent or vitious. <hi>Pueris maxima debetur Reverentia,</hi> is a good trite old Saying.</p>

FOR it is to be obſerved, in the next Place,<note place="margin">Of their Knowledge of Perſons, Relations and Duties.</note> that while Children are acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a general Knowledge of the ſenſible World about them, they are at the ſame time learning the Knowledge of the Perſons with whom they converſe; their Dependence on them, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations they ſtand in to them; and a Notion of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> and thence a very quick Senſe of Juſtice and Injury, as well as of good Uſage, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and Gratitude; all which appear obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them from Conſciouſneſs and Reflection, and Attention to that inward, intuitive, intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Light, which as I have obſerved (Chap. I. § 13. 14.) perpetually ſhines in upon their little Minds, from the DEITY, <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> and <hi>the Father of their Spirits.</hi> Hence they ſoon apprehend the Relations of <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> of <hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> of Things <hi>equal, greater</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> of Things <hi>like</hi> and <hi>unlike,</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> and Things <hi>different</hi> and <hi>contrary,</hi> of <hi>general Names</hi> and <hi>Notions,</hi> and Analogies from Things ſenſible to Things ſpiritual and moral, of Actions <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi> and of Things done with <hi>Deſign</hi> and by <hi>Accident,</hi> &amp;c. And by Reflection and Obſervation they judge of others by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: So that in three or four Years, they do, with a litttle Teaching, begin to have a Notion of Perſons, as being an intirely different and diſtinct Sort of Beings from meer Objects of Senſe. They ſoon know that a Stone in falling, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in running, the Wind in blowing, and the Fire in burning, &amp;c. knows not what it does, and neither acts voluntarily, nor with Deſign: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Man or a Boy, they apprehend, if he does what is either pleaſing or diſpleaſing, beneficial
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006859_0104_102AABBE4F1B5AF8"/>
or injurious to them, he knows what he does, and deſigns to do it, and might, if he would, do otherwiſe. From whence, as I ſaid, they have a quick Senſe of good or ill Uſage, and conſequently, of Right and Wrong, and of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or Reſentment, according as they take themſelves to be well, or ill treated.</p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. HENCE, with regard to what they do themſelves, they, by Reflection,<note place="margin">Of their Notions of Praiſe and Blame, Shame and Guilt, &amp;c.</note> ſoon acquire the Notions of Free-Agency, and of <hi>Praiſe</hi> or <hi>Blame,</hi> according as they are conſcious of their doing well or ill; <hi>i. e.</hi> according as they are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they act a fit and a reaſonable Part on the one Hand, or an unreaſonable and injurious Part on the other. Thence they ſoon learn to have a Senſe of <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Guilt</hi> upon their Conſciouſneſs of having done amiſs, and of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Self-applauſe,</hi> when they think they have done well. And hence they quickly learn the Notions of <hi>Law, Conſcience, Sin</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> eſpecially if they have had the Rules explained, and been duly chaſtized or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded when they have done ill or well, by thoſe on whom they know they have a Dependance, and to whom they find themſelves accountable; and to whom to account, as being both their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors and Governors, they are conſcious it is fit and reaſonable, as they know they ſtand in much Need of their Help and Conduct in order to their own Well-being. All theſe Things are obvious in Children of four, five and ſix Years old, and manifeſtly derive from that intellectual Light, of which I have often been ſpeaking: And the great Concern of Culture, and a right Education, is to awaken their Attention to this
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:006859_0105_102AABC25C8F33F8"/>
inward intuitive Senſe of True and Falſe, Good and Bad, Right and Wrong; and to fix their Attachment to the one, and their Averſion to the other, by ſteadily affecting them with Applauſe or Blame, Pleaſure or Pain, Joy or Grief, according as they affect or do the one or the other.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. AND as the Intellect and Reaſon of Children thus manifeſtly appears to dawn and improve,<note place="margin">How they ſhould be treated, &amp; taught the Notion of the Deity, and their Duty to him.</note> it ought to be continually <hi>encouraged</hi> and <hi>aſſiſted</hi> by thoſe that are about them, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe that have the Conduct of them. As they are got into a World wherein every Thing is new and ſtrange to them, and for want of Knowledge and Experience, they are liable to many Miſtakes in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and to make a thouſand Blunders in their Actions and Conduct; and yet in their original Simplicity and Well-meaning, are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily very inquiſitive, and willing to be taught and conducted; it is mightily incumbent on thoſe to whoſe Care they are by Providence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether Parents, Nurſes, Guardians, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Tutors, to conſider them, with great Candor, as Strangers that need to be conducted and aſſiſted; to be ready to anſwer their little Queſtions, and to teach them to reaſon by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly reaſoning with them; and to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with great Tenderneſs, Patience and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity, to guide and inſtruct them.

                  <p>LOOK! Are not the Fields covered with a delightful Verdure? Is there not ſomething in the Woods and Groves, in the Rivers and clear Springs, that ſooths, that ſoftens, that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the Soul? At the Proſpect of the wide and deep Ocean, or ſome huge Mountain, whoſe Top is loſt in the Clouds, or of an old gloomy Foreſt, are not our Minds filled with a pleaſing Horror? Even in the Rocks and Deſarts, is there not an agreeable Wildneſs? How ſincere a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is it to behold the natural Beauties of the Earth! To preſerve and renew our Reliſh for them, is not the Veil of Night alternately drawn over her Face, and doth ſhe not change her Dreſs with the Seaſons? How aptly are the Elements diſpoſed? What Variety and Uſe in Stones and Metals, and even in the meaneſt Productions of Nature? What Delicacy, what Beauty, what Contrivance in vegetable and animal Bodies? How exquiſitely are all Things ſuited as well to their

particular Ends, as to conſtitute appoſite Parts of the Whole? And while they mutually aid and ſupport, do they not alſo ſet off and illuſtrate each other? Raiſe now your Thoughts from this Ball of Earth, to all thoſe wondrous Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that adorn the high Arch of Heaven. What an inſupportably ſplendid and glorious Body is the Sun, the Center of this our Syſtem, and the inexhauſtible Fountain of that vaſt aetherial Fluid, which is the Light and Life of this whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? The Motion and Situation of the Planets, are they not admirable for Uſe and Order? Were thoſe (miſcalled <hi>Erratic</hi>) Globes e'er known to ſtray in their repeated Journeys through the path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Void? Do they not meaſure Areas round the Sun, ever proportioned to the Times? So fixed, ſo immutable are the Laws by which the unſeen Author of Nature actuates the Univerſe! How vivid and radiant is the Luſtre of the fixed Stars? How magnificent and rich that negligent Profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with which they appear to be ſcattered throughout the whole azure Vault? Yet if you take the Teleſcope, it brings into your Sight a new Hoſt of Stars that eſcape the naked Eye. Here they ſeem contiguous and minute, but to a nearer View, immenſe Orbs of Light, at various Diſtances, far ſunk in the Abyſs of Space! Now you muſt call Imagination to your Aid. The feeble narrow Senſe cannot deſcry innumerable Worlds revolving round the central Fires; and in thoſe Worlds the Energy of an All-perfect Mind diſplay'd in endleſs Forms!

                  <p>O My GOD, if the greater Number of Mankind do not diſcover Thee in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Show of Nature which thou haſt placed before our Eyes, it is not becauſe thou art far from every one of us, for it is <hi>in Thee that we live, and move, and have our Being:</hi> Thou art pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us more than any Object which we touch with our Hands, but our Senſes and the Paſſions which they produce in us, turn our Attention from Thee. Thy Light <hi>ſhines in the midſt of Darkneſs, but the Darkneſs comprehendeth it not.</hi> Thou, O Lord, doſt every where diſplay thyſelf: Thou ſhineſt forth in all thy Works, but art not regarded by heedleſs and unthinking Man. The
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:006859_0124_102AABF3DCDE26E8"/>
whole Creation talks aloud of Thee, and echoes with the Repetition of Thy holy Name: But ſuch is our Inſenſibility, that we are deaf to the great and univerſal Voice of Nature. Thou art every where about us, and within us, but we wander from ourſelves, become Strangers to our own Souls, and do not apprehend Thy Preſence. O Thou, who art the eternal Fountain of Light and Beauty; who art the Ancient of Days, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Beginning, and without End: O Thou, who art the Life of all that truly live, thoſe can never fail to find Thee who ſeek for Thee within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But alas! the very Gifts which Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweſt upon us do ſo employ our Thoughts, that they divert us from perceiving the Hand that conveys them to us. We live in Thee, and by Thee, and yet we live without thinking of Thee: But, O Lord, what is Life in the Ignorance of Thee? A dead inactive Piece of Matter, a Flower that withers, a River that glides away, a Palace that haſtens to its Ruin, a Picture made up of fading Colours, a Maſs of ſhining Ore; theſe, and ſuch Things as theſe, ſtrike our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and make us ſenſible of their Exiſtence, we regard them as Objects capable of giving us Pleaſure, not conſidering that <hi>Thou</hi> conveyeſt to us, <hi>through</hi> them, all the Pleaſure which we imagine <hi>they</hi> give us. Such empty Objects of Senſe as are only the Shadows of Being, take up and engage our low and groveling Thoughts, while that Beauty which Thou haſt poured out on Thy Creation is as a Veil that hides Thee from our Eyes. As Thou art a Being too pure and exalted to paſs thro' our Senſes, Thou art not regarded by Men who have debaſed their Nature, and made
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:006859_0125_102AABF71D603BB0"/>
themſelves like the Beaſts that periſh. So infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated are they, that notwithſtanding they know what is Truth and Good, Wiſdom and Virtue, Law and Order, which (tho' the moſt real and ſtable Things) have neither Figure, nor Colour, nor Sound, nor Taſte, nor Smell, nor any other ſenſible Quality, yet they can doubt of Thy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, becauſe Thou art not apprehended by the groſſer Organs of Senſe. Wretches that we are! we conſider Shadows as Realities, and Truth as a Phantom: That which is nothing is all to us, and that which is all appears to us as nothing. But what do we ſee in all Nature but Thee, O my God? Thou and only Thou appeareſt in every Thing. When I conſider Thee, O Lord, I am ſwallowed up, and loſt in the Contemplation of Thee. Every Thing beſides Thee, even my own Exiſtence, vaniſhes and diſappears in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Thee: I am aſtoniſhed and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing when I think of Thee! The Man who does not ſee Thee has beheld nothing: He who does not taſte Thee has a Reliſh of nothing; his Being is vain, and his Life but a Dream. How unhappy is that Soul who without the Senſe of Thee has no God, no Hope, no Comfort to ſupport him? On the contrary, how happy is the Man that ſearches, ſighs and thirſts after Thee? But he only is fully happy, on whom thou lifteſt up the Light of Thy Countenance, and who, being conformed to Thee, enjoys in Thy loving Kindneſs the Completion of all his Deſires. Thou therefore, O my God, art the God of my Life, my Joy and my Hope: <hi>Thou wilt guide me with Thy Counſel, and afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me to Glory: Thou wilt ſhew me the Path

of Life; in thy Preſence is Fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right Hand there are Pleaſures for evermore. Whom then have I in Heaven but Thee? And there is nothing in Earth that I will deſire in Compariſon of thee. My Fleſh and my Heart faileth: But Thou, O my GOD, art the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever.</hi>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
                  <p>WHAT is here attempted, is a ſhort Syſtem of <hi>Ethics</hi> or <hi>Morals</hi> (chiefly for the Uſe of young Beginners) which have, of late, been called <hi>The Religion of Nature;</hi> by which I would not be underſtood to mean a Syſtem of Truths and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which meer <hi>natural Reaſon</hi> would ever, of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, have diſcovered, in the preſent Condition of Mankind, without the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Revelation</hi> or Inſtruction; for it is but a very little of GOD and Religion, or of Truth and Duty, that Man, in his preſent State, utterly uninſtructed, is able to diſcover by his meer natural Powers, as the Fact hath abundantly demonſtrated, where the ancient Inſtructions were loſt. Nor can it, indeed, be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, from the Goodneſs of GOD, that when he firſt brought Man into Being, a Stranger to every Thing about him, that he would leave him to grope out every Thing that was neceſſary, or even expedient, in order to anſwer the End of his Being, his true Happineſs, without Inſtruction, even in Language and Nature, as well as Religion and Morals; or, that when he had been ſurprized by a Temptation, and fallen into Sin, that he would leave him to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh without giving him further Inſtructions, to be handed down to his Poſterity, how he and they ſhould return to their Duty, and regain His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And that the Fact was accordingly, we are aſſured from the moſt ancient Accounts of the firſt Condition of Mankind. What I would therefore be underſtood to mean by <hi>Ethics,</hi> or <hi>the Religion of Nature,</hi> is, That Syſtem of Truths and Duties, which, tho' they are not obvious to our weak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006859_0131_102AAC072F091788"/>
without Revelation or Inſtruction, yet when diſcovered, whether by the one or the other, do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, upon due Conſideration, to be founded in the firſt Principles of Reaſon and Nature; in the Nature of GOD and Man, and the various Relations that ſubſiſt between them; and from thence to be capable even of ſtrict Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>WE know there are a great Number of Truths in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> which not One in Ten Thouſand of the Bulk of Mankind would ever have thought of, if it had not been for ſuch great Men as <hi>Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes</hi> and Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> &amp;c. which yet may, ſafely, and with great Advantage, be received upon, their Authority, and be accordingly practiſed upon, by thoſe who have not Leiſure or Ability to attend to the Reaſons of them: And now they have led the Way, it is not very difficult for thoſe, who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thinking cloſely, to enter into the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them: The Caſe is much the ſame as to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truths and Duties, with regard to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Prophets and Law-givers. It is the Part of the Prophet or Law-giver, as ſuch, to diſcover Truths, and enjoin Laws, as Rules of Behaviour to the People, who are to receive them upon their Authority, as having but little Leiſure or Capacity to exerciſe their Reaſon about them, and therefore act rationally in ſo doing; And it is the Part of the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> as ſuch, as far as it is practicable, to enter into the Reaſons and Demonſtrations, on which thoſe Truths and Duties are originally founded.</p>
                  <p>SUCH a ſhort Delineation of <hi>Morals,</hi> may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be of ſome Uſe, eſpecially in theſe Times, wherein there is a Sect ariſen, or rather revived, that is continually decrying <hi>Morality,</hi> as tho' it were only carnal Reaſon, and no Part of <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
                     <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:006859_0132_102AAC099C513CB0"/>
nor ſcarce conſiſtent with it: This, it may be preſumed, they would ſcarcely do, if they duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what <hi>Morality</hi> truly is. And, on the other Hand, as one Extreme is apt to beget another, it is to be feared there may be another Sect ariſing, or gaining Ground, who from too juſt an Indignation at thoſe abſurd Notions of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> are in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for want of due Conſideration, of not only ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting light by <hi>that,</hi> but even of loſing all ſerious Senſe of the true Extent and Obligations of <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> itſelf. It is therefore the Deſign of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pages, to endeavour to give a juſt Notion of it, and the Reaſons on which it is founded, and to ſhew its Extent and vaſt Importance, and what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection there is between <hi>it</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would only advertiſe this one Thing further; That no Speculation or Demonſtration whatſoever, is of any further real Uſe to us, than ſo far forth as it directs or engages us in Life and Practice, on which our Happineſs all depends. And, as our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in theſe Things, is, at beſt, but very dark and weak, it is of the greateſt Importance to us, that we diligently ſtudy the holy Oracles, in which we have the ſublimeſt and moſt advantageous Inſtructions and Incentives to Practice, with regard to theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are of the utmoſt Importance to our true and everlaſting Happineſs. However, as we are reaſonable Creatures, and obliged, as ſuch, to yield unto GOD, the Author of our Beings, a <hi>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service,</hi> it may be of very good Uſe for us, as far as it will go, with an implicit Submiſſion to Him for the reſt, to exerciſe our Reaſon upon theſe great and important Subjects.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. THE World of intelligent free Agents, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, comprehends the whole Syſtem of created Spirits, both Angels and Men, and whatever other Species there may be, conſidered as being derived from, and under the Conduct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Almighty GOD, the Author, the Father and Lord of all.

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>VIRTUE</hi> conſiſts in that Integrity, Firmneſs and Stability of the Soul, whereby we do honeſtly and ſtedfaſtly perſiſt, in ſpite of all Temptations to the contrary, in the Love and Practice of <hi>moral Good,</hi> and the Hatred and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of <hi>moral Evil: Vice</hi> is the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>MORAL Good</hi> conſiſts in freely chuſing and doing whatſoever Truth and right Reaſon dictate as neceſſary to be choſen and done, in order to our true Happineſs: <hi>Moral Evil</hi> the contrary; for moral Good muſt mean, the Good of a moral Agent; <hi>i. e.</hi> of rational, conſcious, free, ſelf-exerting and ſelf-determining Agent.</p>
                     <p n="8">8.

THE <hi>Criterion</hi> or Teſt, whereby we determine what we ought to do or forbear, or what thoſe Actions and Forbearances are, which are to be choſen and done, is the <hi>natural Good</hi> of them, or that Pleaſure and Happineſs in the whole of our Nature and Duration, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attends them: For we find by Experience, that ſome Things, Affections and Actions, are, in the very Nature of them, attended with Pleaſure

or Happineſs, either to the Mind, as perceptive of Truth, or to the Will and Affections, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Good; and others with Pain or Miſery, in reſpect to the one or the other. In ſome we have a quick Senſe of the Decent and Amiable, which delight the Mind; and in others, of the Deformed and Odious, which diſpleaſe it: In ſome we perceive the Advantage, in others the Miſchief attending them, to ourſelves or others; and accordingly, the former are attended with inward Tranquility, Acquieſcence, and Self-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and the latter with Anxiety, Remorſe, and Self-reproach.

They appear to have no Notion of any Thing but the Objects of Senſe, can conceive nothing of Duty and Sin, and ſeem capable of no Enjoyment of any Thing but Meat and Drink, and the Means of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Species, and defending themſelves; and theſe only are the Things to which their Exertions and Activity tend.</p>
                        <p n="4">§ 4. WITH Regard to theſe, they have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a wonderful Sagacity, and what looks like Reaſoning, Deſign and Contrivance, and a ſocial Tendency; but theſe do not ſeem to be any Thing of their own, becauſe they have them ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, and do not acquire them by Teaching, Trial and Induſtry. This Sagacity therefore ſeems to be what we call an <hi>Inſtinct;</hi> by which Word, nothing elſe can be meant, but that they are rather paſſively acted and conducted by ſome other Being; ſome governing Mind on whom they depend, according to certain Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which He hath eſtabliſhed, than that they act

from any Principle of Deliberation and Deſign within themſelves.</p>
                        <p n="5">§ 5. THESE Senſations, Appetites and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, indeed, I find I have in common with them; but then I am conſcious of vaſtly nobler Powers and Faculties than theſe.

I can <hi>judge</hi> of True and Falſe, and of Right and Wrong, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate and weigh Things, and <hi>reaſon</hi> and infer one Thing from another, and reduce them into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> and Order, according to their various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections and Dependences.

In the Impreſſions of Senſe indeed, and the Perceptions of Evidence, I am paſſive, but in all theſe I am evidently active, and can chuſe or refuſe, will or nill, act or forbear, from a Principle of Self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion; which are all truly great and noble Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

myſelf or them, and give an Account to myſelf or others, whether I or they do, or do not act according to thoſe Laws. And I find, that as I <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hate</hi> Things according as they are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or diſagreeable to me; ſo I have <hi>Hopes</hi> or <hi>Fears, Joys</hi> or <hi>Griefs,</hi> according as I feel, or have in View, Pleaſures or Pains, and am <hi>conſcious</hi> of having done well or ill, and that my own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> will not fail to <hi>juſtify</hi> and <hi>applaud,</hi> or <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> me accordingly; and as I feel great <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in having done what I apprehend to be right, ſo I feel no leſs <hi>Shame, Horror,</hi> and <hi>Remorſe,</hi> when I have done what is wrong.</p>

And I cannot only conceive that I may, but cannot refrain from being earneſtly deſirous, in ſome Condition or other, to bear a Part in them, and to enjoy myſelf happily through all imaginable Periods of Duration: So that though I know there muſt have been a Time when I began to be, yet I am ſolicitous that I may never ceaſe to be, and to enjoy myſelf; and cannot avoid having Hopes of this, even after Death, ſince this Life turns to but little Account.

                        <p n="10">§ 10. I alſo find, upon looking about me, an endleſs Variety of ſenſible Objects; a glorious Heaven above me, and a ſpacious Earth beneath me, furniſhed with a ſurprizing Variety of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, all connected (together with my own Body, one of the moſt curious Machines of them all) in a moſt wonderful Manner one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Of which, as I know there are a great Number of my own Kind, ſo I cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doubt but there are others of various Orders above me, which may probably have other and nobler Senſes than thoſe five narrow Inlets that I am acquainted with, and confined to, and far greater and nobler Abilities, both of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Activity, than I am furniſhed with. Such I can eaſily conceive to be poſſible; and, from the various Gradations in Perfection of Being, in the ſeveral Tribes below me, it is very probable there may be the like Gradations in ſeveral Tribes of Beings above me.</p>
                        <p n="13">§ 13. As to thoſe of my own Species (from which by Analogy I may form ſome Notion of them) I find we were evidently made for Society, being furniſhed with the Power of <hi>Speech</hi> as well as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> whereby we are capable of entering into the Underſtanding of each other's Minds and Sentiments, and of holding mutual Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Converſation one with another, and jointly conſpiring to promote our common Well-being; to which we are naturally led by a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and <hi>ſocial Diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> ſounded in the Frame and Condition of our Nature, which not only placeth us in the various Relations of <hi>Huſbands</hi> and <hi>Wives, Parents</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and other <hi>Relatives;</hi> but alſo lays us under a Neceſſity of mutual Dependence one upon another, which obligeth us to enter into Compacts

for our Defence and Safety, and for maintaining both private Right and publick Order, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the common Good of our Species, in the ſeveral Communities to which we belong. And as I have a quick Senſe of what is right in others towards me as being what I am, and of my own Eaſe and Comfort, ſo I cannot diveſt myſelf of a Senſe of what muſt, for the ſame Reaſon, be right in me towards others, and a Senſe of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Compaſſion for thoſe that are in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, whereby I am ſtrongly prompted to relieve them: And theſe Tendencies and Affections of <hi>the ſocial Kind,</hi> are evidently planted in us for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting our ſocial Happineſs. And finally; as I cannot long enjoy myſelf in a State of Solitude, and have a ſtrong Paſſion for Society; ſo I find, in Fact, that my true Intereſt and Enjoyment of myſelf, depends on the general Intereſt and good Order of the Community, and this, in Addition to thoſe ſocial Diſpoſitions, ſtrongly prompts me to the Love of my Country, and to be forward and active in whatever may promote the publick Weal. Such are my Abilities and Advantages, and ſuch my Condition, Circumſtances and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and thoſe of the Kind to which I ſtand related.</p>
                        <p n="14">§ 14. But then, if I conſider myſelf a little further, I find, after all, that at beſt I am attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with very great Limitations and Imperfections. I cannot ſubſiſt myſelf a Moment in Eaſe or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, nor add one Power or Faculty to thoſe I have: And there are certain Bounds (ſmall compared with what I can eaſily imagine) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which I cannot at all extend or exert them.

very feeble; my Memory is very brittle; my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is very weak; my Knowledge is very confuſed; my Will is very irreſolute; my Power is very infirm, and my Activity can extend but to a very ſmall Compaſs.</p>
                        <p n="15">§ 15. BUT, which is worſe, I find (which is the general Complaint of every one more or leſs) that we are troubled with ſome unhappy Tendency or other, which ſeems to be founded in the Frame of our Nature; ſome idle, ſenſual Diſpoſition; ſome importunate Appetite, or ſome untoward Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which it is very difficult to keep within rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Bounds, and in Indulgence to which, it is much if we have not contracted ſome ill Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit or other, or, at leaſt, been guilty of many grievous Miſcarriages, for which our Reaſon and Conſciences have ſadly reproached us, and given us very great Uneaſineſs, and ſometimes terrible Apprehenſions and Forebodings of Vengeance to come, unleſs we repent and reform.

                        <p n="1">§ 1. (II.) I PROCEED now to the next Enquiry. Let every One then, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, ſeriouſly aſk himſelf this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>How came I to be, and to be ſuch an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſinful Being as I am?</hi> For we cannot have a right Knowledge of ourſelves, without conſidering, not only what we are in ourſelves, but alſo how we ſtand variouſly related, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, without looking to the Cauſe of our preſent Being and Limitations (<hi>Introd.</hi> 26.) and in order to anſwer this Queſtion, let us conſider and reaſon with ourſelves in the following Manner.</p>
                        <p n="2">§ 2. I KNOW that I have a Being, becauſe I perceive and act, and that I muſt have had a Beginning of Exiſtence, becauſe there muſt have been a Time when I did not perceive or act, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006859_0156_102AAC43A8CE78E0"/>
I can have no Notion of the Exiſtence of an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent active Being, without conſcious Perception and Activity. And if I began to be, I muſt have been made. It is certain I could not come into Being by meer <hi>Chance,</hi> for that is nothing but an empty Name, which we vulgarly uſe only as a Cover to our Ignorance or Inadvertence. I alſo know I did not make myſelf, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and would imply, to be, and not to be, at the ſame Time; nor have I Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue myſelf in Being ſo much as one Moment; nor can I a Moment ſecure my Health, or any of my Enjoyments (Part I. Chap. I. § 14.) ſo that I find I am wholly a limited and dependent Being.</p>
                        <p n="3">§ 3. IT is therefore certain, that I muſt have had a Cauſe; for an Effect, or Thing made, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cauſe, is a Contradiction, and can have no Meaning: There muſt then be ſome other Being on whom I depend. And ſince <hi>there cannot be an Effect without a Cauſe,</hi> it is evident that the Cauſe of my Being muſt have Powers capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch an Effect; otherwiſe there would ſtill be an Effect without a Cauſe, than which nothing can be more abſurd. It is evident that my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents could not be the adequate Cauſes; they could, at moſt, be only the Occaſions or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my Being; for it never was in their Power that I ſhould be at all, or being, that I ſhould be ſuch as I am; nor could they continue me a Moment in Being, Health or Eaſe. It is therefore plain that I muſt look higher for an adequate Cauſe, both of my Exiſtence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
                        <p n="4">§ 4. IT is moreover manifeſt, that <hi>no Cauſe can give what it hath not,</hi> or, which is the ſame Thing, produce an Effect more noble, or of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006859_0157_102AAC46213918B0"/>
greater Powers or Perfections than itſelf; for then again, there would be an Effect without a Cauſe, or Something produced by Nothing, which is impoſſible. Hence, therefore, it is plain, that what is deſtitute of Perception, Conſciouſneſs and Intelligence, cannot produce a perceptive, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, intelligent Being: What is void of any Principle of Deliberation, Liberty and Activity, cannot produce a conſiderate, free, active Being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is conſequently evident, that the Being who brought me into Being, muſt himſelf be poſſeſſed of Powers or Perfections analogous to thoſe I experience in myſelf.</p>
                        <p n="5">§ 5. SINCE, therefore, I know I have ſome conſiderable Degrees of Underſtanding, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Will, Force and Activity, with Freedom of Deliberation, Choice and Deſign, and the Powers of Self-exertion, and Self-determination, together with ſome Senſe of Benevolence, and of Right and Wrong, or Equity and Iniquity, and ſome Diſpoſition to do the one, and avoid the other (Chap. I. § 5, 6.) It is from hence evident, that the Almighty Being, who made me, and whom I call GOD, being the genuine and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Cauſe, from whom I derived, and on whom I depend, muſt Himſelf have <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Knowledge, Will, Force,</hi> and <hi>Activity;</hi> muſt have <hi>Liberty, Choice, Deliberation, Self-exertion,</hi> and <hi>Self-determination;</hi> and muſt be a Being of <hi>Equity, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and all other moral Perfections, which are implied in theſe, and which are comprehended under the Terms <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Rectitude.</hi> And as I am thus truly made by Him, and in ſome Meaſure to reſemble Him, He muſt therefore be ſtrictly and properly my <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> or the <hi>Father of my Spirit.</hi>

IF now it be enquired, <hi>How I came to be ſuch an imperfect, frail, ſinful Being, as I am?</hi> Or how it could be, that the wiſe and good GOD that made me, who is Himſelf the moſt perfect and beſt of Beings, ſhould make me ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, ſinful and miſerable Creature, as I find myſelf to be? (Chap. I. § 15.) To this I muſt anſwer in the following Manner: That GOD ſhould make me ſuch an imperfect (or leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) Creature as I am, compared with others, or with what I can eaſily imagine, I ſee no Reaſon to doubt; inaſmuch as my Being itſelf, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perfection of it, and Advantage attending it, muſt be His ſovereign free Gift, and what He was in no wiſe obliged to beſtow. He is the ſovereign Lord of His Favours, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be intirely at Liberty to beſtow ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

of Being and Perfection, and ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, greater or leſs, as He thinks fit; and it appears that He hath delighted in a boundleſs Variety in all His Works.</p>
                        <p n="21">§ 21. INDEED that He ſhould, without any known voluntary Fault of mine, put me into a Condition that is, in the Whole, worſe than not to be; or that He ſhould, in giving me my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lay me under an abſolute Neceſſity of being finally ſinful and miſerable; this would be a very hard Caſe indeed: But this I muſt think utterly impoſſible, as being what I cannot think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with His Wiſdom, Holineſs, Juſtice and Goodneſs, above demonſtrated. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Wollaſt.

                        <p n="22">§ 22. AND as to my being ſo <hi>ſinful</hi> a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as I muſt confeſs I am, this I cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to GOD; for ſince the formal Notion of <hi>Sin</hi> conſiſts in the voluntary Oppoſition of our Wills to the known Will of GOD, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which He hath made, it muſt be the Fault of my Will, and not of His; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly my own Conſcience tells me, whenever I do amiſs, that I myſelf (and not He) am the

Cauſe, and true Author of all the Wickedneſs I commit. If, therefore, inſtead of being obedient to the Author of my Being, and making a good Uſe of my Liberty, and of the Powers and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages He hath given me, and thereby further improving them, and qualifying myſelf for the Happineſs He deſigns for me in ſo doing, I make a bad Uſe of them, by voluntarily acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to His known Will, and thereby ſink my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a worſe Condition; nay, tho' it were into a worſe Condition than not to be, it is wholly owing to myſelf, and not to Him that made me.</p>
                        <p n="23">§ 23. IF now I ſhould aſk, Why hath GOD made me at all peccable, or capable of Sin? This would be the ſame as to aſk, Why hath He made me capable of Duty? Or, why hath He made me a free Agent? But this would be a ſtrange Queſtion; for without Liberty I ſhould be deſtitute of one of the chief Excellencies of my rational Nature, and ſhould not be capable of either Duty or Sin, properly ſpeaking; for as Sin conſiſts in a free and voluntary Diſobedience, ſo Duty conſiſts in a free and willing Obedience to the known Will of GOD. So that without a Power of Liberty or free Agency, there could have been no ſuch Thing as either Virtue or Vice, Praiſe or Blame; nor can either the one or the other obtain, but in Proportion to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have, or may have, of what we ought to do, and the Powers we are furniſhed with, either to do or forbear. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Wollaſt.

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006859_0172_102AAC6E32388588"/>
fit natural Evil ſhould attend moral Evil, as the beſt Means for the Cure of it: And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD, having it in View that we would abuſe our Liberty, not only juſtly, but wiſely and kindly ordered theſe Calamities, as being the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Means that could have been uſed to bring us to Repentance and Reformation, and to diſcipline us to Virtue, by mortifying our Luſts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaging us from thoſe Objects that are moſt apt to enſnare and miſlead us; and, at the ſame time, they give us Occaſion and Opportunity for the Exerciſe of ſeveral Virtues of very great Uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the perfecting our reaſonable and active Nature, which otherwiſe could have had no Place; and ſince we cannot, as Things now are, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely happy here, they lead us to the Hopes of a better State hereafter.</p>

LET every one then, in the <hi>third</hi> Place, ſeriouſly conſider further, and enquire with Himſelf, <hi>For what End was I thus brought into Being, and am thus continually ſubſiſted by Almighty GOD?</hi> And for the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Queſtion, let him thus think and reaſon with himſelf, or to this Effect.</p>
                        <p n="2">§ 2. THAT I was not made at all Adventures, without any Contrivance and Deſign, but muſt have been made for ſome End or other, I cannot doubt, ſince I have evidently found, that He who gave me my Being, muſt Himſelf be a Being of all poſſible Perfections, and conſequently muſt be a moſt kind, wiſe and deſigning Cauſe; eſpecially ſince I do alſo evidently find in Fact, ſo many, and ſuch manifeſt Tokens of the wiſeſt and moſt benevolent Deſign and Contrivance in my whole Frame, and in every Thing about me (Chap. I. § 2, 9, 10.)</p>
                        <p n="3">§ 3. BEING therefore made by a moſt wiſe and good Cauſe, I muſt neceſſarily have been made for ſome wiſe and good End. And having demonſtrated that the Being who made me, hath
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006859_0174_102AAC740859B200"/>
an infinite Sufficiency within Himſelf for His own Happineſs, independent of any other Being (Chap. II. § 18.) it is manifeſt that whatever good End He had in giving me my Being, it could not be to ſerve Himſelf of me, or to promote any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Himſelf by me: This were a Thought infinitely too mean to entertain of Him, who is <hi>GOD, All-ſufficient,</hi> that it could be poſſible for Him to ſtand in need of me, or of any Thing I could do or ſuffer, in order to His own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">§ 4. MOREOVER, ſince it hath been evidently diſcovered that the Author of my Being is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect, and conſequently perfectly juſt and good; perfectly equitable and benevolent (Chap. II. § 6, 17.) it is evident that He could not give me my Being with any malevolent Deſign, or with a Deſign that I ſhould be abſolutely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably miſerable in the Whole; nor could He (as I humbly conceive) deſign Miſery for me, or any of His Creatures, but in Conſequence of their perſonal, voluntary Demerit, by perſiſting in wilful Rebellion againſt Him, or the general Intereſt of the Conſtitution which He hath made; for this would be ſo far from conſiſting with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Benevolence, that it would imply the very Notion of Cruelty. A Thought which we ſhould remove at an infinite Diſtance from that moſt perfect and beſt of Beings.</p>
                        <p n="5">§ 5. INDEED, in caſe of wilful Rebellion, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally perſiſted in, it is fit and right, and even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Good of the Whole (being the moſt effectual Means to cure Rebellion, and ſecure the Obedience of GOD's Creatures, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their general Good and Happineſs) that Puniſhment ſhould be inflicted upon thoſe
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006859_0175_102AAC7642C94990"/>
that rebel, and obſtinately oppoſe their Wills to the Conſtitution He hath made, and the Ends of His Government, in Proportion to their ſeveral Crimes and Miſdemeanors (Chap. II. § 19.) And indeed Miſchief and Miſery do, in the Nature of Things, neceſſarily reſult from Sin and Vice. But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be therefore ſuppoſed that their Miſery could be His primary Deſign, or that He ſhould intend their Rebellion, or lay them under a Neceſſity of Sinning, that they might be finally miſerable; for this would, in Effect, be abſolutely to deſign their Miſery, and delight in it as ſuch, which to Him muſt be infinitely impoſſible.</p>
                        <p n="6">§ 6. ON the contrary, ſince GOD is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a moſt kind and benevolent Being, and could therefore have no other than kind and benevolent Ends, in giving Being to His rational Creatures, it is plain that His primary Intention muſt have been ſo far from that of making them to be miſerable, that He did undoubtedly make them with a Deſign that they might be, in ſome good Degree, happy, in the Participation and Enjoyment of His Goodneſs, in Proportion to their ſeveral Capacities and Qualifications. And that this was, in Fact, His End, is alſo manifeſt from the Frame and Structure of the Nature which He hath given them; for He hath given them Conſciouſneſs, whereby they are capable of Self-enjoyment; Intelligence, whereby they are able to conſider and judge of what is fit and needful to the Enjoyment of themſelves; Paſſions, whereby they are prompted to deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour what contributes to their Well-being, and to guard and defend themſelves againſt what may be hurtful to them; and a Principle of Activity, to procure the one, and avoid the other; and of Liberty, whereby they are able to ſuſpend Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006859_0176_102AAC77F34CC830"/>
and Acting, till they can duly ballance their Paſſions, and act with Advantage. And beſides theſe Powers, which are Means to their perſonal Happineſs, He hath alſo inſpired them with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Affections, which render them capable of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Happineſs: Having therefore given them the Means, it is plain He muſt have deſigned the End. (Chap. I. § 5, 7, 13.)</p>
                        <p n="7">§ 7. THIS then being the Frame of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which GOD hath given us, it muſt plainly be His Deſign that we ſhould ſeek our Happineſs, in affecting and acting conformable to it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if we act inconſiſtent with ourſelves, and ſo do a Violence to our own Nature; in this Caſe, we can neither enjoy ourſelves, nor any Thing elſe, and ſo muſt be unavoidably miſerable. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch therefore as GOD hath made us to be intelligent, free, active Creatures; and ſince our Happineſs muſt immediately depend upon the right Uſe of theſe Powers, and muſt conſiſt in the free and vigorous Exertion of them, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the great Law of our Nature, which is the inward Senſe of our own Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; it muſt accordingly be His Deſign, not only that we ſhould be happy, but that we ſhould be ſo by Means of our own Activity, and by our always freely acting reaſonably, and conſequently that we ſhould cultivate and improve our Reaſon in the beſt Manner we can, under the Circumſtances in which He hath placed us, in order to make a right Judgment how we ought to affect and act, and conduct ourſelves to the beſt Advantage for our own Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="8">§ 8. IT may, indeed, be truly ſaid, that <hi>GOD made all Things for His own Glory,</hi> if it be rightly underſtood. But wherein then doth His Glory conſiſt? It is plain, it cannot conſiſt in the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006859_0177_102AAC7A1F94B780"/>
Confuſion and Miſery, of His Creatures; nor can it conſiſt meerly in being applauded by them. It is, indeed, fit and right in itſelf, and for our Good, as well as His Honour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He requireth it, that we ſhould daily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Him to be what He is, our Creator, Preſerver and Benefactor; and all that is fit and right, fair and decent, true and good, muſt, as ſuch, be His Glory, as being in itſelf conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to His infinitely perfect Intellect and Will, as well as beatifying to His Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly nothing can be of greater Uſe and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, than that we live under a deep and habitual Senſe of this. But it would be a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Thought of Him, to imagine that he made us for the Sake of being applauded, or that He requireth even theſe juſt Acknowledgments for His own Sake, as though we, or our Services, could be any Advantage to Him. This would be to make Him a moſt ſelfiſh Being indeed; eſpecially if we ſhould imagine that He could aim at Applauſe or Glory, at the Expence of our unavoidable and endleſs Miſery: This would be a moſt diſhonourable and ſhocking Thought.</p>
                        <p n="9">§ 9. SO far from this, that I muſt conceive it to be the Glory of GOD to communicate His Perfections in various Degrees, ſo far as they are communicable, and to diſplay His Goodneſs to His Creatures, and make them happy in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of it, in Proportion to their ſeveral Capacities, and this in Conſequence of their act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Obedience to Him, and in Conformity to His Law, which is the Law of their Natures. For ſince He was pleaſed to give them their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it cannot be but that, as the tender Father of His own Off-ſpring, He will account it His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006859_0178_102AAC7CE7641758"/>
and Glory to ſee them as happy as may be, conſiſtent with the Intereſt of the whole Family (to which it is fit every Individual ſhould reſign) and take Pleaſure in every Thing that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to their Happineſs, and abhor whatſoever is deſtructive to it, and inconſiſtent with it, as His greateſt Diſhonour.</p>
                        <p n="10">§ 10. FOR ſince He that wills the End, muſt will the Means neceſſary to that End, it is plain that ſince GOD wills our Happineſs in the Whole, as our End, and his Glory, it muſt be his Will and Law concerning us, that we avoid every Thing that doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us miſerable, and that we do every Thing that doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us happy (<hi>Introd.</hi> 23.) So that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD, and our Happineſs, with the Means neceſſary to it, and his Diſhonour, and our Miſery, with the Means which tend to that, muſt neceſſarily be coincident, and come in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to one and the ſame Thing.</p>
                        <p n="11">§ 11. AND ſince it is evident, from Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Sin and Vice doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us miſerable; being contrary to to all that is reaſonable and right; contrary to the Attributes and Will of GOD; contrary to the clear Senſe of our own Minds, and to all the Intereſts of Society; and muſt therefore do a perpetual Violence to our reaſonable and ſocial Nature; and conſequently be moſt odious in the Sight of GOD, and all intelligent Beings, as being unavoidably attended with Horror and Confuſion, both perſonal and ſocial: And ſince, on the other Hand, it is no leſs evident, that a virtuous and dutiful Temper and Behaviour, doth, in the Nature of it, tend to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006859_0179_102AAC7E6EA87158"/>
becauſe it conſiſteth in doing all that is reaſonable and right, all that is agreeable to the Attributes and Will of GOD, to the Senſe of our own Minds, and to all the Intereſts of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and therefore muſt neceſſarily approve it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as moſt beautiful and amiable in the Sight of GOD, and all reaſonable Beings, as being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with univerſal Harmony, Peace and Joy, both within and without, with regard both to GOD and Man; it is hence evident, that GOD's Glory muſt conſiſt in our purſuing our own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by avoiding the one, and doing the other.</p>
                        <p n="12">§ 12. BUT now to return: Since I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, from the above Method of Reaſoning, that my Well-being and Happineſs muſt have been GOD's End in giving me my Being, and that it muſt be a Happineſs ſuitable to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which He hath given me, in the Whole of it; I muſt be perſuaded, that ſince, beſides an animal and ſenſitive, He hath moreover given me a rational, active and ſocial Nature, as my ſuperior and peculiar Character (Chap. I. § 5.) it is plain He muſt have deſigned men not meerly for a ſenſual and animal, but chiefly for a rational, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſocial Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="13">§ 13. IT cannot therefore be ſuppoſed an End worthy of GOD, and agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture He hath given me, in the Whole of it, that I ſhould have been brought into Being, only to eat and drink, and ſleep, and enjoy the empty Gratifications of the animal Life, and that my Reaſon, and other ſuperior Powers, ſhould be deſigned only to be ſubſervient to theſe inferior Pleaſures (and in Effect only to render me more a Beaſt than I ſhould have been without them) and that after a few Days ſpent in theſe low, grovelling Purſuits and Enjoyments, I ſhould
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006859_0180_102AAC809EC968A0"/>
then be utterly extinct, ceaſe, and be no more. Theſe ſhort lived animal Enjoyments are indeed Ends ſuitable to the Nature of a meer Beaſt, and for which he is better qualified than I am: But if theſe could be ſuppoſed all the Ends that I was made for, the noble Powers of Reaſon, Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Self-exertion and Self-determination, muſt have been given me in vain; nay, indeed to the worſt Purpoſes, as they only ſerve to make me more exquiſitely ſenſual, and, at the ſame time, ſenſible of my Wretchedneſs.</p>
                        <p n="14">§ 14. AT leaſt this is certain, that theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Powers render me capable of a vaſtly high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er End, and nobler Happineſs, and which cannot attain to its Perfection here: For when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wretched Circumſtances of my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Life, it is plain that ſuch a Happineſs can be but a little While, and but very imperfectly enjoyed, in this preſent, ſhort, uncertain and uneaſy State, amidſt ſo many Sins and Follies, Embarraſments and Perplexities, as I am, at beſt, unavoidably attended with, while in this Body. Since therefore I am evidently made for ſuch an Happineſs, and that it cannot attain to any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Degree of Perfection here, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that my Exiſtence ſhall undoubtedly reach beyond this ſhort and uncertain Life, and extend forward to endleſs Ages. Without this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I cannot ſee how I ſhall ever attain to any End worthy of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the GOD that made me, and ſuitable to the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Nature and Powers which he hath given me, and the ſuperior Happineſs I am evidently capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
                        <p n="15">§ 15. AND that I may live on, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is vulgarly called <hi>Death,</hi> and am of a

Nature capable of proceeding on to a nobler and more perfect Kind of Life, I cannot doubt, when I conſider the vaſtly different Natures of Spirit and Body, of which I conſiſt (the one in itſelf perceptive, conſcious and Self-active, the other of itſelf meerly ſenſeleſs, inert and paſſive) ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely different, that I cannot conceive of any Thing common to them, beſides bare Exiſtence, or of any natural or neceſſary Connection between them: I can conceive of no other than a meer arbitrary Connection, depending only on the Laws of their Union, which, in Natures ſo different, can, I think, be no other than the meer arbitrary Will of the Deity, and His perpetual <hi>Fiat.</hi> The Soul, therefore, being of a Nature intirely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of the Body, cannot be capable of any corporeal Laws and Affections, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot be liable to any ſuch Change or Diſſolution as Bodies are; <hi>i. e.</hi> being a perceptive, active, ſimple, unextended, indiviſible Subſtance, it muſt be naturally indiſcerpible, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incorruptible. I cannot therefore imagine how the Diſſolution of the Body ſhould affect the Exiſtence of the Soul, any more than the putting off an old Garment, to put on a new One, ſhould affect the Exiſtence of the Body.

INASMUCH, therefore, as I am a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of an incorruptible Nature, and know that I have Powers capable of the ſublime and noble Pleaſures of Contemplation and Virtue, which yet cannot, in any Meaſure, attain to their Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, I muſt believe, that, if I am not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to myſelf, they ſhall attain to it hereafter.

Can it be thought that the tender <hi>Father of my Spirit,</hi> would, after all my Pains, drop me into No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and at once fuſtrate all my Hopes and Labours? Can there, in this Caſe, any wiſe and good Reaſons be conceived for putting an End to my Being and my Hopes together? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, would not this ſeem extremely hard and unreaſonable, and conſequently utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, and not of a Piece, with the Conduct of Him, who muſt be a Being perfectly reaſonable and equitable.</p>

THIS Reaſoning is abundantly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be right, when I conſider further, <note n="*" place="bottom">See this Argument finiſhed in the beſt Manner by Mr. <hi>Wollaſton,</hi> in <hi>Rel.

                        <p>§ 19. THE chief Difficulty that lies in the Way of this Perſuaſion of a future State, is the Inconceivableneſs of it: But this, I think, can be no reaſonable Objection againſt it: For who, that had never ſeen any Thing but the univerſal Deſolation and Death of a ſevere Winter, could conceive any Thing of the exquiſite Beauties and admirable Productions of a fine Spring and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? Indeed I can no more conceive how my Soul is now united to my Body, and perceives and acts by Means of it, and by a meer Thought can move its unweildy Limbs at Pleaſure, than I can conceive how it can exiſt, perceive and act, after what we call Death, without this groſs tangible Machine, to which it is at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. I can, however, a little aſſiſt my Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in forming ſome glimmering Notion of that future State, from this eaſy Suppoſition of a Man born blind and deaf, who, at the ſame time, hath the Senſes of Feeling, Taſting and Smelling.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <hi>Guardian,</hi> No. 27.</note> Now, to this Man, the tangible World, with the various Objects of Taſte and Smell, is all the World that he can have any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, any more than I can conceive of thoſe <hi>Things which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor have they enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive.</hi> I, who have the viſible World about me, and the Perception of various Sounds, am to this Man, what I may ſuppoſe Angels and other Spirits are to me: He can no more conceive of the viſible World that I converſe with, than I can conceive of the ſpiritual World, or the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

State of my Being. Now, let me only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Man to be deprived of the Senſes of Feeling, Taſting and Smelling, and he is dead, intirely dead, to all the World that he had ever any Notion of. But then imagine his Eyes and Ears to be opened, and to have this glorious Show of viſible Objects, Light and Colours, with all their various Modifications, ſet before him, with a no leſs wonderful Variety of harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Sounds; I muſt conceive him to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely a new World open upon him, to which he was before an utter Stranger. He is indeed dead to the dark tangible World, but he hath exchanged it for a new viſible World. Such a Change is very conceiveable; but it cannot be imagined that what we call Death can be a greater; nor can I believe it will be ſo great a Change, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly probable that Seeing, Hearing, and ſome neceſſary Inſtances of Feeling, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both our preſent and future State, and a Fund to begin with (together with our intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and moral Accompliſhments) when we enter upon that new Condition, wherein I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that other and more exquiſite Senſes may be added to theſe, and not only theſe Senſes, but alſo our Underſtandings, Memory and Activity, may be advanced to a much greater Perfection than they had before. And inaſmuch as our Happineſs muſt imply Society and Intercourſe with each other, and with the external World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, it cannot be imagined but that we ſhall go off, and be always attended and connected with fine ſenſible Vehicles,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Wollaſton, R.

FURTHERMORE, to add another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance: I ſee here a Multitude of deſpicable Worms, confined to a ſlow Motion, and to a few low grovelling Senſations and Enjoyments, which, after a ſhort Period of ſeeming Death, by a wonderful Transformation, turn into beautiful winged Animals, and waft themſelves at Pleaſure through the Air, and enjoy Pleaſures they were before incapable of. Now may it not be reaſonably thought, that theſe Creatures were deſigned to be Emblems of my own Caſe?

                        <p>§ 21. UPON the Whole, therefore, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how the true End of my Being, eſpecially of that ſuperior Nature, which is the peculiar Character of our Species, can be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meerly by living this wretched, ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Life, that is allotted to me here; ſo I muſt be perſuaded, that I am deſigned for ſome other and nobler Condition of Being hereafter, and cannot avoid having <hi>Hopes full of Immortality.</hi> So that the only conſiſtent Notion I can frame of this Life muſt be this, That as it is the firſt Stage of my Being, ſo it is deſigned only for a State of Childhood, Diſcipline and <hi>Probation,</hi> in order to another, and a better State, hereafter, which, in the Reſult, is to be a State of perfect Manhood and <hi>Retribution.</hi> And conſequently, that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to qualify myſelf for that happy Condition, it muſt be my greateſt Care, and the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Buſineſs of my Life, while I continue here, to acquire, and improve myſelf in, all thoſe Accompliſhments, both of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> and that both <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>ſocial,</hi> wherein the Perfection and Happineſs of my ſuperior ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and immortal Nature conſiſts; which alone I can carry with me into that <hi>future State;</hi> and which alone can enable me to enjoy myſelf, and my Friends, and, above all, my GOD, who is my ſupreme and ſovereign Good, in whoſe Favour, with theſe Accompliſhments, I cannot fail of being, in ſome good Degree, happy even here, and finally ſecure from all Evil, and in the Enjoyment of a

vaſt, an unſpeakable, and an endleſs Felicity! Thus it appears, that the true and ultimate End of my Being, can be nothing ſhort of this; that I may be as happy as my Condition will admit of here, and eternally and completely happy in the future State of my Exiſtence, in the Enjoyment of GOD, and all that is good, and in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Knowledge and Virtue, which alone can render me capable thereof.</p>

                           <hi>Temperance,</hi> or a right Government of all my Powers, Appetites and Paſſions, being due to that human, active and immortal Nature, which GOD hath given me, as being neceſſary to its Happineſs within itſelf. And I the rather begin with theſe, as being neceſſary in order to both the other Branches. And,</p>
                        <p n="2">§ 2. (1.) FROM what hath been ſaid, it is plain, That the <hi>firſt</hi> Duty incumbent upon me, as a reaſonable active Creature, in order to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the End of my Being, is, to cultivate and improve the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and Underſtanding which GOD hath given me, to be the governing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and great Law of my Nature (Part I.

This general Virtue is called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Prudence,</hi> and ſtands in Oppoſition to <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> and <hi>Incogitancy.</hi> And, to deſcend to Particulars,</p>

It is in the next Place incumbent upon me, to conſider ſeriouſly and <hi>know myſelf,</hi> and <hi>not to think of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more highly than I ought to think, but to think ſoberly,</hi> according to what I really am. And this Virtue is called <hi>Humility,</hi> which is the true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all others, as it makes us very cautious of our own Conduct, and lays us proſtrate before the DEITY, and diſpoſeth us to treat others with great Temper, Tenderneſs and Affability; and ſtands in Oppoſition to every Degree of <hi>Pride, Arrogance,</hi> and <hi>Self-ſufficiency.</hi> And,</p>

taking its Riſe in the firſt Connections of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, ſpreads thro' the whole ſocial Syſtem, and iſſues in, and ſtrongly prompts to <hi>publick Virtue,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of our <hi>Country,</hi> and our <hi>Species,</hi> in Oppoſition to every Thing that implies <hi>Malevolence, Selfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>private Spiritedneſs.</hi> But to be particular in its ſeveral Branches riſing from the loweſt to the higheſt:</p>
                        <p n="3">§ 3. (2.) INASMUCH as I have ſeveral Things which I call <hi>my own,</hi> to which I have a <hi>Right,</hi> being poſſeſſed of them either by the free Gift of God, or by my own Activity and Induſtry, with his Bleſſing, and find they are greatly uſeful to my Comfort and Well-being, and feel a great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the unmoleſted Enjoyment of them, and Trouble in being deprived of them: And when I am moleſted or deprived by any One, without having juſtly forfeited them by my own Miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, I feel a ſtrong Senſe of Injury, and muſt therefore by Reflection conclude, that every other Perſon hath the ſame Senſe of Injury in the like Caſe as I have; it muſt therefore be my Duty, and the firſt Dictate of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> not to do Injury to others in any Reſpect, whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to their Souls, Bodies, Names or Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the rather, as I would wiſh to ſuffer no Injury from them in any of theſe Reſpects.

I muſt think it my Duty, from the ſame benevolent Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to treat others with all ſuch Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Acts and Inſtances of Kindneſs and good Uſage, as I ſhould, in my Turn, reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and take Pleaſure in receiving; to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to all good Offices in my Power to others, whether Neighbours or Strangers, whether to their Souls or Bodies; to ſay the beſt of them,

and put the kindeſt and moſt favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction I can upon what they ſay or do; and to conduct towards them with Humanity, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, Affability and Courteſy. And as I find a great Solace under Pain and Diſtreſs in the Pity and Aſſiſtance of others; ſo I muſt think it my Duty to have the like Sentiments of Compaſſion and Tenderneſs towards them in the like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, whether of Mind, Body or Eſtate, and ſhould think I acted unnaturally, if I did not contribute all I could, conſiſtent with other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, to their Comfort and Relief. Thus by reflecting and conceiving ourſelves in each other's Circumſtances (Part I. Chap.

All which are implied in the general Duty of <hi>Charity,</hi> which therefore comprehends <hi>Candour, Affability, Hoſpitality, Mercy, Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> in Oppoſition to all Inſtances of <hi>Uncharitableneſs,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs, Moroſeneſs, Envy, Ill-nature, Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Hardheartedneſs.</hi>

INASMUCH as it is manifeſt, from what was obſerved above, under the firſt general Head of the Duty we owe to Society, that it is incumbent upon us to do all we can to promote the Weal of our Fellow-Creatures, and to have a principal Zeal for the general Good, on which our own Welfare does very much depend (Part I. Chap. I. § 13. And Part II. Chap. I. § 6.) and ſince there may be ſeveral Things in our

Power, above and beyond what meer Juſtice and Humanity require, wherein we may be uſeful to others, and to the Publick; I muſt think it my Duty, from the ſame Principle, to be of a free and generous Spirit as far as I am able; to be forward and ready to every good Work, and to delight in doing Good, as GOD himſelf does, whereinſoever I may be uſeful in promoting his Honour, and the Good of Mankind; and this from a Senſe of Gratitude to him for all I enjoy. This Virtue is called <hi>Liberality, Generoſity</hi> and <hi>Magnificence,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Niggardlineſs,</hi> or a <hi>grudging, narrow</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Spirit.</hi> And for any Benefits received ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of GOD or Man, <hi>Gratitude</hi> is due to the Benefactor, in Oppoſition to a ſtupid <hi>ungrateful Spirit,</hi> which is extremely baſe and odious.</p>
                        <p n="7">§ 7. (6.) SINCE the Peace and Quietneſs of Society, which are indiſpenſably neceſſary to its Happineſs, depend not only on our avoiding eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing that is injurious, and doing all that is juſt, kind and generous, but alſo upon every One's being contented in his own Station, and faithfully endeavouring to diſcharge the Duties of it, without intermeddling in Affairs that do not belong to his Province; and upon every One's being of a Peace-making and forgiving Spirit, (Part II. Chap. II. § 6.) I muſt therefore think it my Duty to keep within my own Sphere, and mind my own Buſineſs, and do the Duty that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to my own Station; and if I have done any Wrong, to repair the Injury, and make Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aſk Forgiveneſs, as well as to be of a forgiving Spirit towards others, as I would hope GOD to be ſo towards me; and in a Word, to do all that is in my Power for promoting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

founded on them, both towards GOD, <hi>our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and our <hi>Neighbours;</hi> I proceed now to enumerate the chief of thoſe <hi>ſubordinate Duties,</hi> which are to be performed as Means of <hi>Culture,</hi> for begetting, improving and perfecting in us thoſe <hi>moral Virtues.</hi> And this will be done in anſwer to the two laſt of thoſe great Enquiries (<hi>Introd.</hi> 27.) <hi>viz.</hi> V. <hi>Whether I am what I ought to be?</hi> And if not, VI. <hi>What I ought to do, as a Means in order to be and do what I ought, and ſo in order finally to anſwer the End of my Being?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">§ 2. THE <hi>firſt</hi> of thoſe two laſt Enquiries will put us upon the great Duty of <hi>Self-examination,</hi> which is a Duty of very great Importance to us; for if we do not examine and truly <hi>know ourſelves,</hi> and what is our real State, how ſhall we be able to rectify what is amiſs, that we may be in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give a good Account of ourſelves at laſt?

what it really is, <hi>without Partiality, and without Hypocriſy.</hi>

                        <p n="4">§ 4. (2.) AND as the Knowledge of myſelf is of ſo great Importance, let it be the next Rule, that I entertain and cultivate within myſelf a due Senſe of the <hi>Dignity</hi> of my reaſonable, active and immortal Nature, as exhibiting a ſmall Image of the Divinity (Part I. Chap. I. § 6, 7, 8. And Chap. II. § 5.) and have a great <hi>Reverence</hi> for it as ſuch: This would make me always careful to do nothing unworthy, indecent or miſbecoming it; on the contrary, I ſhould be concerned, on all Occaſions, to act the decent Part in Life, or what duly becomes it in all its Relations. Let me eſpecially have a great Reverence for the Senſe of my own Conſcience, as being the Divine Light irradiating me within, and the Voice of the Deity Himſelf, that I may take the utmoſt Care, not to live in any Courſe whatſoever for which my own Reaſon and Conſcience ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me; for as One's Conſcience is properly One's Self, it is the greateſt Madneſs in the World, for a Man to live at a perpetual Variance with himſelf, and the firſt Point of Wiſdom, always to keep Friends with himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="5">§ 5. (3.) SINCE I depend wholly on GOD, and He is ever preſent with me, a conſtant Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of all my Behaviour, in the inward Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Thoughts of my Heart, as well as in all the outward Actions of my Life, and ſince I muſt expect to give an Account of myſelf to Him (Part I.

                        <p n="6">§ 6. (4.)

Chap. I. § 11.) ſo that if I have any Deſire of either doing any Good to them, or enjoying any Good from them, it muſt deeply concern me to endeavour to recommend myſelf to their good Opinion, and this can no otherwiſe be done, than by always acting the ſober, honeſt, faithful, generous and benevolent Part, in all my Intercourſe with them, which cannot fail of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging an Intereſt in their Good-will, Eſteem and Confidence, and muſt therefore be the wiſeſt Courſe I can take to anſwer all my moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Purpoſes, with Regard to my comfortable Subſiſtence in this preſent Life, as well as to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify me for a better.</p>

IF upon a due Survey of my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Behaviour, I find I have acted an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and vicious Part, as my own Conſcience will not fail to reproach me for it, ſo I cannot avoid feeling a great Deal of Uneaſineſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe upon reflecting on my Miſconduct (Part I.

                  <p n="1">1. O THOU Almighty BEING, on whom dependeth the Exiſtence of the World, and every Creature therein, and by whom all Things are governed and conducted to the ſeveral Ends of their Being, according to the various Natures which Thou haſt given them: By whoſe good Providence I have been brought into Being, and moſt kindly preſerved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, from the Beginning of my Life to this Moment, and enjoyed many undeſerved Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Favours, with regard both to my Well-being in this Life, and my everlaſting Happineſs in the Life to come; and eſpecially the ineſtimable Advantages of Thy Holy Goſpel, made known to us in Thy Name, by Thy bleſſed Son JESUS CHRIST, and all that He hath taught, and done, and ſuffered for us; I beſeech Thee graciouſly to accept of my moſt grateful Senſe and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of all Thy Bounty and Beneficence towards me. <hi>Bleſs</hi> JEHOVAH, <hi>O my Soul, and all that is within me, bleſs His holy Name: Bleſs</hi> JEHOVAH, <hi>O my Soul, and forget not all His Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities, and healeth all thine Infirmities: Who redeemeth thy Life from Deſtruction, and crowneth thee with lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kindneſs and tender Mercies! Bleſs</hi> JEHOVAH, <hi>O my Soul!</hi>

AND whereas, notwithſtanding the mighty Obligations of Thy Goodneſs, I have, in many Inſtances, ungratefully and perverſly ſinned againſt Thy moſt righteous and reaſonable Laws, in neglecting to do what Thou haſt commanded, and in doing what Thou haſt forbidden; I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly profeſs before Thee, my utter Abhorrence of all my Perverſeneſs, and my ſerious Reſolution, by Thy Grace, to be more watchful againſt all Temptations, and to amend my Conduct for the Time to come. And I do moſt earneſtly beg the Forgiveneſs of my many Offences, through Thy infinite Mercies in Thy Son JESUS CHRIST, and that Thou wilt for His Sake, deliver me from the evil Conſequences of all my Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Follies. And I humbly beſeech the Aſſiſtance of Thy Holy Spirit, to endue me with ſuch Diſpoſitions and Powers, as may carry me innocently and ſafely through all future Trials; and to enable me upon all Occaſions, from a Senſe of Duty to Thee, my GOD, to behave myſelf conformable to Thy moſt holy Laws, which are indeed the Laws of Reaſon and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in all Wiſdom, Probity and Virtue, and in the faithful Diſcharge of all the Duties of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Piety and Benevolence, with a humble Dependence upon thy infinite Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, and under a lively and habitual Senſe of thy All-ſeeing Eye, and the Account I am to give of myſelf to Thee.</p>

And vouchſafe us clear and diſtinct Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and a right Judgment in all Things, together with all virtuous Tempers and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo much Health and Proſperity as may be truly good for us in this our preſent State of Probation.
