            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS ſhort but pithy ſentence, contains in it all the virtues of the divine and the ſocial life. If we might be ſo happy as to penetrate to the bottom of it, to reach the quinteſſence, to unfold the ſubject matter of it, <hi>Charity,</hi> in its nature and riſe, its genuine tendency, effects, objects and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſhould ſee that it will dilate and expand itſelf ſo as to reach every order of men, not only
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012430_0004_0F8997D6537A7B10"/>
in their general callings as chriſtians, but in their particular callings, connexions and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to each other as members of community. For as the truth contained in it, is not too low for the greateſt monarch on earth, ſo neither is it too high for the meaneſt peaſant to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with. And were the hearts of men generally opened to give entertainment to it, they would inſtantly become <hi>the epiſtle of Chriſt,</hi> and preſently <hi>be known and read of all men.</hi> And the law of charity being <hi>written not with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhly tables of</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi>; of a curſed and miſerable, this would ſoon become a bleſſed and happy world!—It was a quality radically concreted with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature; but by the ſeduction and apoſtacy was loſt.</p>
            <p>As the creation ſprung from the Creator, <hi>all was good</hi>: And as man came forth of the hands of his MAKER; (<hi>man,</hi> the beauty and glory of the lower creation) he was innocent and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: In the moral image of his glorious author, —all was love—all was harmony. But when pride entered ſome of the celeſtial inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and proved the defection of thoſe prime apoſtates, the devil and his angels, envy and malignity wrought for the ſeduction of man made in the image of God; and proved fatally ſucceſſful. Man was loſt! his heart was turned off from its proper center and objective bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012430_0004_0F8997D6537A7B10"/>
That ſenſe of moral excellence, (the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,) in which radically lay his ſpiritual life, was gone. Pride, malignity, diſcord and enmity took place. His ſun was ſet! darkneſs and the ſhadow of death overſpread him. His appetites, which were made and deſigned to be ſubordinate, gained the aſcendent. Man fell under the curſe: and inſtead of an innocent regard to that felicity which aroſe from the heart's being ſwallowed up primarily in love to the glorious Being, and a ſenſe of moral beauty, a ſupreme regard to ſelf, and to creature good, took place. Hence all that jarring, diſcord, confuſion and bloodſhed which enſu'd, all over this miſerable world; as well as all thoſe pains, diſorders, and diſtreſſes of human nature; which finally reduce us to the duſt, whence we were taken. The curſe of God's law fell upon us, which condemns to eternal pain for every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience. And the very ground is curſed for man's ſake, in conſequence of his ſin. Yea, the animate and inanimate world ſuſtains the weight. The creature or the creation groans, being burdened and pained for deliverance. And from this guilty depravity, in which lies our ſpiritual death, and has ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſpread itſelf through the human nature, ariſes all that unkindneſs from friends, and all that bitterneſs from enemies, which we ſee and feel in this apoſtate world. In a word, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012430_0005_0F8997D6F1F11090"/>
were ruined and loſt: <hi>Death entered by ſin, and paſſed upon all, for all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON this plan proceedeth the wonderful work of redemption and recovery for loſt man, by the Redeemer and Sanctifier: by the Son of God who came to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt, and by the Spirit of God to make application. Here was room for mercy, mere mercy to take place;— divine wiſdom and counſel found out the way, for the exerciſe of it. A way glorious, clear beyond the reach and penetration of the moſt exalted of created nature, till it was opened to view by the man whoſe <hi>name is the Brouch; who was to build the temple of the Lord; to build the Temple of the Lord, and to bear the glory.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Zech. 6.12.</note>
Of which early diſcoveries began to be made ſoon after the apoſtacy; and were after renewed and made more plain to Abraham, Moſes, David and Iſaiah, who ſaw his glory and ſpake of him. And when the fullneſs of time was come that the predictions which went before of him ſhould be accompliſhed; ſuch as <hi>this</hi> with many others; <hi>Behold a virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Emanuel; the Spirit of the Lord came upon her, and the power of the higheſt over ſhadow'd her. And the holy thing born of her</hi>;—Here, note, is an exemption from all the human race by ordinary generation; <hi>the holy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012430_0005_0F8997D6F1F11090"/>
thing born of her is call'd the Son of God.</hi> In a time of general expectation he made his entrance into the world, in a way not agreeable to the general taſte; not with public obſervation; not in worldly ſplendor, as the princes and nobles of this world—but in humble obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he made a ſtable his birth-place, and a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his cradle. However, it was to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the upper world, attended with a pomp and magnificence truly caeleſtial; becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dignity of the Perſon. The heavenly inhabitants were active and admiring ſpectators of the ſurpriſing ſcene. The morning ſtars ſang together, &amp;c. A caeleſtial meſſenger brought the tidings down to earth. <hi>And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately there was with the angel an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude of the heavenly hoſt:</hi> Thoſe aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial minſtrels fill'd theſe lower regions, <hi>ſinging praiſes, and giving glory to God in the higheſt,</hi> and proclaiming <hi>peace, good-will to men.</hi> Thus was fulfilled that prediction; <hi>when he bringeth his firſt-begotten into the world, be ſaith; And let all the angels of God worſhip him.</hi> And what was the occaſion of all this ſublime ſolemnity? <hi>This day is born in the city of David a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> And he was deſigned to ſave them from their ſins, (and therefore not agreeable to men's taſte, for they love their ſins) and to recover thoſe who were ruin'd and loſt by ſin; to reſtore them to the image of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012430_0006_0F8997D7B1703060"/>
God; to the cordial practice of the duty and felicity pointed out in our text, <hi>CHARITY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHICH word contains in it the ſubſtance of the law and religion of innocence, and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the goſpel. CHARITY is an agreeable found to moſt, and often in the mouths of men in general; but too often a ſtranger to their hearts: and perhaps little underſtood in the genuine nature and effects of it.</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing on the words, let us</p>

               </gap> a little to the nature, the riſe, objects and operations of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. VIEW it as the end of the commandment.</p>
            <p n="3">III. MAKE ſome application, agreeable to the ſubject and occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE are to attend a little to the nature, riſe, objects and operations of charity.</p>
            <p>IF we conſult the ſacred oracles, we ſhall find it a primary and radical virtue of the chriſtian life: clear above, and ſpecifically different from any thing we are poſſeſſors of in this fallen ſtate, either by natural birth, or the force and influence of meer education. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> agreeable to its own principle depraved. <hi>To be carnally minded</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>is enmity againſt God.</hi> The loyal ſubjects
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012430_0006_0F8997D7B1703060"/>
of God's moral government, as ſuch, <hi>are born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the wiil of man.</hi> And as to the glories of that king and kingdom, with which charity is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily converſant, they are revealed not by fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>CHARITY in its nature is the ſame with love, a divine or a true chriſtian love: which is a holy exerciſe of heart toward its proper objects; and is the root and ſubſtance of all godlineſs. That it is the ſame in its nature with holy love, may be ſeen by obſerving that the ſame word, <hi>agape,</hi> in the original language of the new teſtament, here tranſlated <hi>charity,</hi> is every where uſed, where the word <hi>love</hi> is uſed in our tranſlation, i. e. a holy or chriſtian love. To mention but one inſtance out of innumerable; <q>Hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God</q> 
               <hi>agape tou theou,</hi> 
               <q>is ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the heart.</q> And where it has not only the ſupreme and glorious Being, but fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures as the object of it, as in our text, and elſewhere, it ſeems to be judiciouſly tranſlated <hi>charity</hi>: And comprehends the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of both tables.</p>
            <p>IT IS of a divine original, the fruit of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous efficacy. For <hi>the fruits of the Spirit are love,</hi> &amp;c. It ariſes <hi>out of a pure heart</hi>: a heart purified or renew'd by grace; put into a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſee and feel the weight of the arguments and motives to love; which never fail to operate
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012430_0007_0F8997D8727BEB70"/>

               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Tit. 1. 15.</note> Conſcience may be called the eye of tie ſoul; a diſcerner of the things which are excellent, and of the excellence of then—and of the guilt and turpitude of the reverſe. But <hi>if the eye be evil,</hi> viciated and defiled, <hi>the whole body is full of darkneſs.</hi> Let the <hi>veil,</hi> which conſiſts in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, propenſity or exerciſe of heart directly the reverſe to charity, <hi>be taken off and the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, will ſhine into the heart; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his glory—the heart is ſprinkled from evil conſcience</hi>;—holy affections inkindle in the ſoul, riſe into zeal and ſerver in the greateſt and beſt cauſe: and in their benevolent effects, like the kind and radient beams of the ſun, diffuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to every proper object.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle adds—<hi>and of ſaith unfeigned</hi>: a found and permanent faith; by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction from that which is temporary and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, <hi>withering away in time of temptation</hi>—and from that which is in pretence, and not in

truth; or that which is erroneous and unſound. Which was the caſe with ſome in the church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which began to degenerate in Paul's day; who beſought Timothy to <hi>charge ſome</hi> not to teach any <hi>other doctrine</hi>; <hi>mee heterodidaſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein,</hi> not to teach heterodoxy; which ſome had fallen into, inconſiſtent with that <hi>form of ſound words delivered</hi> to them: and had turned aſide to vain jangling; <hi>deſiring to be teachers of the law, not underſtanding what they ſaid, nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they affirmed.</hi> And before the deceaſe of the apoſtle John, that church was complained of as having <hi>loſt her firſt love.</hi> When a church or people degenerate, or fall into errors incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the truth and ſimplicity of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they loſe their love or purity toward God, and their charity toward men. He who comes to God, muſt believe his being and perfections, or his true character; which is moſt eſpecially exhibited in the truths revealed in his holy law, and in the glorious goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. When thoſe truths are received, and that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter duly apprehended in the excellence of it, (as it always is when the truth enters an honeſt and good heart), <hi>charity</hi> or a holy affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably enſues, and is coming to God. For it is a uniting of the heart to the glorious and worthy object.</p>
            <p>HE therefore, who receives the record of God, on <hi>divine</hi> teſtimony, or <hi>believeth</hi> in his heart, <hi>that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God</hi>;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012430_0008_0F8997D935C38CC0"/>
and will not <hi>be aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God to</hi> every one <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,</hi> and gives entertainment to <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the objects of charity, that noble, that divine and extenſive virtue, it is not bounded by the utmoſt limits of creation. It extends clear beyond all created nature. As it is virtuous, noble and ſublime in its nature, ſo it ſoars aloſt to the moſt noble and ſublime objects; the unbounded and incomprehenſible excellence of the Creator and Redeemer. As it is ſaid of <hi>hope,</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of <hi>charity,</hi> out of which hope ſprings: it enters into that within the vail, whither the fore-runner is for us entered. If our affection is bounded by the creature, or limited to created good, we have no portion in God, nor at preſent capable of enjoying any. Charity, if it take a ſurvey of all creatures and things below the ſkies, and then ſtretch its wings and ariſe to the upper and inviſible world, rove among created caecleſtial inhabitants, the general aſſembly and church of the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, can find nothing in them, which can be its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bounds, or its principal and primary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. It cannot be bounded by, or reſt in any thing ſhort of uncreated excellence, the ſum and comprehenſion of being and bleſſedneſs, the perfections and glories of God and the Lamb who ſetteth on the throne. As it is written,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012430_0008_0F8997D935C38CC0"/>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God.</hi> This is the old and the new commandment, the law and the goſpel. Thoſe therefore who are <hi>riſen with Chriſt,</hi> have <hi>their affections on things above where Chriſt is at the right hand of God.</hi> Charity, the end of the commandment, is a compliance with this divine precept, without which there is no cordial compliance with any injunction of divine revelation.</p>
            <p>THE greateſt and beſt of beings, the <hi>Being</hi> of glorious and unbounded excellence, is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary object of this holy affection. And if ſo, it fixes on him, in a ſpecial and peculiar manner on account of <hi>that</hi> in his character, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him moſt eſpecially worthy, excellent and amiable; which is his moral perfections; wherein lies his peculiar glory, and his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs. As he is glorious in holineſs, charity views him and centers in him, according to that character: otherwiſe is not according to truth. But as it <hi>rejoyceth in the truth</hi> ſo more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the glorious truth of the divine charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the amiableneſs and moral beauty of which is its primary objective ground. And as the ſuperlative excellence of the divine Being, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in his works and in his word, ſo the divine law and glorious goſpel of the grace of God are objects of it. <hi>Thy word is very pure, wherefore thy ſervant loveth it.</hi> Charity <hi>rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in</hi> the <hi>word more than in all riches. And it is ſweeter than honey to the taste.</hi> It <hi>eſteems</hi> his <hi>precepts,</hi> clothed with all their attractive and all

their tremendous fanctions, <hi>concerning all things to be right</hi>; is well ſuited with them. And as the Redeemer, the aſcended <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> in his divine and mediatorial glories, is an object of this divine virtue, ſo the glorious goſpel of the grace of God wherein he <hi>has brought life and immortality to light,</hi> is the center of its exerciſe and of its joy.</p>

               </gap> to the tendency and operations of it, in regard to God its primary object, they are all divine, all glorious. As it is itfelf an aſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the deity who is <hi>love</hi>; ſo it tends more and more to lead the ſubject of it, to aſpire after conformity to God, 'till he is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up in likeneſs and enjoyment. For it is a participation of the divine nature, and its am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition can be bounded by nothing ſhort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with all the fullneſs of God. It renders Chriſt the <hi>chief of ten thouſand, and altogether lovely: ſits under his ſhadow with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and his fruit is ſweet to its taſte.</hi> It is ardently fond of every thing which has a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable aſpect upon his cauſe and intereſt in the world: Is never ſo much in its element as when that flouriſheth, nor ſo much out of it as when that is under decay and ſuffering. It ſenſibly knows what it is in good earneſt to offer up that petition, <hi>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.</hi> It feels the weight and efficacy of goſpel motives, not only to <hi>join</hi> itſelf, but forever to <hi>leave to the Lord</hi> as its portion and bleſſedneſs: and the language of it to others is, <hi>Come taſte and ſee that the Lord is good.</hi>

IN a time when the chriſtian world is all in the heave, and one ſays <hi>this</hi> and another <hi>that</hi> is right; <hi>lo, here is Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>lo, there</hi>; and their language confounded like that of <hi>Babel, Charity</hi> reſts in God as its portion, and ſays, The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice. It makes God its <hi>dwelling-place in all generations</hi>: and when wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the avocations, temptations or ſnares of time, it on reflection aſſumes this language, <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my ſoul.</hi> As it is grieved at the diſhonour of God, the violation of his law, <hi>(I beheld the tranſgreſſors and was griev'd)</hi> ſo it reſolves to adhere to him, oppoſe who will; <hi>depart from me ye evil doers; for I will keep the commandments of my God.</hi> It carries the ſoul above the pomps and allurements of the preſent world: it chearfully ſubmits to ſelf-denying duties at the call of God. It was this gave <hi>Abraham</hi> the victory in that ſevereſt of combats between nature and duty, when call'd to lay violent hands on his dear and only ſon <hi>Iſaac—</hi>—This influenced Moſes to deſpiſe the pomps and pleaſures of a royal court, when in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the cauſe of his God; <hi>chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> It is a principle of dependence on God and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for all ſupplies relative to the natural and the divine life: renounces therefore all confidence in the fleſh, and rejoiceth in Criſt Jeſus, in whom dwells all the fullneſs of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012430_0010_0F8997DAB0A2F168"/>
the Godhead. And by way of conſequence, a ſpirit of <hi>adoption</hi> always attends it, which is a ſpirit of <hi>prayer and ſupplication with thankſgiving, in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to ſelf, I ſhall only obſerve that the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the ſubject conſiſts in, or immediately reſult from it: for it is a principle of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and joy in God and the divide Emmanuel, <hi>whom having not ſeen ye love; and in whom tho now ye ſee him not, yet believing ye rejoice with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> Here is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity out of a pure heart and of faith unfeigned. A good conſcience is implied: divine conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion joy unſpeakable reſults from or conſiſt in it.</p>
            <p>CHARITY always has reſpect to ſome being or quality as its object; and the apprehended amiableneſs or worth of the object, (which is likewiſe its ground and motive) the higher, it riſes, the ſtronger it operates, and the greater the felicity reſulting from it. It may be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, whether it is poſſible in the nature of things, for a rational or ſocial creature as ſuch (which is the ſame with a moral agent) to enjoy happineſs abſtract from all conſideration of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſociety? If not, whether the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a rational creature, as ſuch, is not wholly of the ſocial kind? And if ſo, it may be aſſerted that there can be no happineſſ to a moral agent without love; and even all that happineſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically conſiſts in it. Thiſ reaſoning ſeems to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012430_0010_0F8997DAB0A2F168"/>
be countenanc'd and confirm'd by divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. That which duty and virtue conſiſts in, happineſs conſiſts in: but duty and virtue according to revelation, conſiſt in love: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happineſs. This therefore is the ſum of the law, to love the Lord thy God with all the heart; and thy neighbour as thy ſelf: Therein we have fellowship one with another; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt. The conſolation which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from it, the <hi>ſtranger intermeddles not with.</hi> It is that which attends the ſubject of it through life; at home and abroad—in private and public life; its joy in prosperity; its ſupport in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; even in the vally of the ſhadow of death: Its language is, <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me by thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and afterward receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but thee &amp;c. Myſteſh and my heart fail, but thou art the ſtrength of my heart and my portion forever. Charity never faileth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, charity has not only the <hi>divine perfections</hi> and government, but <hi>fellow men</hi> for the object of it: <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Though we are made more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and primarily the guardians of our own intereſt and happineſs, yet charity conſiders the intereſt of another of as much worth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as our own, and is diſpoſed to further and promote it. It extends its benevolent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes not to a few individuals and friends merely, to whom indeed it is grateful for all benefactions and manifeſtations of favour and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012430_0011_0F8997DB7232B540"/>
reſpect, but it wiſhes well to enemies, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives injuries; and conducts as the off-ſpring of that <hi>glorious Being who cauſeth his ſun to riſe an the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and unjuſt.</hi> [It is of a patient and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering diſpoſition, under the evil things with which it is tried in this tempting and thorny world, in the courſe of divine providence: and is a ſpirit of that forbearance recommended in the ſacred oracles, one toward another, under common infirmities and failings: <hi>Forbearing one another in love.</hi> While it neglects not juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and equity, kindneſs is its genuine make and tendency, <hi>It ſuffereth king and is kind: Yea it beareth all things: endureth all things.</hi> It is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the law of kindneſs; which is, that we <hi>love our neighbour as ourſelves.</hi> We mean not to fail in kindneſs to ourſelves: and if our regard to ourſelves, be the meaſure of regard to others, we ſhall be kind to them.

capricious will and humour of the ruler; which is so far from
being a lawful government, that it is the iligitimate off-spring of pride and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; it has its origin from beneath, and is uſually brought about by <hi>force</hi> or <hi>intrigue</hi>; and commonly pregnant with a ſeries of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, cruelty, oppreſſion and bloodſhed. Under it the inſlaved people groan 'till they are ſo ſunk and debaſed that they are abandoned as to any ſenſe of liberty and the rights of men; which happens not 'till they have loſt all ſenſe of public and private virtue; and are invelop'd in a thick and impenetrable cloud of ignorance and wickedneſs: Then, and not 'till then are they prepared to pay their ſtupid, crouching and ſervile devoirs to uſurpation and deſpotism.</p>
            <p>CHARITY is a cardinal quality of a true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot: It effectually engages the ruler to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the civil intereſt of the ſtate and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and as a means of it, to diſcountenance and ſupreſs vice and immorality, which ever has a threatning aſpect, both natural and moral, on the common weal;—and to promote and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage virtue and religion: as <hi>righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, but ſin is the reproach,</hi> deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ruin of a people.

of the people; either to indulge humour or avarice, or to gratify a faction: For he knows that ſuch acts of arbitrary power, not being the exerciſe of lawful authority, are unjuſt, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not in their nature binding.</p>
            <p>WHEN Pilate the Roman governor in <hi>Judea,</hi> told the king of Iſrael that he had <hi>power to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and power to releaſe him; Jeſus anſwered, Thou couldſt have no power againſt me, were it not given thee of God.

            <p n="2">II. WE come now to the ſecond thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, viz. <hi>to view charity as the end of the commandment</hi>—Which is already ſo far an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated, that but few words are neceſſary.—And here let us obſerve, that the apoſtle's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and immediate reference, by <hi>the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is to the charge or injunction which Paul beſought Timothy to lay upon ſome to teach no other doctrine. As may be ſeen by looking into the original text, and comparing the words uſed; which are of the ſame derivation. He deſired Timothy, <hi>hina paranggeilees,</hi> that thou
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012430_0015_0F8997DF54464308"/>ſhouldeſt charge ſome, <hi>not to teach any other doctrine.</hi> Then adds, <hi>now the end, tees parang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelias,</hi> of this charge, this injunction, <hi>is charity.</hi> However, we are not to underſtand it excluſive of other precepts and injunctions; for where is the ſame reaſon, there ſhould be the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. But there is the ſame reaſon to ſay of other precepts and injunctions of religion, <hi>the end of them is charity.</hi> The precepts of the <hi>law,</hi> the diſcoveries, doctrines, calls and injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> all point out and aim at this end; this noble and caeleſtial virtue: This therefore is the old and the new commandment, the law and the goſpel: and this is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of them: <hi>On this bangs all the law and the prophets.</hi> As we have conſidered, it radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally contains all the virtues of the divine life, perſonal and ſocial: and is the root and origin of all true morality. <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my word.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John 14.23.</note> 
               <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the law.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>REMARK I. IF charity be the end of the commandment, containing in its boſom all the virtues of the chriſtian life, and is a radical virtue, the ſum of all conformity to God, then without it we have no cordial conformity to God in any of the precepts and injunctions of religion; but our <hi>whole mind and conſcience is defiled, and nothing is pure.</hi> And the want of it
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012430_0015_0F8997DF54464308"/>
in a moral agent, implies in it that temper and exerciſe of heart which is the root and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of all corruption and vice. And <hi>tho' we could ſpeak with the tongue of men and angels, and have not charity, we ſhould be as ſounding braſs and a tinkling cymbal. And tho' we have the gift of propheſy, and underſtand all myſteries and all knowledge; and tho' we had all faith, ſo that we could remove mountains, and have no charity, we are nothing</hi>; <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3</note> and ever lie open expoſed to the ſnares of a depraved heart, an evil world, and ſubtle devil; which have made shocking work with this apoſtate race. How came Cain to riſe up againſt and murder his brother? The want of charity.— And the ſame cauſe brought in all that inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of wickedneſs which cauſed the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the world to repent that he had made man on the earth, and to destroy a world of them with a deluge; ſpread vice and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery through Sodom and the cities of the plains, and brought upon them <hi>the vengeance of eternal fire</hi>: Sold Joſeph into Egypt: raiſed murmurings in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt God Moſes, and brought deſtruction on them in the wilderneſs; led them off to idolatry in Canaan, and the wrath of God fell upon them: removed the candleſticks from the Aſian churches; has ſpread vice and debauchery, cruelty, tyranny, oppreſſion, bloodſhed and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012430_0016_0F8997DFF2367248"/>
over this globe. Hence vanity of vanities, all is vanity. And we of New-England ſhall have nothing to ſave us from the higheſt pitch of abomination, but what is called reſtraining grace, when once our charity is gone; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this we are nothing.</p>
            <p>FROM all which we may remark,</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE vaſt difference between this, and that modern charity which ſeems to be in the mouths of many, but is well conſiſtent with an impure, an unrenewed heart, an evil conſcience and a feigned faith. [The <hi>one</hi> is the root and comprehenſion of all virtue public and private, and the other has nothing of the nature of true and genuine virtue in it. The <hi>one</hi> is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and divine principle, and the <hi>other</hi> flows from principles merely human and depraved. And as their origin, ſo their objects and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency are ſpecifically different. The <hi>one</hi> (a diſintereſted virtue) has him who is glorious in holineſs for its primary and its ultimate object; while mere ſelf is the riſe, the hinge and the centre of the <hi>other.</hi>]</p>
            <p>IT ſeems to lie ſome times in liberal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions to the public and the poor: and may ariſe from a natural ſoftneſs and generoſity of temper and conſtitution, or from other cauſeſ and motives. Thus our mother country is ſaid to abound in this kind of charity. Hence a noted writer of their own ſays, <q>They hope
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012430_0016_0F8997DFF2367248"/>
their charity will cover the multitude of their ſins; <note n="*" place="bottom">Salm. Geo. p. 226.</note> and ſave them from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> But an inſpired writer intimates, that "we may give all our goods to feed the poor," yet be deſtitute of charity. Beneficence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the genuine effect of true charity: and it tends on proper occaſions to cover the ſins of others, but to purge out and deſtroy our own. Not to expect ſalvation in them, but to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them. <hi>For this cauſe was the Son of God manifeſted, to take away our ſins, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> On the other hand, it is the tendency of this ſpecies of modern charity, by benefactions to purchaſe a ſalvation conſiſtent with the life and power of ſin. A meer ideal project, ariſing from the DECEIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FULNESS of ſin.</p>
            <p>In ſome, it ſeems to conſiſt in a good opinion of others, while living; but eſpecially to find them out in heaven, evidence or not, when dead and gone. Apoſtolic charity wiſhes the eternal ſalvation of men ardently; but is no blind and credulous principle, forming opinions and maxims without foundation to ſupport them. Sometimes it is garniſhed with the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of <hi>catholick:</hi> and ſo extends its good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to all parties and profeſſions of men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever different and oppoſite in their ſentiments and practice. This evinces that it has no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of its own, or baſis for its ſupport. [Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012430_0017_0F8997E0B091DA68"/>
to this pagans, infidels, and popiſh ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, who wear the mark of the <hi>beaſt,</hi> ſtand near as fair for heaven as chriſtians.] How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is not of that ſort which <hi>never faileth.</hi> It is capable of retiring into itſelf, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a very contracted ſpirit. While the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is at a diſtance, or to ſerve a turn, it will make a ſpecious ſhew; but, ſtand in the way of its ambitious or party views, it will become bitter and cenſorious; will repeat and aggravate failings, and often find them where there are none: will run into parties and intrigues, if not factions: will ſtigmatize ſuch as differ from them, or ſtand in their light, with epithets of reproach, or ſome diſcriminating marks of odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. [Yet will cry out and call upon others for charity, meaning a good opinion of them, and approbation of their temper and conduct.] Would be thought very charitable, but indulge a temper and conduct very inconſiſtent with evangelic <note n="‡" place="bottom">Neither is this charity free from the imputation of ſelf Inconſiſtency. Arians, Socinians, and Arminians exerciſe this ſort of charity toward Calviniſts. Biſhop Beveridge was a Calviniſt in doctrine; and the Arminians, &amp;c. from that day to this, have eſteemed him to be one of the beſt men in the church. But yet they will ſay, <q>if they believed Calviniſtic doctrines to be agreeable to the bible, they would renounce in</q> This is juſt as many have done. Many of the deiſts And infidels in England have been convine'd, that the bible ſupported Calviniſtic doctrines, which they could not ſubmit to, and therefore renounced revelation. A carnal unbelieving heart is as oppoſite to bible doctrine as to Calviniſtic doctrine: for it is enmity againſt God: And if ſo, it is enmity againſt the doctrines of God's book. Thoſe doctrines which ſuit an impenitent, unhumbled heart, are not the holy truths of the bible.</note> All ſuch kind of charity,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012430_0017_0F8997E0B091DA68"/>
conſiſtent with an unhumbled, an unbroken and impenitent heart, how high ſoever it ariſes, differs not materially in its general nature and origin, or very eſſentially in its object, from that which once preſſed a clamorous out-cry from a popular multitude; GREAT IS DIANA, OF THE EPHESIANS.</p>
            <p>[IT may be called <hi>modern</hi> by way of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>apoſtolic</hi> charity; not becauſe it is of late date; for it took its riſe from the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and has lived and reigned in this guilty world ever ſince. It often diſcovers itſelf in a biggoted fiery zeal in favour of a cauſe, and againſt thoſe of different ſentiments and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. As it is the off-ſpring and ſpirit of pride, and carries in it much fondneſs for ſelf; ſo it uſually affects domination; and would have every one bow under its ſcepter. It has therefore made dreadful work in this part of the creation. Hence the ancients had <hi>trial of cruel mockings and ſcurges; yea, moreover of bonds and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment. They were ſtoned, they were ſawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword: They wandered about in ſheep ſkins and goat-ſkins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented</hi>] And hence the Iſraelites killed the <hi>true,</hi> cheriſhed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the <hi>falſe prophets,</hi> who propheſied

Again, when pleading for an American epiſcopate, after which they ſo much languiſh for the government of their clergy and people, confirmation, &amp;c it is added, by the Bp. of Briſtol, in his ſermon before the ſociety, p. 26.27. <q>BUT there are men who will receive neither law nor goſpel from us; who clamor for liberty, but yet are the moſt imperious of taſk maſters and tyrants; who contend for unlimited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration for themſelves, but yet are to all others moſt intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, whenever they get power into their own hands</q> Theſe and many ſuch like are the repreſentations made of the colonies without diſtinction, by the higheſt dignitaries in the church, on thoſe high anniverſary occaſions, in the pariſh church of St. MARY L BOW, and ſpread all over the nation.— The deſign of which is obvious.

happy people! were we but ſenſible of it, and of the right way of preſerving our happineſs, (felices ſua ſi bona nôrint) which is in great meaſure wrapt up in charity. It has paved the way for the joys of the preſent occaſion, wherein our eyes behold our teachers, and our <hi>ears hear the voice ſaying, this is the way, walk ye in it.</hi> Likewiſe behold our rulers, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our country, who are of ourſelves, and of our own chooſing; whoſe intereſt is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon imbarked with ours; and are not only our civil fathers but our chriſtian brethren; men of charity and men of prayer, as Moſes. Men who will naturally care for our ſtate; ſhining and exemplary ornaments in our churches; men (as we charitably ſuppoſe) fear God and hate covetouſneſs—wiſe men and known among our tribes; under whoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations we enjoy all advantages to lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty. He who rules in heaven, and ſits king forever, has indulged us theſe peculiar and joyful pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges.

            <p>THE diſcourſe now turns itſelf more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the preſent occaſion; and thoſe who poſſeſs the peculiar honours of the day, —the Honorable the Governor and Company of this Colony, including both Houſes of Aſſembly,

            <p>HONORED and worthy Fathers,</p>
            <p>WE have been told by ſome, that this paſſage of ſacred writ, (with how much juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice every one is at liberty to judge) <hi>Know ye not that the ſaints ſhall judge the world</hi>? means, that a chriſtian magiſtracy ſhould be ſet up in the world. The comment ſeems agreeable to ſome ancient prediction relative to goſpel days. As, <q>I will reſtore your judges as at the firſt, and your counſellors as at the beginning,</q> and the like. The paſſage is this day fulfilled in our eyes, and is the joy of our hearts. We beſeech you therefore to remember that the hopes and confidence of this people, under God, is repoſed in you: and their meain is, that you ſhould ſerve the public, and not merely ſerve yourſelves of them. And the ſame is God's meaning, who has raiſed you to the honour of this truſt. And how vile in his ſight, as well as baſely ungrateful to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try muſt you be; if, by a mean, careleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive and ſupine diſpoſition, or any worſe cauſe, you ſhould either betray their rights, or not proſecute their beſt intereſt? <q>Rulers hold their character at their peril; their ſhining ſuperiority will degrade or exalt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012430_0022_0F8997E473546180"/>
them.</q> And we hold ourſelves under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of gratitude, firſt to the governor of the world, and then to your honours, for that charitable and that reſpectable character held up to public view in this worthy ſenate;—for your charitable care and tenderneſs of our public rights, civil and religious, when they have been brought into danger. We look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, under God, the guardians of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing privileges, which have been dearly purchaſed, and by charity are highly prized. We thank you for the ſalutary and good laws which from time to time have been enacted, for the preſervation of peace, property and every perſonal and ſocial intereſt—for the ſuppreſſion of vice, prophanneſs and immorality—for the encouragement and ſupport of virtue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in all our towns and churches, whereby the whole country is divided into eccleſiaſtical ſocieties or pariſhes for religious purpoſes, in which goſpel adminiſtrations are every where ſupported by law: ſo that your public conduct and the ſtate of public facts, is a contradiction to the repreſentations which ſome have the effrontery to make of us, in two reſpects;</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT we have not the ordinances of the goſpel, the knowledge of God, or the means of religion and vertue.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we are of ſuch an intolerant ſpirit that we can bear no profeſſion but our own, <note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop of Briſtol's ſerm. before ſoci.</note>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:012430_0022_0F8997E473546180"/>
when at the ſame time we have a known legal fund for the ſupport of the profeſſion of ſuch as would faſten the charge upon us: a lenity and ſupport unexampled by any country, in reſpect to thoſe who diſſent from its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>WE thank you for your pious care in regard to the <hi>execution</hi> of laws for the ſuppreſſion of immorality; and your charitable and judicious appointment of executive authority, in which we pray you may abound more and more in your circumſpection; and for all your charitable attention to our ſchools of learning, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private: by means of which knowledge, human and divine literature, has been diffuſed through this colony, and into many other parts of this land. What was all the boaſted lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> thoſe ancient ſeats of the muſes, compared with Connecticut under favour of your countenance? That the whole country in greater or leſs degrees reap the agreeable and ſalutary effects: That many, who have not had the advantage of a public education, as well as many who have, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come qualified for eminent uſe in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and every church furniſhed with a learned miniſtry of their own chooſing. We aſk the continuation of your countenance in this regard. Suffer; honoured ſirs, the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic direction, <hi>Above all things put on charity</hi>; which always has a favourable aſpect on know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012430_0023_0F8997E616D12408"/>
virtue and liberty; which are in cloſe connection. It is a moſt public-ſpirited vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; will have a ſalutary influence on all your conſultation—will ſeclude all low, ſelfish and party deſigning views and intrigues. Have you any men of that character among you, it will daſh them out of countenance when they ſee their artifice and intrigues frowned upon by a spirit of charity and general benevolence, which will view them as ſpots and blurs in your character, and unſalutary excreſcences in your body, and no honour to your conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. As their intriguing ſpirit is ever reſleſs to forward men of their own turn, it will be attended with more extenſive influence and danger to the public order and good of society than at firſt view will be readily imagined.—Charity will be as the candle of the lord to intricate paths. At leaſt it will diſpose your minds to ſearch after truth, and to feel the weight and force of its arguments which is half the battle. <hi>The meck will be guide in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the meek will be teach his way.</hi>—A principal object of this public virtue is the common good: But ſeperate this from regard to the divine honour and law of God, and your charity will be very same and defective, and you will purſue the object very ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Charity will aim at this object in all your acts, and when made will ſee to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012430_0023_0F8997E616D12408"/>
—Will take heed to prefer men who love order and government, and will exert themſelves for it; and are friendly to all our rights and privileges as men, as Engliſshmen, as chriſtians and coloniſts: Men who diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance idleneſs and growing profuſeneſs, and other vices: who will, by example and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity encourage induſtry and good oeconomy, the natural ſupports of our liberty—men who know how to diſtinguiſh between lawful and licentious liberty: the latter of which, taking occaſion from ſome late occurrences, has been for ſome years ſtruggling for the aſcendant in church and ſtate; has in great meaſure gained the point in the former, and ſoon will in the latter, provided there be none to give out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: Then will you bear the ſword in vain, and we are an undone people. It is reported, that in ſome of our populous towns the laws againſt vice, particularly prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are openly trampled on with too little notice of authority. If this be the caſe, it will ſpread itſelf like a contagion, our children will be ruined, and woe to this land! <hi>Woe unto thee if my ſoul depart from thee.</hi> Wherefore be ſtrong, and quit you like men. All the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and good people in the land will be with you: And what is infinitely more <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> will be with you.</p>
            <p>YOUR honours will remember withal, that though as rulers you ſuſtain the exalted cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012430_0024_0F8997E6B219B2E8"/>
of God's, you <hi>muſt die like men,</hi> and be your ſelves brought to another tribunal above any earthly one, which will be as impartial and deciſive for you as for the meaneſt ſubject on earth.</p>
            <p>WILL your honours indulge us another word? This reſpectable body has often been minded of the <hi>public good,</hi> as the object of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the end of your inſtitution; but when particulars have been entered on, there is one point has ſcarcely ever been touched; which may be one reaſon it has been ſo little thought of, and attended to by the legiſlature, and yet may be viewed as a point of great importance to the public; beſure when it comes to our own perſonal caſe, we are wont to view it in that light: And it is ſtrange it is not more conſidered in that light by the public. Our lives and health we are wont to regard above every thing in the preſent world, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the reſt: and the vital and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſprings in this curious animated machine, which is <hi>fearfully and wonderfully</hi> made, lie deep and much out of common obſervation; and are liable to a vaſt variety of accidents, by which health is impaired and life endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered. There are healing remedies provided by the author of nature for many of theſe caſes: but when the patient is taken into the hand of ſuch as have never been at the pains to penetrate into the human ſtructure, to learn
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012430_0024_0F8997E6B219B2E8"/>
wherein a healthy ſtate conſiſts, what is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it, nor to learn the nature of medicine, the doctrine of diſeaſes, their cauſes, ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and curative indications, nor to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between things that differ, his caſe is danger of proving fatal for want of ſkill, when it was not ſo in the nature and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it. And we being as unable to diſtinguiſh between the proſeſſors of the medical art as many of them are between the objects of their profeſſion, ſecurely repair to them, as an ox to the ſlaughter, and a bird to the ſnare of the fowler, not knowing that it is for our life. It is as impoſſible to be able practitioners in the more common way without ſtudying the principles of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as it is to be mathematicians without the knowledge of figures, or to underſtand the motions and ſituation of the heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without the ſtudy of aſtronomy. It is an affair, may it pleaſe your honours, of ſo much conſequence, that in many countries it has commanded the attention of the civil ſtate, both ancient and modern, Will not charity to this people call for ſome inquiries in this reſpectable body, whether the art of healing may not, at leaſt gradually, be put upon ſome more reſpectable footing. We have ſome among us of that profeſſion, of a penetrating and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive genius, worthy of honour; and there no
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012430_0025_0F8997E771676A48"/>
method can be entered upon to encourage and increaſe their number, and to diſcourage ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and raſh adventurers? by which means generations to come <hi>will riſe up and call you bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HONOURED ſenators, we wiſh you a bleſſing out of the houſe of God—that he will <hi>guide you by his counſel and afterward receive you to glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now in the next place it may be ſaid, that among all the ſubjects of God's moral kingdom, there is no order of men who ſtand in greater need of being the ſubjects of the kind and efficatious influence of charity than thoſe who are to feed the ſheep and the lambs of Chriſt's flock.</p>
            <p>Wherefore,</p>
            <p>REVEREND and highly eſteemed in love for your work ſake; How ſublime, how worthy, and how ponderous the truſt committed to you! too weighty for the ſhoulders of angels. And how excellent the depoſited treaſure! yet 'tis committed to earthen veſſels; frail, feeble and ſinful mortals! but, behold, here is wiſdom—<hi>That the excellence of the power may be of God, and not of us.</hi> Wherefore your dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the eye of your Lord and maſter, and your ſucceſs with depend much on your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in which is included humility, meekneſs and dependence. Your primary and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012430_0025_0F8997E771676A48"/>
object is truth, and the inculcating of it on the minds of men, for the eternal intereſt of individuals and the good of commmunity. You are <hi>to put them in mind to obey magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, to be ready to every good work:</hi> And to <hi>follow peace with all men, and holineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> You are to <hi>give yourſelves to reading, to meditation and to prayer (for who is ſufficient for theſe thing) that your proſiting may appear to all</hi>—And that you may be as ſcribes well inſtructed to the kingdom of heaven, able to bring forth out of your treaſure, which is inexhauſtable, things both new and old. If you love your maſter, you will love his cauſe, love your people, love mankind and one another—Well <hi>take heed to yourſelves and your doctrine, that you may both ſave your own ſouls and them who hear you.</hi> The ſame mind will <hi>be in you which alſo was in Chriſt Jesus.</hi> And you with <hi>ſtrive together for the faith of the goſpel</hi>: Avoiding <hi>all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wrath, malice, envy and evil ſpeaking</hi>—Thinks what a mixture of indignation and piety is ſome times raiſed in ſetious and judicious breaſt, (in reading ſome public and inconſiſtency of the author with his profeſſed deſign and motive in writing, a regard to truth; and avoid it. Not that we are ſtudiously to avoid the moſt public inquiries and ſearches
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012430_0026_0F8997E830AE1CC8"/>
after truth. But dear brethren, while you contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the ſaints, remember that he <hi>who has choſen you ia this warfare, rides proſperouſly, becauſe of truth,</hi> through the influence of truth, <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs:</hi> And remember that your brother will determine, and all judicious men will determine that you have no more right to treat him with contempt, rancour and virulence than he has to treat you in the ſame manner. And though ſuch conduct may pleaſe the corruption or gratify the viciated humours of a party, yet it ordinarily ſubſerves not the object in view, or which ought to be in view. Verily this wiſdom comes not from above. You need not then be told the quality and riſe of it: For we ſpeak as to wiſe men. In a word, which is to ſay all above all things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs, and will animate you in the ſacred employment, render you ſolicitous to be <hi>free from the blood of all men.</hi> And to that end you will make Chriſt and his atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and thoſe truths in cloſe connexion therewith, the grand theme of your miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; will render you faithful unto death, and your end will be everlaſting life. We are ſtuards of the myſteries of God, and it is required of ſtuards that a man be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: And the time is coming when it will be
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012430_0026_0F8997E830AE1CC8"/>
ſaid, <hi>Give an account of thy ſteward-ſhip, for thou muſt be no longer ſteward.</hi> We have wiſe and godly rulers; bleſſed be God: let us then conduct as wiſe and charitable teachers, and there will be hope that this people will be lead as by the hand of Moſes and Aaron in the way they ought to go.</p>
            <p>NEXT we turn to the freemen of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. The continuation, gentlemen, of our ſingular bleſſings under God, depend much on you. Will not charity to this beloved colony, to your country, to your wives, your ſons and daughter, children of God's people, a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous riſing generation, influence your minds and conduct to be faithful to your truſt, <hi>to remember the oath of God which is upon you</hi>; not only to be true and faithful to his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but to the intereſts of this dear colony as eſtabliſhed by charter? And let us always have choſen out from among us wiſe, uuderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and faithful men, to have the rule over us, and to be guardians of our diſtinguiſhing rights? and to perpetuate them to posterity, Now the end of the commandment is charity.</p>
            <p>FINALLY to the body of this people.</p>
            <p>LATELY our country was ſhocked as with an earthquake:—The ſhocks were repeated—was all in trembling for her liberties—come into ſalutary reſolutions; was almoſt perſwaded to put on ſackcloth and fit in aſhes. But our
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012430_0027_0F8997E9B1840680"/>
repentance was ſuperficial; What a ſhining contraſt do our eyes now behold all over this land! The world rejoiceth, but will not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity tremble? Is the bitterneſs of death paſt? No, the arrows are ſtill pointed at the heart of our liberties. But not to dwell here. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity beſpeaks your attention to the important objects of it and recommends itſelf to your entertainment from the innate worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of it, and from the fruits and bleſſings which never fail to attend it. It produces per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal joy unſpeakable and full of glory. It ſpreads its kind influence on thoſe round about it. It is the bond of ſocial happineſs. It is the end of the commandment. It will ſet us all right, in proportion to the degree and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, both in regard to God and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It will bring down the bleſſing of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon us, and we ſhall be a happy people. <hi>The lion will lie down with the lamb,</hi> &amp;c.—Love one another and walk in the light of the divine countenance.—We ſhall be guided by the divine counſel, and afterward received to glory, where love will for ever dwell and reign without mixture.</p>
