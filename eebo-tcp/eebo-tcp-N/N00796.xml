            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was imployed in delivering God's meſſages to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing people the Jews, when they were chargeable with great degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, with many and groſs ſins; ſome of which are mentioned in the 6, 8, 9 <hi>verſes</hi> of the preceeding Chapter, as well as in ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. For theſe ſins, God by his Prophet threatens them, with various and terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In the firſt verſe of this Chapter he threatens them with Famine: <hi>he would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Stay, and the ſtaff, the whole ſtay of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000958_0003_0FADE3EA9835E428"/>
Bread, and the whole ſtay of water.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe (containing our <hi>Text</hi>) God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to take away their men of chief Note, that were moſt Eminent, Uſeful and Serviceable in their <hi>Military,</hi> their <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Our Text refers to the firſt of theſe, their men that were moſt Eminent, Uſeful and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in <hi>Military</hi> Affairs, the <hi>Mighty man,</hi> and the <hi>Man of War</hi>; their valiant able <hi>Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi> theſe God threatens to take away from them in Judgment. From whence we may obſerve this Doctrine.</p>
            <q>That Valiant, Able Warriours among Gods People, are juſtly accounted a great Bleſſing to them.</q>
            <p>This is very plain, otherwiſe the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſuch men, would not be threatned as a Judgment, Curſe, or Puniſhment. <hi>War</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered meerly and abſolutely in it ſelf, is not good, nor ſhould it be deſired by any man. No War was ever begun or carried on, with ſufficient reaſons and juſt grounds on both ſides. Either the <hi>Aſſailant</hi> or <hi>Defendant,</hi> ſurely ſins; one party ſurely ſins, and both commonly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. War therefore conſidered meerly in its ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot lawfully be deſired; for in deſiring of it, we deſire the ſin and miſery of ſome or other, neither of which is lawful in it ſelf. Tho' tis thus, yet in ſome caſes, <hi>War</hi> is not only
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000958_0004_0FADE3EBB0944B68"/>
lawful, but alſo commendable, yea a neceſſary duty. Before I ſpeak directly to the Doctrine, I ſhall endeavour a brief Anſwer to theſe two Inquiries, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>To whom does it belong to make War?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>What are the juſt cauſes of War?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>To whom does it belong to make War?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Anſwer, <hi>It belongs to the Chief Supream Authority, juſtly Establiſhed over a people, to make War.</hi> For the Supream Authority, is to defend the Subjects in their <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and to revenge the groſs wrongs done to them by Enemies. It ſeems juſt and reaſonable alſo, that the Supream Authority may delegate or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate power, to far diſtant <hi>Provinces</hi> or <hi>Plantations</hi> under them, to make War in ſuch and ſuch caſes, under ſuch and ſuch limitations, as the matter may be circumſtanced. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what has been ſaid, it ſeems juſtifya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ſmalleſt part or handful of any Nation, (tho' they have no direct Order or Commiſſion, from the Supream or Subordinate Authority over them) to make a defenſive War, when they are unjuſtly and ſuddenly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by cruel Enemies; but 'tis no way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable for private unauthorized perſons to make an offenſive War. If upon Spoils or Robberies done by ſome of a Neighbouring Nation, private perſons ſhould, without Order or Commiſſion from Authority, go and make
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000958_0005_0FADE3EC2E8FB550"/>
War upon that Nation, they would ſin great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. Such a courſe as this would be likely, to Embroil Nations in continual Wars, Uproars and Confuſions.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What are the juſt cauſes of making War?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Anſwer,</hi> I ſuppoſe the moſt of them may be comprehended under theſe three gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heads. Either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Defence, or ſelf preſervation from the unjuſt aſſaults of others.</hi> A Peoples fighting for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their <hi>Perſons, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> ſeems altogether reaſonable, having nothing to be ſaid againſt it. Self-preſervation, is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple implanted in all men, as well as other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, and that by God himſelf. 'Tis alſo lawful for a people to make, or help in, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive War, when their <hi>Allies</hi> or <hi>Confederates</hi> are unjuſtly aſſaulted and moleſted: thus <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> being in <hi>League</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> came to fight for them againſt their Enemies, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Another juſt cauſe of War is, Recovery of great damages.</hi> When <hi>Ziklag</hi> was taken and ranſacked, and the Wives, Children, &amp; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>David</hi> and his men were taken away by the <hi>Amalekites; David</hi> and his men made War upon them, for the recovery of thoſe damage<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and did recover all. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. <hi>Ch.</hi> When <hi>Lot</hi> was taken Captive, and his Goods made a prey,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000958_0006_0FADE3ECD19E9308"/>
               <hi>Abraham,</hi> his <hi>Allie</hi> and Friend made War upon the <hi>Aggreſſors</hi> or <hi>Aſſailants</hi> for the Recovery of damages, and did deliver <hi>Lot,</hi> and reſcue his Goods. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. I ſuppoſe under this Head, may be comprehended the unjuſt <hi>revolt of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> and <hi>falling off of Tributaries</hi>; for the groſs default of ſuch, it ſeems Juſtifyable to make War upon them, to reduce them to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer juſt order, duty and obedience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Another juſt cauſe of War may be, the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Injuries.</hi> Though the caſe may be ſo circumſtanced, that there's no poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering damages, or repairing the loſs ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it may be not only lawful, but alſo a duty to revenge Injuries. Thus if our Heathen Neighbours ſhould ſuddenly burn any of our <hi>Frontier Towns,</hi> &amp; deſtroy the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it would then be our duty, were it in our power, to revenge that Injury in the death of all the <hi>Actors</hi> in, and <hi>Abettors</hi> of, ſuch Murder, although we could not poſſibly recover dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or pay our ſelves for the Goods unjuſtly deſtroyed, or taken away. Having briefly premiſed theſe things concerning War, which poſſibly are not wholly forreign to our preſent occaſion, we may now proceed to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> it ſelf:
<q>That valiant able Warriours among Gods People, are juſtly accounted a great Bleſſing to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000958_0007_0FADE3EDAAFDF758"/>Here it ſeems very natural to raiſe theſe two Enquiries: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Who are to be accounted valiant, able, Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours? Or when may perſons be juſtly ſo termed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How does it appear that ſuch perſons among Gods people, are juſtly to be accounted a great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Who are to be accounted valiant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> able Warriours? Or when may perſons be juſtly ſo termed?</hi> In order to an Anſwer, we may note, That Souldiers as ſuch, are Inſtruments: that the goodneſs of Inſtruments is to be judged of bv their fitneſs or ſuitableneſs to obtain the end, whereunto they are deſigned. The Anſwer to the ſecond of the premiſed Queſtions, about the juſt cauſes of War, tells us, that the end of Souldiers as ſuch, or the uſe they are to be put to, is, to <hi>defend, recover</hi> damages, and <hi>revenge Injuries.</hi> Now the more fit Souldiers are for theſe Services, ſo much the more valiant and able they are to be accounted. Note alſo, Souldiers are either <hi>Rulers,</hi> or <hi>Ruled, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or <hi>Private Souldiers.</hi> Now firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Private Souldiers,</hi> they may be ſaid to be valiant and able, when they have theſe following Qualifications. Namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When they are ſtrong and able of Body to go through hard, difficult Services.</hi> Men are not fit for Souldiers, unleſs they are ſit to endure <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 3. Souldiers are often call'd to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000958_0008_0FADE3F02E782228"/>
Encounter with Storms and Tempeſts, wet &amp; dry, hot and cold, with hunger and thirſt: they are ſometimes called to frequent Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, long marches, to paſs Hills and Dales, craggy Mountains, and deep Rivers, ſuddenly to Intrench, to build Forts, to ſcale Walls, and other ſuch like Services, which contain more difficulty in them, than can be eaſily conceived of.

how to uſe it, ſeems as idle and fooliſh, as for a Child to boaſt of a Book, which he cannot read a word in. Souldiers ſhould alſo know the words of Command, that they may readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the mind of their Commanders in them, and ſpeedily yield obedience thereunto. So ſhould they underſtand the <hi>beat of the Drum,</hi> and the <hi>ſound of the Trumpet</hi>: otherwiſe they can't diſtinguiſh between a <hi>Charge</hi> and a <hi>Retreat,</hi> and then what follows, but confuſion inſtead of order, and overthrow inſtead of victory? If theſe things are not underſtood, who ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf for the battel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.7, 8. Thoſe were highly commended that were <hi>expert</hi> in War, <hi>that had all manner of Instruments of War for the battel, and were men that could keep rank,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.33, 37, 38.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>When they are obedient to their Commander.</hi> 'Twas the commendation of thoſe Souldiers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.9. <hi>That they went and came, at their Commanders bidding.</hi> And truely without this qualification, Souldiers don't deſerve to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: 'tis not their buſineſs to diſpute and capitulate <hi>with,</hi> but yield obedience <hi>to,</hi> their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. When <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers were <hi>Preſſed,</hi> each took his Oath, not to forſake his <hi>Captain</hi> or <hi>Country,</hi> which Oath was called, <hi>Sacramentum Militare. Obtemperaturas ſum et facturus quicquid mandabitur ab Impreratoribus, juxta vires</hi>; to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000958_0011_0FADE3F2D7218240"/>
utmoſt of my power, I will obey thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in all things. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>'Tis better for a Souldier to fear his Captain, than his enemies. Paulus Aemylius</hi> would ſay, a Souldier ſhould take care of three things, <hi>That he has a ſtrong body good arms,</hi> and a <hi>mind ready to obey.</hi> When a Souldier was once juſt ready to ſmite his enemy with his Sword, he forbore upon the Sounding of a <hi>Retreat,</hi> and being asked by one, why he ſuffered his enemy to eſcape, he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, <hi>'Twas better to obey his Emperor, than ſlay his Enemy.</hi> He's not a good Souldier, that knows not how to obey his Commander. I ſuppoſe thoſe who have theſe forementioned qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, may well paſs for valiant, able Souldiers.</p>
            <p>We may further note, that the more <hi>Pious</hi> perſons be, ſo much the better Souldiers they commonly are. Thoſe who will Curſe and Swear, as though they would Damn their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into Hell, are ſometimes backward enough to look an enemy in the face, much more to ſmite him to the ground. <hi>Iphicrates</hi> ſpake like a brutiſh Heathen, when he ſaid, <hi>A Souldier ought to be coveteous of riches and pleaſures that he may the more boldly incounter dangers for the ſatisfying of his luſts</hi>: It better becomes Chriſtians to ſay, <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be pious and gracious, that ſo they may the more boldly incounter dangers for the anſwer of a good Conſcience.</hi> Never were there better, bolder, and more couragious Souldiers in the world, than
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000958_0012_0FADE3F3A04BFD78"/>
ſome of the holieſt of men have been. 'Tis mentioned as an eminent commendable effect of <hi>Faith</hi> in ſome, <hi>That they waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the Aliens, Heb.</hi> 11.34. As <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> are the weapons of the Church, ſo men moſt expert at thoſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are moſt commonly the beſt Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoke theſe few things of <hi>private Souldiers,</hi> we may now proceed to the other part of the diſtribution, <hi>viz Officers</hi> or <hi>Commanders,</hi> among whom there are various orders or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees one above another: yet excepting the Chief Supream Commander, who as ſuch, is not to receive &amp; obey, but to give out <hi>Commands,</hi> unto his army; I ſuppoſe they are all the more worthy to be accounted valiant, able Souldiers, by how much the more they have, of all the forementioned qualifications. If their hardy bodies will indure uncomfortable lodgings, mean diet, wet &amp; dry, heat &amp; cold, tedious marches, and great fatigues, this might animate their Souldiers to do ſo too. Commanders ſhould have ſingular Courage alſo, according to the Station they are in, they ſhould have enough for themſelves, and ſome to ſpare to their Souldiers too; that is by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Exhortation. We muſt not look for great Exploits to be done by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that has a cowardly Captain. A faint hearted <hi>Leader,</hi> will rather encourage the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000958_0013_0FADE3F45FFA3FB0"/>
feet of his Souldiers to flee, than their hearts or hands to fight. They ſhould have good Skill likewiſe. 'Tis to be ſuppoſed, that every Officer according to his place, be it high or low; is able to Inſtruct all under him, in their duty, otherwiſe how can he give proper words of Command, or puniſh Offenders for not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them? You know what is like to become of blind guides and their followers. As for the Obedience of Inferiour Officers, to thoſe that are Superiour; 'tis as needful and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the Obedience of any Private Souldiers. Beſides theſe Qualifications, it ſeems very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that Commanders, eſpecially the chief of them ſhould be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Men of great Prudence and Conduct.</hi> Great Prudence and Conduct is needful for the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Marches, eſpecially through difficult paſſages, for the ordering of <hi>Scouts</hi> to diſcover <hi>Ambuſhments,</hi> and prevent ſudden Surprizal, for Entrenching and Fortifying in commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places, for ſecuring of <hi>Stores,</hi> for chooſing time and place for battle, and ſuch like things of great weight.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Men well acquainted with their Souldiers, and Under Officers.</hi> This is needful, that ſo they may chuſe and order, for ſuch and ſuch Services, men that are moſt proper for the ſame. <hi>Joab</hi> choſe the <hi>choice men of Iſrael for the moſt difficult Service,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9. This he
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000958_0014_0FADE3F51213D690"/>
could not have done, but that he knew his Army well.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Men of great Sagacity, Circumſpection, Watchfulneſs and Diligence.</hi> Men that will have not only a careful watchful eye, over all the Affairs of their own Army, but ſuch as will uſe all proper means to get Intelligence, about the <hi>Number, Skill, Courage, Preparation, Deſigns,</hi> &amp; <hi>Motions</hi> of the Enemy. The knowledge of theſe things, gives great advantage on many accounts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Men of great patience.</hi> Souldiers often meet with ſuch hard lodging, hard fare, with ſuch loſſes, diſappointments and difficulties, that they ſometimes begin to murmur againſt, and find fault with, their Officers, and all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' never ſo prudent. Thus <hi>Davids</hi> men murmured againſt him, and talked of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. Poſſibly good pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and patience, might divert ſuch Storms, which if not diverted, would hurry all into confuſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Men of reſolution to puniſh Delinquents.</hi> They ſhould forbid all Impiety and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Intemperance and Debauchery, Injuſtice, and Diſhoneſty; and if ſuch Crimes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they ſhould ſee them puniſhed. The <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to puniſh their delinquent Souldiers, ſometimes by <hi>Disbanding of them with diſgrace,</hi> ſometimes by <hi>with-holding their Wages,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:000958_0015_0FADE3F60F5F12E8"/>
ſometimes by <hi>diminiſhing their food,</hi> ſometimes by <hi>beating and cudgelling them</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes by <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> and ſometimes by <hi>death. Lamachus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Non licet in bello bis peccare, error enim in bello eſt mors.</hi> Men muſt not offend twice in War, for an Error in War is death. Souldiers will not be kept in order, without good Laws, and them well Executed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Men that are Godly and Conſcientious.</hi> 'Tis recorded to the endleſs praiſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Italian</hi> Band, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2. <hi>That he was a devout man that feared God with all his houſe, and prayed to him always.</hi> Surely ſuch men are ſitter for Commanders, than thoſe who by their prophaneneſs and debauchery, ſeem to fight more daringly againſt God in heaven, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men on earth. How ſhall we think thoſe will be faithful to their Countrey, and the Cauſe of it, who will not be faithful to God and his Cauſe? <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, removed thoſe profeſſed Chriſtians from being his Courtiers, whom (upon a deſigned trial) he found more ready to Sacrifice to Idols, than to diſobey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſaying, <hi>thoſe who are diſloyal to God, will never be true and truſty to their Prince.</hi> How often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have Commanders of weak, depraved Conſciences, <hi>received bribes, Sold their Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cauſe, Countrey and all,</hi> only for their own pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent perſonal <hi>Preferment, Profit,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure?</hi>

Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſaid to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, to this purpoſe, while <hi>God damn me,</hi> leads the <hi>Van,</hi> and the <hi>Devil take me,</hi> brings up the Rear, there's no likelihood of good ſucceſs. There's no reaſon to expect the ſucceſs of Armies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Gods preſence and bleſſing be with them: there's no reaſon to expect his preſence and bleſſing with them, if he is greatly provoked by them, and ſo he will be by Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if their Commanders are not conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. When <hi>Moſes</hi> the chief Commander of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was praying, then <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Army did prevail. We may now proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How does it appear that ſuch Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers among Gods People are a great Bleſſing to them, and are juſtly to be accounted ſo?</hi> In order to an Anſwer, we need only premiſe, that a well ſettled peace, is a great Bleſſing to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When they have ſuch a peace, their <hi>Perſons, Civil and Religious Liberties,</hi> and alſo their <hi>Eſtates</hi> are ſafe. They may ſleep ſafely in their Houſes, follow their buſineſs without fear or danger, ſit quietly under their Vines and Figtrees, freely make uſe of their own; and which is more than this, they may Serve and Worſhip God, in obeying all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and attending on all the Inſtitutions of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, without diſturbance or moleſtation. Thus it is with Gods people,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000958_0017_0FADE3F907851C20"/>
who are favoured with a well eſtabliſhed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and a well ſettled peace. That ſuch a ſtate of Affairs is a great Bleſſing, will be owned by every thinking Chriſtian; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he conſiders, that <hi>Peace</hi> is promiſed as a very comprehenſive mercy, in caſe of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and War threatned, as a very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Judgment, in caſe of Diſobedience. <hi>Lev</hi> 26.5, 6, 17, <hi>verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may now anſwer the Enquiry in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch Valiant Souldiers as have been deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, are very proper means under God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To continue unto God's People, their Liberties and Properties when quietly Enjoyed.</hi> If Gods people have plenty and proſperity, yet if their envious Neighbours know them to be well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with valiant, able Souldiers, they will not much care to moleſt them. <hi>When a ſtrong man armed keepeth his palace, his Goods are in peace. David</hi> with his experienced Souldiers, did mighty Exploits in War, and when he dyed, he left the Land full of able Souldiers, which being known, the Neighbouring Nations dare not diſturb <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son, but he <hi>had peace on all ſides round about him, and Judah and Iſrael dwelt ſafely; every man under his vine and under his figtree</hi> 1 <hi>King</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.24, 25. But if a people have peace and plenty, without ſuitable men to defend them, they ſeem to be an inviting prey to their covetous Neighbours.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:000958_0018_0FADE621636003D8"/>2. <hi>Able Souldiers are proper means to recover the Liberties and Properties of Gods People, when taken away.</hi> This was frequently experienced by the Iſraelites, as we are often told in the Book of <hi>Judges.</hi> The Jews experienced this truth alſo, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> plainly informs us. Many other inſtances might be given were it needful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Able Souldiers are very proper means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Liberties and Properties (as well as the Lives) of Gods people, when they are indangered.</hi> Able Souldiers are very proper means, to <hi>prop up,</hi> and <hi>ſteady</hi> a ſhaking, tottering State. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Yea, ſince the firſt planting of this Country by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> our Souldiers have been made a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God's people here on all theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.

            <p>Now theſe things might teach us;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God's People ought to Train up and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, good able Souldiers.</hi> 'Tis true, thoſe happy days are promiſed and much hoped for, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Men ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks: Nation ſhall not lift up a Sword againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more,</hi> Mic. 4.3. But thoſe days are not yet come, and poſſibly before they do come, there will be occaſion to urge thoſe other words, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up: beat your Plowſhares into Swords, and your Pruning hooks into Spears, let the weak ſay I am ſtrong</hi> Thoſe are carnal men, who ſay, Chriſtians ſhould not uſe <hi>carnal Weapons:</hi> That is, Inſtruments of War, when the cauſe of God and his People require the Warlike imployment of them.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, as well as in a Spiritual ſenſe. Chriſtians have great reaſon to learn War, and make War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preparations. I ſuppoſe all the Lord's Batttels are not yet fought; and we don't know who
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000958_0021_0FADE6231D3F59B8"/>
of us may be call'd to ingage in ſome of thoſe that remain. Be Exhorted then to learn War, to indeavour after Military skill, a martial ſpirit, an ability to do Service againſt Enemies; if the cauſe of God and his people ſhould call you to it. To incourage you here unto,</p>
            <p>Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The neceſſity of it, in an ordinary courſe of Providence.</hi> The preſent condition of the world, and wickedneſs of men, is ſuch, that we cannot be ſecure of any thing we have, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we have ſome force and power, as well as juſtice on our ſide. It has been often ſeen, that under God, Souldiers have been the defence and protection of what God's People do injoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you have no Warlike force, your wealth and riches will be but an inviting, eaſy prey, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Enemies. Intreaties will not do with thoſe whoſe tender mercies are cruelty. The force of enemies, muſt be repel'd with force. Would you have your Country ſpoiled, your Houſes rifled and burnt, your Goods and Riches taken away, your Children daſht againſt the ſtones, your Wives and Daughters raviſh'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your faces, your Women with Child ript open, your Aged Fathers and Mothers barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly dragg'd about the Streets, your Churches overthrown, your ſelves Captived, Inſlaved, or contemptuouſly ſlain? If you would avoid ſuch Indignities, Inſolencies, and out rages as theſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000958_0022_0FADE623DEDA1240"/>
are (which are frequently perpetrated by an Invading Enemy) then learn War; indeavour after Military skill and courage, to repell the pride and power of enemies. A few well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd Souldiers, are commonly of more uſe and worth, than vaſt multitudes of untrained men. <hi>Abraham</hi> with three hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Trained</hi> Servants, overcame four Kings and their Armies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, with between thirty and forty thouſand well diſciplin'd Souldiers, routed the unskilfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained multitude of <hi>Darius,</hi> which conſiſted, ſome ſay of four hundred, ſome of ſix hundred thouſand men.</p>

his Sword from Blood.</hi> We ſhould not be cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Neuters, or idle Spectators, when the common cauſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt calls for our aſſiſtance. We ſhould love him above our lives, and therefore be willing to indanger and expoſe our lives, when his and his peoples Intereſt calls for it. <hi>We ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, takes our neglect of, or diſregard to his people, as a neglect of, or diſregard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.45, Surely ſince he has dyed for our Salvation, we ſhould be willing (his Providence calling us to it) to die for his Glory. And great ſhall be our reward, if we have ſuch a willingneſs, and our actions are agreeable thereunto. <hi>Titus</hi> the <hi>Roman General,</hi> to incourage his Souldiers in fighting againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Soul of him that dies in War, is preſently received into the moſt pure, airy Element, and from thence carried and placed among the ſtares of Heaven.</hi> He had no reaſon to ſay this, but we have good reaſon to ſay, thoſe that ſincerely love, fight, and die for, the true Intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall immediately at death, have their Souls taken above the Stars of Heaven, to be with Chriſt in Glory. <hi>Thoſe that ſuffer with him, ſhall reign with him, but if we deny him, he will deny us.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12.

after Military Skill, Courage, and other Martial Accompliſhments: that if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhould call you forth, you may be qualified to do real Service, in defending the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in recovering their damages, or revenging unjuſt Indignities and Outrages committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. In all your <hi>Artilleries</hi> and <hi>Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> you ſhould act like Chriſtians. You muſt give an account to Chriſt, of your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Training Dayes, as well as on other dayes. On ſuch dayes therefore you ſhould Conſcientiouſly Serve Chriſt, by diligently endeavouring after more knowledge, skill, and accuracy in Military Matters, that you may imploy the ſame, in real Service for Chriſt and his People, if Providence ſhould call for it.</p>
            <p>As for you Gentlemen of the Honourable <hi>Artillery Company</hi>; I wiſh you may go on, be encouraged and proſper, in thoſe great and generous qualifications, you aſpire after.

But let none of us ſo much aſpire after being Souldiers, as to forget that we are Chriſtians. If we had the greateſt and moſt deſirable Warlike accompliſhments and preparations that could be, yet we ought not to truſt in them

We ſhould make the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and uſe the beſt means we can, in all affairs; but we muſt not have our dependance on any of them, but on God alone. The beſt means often fail; therefore the <hi>Wiſe man muſt not glory in his wiſdom, nor the ſtrong man in his strength. The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.11. Let us uſe means, but not truſt in them. Let us take up with <hi>Sauls</hi> advice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Be valiant, and fight the Lords Battels.</hi> And with that of <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 Sam. 10.12. <hi>Be of good courage and let us play the men, for our people and for the Cities of our God: and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good.</hi> An Excellent Speech of a <hi>General</hi> it was; to exhort to the doing of our beſt, and yet truſting in God, and leaving the event with him. He is a Man of War, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.3. He teacheth to War, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.1. He Spirits men to it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.11. He helps in War, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.8. The victory is his, he gives it to whom he will; for he can ſave by many or by few. We ſhould therefore uſe the beſt means we can, and have our whole dependence upon God.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:000958_0027_0FADE627B95A6B38"/>I ſhall conclude in ſaying, There is another Warfare, which every one of us ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in. We ſhould get ingrafted into CHRIST, liſted under his Banner, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the help of his Grace, to fight againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil: to fight the good fight of Faith, till we lay hold on Eternal Life: to be ſtedfaſt, unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as we know our labour ſhall not he in vain in the Lord.</p>
