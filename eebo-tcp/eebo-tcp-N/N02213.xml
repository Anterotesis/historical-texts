            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Preacher ſought out acceptable Words, faithful Sayings, and worthy of all Acceptation. <hi>Here we have a Variety of the wiſeſt Leſſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e'd to us; many juſt &amp; ſeaſonable Caveats &amp; Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions given; with weighty &amp; moving Exhortations; which if well entertained &amp; apply'd, wou'd be of no common ſervice, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the great Intereſts of Religion, the Deſigns of the Evangelical Miniſtry.—And here alſo we are taught how to make uſe of this Subject for our</hi> Conſolation <hi>in ſeveral Caſes. Here Auditors are told how they may apply it to compoſe their Minds, to ſit quietly under the Adminiſtrations of ſuch as are not altogether agreeable to their Wiſhes. And here alſo Ministers are put in mind, to apply it for their Support &amp; Encouragement, under the dark Proſpect of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful Miniſtry. An inexpreſſible Grief this! But we muſt eye the Hand of GOD in it. If we have Succeſs it is not to be aſcrib'd to</hi> our own Power or Holineſs. <hi>For who is</hi> Paul? <hi>and who is</hi> Apollos? <hi>But Miniſters by whom Men believe,</hi> even as the Lord giveth to every Man. <hi>So then neither is he that planteth,</hi> any thing; <hi>nor he that watereth: but GOD—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>To Him we ſhou'd give all the Glory of our Succeſs. And when deny'd that, if we are</hi> faithful, <hi>we may take Comfort in this; knowing that we are but Men, Men of like Paſſions with others; and that with</hi> Men <hi>it is impoſſible.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Tho' (ſuffer me to add) we ſhou'd be very</hi> jealous of our ſelves <hi>in this Caſe, and examine ſtrictly into our own Temper &amp; Conduct; leſt by any means we ſhou'd have been</hi> acceſſory <hi>to our own Unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs and deceive our ſelves with a groundleſs Preſumption of our unblamable Fidelity. Miniſters are too often the faulty Cauſes (at leaſt in conjunction with their People) of their want of Succeſs. We are Men</hi> ſubject to like Paſſions <hi>with others. The brighteſt</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>of the Churches are but Spirits</hi> in Fleſh; <hi>and have in them the ſame Principles of moral as well natural Corruption, common to others.

            <p>NOW, althô we cannot ſee to the bottom of any of <hi>God's Counſels,</hi> yet there are ſome obvious Reaſons of his appointing <hi>Men of like paſſions with others,</hi> to <hi>the Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> which do Juſtify the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and diſplay the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of GOD here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and much of the Duty both of <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>People</hi> may be learn'd herefrom. Let the following Reaſons therefore be weighed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD appoints Men of like paſſions with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be the Miniſters of his Word, <hi>becauſe he will treat with us about the things which belong to our everlaſting peace, in ſuch a</hi> familiar <hi>way, as is moſt accommodate to the Humane Nature.</hi> He <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our frame: Remembreth that we are duſt,</hi> and ſuits his <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> accordingly. It is an Inſtance and Argument of the Condeſcending Goodneſs of GOD that he doth not preach <hi>Perſonally</hi> unto us, nor ſend his Glorious Angels; but <hi>Men</hi> of the ſame Nature &amp; <hi>of like paſſions with ourſelves,</hi> to reveal his Will unto us, and to treat with us about our ſpiritual and everlaſting concernments. The Conſideration of the weakneſs of the Humane Nature in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Imperfection and Mortality, determin'd the Alwiſe and Gracious GOD to <hi>this method</hi> of dealing with us for our Inſtruction and Salvation.</p>
            <p>IF the <hi>Great and Dreadful GOD</hi> ſhould ſpeak <hi>Perſonally</hi> unto us, how could our weak faculties
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002638_0012_0FE5D901C553B948"/>
bear the overwhelming <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty,</hi> in which it becomes him to ſpeak? When JEHOVAH <hi>thundred on the Mount, and the Higheſt gave his voice from Sinai,</hi> the People <hi>could not endure. And ſo terrible was the ſight of the Mount burning with fire, and the ſound of the Trumpet waxing louder and louder, and the voice of words, that Moſes</hi> himſelf cryed out, ſaying, <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake. And the People entreated that they might not hear</hi> the voice of the Lord again, leaſt they ſhould <hi>die; but that Moſes, and not God, would ſpeak with them.</hi> And GOD approved of their Requeſt. Should the Lord come down in ſuch Splendid Equipage, and Preach the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to us in the like Divine Glory, we ſhould be no more able to endure, than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were at the Promulgation of the Law. We ſhould be ſo <hi>troubled at his Preſence,</hi> that we could not hearken to his Doctrine. The Terror of his Majeſty would hinder the Attention of our Minds, and put us into the greateſt Confuſion.</p>
            <p>OR if GOD ſhould ſend his Holy <hi>Angels</hi> (which are Infinitely Inferior to him in Glory) to Preach unto us; yet the Luſtre of Seraphim would dazzle and confound, rather then inform and edify us. <hi>Manoah'</hi>s Wife ſaid unto him, <hi>a man of God came unto me, and his Countenance was like the Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enance of an Angel of God, very terrible,</hi> Judg. 13. 6. An Angel brought the firſt Tidings of a <hi>Saviour'</hi>s <hi>Birth,</hi> but his Appearance was ſo bright and glorious that the poor Shepherds were amazed: Luke 2. 9. <hi>

            <p>THIS is the ſhorteſt and eaſieſt way of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And without this our Preaching is commonly in vain.

A Traveller, who hath only oral directions given

For <hi>we</hi> have <hi>Bodies</hi> as well as <hi>Spirits:</hi> and it is a Chriſtian's daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to <hi>keep under his body, and bring it into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi> Humane Virtue conſiſts in acting agreeably to the Humane Nature in its primitive conſtitution; that is, Right Reaſon's maintaining a proper Dominion over the Brutal part. But how could <hi>Angels</hi> (which are <hi>Spirits</hi> only) be Examples of Virtues, which conſiſt in the due government of <hi>Senſitive</hi> Appetites? Could they be Patterns of <hi>Temperance, Chastity,</hi> and the like? None can by their Example teach us how to behave our ſelves in the <hi>circumſtances of men,</hi> unleſs they communicate with us in the paſſions and circumſtances of the Humane Nature.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, the Example of <hi>Angels</hi> would not be ſo <hi>Encouraging,</hi> as that of <hi>Men,</hi> who <hi>are of like paſſions with us.</hi> For <hi>Angels, who excel in ſtrength,</hi> to be conſtant, exact and univerſal in their Obedience; for them, whoſe Nature is pure and perfect, to ſhine as Lights in the World; what great Encouragement would this afford to <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>polluted</hi> Creatures, that they ſhall attain to the

high pitch of Virtue and Holineſs, which is required of them? Would the illuſtrious Virtue of Spotleſs Angels <hi>provoke the Emulation</hi> of fallen Creatures? If Men that are ſenſible of the Weakneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of their Nature, ſhould hear <hi>Angels</hi> vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inculcate the precepts of Religion, and propound their own Pattern as a Motive to Conformity, would they not think that ſuch Rules were calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only for the <hi>Angelical Nature?</hi> and that ſuch great and difficult Duties were impracticable to Men? Would they take any pains to write after an Angel's Copy! But when they ſee the Doctrines of their Preachers, <hi>who are Men like themſelves,</hi> in ſome good meaſure exemplified in their Lives, this raiſeth their Hopes, excites &amp; enlivens their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. To ſee Men which have the ſame weak and depraved Nature that they have, Men <hi>Compaſſed</hi> with Infirmities, and aſſaulted with Temptations as they are, yet by the Help of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> (which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to all) ſurmounting the difficulties of a Chriſtian Courſe, this is a great Encouragement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to engage &amp; continue in it: for this is a Convincing Evidence that the Things enjoyned them are not utter Impoſſibilities. The Apoſtle thus excites Chriſtians to fervent Prayer: Jam. 5. 16, 17. <hi>Pray for one another</hi>—. Elias <hi>was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are, and</hi> He <hi>prayed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,</hi> and effectually.</p>
            <p n="3">3. MEN of like paſſions with others are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>becauſe ſuch are</hi> equally Concern'd <hi>with the People in the Meſſage which they bring, and the things which they teach.</hi> Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

ſaw it beſt, that the important Truths of the Goſpel ſhould as neceſſarily relate to the Preacher's, as to the Hearer's welfare: that the eternal Intereſt of Miniſters, as well as of People, ſhould be wrapped up in them; and therefore the former muſt be <hi>Men of like paſſions with the latter.</hi> Since Miniſters are Men, the weighty Matters which they come to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh unto, and treat with others about, do as nearly concern their own Souls as their Hearers.</p>
            <p>AND this gives a conſiderable advantage to their Miniſtry: for by reaſon hereof, People may with greater Confidence Commit their Souls to the Care of their Miniſters; knowing that if they are wiſe for themſelves, they will be faithful unto thoſe whom they take the overſight of. Miniſters being <hi>Men,</hi> if they imbibe &amp; vent any Error, they poiſon their own Souls as well as their Hearers. If they gather <hi>wild Gourds,</hi> inſtead of wholeſome Herbs, for the <hi>Pot,</hi> they endanger their own Lives as much as Their's whom they are to <hi>feed.</hi> If the ſpiritual <hi>Guides</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead people, they will inevitably fall with them <hi>into the ditch</hi> of perdition; yea, they'll be plunged deepeſt in Hell. If the ſpiritual <hi>Watchmen</hi> do not ſtand alway upon their guard, and be not attentive to eſpy &amp; give notice of approaching Dangers, they are as likely to be <hi>taken away by the ſword</hi> as others. So that <hi>their</hi> Intereſt is the People's Security. This is an Argument perſuading us of their Integrity and Faithfulneſs; and renders our Confidence in them more reaſonable. Our ſpiritual <hi>Pilots</hi> do not ſtand on the ſhore, looking upon us, and only Calling to us in a Sea of Dangers; but they embark with us, and venture their Souls with ours in the ſame <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AND a neceſſitous Eſtate is accompanied with many Temptations to <hi>Unfaithfulneſs.</hi> Not that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are free from ſuch, in a plentiful Condition: neither will their outward Circumſtances, whatever they be, excuſe their Unfaithfulneſs. Yet when People keep their Miniſters poor &amp; low, they Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempt them to Negligence &amp; Cowardice, to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content &amp; Worldlineſs, to Flattery and unworthy Courſes: and let them conſider <hi>whoſe</hi> work they are doing, while they tempt their Miniſters unto ſuch Evils.</p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſing a Miniſter be faithful (as we truſt many are) while oppreſſed with Poverty, yet it is not likely that he ſhould be ſo <hi>Succeſsful.</hi> For his indigent beggarly condition procures him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, even of thoſe, who are the faulty cauſes of it.

Perſons are often deſpiſed, and their Inſtructions, Reproofs &amp; Exhortations diſregarded. It is an ancient obſervation, Eccl. 9. 16. <hi>The poor man's Wiſdom is deſpiſed, and his words are not heard.</hi> The <hi>Brighteſt Lights</hi> are very much obſcur'd, to the Eyes of the World, by the interpoſing Cloud of Poverty. Not only the Grandees of the Earth, but the very <hi>Abjects</hi> are prone to contemn even very worthy Miniſters, for their mean outward Circumſtances. If the Preacher's <hi>Condition</hi> (faith one) be not, as well as his Pulpit, ſomewhat <hi>elevated</hi> above the loweſt Station, few will mind his words or obey him.</p>
               <p>AND ſince Miniſters are <hi>Men of like paſſions with others,</hi> they ought to be provided with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a worldly Eſtate to <hi>tranſmit</hi> to their <hi>Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> A parental Affection and provident Care for their Children is allowable in them, as well as in others. They do not ſhew themſelves Chriſtians, but inhumane &amp; worſe then Infidel Parents, who take no care to provide for their Children, whom they expect to leave in the World, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. Miniſters are endued with humane Reſentments, and it muſt be grievous unto them, to think that their Families will be left by them ſome of the moſt deſtitute on Earth—.</p>
               <p>THUS from GOD's appointing <hi>men of like paſſions with others</hi> to be the Miniſters of his word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Arguments may be drawn to prove that a liberal Maintenance ſhould be afforded them. And the People who complain of this as an inſupportable Burden, do Conſtructively Murmur againſt GOD for ſending to them frail <hi>Men,</hi> and not <hi>Angels,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied Spirits, to Miniſter unto them in holy things.

If there were nothing to be found in the BIBLE concerning this Duty of People towards their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yet if they would but waſh off the dirt, which blinds the Eyes of natural Reaſon, they might eaſily read it in the <hi>very frame of humane nature.</hi> But <hi>ſay I theſe things as a man? or ſaith not the Law,</hi> yea and the Goſpel, <hi>the ſame alſo?</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 8.</p>

The Work of the Miniſtry is not leſs difficult &amp; dangerous, than it is honourable to thoſe who are employed in it. It is a Charge like that, in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 39. which a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath given him of every Soul committed to his Paſtoral Care,—<hi>Keep this man: if by any means he be miſſing, then ſhall thy life be for his life.</hi>—To <hi>watch for Souls, as they that muſt give account,</hi> is no eaſy task.

He muſt not ceaſe day nor night praying in ſecret for his People, that they may be ſaved.

Eccleſiaſtical Authority, which he is veſted with, muſt be exerciſed by him in <hi>looſing &amp; binding,</hi> as there ſhall be occaſion. The holy Diſcipline, which Chriſt hath inſtituted, muſt with Courage, Prudence &amp; Impartiality be managed by him.—He is in his <hi>private converſe</hi> to inſtruct and admoniſh, to warn &amp; exhort: to reſolve the ſcrupulous, to comfort the dejected; to confute the erroneous; to eſtabliſh the wavering; to ſeek the loſt, &amp; bring back the ſtraying ſheep. He is to viſit the ſick, &amp; help them to improve their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; prepare for their Death. He is as the Pilot of Souls, to direct them, when launching into the Ocean of Eternity, that they may not daſh againſt the Rock of <hi>Preſumption</hi> on one hand, or of <hi>Deſpair</hi> on the other.—Such like are the weighty Duties
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002638_0039_0FE5D8E75C6B0640"/>
which a Miniſter hath to perform. This is the Work which he muſt do, maugre all the oppoſition of Earth &amp; Hell. He muſt be ſincere &amp; faithful in all this, or he incurs a puniſhment more dreadful then Tongue can expreſs, or Heart imagine.—And now is not this a Work that might employ the ſtrength of <hi>mighty Angels?</hi> and yet it is required of weak &amp; imperfect Men. <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> Not a glorified Saint; not an Angel of God; much leſs is frail Man in the ſtate of common Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency. The Miniſterial Charge is a burden too heavy for any Creature of himſelf to ſtand under. <hi>Onus angelicis humeris formidandum.</hi> And if the Shoulders of Angels wou'd ſhrink &amp; tremble under it, well may theirs, who are frail Men, which are cruſhed before the <hi>Moth.</hi> There is no Man who knows himſelf, &amp; what the Work of the Miniſtry is, but will undertake it with <hi>fear and trembling,</hi> when he is called thereto. It is an Argument of wretched Ignorance and Self-conceit, for a man to intrude himſelf into this hard and hazardous Office.
