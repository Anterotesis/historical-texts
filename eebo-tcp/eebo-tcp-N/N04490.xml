            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here preſent you with a little Treatiſe, which I muſt expect will make the World angry with me, becauſe it is contrary to the World's Religion</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible I ought rather to die, than, for my <hi>own Will,</hi> to get the Diſpleaſure of the meaneſt Perſon in the World: And Satan ſometimes tells me, <hi>he</hi> can put me in to a fine Way, whereby I may do God much Service, and yet keep in with the World, ſleep in a whole Skin, and go to Heaven in a Feather-bed. His Way which he would have me take, is to keep a <hi>Medium</hi> between thoſe who have <hi>no Zeal,</hi> and thoſe who are <hi>zealous:</hi> And when he hath flatter'd away my <hi>Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> he perſuades me, (as he doth <hi>ſome</hi> others) that I have made a <hi>great Progreſs</hi> in Religion, and have <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Meekneſs and Gentleneſs of Chriſt:</hi> As if the <hi>Lion</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> could not <hi>lie down together</hi> in the ſame Soul.</p>
            <p>But no ſooner doth God give me to look into Eternity, and to realize, that the Things of this little World are not to be deſired to make one happy; but I ſee that this <hi>ſweet</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as the World calls it, and which never <hi>poyſons</hi> a Man's Soul, but when the World is <hi>ſweet</hi> to him) is only <hi>Satan tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into an Angel of Light;</hi> the <hi>cloven Foot</hi> appears quite plain: And I can ſay, from the Bottom of my Heart, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan; thou art an Offence unto me;</hi> thou <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureſt not the Things that be of God,</hi> but the Things that be <hi>of Men.</hi> Nay, I had rather be exercis'd with Pain, Sickneſs, Poverty, Reproach, and all other Evils God ſees to be <hi>wholeſom</hi> for me, than have my Soul languiſh under that <hi>faſhionable</hi> Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:005568_0003_10186A5DC5601170"/>
For then, the worldly Miſt being remov'd, I ſee plainly that the World hates Chriſt's Religion <hi>now,</hi> as mortally, as it ever hated <hi>him;</hi> that (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith) <q>'tis not the Goſpel Men preach, if it is preach'd in Peace; and that whoſoever will be a faithful Preacher of the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>muſt</hi> (as <hi>he</hi> hath foretold) have the World for an Enemy, and live in the Wars all the Days of his Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, did I call that preaching the Goſpel, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly paſſeth for it, viz. Miniſters telling poor Sinners they muſt believe Jeſus Chriſt to <hi>be an all ſufficient Saviour of Sinners in general, but not their Saviour in particular;</hi> I ſhould be of another Sentiment: For the World doth not <hi>hate,</hi> but <hi>love</hi> this Religion; 'tis the Religion of <hi>Nature;</hi> at leaſt <hi>Nature</hi> is not puzzled with it; all the Miniſters Hearers have got <hi>ſomething</hi> of it already; or, however it appears an eaſy Thing to get <hi>dark</hi> Religion at any Time: So that Miniſters will be more likely to be <hi>deify'd</hi> than <hi>perſecuted</hi> by the World for preached <hi>this</hi> Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But inaſmuch as <hi>I have not ſo learned Chriſt;</hi> inaſmuch as I believe <hi>this</hi> to be <hi>another Goſpel;</hi> it is moſt clear to me that thoſe who <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>powerfully</hi> preach down <hi>this</hi> Faith, ſo agreeable to Nature, and in lieu of it preach that (as holy <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> expreſſeth it) "every Sinner muſt believe Jeſus Chriſt to be <hi>his</hi> Saviour and <hi>his</hi> Redeemer, will meet with Perſecution, in ſome Degree, and that not only from the prophane and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Part of the World, but alſo and eſpecially from many moral Perſons without Grace: (For the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were the worſt Enemies Chriſt had) and it may be, ſometimes from tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious Perſons, who have been enticed over into the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy's Camp. The World's Enmity againſt <hi>this</hi> Goſpel, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>this</hi> Faith, ſprings directly from its Enmity againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For the World hath ſuch an <hi>high</hi> Opinion of its <hi>own</hi> Righteouſneſs, and ſuch a <hi>mean</hi> Opinion of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, that it will not bear <hi>Man</hi> to be ſo much <hi>deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> and Chriſt to be ſo much <hi>exalted,</hi> as that a poor Sinner, who knows he deſerves to be ſent to Hell, ſhould <hi>this Moment</hi> believe that God for Chriſt's Sake <hi>doth</hi> forgive <hi>his</hi> Sins, and that Chriſt and all his Benefits belong to <hi>him</hi> notwithſtanding all his Vileneſs. This is the <hi>Root of Bitterneſs;</hi> Hence it is that the Doctrine of a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>aſſured</hi> Faith is ſo <hi>run down,</hi> becauſe it <hi>exalts</hi> the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> becauſe it makes
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005568_0004_10186A60251CA028"/>
               <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>his</hi> Righteouſneſs to be <hi>nothing,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his</hi> Righteouſneſs to be <hi>all in all;</hi> it not being ſuch Divinity as can be well digeſted, by thoſe who have never ſeen the <hi>Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or, if they have ſeen it, are <hi>now</hi> groping <hi>in the Dark,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking to be juſtified as it were, by the Works of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the View in which the Thing appears to me: In Proportion therefore, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> appears to me to be a <hi>great</hi> Saviour, my <hi>Heart always burns within me,</hi> with Zeal againſt <hi>that</hi> Religion which makes him a <hi>little</hi> Saviour. Nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when I aſcribe <hi>Glory to the Lamb</hi> in my Heart, and <hi>lift him up</hi> in my very Soul, it ſeems that if I had as many Lives as Hairs on my Head, I could willingly and chearfully part with them all, rather than <hi>come into their Secret,</hi> who are for baniſhing a <hi>particular</hi> Faith out of the World, and thereby <hi>pulling down</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>trampling</hi> him under their Feet.</p>
            <p>And, 'tis becauſe <hi>God who is rich in Mercy, for the great Love wherewith he loved me, when I was dead in Treſpaſſes and in Sins,</hi> hath <hi>quickned</hi> me by making me to know that Chriſt is <hi>mighty to ſave,</hi> that I have undertaken, and, at Length fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the enſuing Treatiſe; the great Deſign of which (<hi>he</hi> knows) is to ſpeak a good Word for the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to ſet the Crown upon <hi>his</hi> Head, when ſo many are going Traiterouſly to rob him of it, and to place it upon the Head of <hi>Rebellious Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I know that <hi>Jealouſy</hi> for the Honour of <hi>Zion's King,</hi> hath made me <hi>bold in my God,</hi> to draw my Pen in <hi>his</hi> Cauſe, and to maintain <hi>his</hi> Right, notwithſtanding a great <hi>Hoſt</hi> of <hi>Terrors</hi> that were ſet <hi>in Array</hi> againſt me; ſo I am perſuaded, <hi>my God who ſtood by me, and ſtrengthened me</hi> to go through the Work, will bleſs it now it is done, to the <hi>praiſe of the Glory of his Grace:</hi> Nay, I <hi>can't</hi> doubt but it will redound more to his Glory than any Work I have been enabled to do <hi>by</hi> him, and <hi>for</hi> him, ever ſince I <hi>knew the Grace of God in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, I expect it will be ſaid by <hi>ſome,</hi> 
               <q>For <hi>their</hi> parts, <hi>they</hi> think I have been writing a Book that confutes <hi>no body;</hi> ſince all the Miniſters they can find agree with me, that a <hi>meer General</hi> Faith is good for <hi>nothing,</hi> and that Believers ſhould have a particular Application of the Blood of Chriſt to their <hi>own</hi> Souls.</q> I anſwer; Miniſters may agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005568_0005_10186A61F505CE88"/>in ſaying <hi>all this,</hi> and yet be no nearer together in the Matter of <hi>Juſtifying</hi> Faith than <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, Dr. <hi>Perkins</hi> obſerves, that both <q>
                  <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> agree together in holding that Believers ſhould have a <hi>particular</hi> Application of the Blood of Chriſt unto their <hi>own</hi> Souls: and yet, (ſaith he) the Agreement is only <hi>in Words:</hi> For <hi>we</hi> hold a <hi>particular</hi> Application <hi>by Faith; they</hi> only <hi>by Hope</hi> and <hi>Conjecture.</hi>

For my Part, thro' Grace, I have an univerſal Love towards Miniſters; (more eſpecially thoſe who appear to have been inflamed with the Love of Chriſt, <hi>whoever</hi> they be, <hi>wherever</hi> they be, and <hi>however,</hi> in leſſer Matters, oppoſite to me) and have felt my Heart wiſhing them well, and praying for them, even thoſe who are <hi>moſt</hi> againſt me, a great Part of the Time that I have been writing this Book.

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>I Have oftentimes wonder'd, and believe I ſhall continue wondring as long as I live, how it ſhould come to paſs, that in <hi>ſo Proteſtant</hi> a Country as <hi>this,</hi> it ſhould be a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to any Man to be a <hi>true Proteſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One muſt be a Stranger to the State of Religion in <hi>New-England,</hi> not to know that a <hi>general</hi> Faith is in Vogue, not only among <hi>Arminians,</hi> but among <hi>Calviniſts</hi> alſo, eſpecially of the Clergy; and that thoſe who maintain a <hi>particular</hi> Faith, are look'd upon to be <hi>Enthaſiaſts</hi> and <hi>Antinomians</hi> &amp;c. And yet theſe few <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts falſly ſo called,</hi> are the only <hi>thorough Proteſtants</hi> in the Land: All the reſt, whoſoever they be, do <hi>ſo far</hi> turn their Backs upon the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> and <hi>ſay a Confederacy</hi> with the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly Mr. <hi>Ebenezer Erſkine</hi> in a Sermon lately come among us, warns his Hearers againſt a <hi>general</hi> Faith, as what was renounced by their Forefathers as a <hi>BRANCH</hi> of <hi>POPERY.</hi> He refers to theſe Words in their <hi>national Covenant;</hi> 
               <q>We deteſt and refuſe the uſurped Authority of that <hi>Roman Antichriſt</hi>—His <hi>general</hi> and <hi>doubtſome</hi> Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, the Meridian Sun never was plainer to one tolerably acquainted with eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, than that <hi>this</hi> Faith is the Faith of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>aſſured</hi> Faith is the Faith of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſanguine and undaunted Chriſtian Hero, <hi>Luther,</hi> is well known to have been the firſt in the Reformation, who gave a Blow to that <hi>Man of Sin</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> And 'tis as well known to thoſe who have read his Works, that the chief Blow which is gave him, and which ſet him a reeling, was by preaching down that <hi>general dark</hi> Faith, which <hi>then</hi> was, and <hi>now</hi> is held <hi>ſo ſacred,</hi> and by preaching up a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> and <hi>aſſured</hi> Faith in the Room of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo his Brother in the Reformation <hi>(par nobile fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum!)</hi> might be ſuppoſed to be <hi>like-minded</hi> meerly from his being a Reformer; for otherwiſe, inſtead of preaching People <hi>from Rome,</hi> he would have preach'd them to <hi>Rome</hi> again;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005568_0010_10186A6E29B34B00"/>but, beſides he hath expreſly over and over declared his Mind in his <hi>Inſtitutions.</hi> 
               <q>We ſhall have a perfect Definition of Faith (ſaith he) if we ſay that it is a ſtedfaſt and <hi>aſſured Knowledge</hi> of God's Kindneſs towards <hi>US,</hi> which being grounded upon the Truth of the Promiſe in Chriſt, is both revealed to our Minds, and ſealed in our Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>The Deſcription of juſtifying Faith given by the Church of <hi>Holland</hi> is worthy alſo of particular Obſervation: It is, (ſay they) a <hi>ſure Knowledge</hi> of God and his Promiſes revealed to us in the Goſpel, and a <hi>hearty Confidence,</hi> that <hi>all my Sins are forgiven me.</hi>

            <p>Nay, Dr. <hi>William Perkins,</hi> who maintain'd this ſame Cauſe againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> between one and two hundred Years ago, which I am now maintaining againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> gives us the Definition of the Faith of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in theſe Words,—
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005568_0011_10186A7308027210"/>
               <q>A juſtifying Faith is not only a general Belief of the Articles of Faith, that Chriſt was dead and roſe again for them that believe; but it is an <hi>aſſured</hi> ſtedfaſt <hi>Confidence,</hi> whereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man <hi>particularly</hi> doth apply <hi>to himſelf</hi> the general Promiſes of God, for the Hope of Remiſſion of his Sins in Chriſt, that Chriſt died, roſe again, and did all the reſt for <hi>him.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Willet</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis Papiſmi 976.</hi> Which he cites from Dr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>'s <hi>Reformed Catholick,</hi> where, as well as in Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Biſhop</hi> this Matter is largely treated of.</note>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> the <hi>Martyrologiſt</hi> is ſo zealous that he thinks it Blaſphemy to deny this Definition.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Papiſts (ſaith he) <hi>blaſphemouſly</hi> ſay, that Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a Man firmly believeth, and certainly <hi>aſſureth</hi> himſelf that for Chriſt's Sake <hi>his</hi> Sins are forgiven, and that he ſhall poſſeſs eternal Life, is not Faith, but Raſhneſs, not the Perſwaſion of the Holy Ghoſt, but Preſumption of a Man's Boldneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Matter in Diſpute between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> was fairly repreſented, we are abundantly confirmed by the Papiſts themſelves, who glory in their being Enemies to a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>aſſured</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> all determine that there is no <hi>Confidence</hi> or <hi>Aſſurance</hi> in ſaving Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith it is not the Property of Faith to apply to every Believer, the Promiſes of God in Chriſt: This he ſaith is <hi>Preſumption.</hi> (The common Objection at this Day!)</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> ſay, <q>That Faith by which we are juſtified, is a general or univerſal believing of the Articles of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, not any <hi>fond ſpecial</hi> Faith, or Confidence of <hi>each Man's own Salvation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declared, That juſtifying Faith is not that <hi>aſſured</hi> Belief, and <hi>Confidence of the Heart,</hi> whereby we are perſuaded that <hi>our</hi> Sins are forgiven in Chriſt. <note n="**" place="bottom">Seſſ. Can. <hi>6.13.</hi>

            <p>Theſe Curſes are to this Day in <hi>full Force and Virtue;</hi> ſo that we are all <hi>curſed</hi> and <hi>curſed</hi> again by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as well as reproach'd by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for the ſame Cauſe, even for our maintaining this heavenly Doctrine, viz. That a poor Sinner, in order to his being juſtified, muſt believe Chriſt to be <hi>his</hi> Saviour, and <hi>his</hi> Redeemer. But the <hi>Curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come;</hi> there is no <hi>curſing them</hi> whom the <hi>Lord bleſſeth:</hi> I deſire to take <hi>theſe Curſes,</hi> and <hi>theſe Reproaches,</hi> and <hi>bind them as a Crown to my Head,</hi> eſteeming it the greateſt Glory of my Life, that I have been counted worthy to ſuffer Shame in this glorious Cauſe.</p>
            <p>That which ſtirs up the Enmity of the Papiſts, and cauſes them to <hi>oppoſe, curſe</hi> and <hi>burn</hi> the Maintainers of this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is a Jealouſie they have, leſt it ſhould one Day deſtroy Popery from the Face of the Earth: for they can foreſee, without any Spirit of Propheſy, that if a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>aſſured</hi> Faith ſhould once gain Ground in the World, <hi>their</hi> Kingdom which is founded upon <hi>Darkneſs, Doubting</hi> and <hi>Uncertainty,</hi> muſt inevitably tumble to the Ground: they could no longer keep up a Market of <hi>Indulgences, Maſſes,</hi> and <hi>Pilgrimages,</hi> &amp;c. and the Fire of <hi>Purgatory</hi> would be quite <hi>put out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For which Reaſon it is aſtoniſhing to me, that the Doctrine of a <hi>general</hi> Faith, which as the <hi>Smoke of the bottomleſs Pit,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005568_0013_10186A7738F851F0"/>darkens the Air and the Sun,</hi> ſhould be ſo careſs'd in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as zealous for the general Proteſtant Cauſe as any in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, I make no Doubt but there are many People in the Land, and ſome Miniſters, who have fallen in Love with this Antichriſtian Doctrine, who yet out of Allegience to King GEORGE, or rather to King JESUS, would <hi>die the Death,</hi> and be burnt to Aſhes, rather than be reconciled to that <hi>Mother of Abominations,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Why then have they gone ſo far <hi>backwards,</hi> as to ſymbolize with her, in this great Article of Chriſtian Religion? All I can learn they have to ſay for themſelves, is only this; viz. <q>That the Divines who came after, found out that <hi>Luther</hi> and the other Reformers had not rightly defin'd Faith by putting <hi>Aſſurance</hi> into the Nature of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Solution, if weigh'd in the Balance, will be found <hi>ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than nothing and Vanity:</hi> For, <hi>Luther</hi> and the other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, were either <hi>quite right,</hi> or elſe quite <hi>wrong</hi> in putting Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance into the Nature of Faith. If <hi>they</hi> were <hi>quite right</hi> then theſe Men are <hi>quite wrong</hi> in finding Fault with their Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Faith: But if the Reformers were <hi>quite wrong</hi> (as <hi>theſe</hi> Men ſuppoſe) then theſe Things will follow, and <hi>muſt</hi> be maintained by them; viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Papiſts were in the Right, in condemning this Doctrine as Hereſy, and warning againſt, and oppoſing <hi>the Proteſtants</hi> for preaching it up, provided they had kept within the Bounds of Moderation, and had not proceeded to <hi>curſing</hi> and <hi>burning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That every one who died for a <hi>particular,</hi> and <hi>aſſured</hi> Faith, (for, as a certain learned Author obſerves, <q>it was ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Blood of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Flames:</q> there is no Doubt but <hi>Tindal</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> were hurried to the Stake, and burnt, in a great Meaſure for their Zeal for this Doctrine) I ſay it follows that every one of theſe died <hi>as a Fool dieth,</hi> not as Witneſſes to the Truth, but as Witneſſes to a Falſhood, of which the Devil was the Author; for he is the Author of all falſe Religion; ſo that they were all the Devil's Martyrs, and not Chriſt's.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Preaching of this falſe Divinity of which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the falſe Spirit was the Author, was the Means of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that wonderful Work of Reformation which we have
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005568_0014_10186A7A17217A70"/>heard and read ſo much of, when Thouſands and Thouſands were ſuppos'd to <hi>flock unto</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as a Cloud, and as <hi>Doves unto their Windows,</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> were <hi>born in a Day.</hi> For, one muſt be very ignorant of thoſe Times, not to know that People were taught <hi>no other</hi> Way to the Favour of God, than by a <hi>particular,</hi> and <hi>aſſured</hi> Faith, and that this Doctrine was forever ſounding in their Ears. And Oh, how ſweetly would ſuch Talk as this <hi>for</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> ſound in the Ears of the <hi>Pope, Cardinals, Friers, Monks,</hi> and the Reſt of their religious Rabble, cauſing their very Hearts within them to <hi>leap for Joy!</hi> And did they think this was the <hi>common</hi> Talk; would they not together with their Thank-offerings to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and other Saints, both good and bad for the hopeful Proſpect, think it almoſt Time to ſend over another <hi>Reginald Poole,</hi> to forgive us in the Pope's Name, for what was paſt, and to reconcile us <hi>more perfectly</hi> to Holy Mother Church? And yet really this, is in Effect the Talk of every one who ſaith <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> and thoſe who firſt broke away from the Pope, <q>did not define Faith right by putting <hi>Aſſurance</hi> into the Nature of it.</q> All <hi>that Popiſh</hi> Talk is wrapt up in this one Saying: So that <hi>hereby,</hi> they <hi>crock</hi> and <hi>beſmear</hi> themſelves ſo, that all the Water in the Sea will not waſh off the <hi>Popiſh Smutt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſome who came after thoſe Chriſtian Heroes, did ſee, or pretend to ſee that the Reformers ought not to have put any <hi>Aſſurance</hi> into the Definition of juſtifying Faith, I make no Doubt: But then it is clear from what hath been ſaid, that their Eyes were anointed with <hi>Popiſh Eye-Salve</hi> which made them ſo quick-ſighted.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, when a Number of them in <hi>Scotland</hi> of Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Faction, pretended to ſee the Falſhood of that Faith, <q>declaring that there was no <hi>perſonal Confidence</hi> in it, and that <hi>perſonal Application</hi> was meer Preſumption, and the <hi>Fiction of a craſy Brain.</hi>
               </q> Mr. <hi>Robert Bailey,</hi> then Miniſter of <hi>Kilwinning,</hi> afterwards one of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſembly,</hi> wrote againſt them, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with <hi>Popery</hi> for that very Aſſertion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtorla motuum in Regno Scotice, Pag. <hi>517.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And if there was that Zeal for <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which there was then (An. Dom. 1640) in the Churches
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005568_0015_10186A7F0FEEF6D8"/>of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſuch <hi>Popiſh</hi> Talk would be born Teſtimony againſt, and not be <hi>countenanc'd</hi> by whole Aſſemblies of Miniſters.</p>
            <p>But to return, How ſhall we account for this Thing which ſeems ſo unaccountable; viz. That there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>warping</hi> towards <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>ſo Proteſtant</hi> a Country as <hi>this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In general; this <hi>Phenomenon</hi> muſt be reſolved into <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> 'Tis <hi>becauſe Darkneſs covers the Earth, and groſs Darkneſs the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>general</hi> Faith is a Doctrine of <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> It is a Weed that grows only in the <hi>Shade,</hi> and <hi>withers</hi> when the Sun looks upon it.</p>
            <p>Accordingly in the Time of that glorious Reformation, of which I have been ſpeaking, when God <hi>ſent forth his Light,</hi> and his <hi>Truth,</hi> it <hi>ſhrunk up</hi> before the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs:</hi> but when the heavenly Light was withdrawn, it <hi>flouriſhed again,</hi> poor People <hi>grop'd in the dark,</hi> and blunder'd backwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it hath alſo been in this ſecond Reformation; while the <hi>glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhined</hi> into the Hearts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, the Meeting Houſes rang, and the Fields eccho'd with a particular Faith; (no Miniſter <hi>can</hi> feel <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of the Love of Chriſt in his own Soul, without preaching it) but now ſince the <hi>Lord hath departed,</hi> even the <hi>Glory of the Lord that was riſen</hi> upon them; alas, how ſeldom do we <hi>hear the joyful Sound!</hi> When Miniſters don't <hi>know</hi> that <hi>they</hi> have Chriſt <hi>for nothing,</hi> they can't find in their Hearts to believe that others may have him <hi>for nothing:</hi> and then <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>ſelling</hi> Chriſt comes in the Room of <hi>free Grace:</hi> their <hi>benighted</hi> Hearers alſo, <hi>love to have it ſo;</hi> a <hi>general</hi> Faith is what alone will go down with <hi>them;</hi> like <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> before mentioned, they think it Preſumption for a poor Sinner to apply Chriſt and his Benefits <hi>to Himſelf,</hi> before he hath ſomething to pay, i.e. before he finds in himſelf a <hi>Willingneſs</hi> to <hi>make him welcome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid, I truſt it is evident what is the Faith of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and what is the Faith of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and withal that 'tis <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>latter,</hi> and defend the <hi>former;</hi> which I ſhall endeavour to do by the following Arguments.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Devils believe Chriſt to be <hi>a</hi> Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> i. 24. And if Men at Converſion only believe him to be <hi>a</hi> Saviour, <hi>wherein</hi> doth the Faith of <hi>Devils</hi> differ from the <hi>Faith of God's Elect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know it will be ſaid, the <hi>Effects</hi> of their Faith are <hi>different:</hi> To which I anſwer, <hi>qualis cauſa, talis effectus;</hi> If the <hi>Effects</hi> are <hi>different,</hi> ſo are the <hi>Cauſes</hi> which produce them; and conſequently Faith in thoſe accurſed Spirits muſt have <hi>another Difference</hi> than what lies in the <hi>Effects:</hi> which Difference can lie <hi>no where,</hi> but where I have plac'd it; viz. That the <hi>former</hi> only believe Chriſt to be <hi>a</hi> Saviour, while the <hi>latter</hi> believe him to be <hi>their</hi> Saviour.</p>
               <p>For, as 'tis Men's <hi>taking God at his Word,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>their</hi> Saviour, which makes them <hi>new Creatures;</hi> ſo, did God by his Spirit convince the Devils that there was in Chriſt Salvation <hi>for them</hi> (which he never will do) they could be Devils no more. The ſame Diſcovery from the Spirit of God, which makes the former ceaſe to be <hi>wicked Men,</hi> would make the latter ceaſe to be <hi>evil Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, if any one ſhould think that the eſſential Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Faith of Devils, and of <hi>good Men</hi> lies here; that the <hi>former</hi> only believe him to be <hi>a</hi> Saviour, but not of any of their Race, while the latter believe him to be a Saviour of the humane Race. I anſwer, this Solution ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurts than helps their Cauſe: For if a little <hi>general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bality</hi> of Salvation by Chriſt, is ſuppoſed the Means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Man a new Creature, while the Devils who have <hi>no Hope</hi> remain Devils ſtill notwithſtanding their Faith; how much <hi>more likely</hi> is it that Men would be <hi>renewed in the Spirit
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005568_0017_10186A84A75CF338"/>of their Minds</hi> by a <hi>ſure</hi> Perſuaſion that Chriſt and all his Benefits belonged <hi>to them in particular?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſince the <hi>general</hi> Faith I am now oppoſing, can't be made out <hi>any Way</hi> to be <hi>eſſentially</hi> different from the <hi>Faith of Devils;</hi> the <hi>Faith of God's Elect</hi> muſt be a <hi>particular</hi> Faith, whereby a Man not only believes Jeſus Chriſt to be the Saviour of <hi>Sinners in general,</hi> but the Saviour of <hi>himſelf,</hi> a moſt vile and miſerable Sinner.</p>

                  <hi>Second</hi> ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>Faith in Chriſt is in Scripture ſet forth by a Marriage. <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. <hi>7.4.</hi> Rev. <hi>19.7.</hi> Eph. <hi>5.32.2</hi> Cor. <hi>11.2.</hi>
                  </note> But what Woman ever gives her ſelf in Marriage to a Man, without looking upon him as <hi>her</hi> Friend, as one that loves <hi>her,</hi> and gives himſelf to <hi>her?</hi> If all this were wanting, that which is eſſential to a Marriage would be wanting: And yet this is all wanting in the ſpiritual Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Believer according to a <hi>general</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>The Soul gives her ſelf to Chriſt, without looking upon him as <hi>her</hi> Friend, as one who loves <hi>her,</hi> or ſo much as ever intended Marriage with <hi>her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed if a Woman ſhould marry a Man <hi>in the Dark,</hi> and give her ſelf to him to be his lawful Wife, only becauſe ſhe thought him a likely Man, and had heard that he wanted a Wife; ſuch a Marriage as this, would be well repreſented by a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Faith. But was there ever ſuch a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as <hi>this?</hi> Or, if ever any Woman ſhould be ſo much <hi>out of her Wits,</hi> as to marry her ſelf to a Man in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; all wiſe Men would look upon the Marriage to be a Nullity.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſince the Holy Ghoſt repreſents Faith to us by a Marriage; and ſince a <hi>general</hi> Faith will admit of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between Chriſt and the Soul like a Marriage; it <hi>muſt</hi> be in the Way of a particular Faith, that poor Sinners are married to the <hi>Lamb of God.</hi>

                  <hi>Third</hi> ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>Another Argument againſt a <hi>general</hi> Faith, is that it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Men to make <hi>God a Liar,</hi> at the very Time of their Converſion. Who is he that <hi>maketh God a Liar,</hi> but he that believeth not the <hi>Record</hi> which he hath given of his Son? And this is the <hi>Record</hi> (O glorious <hi>Record!</hi>) that <hi>God hath given to US eternal Life in his Son.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005568_0018_10186A880F944030"/>
If therefore at Converſion, we don't believe that <hi>God gives eternal Life to</hi> US, we make <hi>him a Liar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It don't excuſe us, let us believe never ſo firmly that God <hi>gives eternal Life</hi> to <hi>Sinners in general:</hi> No, we muſt put <hi>OUR SELVES</hi> into the Number, and believe that <hi>God gives eternal Life</hi> to <hi>US,</hi> or elſe we make <hi>him a Liar</hi> according to the very Words of St. <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some may think the Difficulty ſolv'd by ſaying that the <hi>Record</hi> means that God gives eternal Life to us Sinners, <hi>if</hi> we will believe. <hi>If</hi> we will believe! That is, if we will <hi>pay</hi> for it: for <hi>here</hi> believing ſtands for <hi>working;</hi> and <hi>working</hi> is the <hi>ſame Thing</hi> with <hi>paying.</hi> There muſt be <hi>no legal ifs; one if</hi> ſpoils all: For this only is <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> Goſpel, viz. That God <hi>gives Eternal Life</hi> to Sinners <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> not <hi>if</hi> they will believe, but <hi>whether they believe or no:</hi> tho' without their believing, or <hi>taking</hi> the <hi>unſpeakable Gift</hi> will <hi>profit them nothing,</hi> but only be a Means of their receiving the <hi>greater Damnation.</hi> Nor is this a Doctrine of <hi>Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as <hi>Satan</hi> would perſwade the World: On the contrary 'tis the <hi>only Cure</hi> for a <hi>licentious Life.</hi> Convictions will not do; though the <hi>Pains of Hell get hold</hi> of Sinners, yet they are liable afterwards to return like <hi>the Dog to his Vomit, and like the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire.</hi> But can a Man ſin againſt a God giving <hi>eternal Life</hi> to him?— No verily, when once the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> of God <hi>his</hi> Saviour hath appeared to <hi>him,</hi> all the Devils in Hell can't make him in Love with a wicked Life any longer.</p>

                  <hi>Fourth</hi> ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>As the Doctrine of a general Faith reflects upon the ever-bleſſed God, ſo doth it upon Man too, by ſuppoſing him to be ſtupid and irrational at Converſion; <hi>when</hi> all Men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, <hi>come to themſelves,</hi> though they were <hi>beſides themſelves</hi> before. Luke 15.17. It will be granted that what a convinced Sinner wants, is to ſee that <hi>he</hi> hath a Right to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Well, by a divine and ſupernatural Light, he comes to ſee that <hi>whoſoever will,</hi> hath a <hi>Right</hi> to Chriſt, and yet he don't ſee that <hi>he</hi> hath a <hi>Right</hi> to him! Was ever any Thing more abſurd! Suppoſe one among a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of condemned Malefactors in Priſon, expecting Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ſhould verily believe that the King hath ſent Orders that <hi>whoſoever will</hi> ſhall have his Liberty, and yet at the ſame Time ſhould not ſee that <hi>he</hi> had his Liberty; would
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005568_0019_10186A8A8DB75E28"/>not every one ſap that herein he was more like a <hi>Stock</hi> or a <hi>Stone,</hi> than a reaſonable Man?</p>
               <p>Thus doth this Doctrine ſuppoſe Men to exerciſe no more Reaſon at Converſion, I won't ſay than Brutes, (for Brutes are wiſer: when they want Liberty, no ſooner are the Bars let down, but <hi>every one</hi> ſees Liberty <hi>for himſelf:</hi>) but than Stones and <hi>Stumps;</hi> and yet <hi>them</hi> all Men, however it was with them <hi>before,</hi> or may be <hi>afterwards,</hi> have the cleareſt Exerciſe of their Reaſon.</p>
               <p>But where would be the Harm, if they ſhould allow a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature tranſacting for Eternity, to be as wiſe as the <hi>Beaſts that periſh?</hi> When theſe ſee a <hi>general</hi> Privilege, they always ſee a <hi>particular</hi> Privilege <hi>for themſelves.</hi> And why will they not allow that when a poor condemned Sinner ſees Salvation for Sinners in <hi>general</hi> in Chriſt, he ſhould <hi>at the ſame Time,</hi> ſee Salvation <hi>for himſelf in particular?</hi> Why, this would be to ſuppoſe too much <hi>Light</hi> in Converſion, and <hi>that</hi> they are dreadfully afraid of: If Converſion is <hi>all Darkneſs,</hi> (as to a Man's <hi>own</hi> Caſe) <hi>it is all good:</hi> there can't be <hi>too much Darkneſs;</hi> but the leaſt <hi>Glimmering</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> would <hi>ſpoil all.</hi>

If I ſhould give a Crown to a poor Man, and he ſhould take it, without ſeeing that I did really intend to give it to <hi>him,</hi> he would be a <hi>Thief</hi> and a <hi>Robber,</hi> and remain without <hi>any Right</hi> to the Money, which would have been <hi>his own,</hi> had he been convinced that I gave it to <hi>him.</hi>

               <p>This is certainly a parallel Caſe: The <hi>former</hi> is not more properly <hi>temporal,</hi> than the <hi>latter</hi> is <hi>ſpiritual</hi> thieving. — Wherefore, ſince a <hi>general</hi> Faith puts the whole World upon <hi>ſtealing Chriſt;</hi> ſince it teaches every Man to <hi>ſnatch at him in the dark,</hi> and to <hi>take</hi> him without ſeeing that Chriſt belongs to <hi>him,</hi> and conſequently to dream that he <hi>poſſeſſes</hi> a Saviour when he doth not, to the infinite Hazzard of his Soul; it follows plainly that a <hi>general</hi> Faith, is not the <hi>Faith of God's Elect.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>Twelfth</hi> ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>That it makes Chriſt but a <hi>little</hi> Saviour. Every one who hath only a <hi>general</hi> Faith, believes Chriſt to be only a <hi>little</hi> Saviour; and the Preachers of this <hi>new Goſpel,</hi> do in Effect, what in them lies, to make their Hearers believe that Jeſus Chriſt is not a <hi>great</hi> but a <hi>little</hi> Saviour.</p>
               <p>I don't ſay that in Words, they affirm Chriſt to be a <hi>little</hi> Saviour; this would be <hi>open Blaſphemy:</hi> They may, both Miniſters and others, <hi>in their Talk,</hi> ſet forth the Perfections of Chriſt, and declare that he is <hi>mighty to ſave, able to ſave even to the very uttermoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whatever any of us may ſay <hi>about Chriſt,</hi> every one regards him <hi>juſt ſo much</hi> (and no more) as he <hi>regards</hi> him in <hi>his Heart.</hi> And he that don't <hi>in his Heart</hi> believe him to be
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005568_0027_10186AA1461B52F0"/>
                  <hi>his</hi> Saviour, let him ſay what he will, don't believe him to be a <hi>great</hi> Saviour; and conſequently the Miniſters who tell poor Sinners that they muſt not believe Chriſt to be <hi>their</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in <hi>particular,</hi> do, in Effect, tell them they muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt to be a <hi>great,</hi> but only a <hi>little</hi> Saviour. But it will be ſaid, it is no Conſequence, that if a Man don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt to be <hi>his</hi> Saviour, he don't believe him to be a <hi>great</hi> Saviour.—I reply; a Man can't ſee Chriſt to be a <hi>great</hi> Saviour, without ſeeing him to be a <hi>Saviour</hi> great enough to ſave <hi>him:</hi> He therefore that never ſaw Chriſt to be <hi>his</hi> Saviour, never yet ſaw him to be a <hi>great</hi> Saviour. Here it will be ſaid; Every one who ſees Chriſt to be a <hi>great</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſees him to be a Saviour <hi>great</hi> enough to ſave <hi>him, if</hi> he was but <hi>qualified</hi> to be ſav'd by this <hi>great</hi> Saviour. If he was qualified! Away with theſe <hi>legal ifs</hi> to Rome! When a Man ſees Chriſt to be a <hi>great</hi> Saviour, the <hi>Wall of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is broken down,</hi> and he ſees Chriſt to be <hi>his</hi> Saviour, bad as he is, without one <hi>if</hi> in the Way. 'Tis <hi>Qualification</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to ſee <hi>Chriſt qualified:</hi> When therefore he ſees <hi>Chriſt qualified</hi> he <hi>can't help</hi> ſeeing <hi>himſelf qualified.</hi> How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any one ſhould by Faith realize that Chriſt is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to ſave the <hi>Chief of Sinners,</hi> in all their <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Filth,</hi> as <hi>black</hi> as <hi>Hell</hi> with Sin and Luſt and <hi>Unbelief,</hi> and yet have any Scruple, whether <hi>he</hi> is <hi>qualified</hi> to be <hi>ſav'd</hi> by <hi>ſuch</hi> a Saviour?</p>
               <p>'Tis the greateſt Abſurdity in the World to ſuppoſe this: And if it is an Abſurdity; then it is plain, that all I have ſaid againſt a general Faith in this Argument, is <hi>ſound Speech that cannot be condemned;</hi> viz. That it makes Chriſt to be a <hi>little</hi> Saviour; that thoſe who have only a <hi>general</hi> Faith, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſaw him to be a <hi>great</hi> Saviour; and that the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this <hi>new Goſpel</hi> teach People only, in Effect, that they muſt believe Chriſt to be a <hi>little,</hi> and not a <hi>great</hi> Saviour.</p>

               <p>Another Argument againſt this <hi>general</hi> Faith is, That it is an Enemy, i. e. it makes Men Enemies to that glorious and Soul-raviſhing Doctrine of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> of which we read <hi>ſo much</hi> in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005568_0028_10186AA426A60330"/>in his I. Epiſt. 1. Chap.

For which Reaſon, I have often thought with my ſelf, what dreadful <hi>Antinomians Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and other Apoſtles would be looked upon were they to live at this Day; and how faſt moſt Pulpit-doors in Town and Country would be ſhut againſt them! For the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Miniſters are ſo far from being of the ſame Mind with <hi>them,</hi> that they don't ſeem to think that ſcarce one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ever arrives to <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> when they ſpeak of it, they <hi>run it down</hi> as a Thing that People are better <hi>without</hi> than with. 'Tis repreſented by them as a Thing that would make Perſons <hi>lazy</hi> and <hi>proud;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now, to what can it be owing that the Apoſtles and theſe Miniſters agree no better in the Article of <hi>Aſſurance?</hi> The <hi>Root of Bitterneſs</hi> is the above-mention'd <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Faith: Take away <hi>that</hi> and the <hi>Contention ceaſes:</hi> Whereas that being <hi>held faſt</hi> there <hi>can</hi> be <hi>no Reconciliation.</hi> Nay, I have ſometimes wonder'd how it comes to paſs, that the <hi>Men of this Device,</hi> agree with the Apoſtles as far as they do, in owning Aſſurance to be ſo much as a <hi>poſſible Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> For even <hi>this</hi> is more than their Principle will admit of. Let us make the Trial—Suppoſe ſome one hath actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attain'd to <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> I would ask, How did he come <hi>by it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if the Faith by which he was juſtified, was, as <hi>they</hi> ſay, only a Belief of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt's</hi> being a ſufficient Saviour for Sinners <hi>in general;</hi> every one may ſee that <hi>this</hi> Faith, though ſtrain'd to the <hi>higheſt Pitch,</hi> will not <hi>come up</hi> to <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> For there can be nothing in the <hi>Superlative,</hi> of which there was not <hi>ſomething</hi> in the <hi>Poſitive.</hi> If therefore there was no <hi>Aſſurance</hi> in the <hi>poſitive</hi> Degree, 'tis <hi>impoſſible</hi> there ſhould be <hi>any</hi> in the <hi>Superlative.</hi> Since therefore the Man's Faith (let him be never ſo <hi>ſtrong in the Faith</hi>) don't help him <hi>at all</hi> to <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> it follows that his <hi>Aſſurance</hi> if he hath <hi>any,</hi> can be only the <hi>Aſſurance of Works.</hi> Now that there can be no ſuch Thing as the <hi>Aſſurance of Works,</hi> or <hi>Aſſurance</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>only</hi> from the Obſervation of our good Frames, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005568_0029_10186AA5F11D0B38"/>good Duties, is evident enough from this ſingle Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. That every Believer knows how <hi>unlike</hi> a Child of God he is <hi>ſometimes:</hi> And if he asks himſelf whether he who is <hi>ſometimes like</hi> a Child of God, and <hi>oftentimes unlike</hi> one, be really a true Child of God, or elſe only a reformed Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite; the moſt he can arrive to <hi>this Way</hi> will be a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> that his State <hi>may</hi> be good. This Thing muſt needs be ſo: And if it is ſo, then it will follow, that though a Man hath never ſo much of <hi>their</hi> Faith, and withal <hi>abounds</hi> in good Works, he can't hereby come to any <hi>Aſſurance:</hi> And if Faith and Works together will not bring <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> I know not what will; all Men muſt live and die <hi>without</hi> it. The <hi>ſmall</hi> Agreement therefore which there is between theſe Men and the Apoſtles, is <hi>too much</hi> for <hi>their</hi> Principles to bear: to be conſiſtent with themſelves, they muſt deny even the <hi>Poſſibility of Aſſurance.</hi> The <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>PERKINS</hi> (in his <hi>Treatiſe of Conſcience</hi>) ſaith, <q>That the Queſtion between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is, Whether a Man in this Life, may ordinarily, without Revelation, be infallibly certain of his own Salvation? — <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, hold this for a clear and evident Truth, but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> deny it wholly.</q> Hear what <hi>LUTHER</hi> ſaith. <q>I have uſed, ſaith he, many Words to declare that a Chriſtian muſt aſſure himſelf that <hi>HE</hi> is in the Favour of God—that we may learn to reject and utterly abandon that Deviliſh Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which taught, that a Man ought to be uncertain, and to ſtand in Doubt of the Favour of God towards <hi>HIM</hi> —<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>Is not <hi>this</hi> therefore enough to ſpoil the Credit of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Faith (if only <hi>this</hi> could be ſaid againſt it) that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains Men by neceſſary Conſequence to deny the Doctrine of Aſſurance, which the Bible is every where beſpangled with? And, is it not clear from hence, that <hi>true</hi> Faith is of a <hi>particular</hi> Nature, whereby every one believes Chriſt to be <hi>his</hi> Saviour, and hath juſt ſo much <hi>Aſſurance</hi> as he hath Faith?</p>
               <p>Nor, doth this Account of juſtifying Faith at all derogate from the Honour which the Scriptures put upon good Works, in making them <hi>evidential</hi> of a Man's good Eſtate. Indeed when a poor Sinner believes to Salvation, he looks upon God in Chriſt to be his Friend (according to his Word) without ſeeing any good Thing in himſelf; for before Faith there can be none: But a Man can never determine that he <hi>hath</hi> believ'd, and is <hi>paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> without ſeeing the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Faith in himſelf; becauſe <hi>if any Man is in Chriſt Jeſus, he is a new Creature.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. Obſerving this Change in our ſelves, is what the Apoſtle, in Rom. 8.16, calls the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of our <hi>own Spirits;</hi> and our looking upon God in Chriſt, to be our <hi>Friend,</hi> which we are enabled to by his Spirit, is in the ſame Verſe, called the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of <hi>his Spirit:</hi> So that in Order to our being <hi>quite ſure,</hi> that our <hi>State</hi> is good, there muſt be <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> and God muſt be <hi>one</hi> of them: By <hi>his Spirit witneſſing with our Spirits, that we are his Children,</hi> we can be ſure, but <hi>no other Way.</hi> And this Aſſurance, is what I ſuppoſe all the Children of God expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience more, or leſs of: Beſides the Alteration they ſee in themſelves, and all rational Arguments they can bring to prove their Adoption, God ſometimes more eſpecially, <hi>ſhines</hi> into their Hearts, by the <hi>Spirit of Adoption;</hi> they ſee God as a reconciled God and Father, and hear him ſaying to them, Son, Daughter, be of good <hi>Cheer, your Sins are forgiven you,</hi> I have <hi>loved you with an everlaſting Lovingkindneſs;</hi> I will

O bleſſed God, pour out the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> upon them! Oh that all my Antagoniſts may have the <hi>full Aſſurance of Faith!</hi> Diſpute out <hi>thy</hi> Cauſe with them, by filling their Hearts brim-full of the Love of Chriſt: Let Aſſurance of thy Love quite ſpoil them for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting any more againſt <hi>Aſſurance.</hi>— But to return—This Witneſs of the Spirit, of which I have been ſpeaking, or Knowledge of our good Eſtate, <hi>partly,</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> ſhining immediately into our Hearts, is what is called <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> by almoſt all the Friends of a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Faith: And all theſe, whoſoever they be, are with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> utter Enemies to any <hi>genuine Aſſurance:</hi> If they talk <hi>for</hi> it, it muſt be, becauſe they don't underſtand their own Principles, or, which is worſe, becauſe <hi>by this Craft</hi> they <hi>have their Wealth,</hi> and keep up their Reputation among the People.</p>
               <p>And as for here and there one of the <hi>Generaliſts,</hi> who ſuppoſe one in a Thouſand are favour'd with the <hi>Witneſs of God's Spirit;</hi> if they are right in owning there is ſuch a Thing, they <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>wrong</hi> in ſuppoſing it to be <hi>ſo rare a Thing:</hi> Or, in other Words, they <hi>muſt</hi> deny entirely the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's Spirit,</hi> (as the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> with his Clergy, have lately done) or elſe own that every one hath this <hi>Witneſs of the Spirit</hi> in ſome Meaſure, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes ſaving Faith, and conſequently bid <hi>Adieu</hi> to that <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> and <hi>dark</hi> Faith which is ſo dear to them. For, not to inſiſt upon the Apoſtle's making it the <hi>common</hi> Privilege of Believers, to have <hi>the Spirit of God witneſſing with their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that they are the Children of God:</hi> (Though this is an Argument which I think it impoſſible for them to get over) Nor yet to <hi>dwell</hi> upon <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>otherwiſe</hi> Chriſt would <hi>leave</hi> Believers <hi>comfortleſs,</hi> it having been ſhewn that there is no <hi>rational</hi> Comfort without it: (which alſo is a Difficulty on <hi>their</hi> Side inſuperable:) I ſay, waving theſe Arguments; this Conſideration is of great Weight, viz.

               <p>A general Faith is an Enemy to <hi>true</hi> Repentance. That true Faith always produceth <hi>true</hi> Repentance, will be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all. Now <hi>true</hi> Repentance is Men's <hi>returning</hi> to God, as <hi>their God.</hi> Jer. 3.22. <hi>Behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord</hi> OUR GOD. And if this is <hi>true</hi> Repentance, a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Faith cannot be <hi>true</hi> Faith, for it will never <hi>produce</hi> this Repentance; becauſe when a Man hath only a <hi>general</hi> Faith, he never ſees God to be HIS GOD.</p>
               <p>What will a Generaliſt ſay here? He can't deny this to be <hi>true</hi> Repentance; and by owning this to be <hi>true</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he doth really own <hi>his</hi> Faith to be <hi>falſe</hi> Faith. To ſave it, he muſt be forced to <hi>create a new Thing</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">A general Faith puts Men upon inventing <hi>new</hi> Articles in Religion, a <hi>new</hi> Faith, a <hi>new</hi> Repentance, and indeed a <hi>new</hi> Bible, no more agreeable to the <hi>Word of God</hi> than the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                  </note>; He muſt ſay <q>there are <hi>two Sorts of true</hi> Repentance; and that tho' a Man <hi>truly</hi> repents when he ſees God to be <hi>his God,</hi> yet he <hi>may</hi> repent <hi>truly</hi> without <hi>any ſuch Diſcovery,</hi> and <hi>always doth ſo at firſt.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My Bible don't teach me this Divinity; it aſſerts, there is a <hi>Repentance unto Life,</hi> and ſuppoſeth there is a Repentance <hi>not</hi> unto Life: But as to there being <hi>two Sorts</hi> of <hi>Repentance unto Life, eſſentially</hi> different, as they <hi>muſt</hi> be, if the <hi>one</hi> is produced by a Man's ſeeing God to be <hi>his</hi> God, and the <hi>other</hi> without <hi>any ſuch Diſcovery:</hi> This Divinity, I ſay, is what I never could find in <hi>my</hi> Bible; nor could they find it in <hi>theirs</hi> were it not that <hi>they want</hi> it, and <hi>can't poſſibly do without it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if they will inſiſt upon it that it is in <hi>their</hi> Bibles: I would ask them what becomes of their <hi>Calviniſm</hi> all the while? <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Bible was the ſame with mine: He never was quick-ſighted enough to find any <hi>ſuch</hi> Repentance in <hi>his</hi> Bible: On the contrary, he ſaith boldly, <q>

               <p>A general Faith makes a Man an Oppoſer of the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi> and <hi>experimental</hi> Religion in the Place where he lives, and as far as he hath any Influence.</p>
               <p>If a Man preacheth this Faith, his People are likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main eaſy and unmov'd; for almoſt every one hath gotten this Faith; Or however it appears ſo eaſy a Thing to get it, that no one is likely to be much concern'd about it.</p>
               <p>Or, if People ſhould by <hi>any</hi> Means be under ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions; let them but believe what the Miniſter preaches to be true, and their Convictions will ſoon die away.</p>
               <p>For, when a Man is under ſtrong Convictions, he don't doubt but Chriſt is a <hi>general</hi> Saviour: what he wants is, to ſee Chriſt to be <hi>his</hi> Saviour: And if the Miniſter can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him there is no Need of <hi>this,</hi> the Man grows eaſy and hath <hi>Peace,</hi> though God hath no Peace for him.</p>
               <p>Or, if any of a Miniſter's Hearers ſhould get a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>aſſured</hi> Faith, notwithſtanding all the Warnings they had heard againſt it; If in the Midſt of their Diſtreſs and Deſpair of helping themſelves, the All-ſufficiency of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be diſcover'd to them by the Spirit of God, making them cry out, at leaſt in their Hearts, <hi>My Lord, and my God!</hi> the Miniſter muſt tell them (and others too) that they are deluded. And accordingly, it is obſervable, that in a late <hi>Declaration</hi> of Miniſters, <hi>ſuch</hi> Converts are ſuppoſed to be deluded; they give Thanks only for the Converſions of thoſe who had no <hi>ſuch particular</hi> Faith, i. e. in my real Judgment, <hi>only for the Converſions of thoſe who never were converted.</hi>

               <p>This is what leads the <hi>Van</hi> in Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s invincible <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada,</hi> and in which thoſe who are <hi>likeminded</hi> ſeem moſt to glory: but to glory in this, is to glory in a <hi>Thing of nought;</hi> for it only confutes an Opinion which <hi>we</hi> hold not, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, <hi>viz.</hi> that all Men ſhould be preſſed to believe Chriſt and Forgiveneſs are <hi>theirs,</hi> i. e. <hi>in Poſſeſſion:</hi> What <hi>we</hi> hold is that all Men ſhould be <hi>preſſed to believe</hi> that Chriſt and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs are <hi>theirs,</hi> not <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005568_0035_10186AB395963AD8"/>'tis the not attending to this juſt Diſtinction, which gives Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s Argument all the Credit it hath in the World.</p>
               <p>To preſs all Men to believe that Chriſt and Forgiveneſs are <hi>theirs,</hi> i. e. <hi>in Right</hi> and by God's <hi>Grant,</hi> is ſo far from preſſing them to <hi>believe a Lie,</hi> that it is preſſing them to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a great Goſpel-Truth,</hi> or rather the <hi>Truth of the Goſpel.</hi> For, <hi>What ſaith the Scripture?</hi> Why, <hi>that God ſent his Son to be the Saviour of the World;</hi> (Joh. 4.14.) that <hi>he gave him for a Covenant of the People, and for a Light to the Gentiles;</hi> (Iſa.42.6.) that <hi>whoſoever will may come, and take of the Waters of Life freely,</hi> (Rev. 22.17.) Nay, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the Ends of the Earth,</hi> Iſai. 45.22.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe and ſuch like Declarations ſhew us that Chriſt is <hi>by Office,</hi> whatever he is <hi>in the Event, the Saviour of every Man:</hi> that one Man hath as much <hi>Right</hi> as another to <hi>lay hold on eternal Life,</hi> and that <hi>all</hi> Men are <hi>warranted</hi> and <hi>commanded</hi> ſo to do in the Word of God. The Matter may be illuſtrated in the following Manner. — Suppoſe a King, in Conſideration of his Son's <hi>Mediation</hi> in behalf of certain condemned Traitors, obliges himſelf to beſtow his Pardon and Favour upon thoſe who will come to him, and receive ſuch Kindneſs at his Hands, — Have not all thoſe Traitors a <hi>Right,</hi> and one juſt as good a <hi>Right</hi> as another to the King's Pardon and Favour? And would it be abſurd in any one to preſs them to believe they had ſuch a <hi>Right,</hi> and to make uſe of it? And if any ſtood out, while it was too late and miſs'd of it, would not their <hi>Blood be upon their own Heads?</hi> moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have Life,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, John 5.40. i. e. Eternal Life is <hi>yours,</hi> by God's Grant, but ye will not accept of it, and ſo <hi>muſt</hi> periſh!</p>
               <p>Tho' there is a ſecret <hi>Decree</hi> of God, yet this Matter ſhould be conſider'd <hi>abſtractly,</hi> as if there were none at all: I mean, we ſhould not <hi>limit</hi> God's <hi>Grant</hi> by any <hi>Decree.</hi> Accordingly it is obſervable, that tho' the Apoſtle fully believed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, yet they preached Chriſt and Salvation by him as <hi>freely</hi> as if they knew every one of their Hearers to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. Thus have I fairly diſmiſs'd this Argument by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it confutes not what we maintain, but only what we abhor as well as they.</p>
               <p>However, if the Objecters are not quite weaned from it, I would mention one thing more which will ſpoil it forever for <hi>their Uſe;</hi> and that is, it concludes as ſtrongly againſt <hi>their</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005568_0036_10186AB780ECE870"/>Faith as it doth againſt <hi>ours:</hi> Nay, it concludes againſt all Faith but the Faith of <hi>Devils</hi> and thoſe who are in <hi>Deſpair,</hi> whoſe Faith is that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is really the Saviour of Sinners, but they have no Lot nor Inheritance in him.</hi> I ſay this <hi>Dreadful</hi> Faith, is what alone can ſtand the Force of this Argument: for, as <hi>we</hi> preſs all Men to a <hi>particular</hi> Faith that Chriſt and his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are <hi>theirs,</hi> they preſs all Men to a <hi>general</hi> Belief of the ſame Thing: Neither <hi>we</hi> nor <hi>they</hi> are free from preſſing them to expect <hi>ſome</hi> Benefit by Chriſt, whereas <hi>moſt</hi> Men not being elected will receive <hi>no</hi> Benefit by him: So that even they themſelves, by their own Argument, <hi>preſs moſt Men to believe a Lie.</hi>

               <p>The Truth is, Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s ſecond Argument, (like his firſt) is a <hi>meer Sophiſm;</hi> it confutes only this Opinion, <hi>viz. That all that is eſſential to ſaving Faith is to believe Chriſt and

               <p>But, being convinc'd of <hi>this,</hi> the Scales fall from their Eyes, the <hi>glorious Goſpel</hi> ſhines into their Souls, and they ſee the Truth of <hi>ſuch</hi> Declarations of <hi>free Grace,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that though they are <hi>ſo bad,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>nevertheleſs theirs,</hi> and Forgiveneſs <hi>theirs.</hi> I ſay, <hi>Conſequently:</hi> For 'tis impoſſible any one ſhould receive the <hi>free</hi> Declarations of the Goſpel <hi>as the Word of God,</hi> and yet be <hi>in the Dark</hi> about his <hi>own Soul:</hi> For he that believes the <hi>Chief of Sinners</hi> are welcome, <hi>can't help</hi> ſeeing that <hi>he</hi> is welcome: He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily believes God <hi>juſtifieth</hi> the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> can't queſtion God's Favour to <hi>him</hi> though <hi>ungodly:</hi> In a Word, Sin being the only Thing which makes any jealous of the Love of God; when they ſee this <hi>Wall of Partition broken down,</hi> ſo that Sin is <hi>no Impediment at all,</hi> but Sinners are in as good a Caſe as if they had never ſin'd, having <hi>ſuch an High Prieſt;</hi> I ſay, when Men ſee <hi>this</hi> (and they always ſee this, only when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is <hi>hid</hi> from them) they can't be jealous of the Love of God towards <hi>them.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> meant that that cannot be the Eſſence of <hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> which is not always conſtant and abiding ſo long as a Man is a Believer, at leaſt, <hi>in Habit;</hi> his <hi>major</hi> Propoſition is an undoubted Truth: To ſuppoſe orherwiſe, would be to ſuppoſe a Man might be a <hi>true Believer,</hi> and an Unbeliever too at the ſame Time. But then, what will become of his minor? viz. That <hi>the particular Perſwaſion and Aſſurance that Chriſt is mine, is not always abiding ſo much as in Habit as long as I am a Believer.</hi> For a Ceſſation of <hi>Acts</hi> will by no Means prove there is <hi>no Habit</hi> remaining.</p>
               <p>The Men with whom I have to do, will grant that a Man may be ſaid to have been a <hi>true</hi> Lover of God for many Years together, tho' a great Part of his Time God was not <hi>in his Thoughts,</hi> and when he did think of him, he generally look'd upon, and fear'd him as an Enemy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>all that Time,</hi> there was the <hi>Habit</hi> of Love which would have been drawn forth into delightful <hi>Acts,</hi> had the Lets and Hindrances been taken away. I ſay thoſe who are for a <hi>general</hi> Faith, and yet are any Thing like <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts</hi> will grant this: And <hi>this</hi> is, in Effect, to grant there may be the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> in a Man, tho' by Reaſon of <hi>Lets</hi> and Hindrances from the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> this <hi>Habit</hi> may be very ſeldom drawn forth into <hi>Acts,</hi> eſpecially <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> Acts from which all doubting is remov'd.</p>

For, let the Eſſence of ſaving Faith, lie in what it will; in believing Chriſt to be a <hi>general,</hi> or a <hi>particular</hi> Saviour, good Men when exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with Atheiſtical Thoughts (not to mention other Impediments) don't believe him to be any Saviour at all.

               <p>This is one of Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s moſt plauſible Arguments.

                  </gap> to be fair Reaſoning: And if it is, then it is plain that all the Support which any have without ſeeing Chriſt to be <hi>their</hi> Saviour, and <hi>Forgiveneſs theirs,</hi> is only a Support of their <hi>own Righteouſneſs;</hi> and conſequently that this Argument of Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s alſo, eſtabliſhes the Faith he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deſtroy by it; and we may conclude it to be <hi>true</hi> Faith, becauſe it doth not, like <hi>theirs,</hi> ſpeak any Comfort to Men while they lean upon their <hi>own Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I diſmiſs this Argument, I would obſerve that 'tis calculated, as much againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> as if Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> had had <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Eye, and intended a Confutation of him.—<hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, that <q>the Conſciences of the faithful when the <hi>Affiance</hi> of their Juſtification before God is to be ſought, ſhould raiſe themſelves above the Law, and forget the whole Righteouſneſs of the Law, and lay aſide all thinking upon Works. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Inſt.

                  </q> But <hi>this</hi> Divinity Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Argument, and what he ſaith <hi>upon it,</hi> makes to be Hereſy: <hi>He</hi> would have diſtreſſed Souls <hi>keep cloſe to the Law,</hi> and not forget the Righteouſneſs of it: He would have others comfort them with Marks and Signs (by which Means they are often comforted into Hell) though the poor Souls don't ſee that Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>their</hi> Saviour, and that all his Benefits belong to <hi>them.</hi> And yet Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> was a <hi>Calviniſt!</hi> Nay, the <hi>Generality</hi> ſo

            <p>Methinks I hear ſome poor Souls ſaying: <q>If we had a Thouſand Worlds, we would part with them all, for this <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of which you are ſpeaking.</q> I anſwer; I wiſh you were willing to have it <hi>for Nothing:</hi> Do but let go your own Righteouſneſs, and I dare pawn my Soul, that you ſhall have it before I have done ſpeaking with you. <hi>Come now, let us reaſon together:</hi> What is the Difficulty, what is the <hi>Wall of Partition</hi> that lies in the Way to your having <hi>Aſſurance?</hi> Is it that you are old Sinners, great Sinners, <hi>Sinners againſt God exceedingly?</hi> Why, my dear Friends, Sin is <hi>no Impediment</hi> at all; you have no more Reaſon to doubt of God's good Will towards you, than if you had never ſinn'd, you are in as good a Caſe as if you had never offended him, in Thought, in Word, or in Deed, <hi>having ſuch an High-Prieſt:</hi> Though your Sins <hi>have abounded,</hi> the Grace of God hath <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded much more;</hi> though your Sins have reached unto the very Heavens, the Mercy of God in Chriſt is <hi>above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> Indeed, was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> but a <hi>little</hi> Saviour, there would be good Reaſon for <hi>great</hi> Sinners to be afraid; nay, I my ſelf ſhould not have one Thought of being ſaved by him. But he is a <hi>great</hi> Saviour, <hi>able to ſave unto the uttermoſt,</hi> I know him to be ſuch a Saviour, and therefore, I, though a <hi>great</hi> Sinner, though the <hi>Chief of Sinners,</hi> am not afraid to venture my Soul upon him: And if I had all your Souls to take Care of, I would <hi>this Moment</hi> venture them all upon <hi>him,</hi> without one Doubt of his being willing to ſave them.</p>
            <p>And every Doubt you have of Chriſt's Willingneſs, is only doubting whether he is a <hi>great</hi> Saviour, and whether the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:005568_0045_10186ACFB2C81B58"/>of God is true, which ſaith that he hath in <hi>Chriſt given eternal Life to you:</hi> 1 Joh. 5.11. So that hereby, you make God a Liar and Jeſus Chriſt but a <hi>little</hi> Saviour, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſerve to be ſent to Hell for every Doubt you have. <q>Don't think to excuſe your ſelves, by ſaying you don't doubt of <hi>God's Faithfulneſs,</hi> nor of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Ability</hi> to ſave Sinners, but that all the Difficulty lies in believing that ſuch Sinners as you, are really <hi>qualified</hi> to be ſav'd by him.</q> This is only deceiving your own Hearts, or rather, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the <hi>Deceitfulneſs</hi> of your own Hearts: For inſtead of doubting whether <hi>you</hi> are <hi>qualified</hi> to be ſav'd by Chriſt, you are only doubting whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>qualified</hi> to ſave <hi>you:</hi> Did you but <hi>ſee him qualified,</hi> you could not help ſeeing <hi>yourſelves qualified;</hi> it being impoſſible that any one ſhould queſtion whether <hi>he</hi> is <hi>qualified</hi> to be ſav'd by a Saviour who is <hi>willing</hi> as well as <hi>able,</hi> to ſave the very <hi>Chief of Sinners,</hi> juſt as they are, before there is any <hi>Alteration</hi> in them. Your Want of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> therefore is founded upon this very Thing, viz. Your having a mean Opinion of him whom <hi>Man deſpiſeth, and the Nations abhor;</hi> you dare not ſtand before God, in his Name <hi>as Sinners,</hi> but only as Saints: Whereas did you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in your Hearts, that he was able to ſave to the <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,</hi> you could not help ſeeing <hi>in him</hi> a Saviour for <hi>your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> And though you knew you deſerved to be ſent to Hell, you could not have one Doubt, of the Mercy and Lovingkindneſs of God towards <hi>you.</hi> And O that God would anoint your Eyes <hi>with Eye-ſalve,</hi> that the <hi>glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> which <hi>ſhines</hi> round about you; might <hi>ſhine</hi> into your Souls: That you might ſee <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be your Saviour, and by the <hi>Sight</hi> be transformed into his Likeneſs. I ſay <hi>transformed into his Likeneſs:</hi> For one can't ſee the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, without being <hi>like</hi> him, when the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> of God our Saviour appears to <hi>us,</hi> it <hi>always renews us in the Spirit of our Minds,</hi> making us as Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled and ſeparate from Sinners:</hi> Which <hi>precious Faith,</hi> God of his infinite Mercy, grant may be vouchſafed to every one of my Readers for Jeſus Chriſt his Sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
