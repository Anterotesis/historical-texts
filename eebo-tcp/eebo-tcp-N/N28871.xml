            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE moſt celebrated writers of former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have happily illuſtrated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended intereſting and important truths by allegory, or fable; and by their agreeable manner in the figurative ſtyle, have ever been highly acceptable. Through thoſe ſilvery channels, eſſential truths have been propitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed, which were very unlikely to have been otherwiſe ſo cordially entertained. As ſuch a method of writing hath always prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both pleaſing and inſtructive, it is highly probable it will be continued in practice thro' ſucceeding ages. The introduction of imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inary beings hath, perhaps ſome degree of propriety in the ſcenes preſented in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing memoirs, which are laid in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions where the moſt ſtupendous fabulous le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends originated. If fable hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo ſucceſsfully employed (as both ſacred and profane hiſtory appear to evince) for the inſtruction and entertainment of mankind;—if trees have been ſummoned to ſpeak; the floods to lift up their voice; and the various orders of inferior exiſtences, in language in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, to rebuke and reform;—if a proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's madneſs hath been corrected by a moral leſſon from his inſulted beaſt; the vicious and cruel reprehended and reclaimed by talking birds and ſinging trees; why may not adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or even riper years, be ſtill in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſciplined? Doth the mighty Hercules come forward, in ancient ſtory, with his tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038495_0003_10122C62CC1AF408"/>
club, to arreſt the progreſs of thoſe baleful monſters which diſturbed the peace of ſociety; why ſhall not a Prince of China, in a later age, advance upon the theatre of the world, though with leſs formidable weapons than was that of the redoubtable hero;—with victorious eloquence and alluring manners to correct and reform the raſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and untutored, and reſtore the hapleſs wanderer to the paths of true virtue and honor, and conſequent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; and, having atchieved the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exploits, eſtabliſh a grand ſociety cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by love? As then, the deſign of fable is agreeably to convey the moſt ſalutary truths that they may be effectually impreſſed upon the minds of thoſe readers who are apt to be diſguſted with dry treatiſes of morality; let it ſtill be permitted to lend its benevolent aid for our entertainment and inſtruction, till the expected aera fully arrives when genuine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed truth ſhall ſhine forth with charms ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceding the neceſſity of the faſcinating blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments of fictitious tales. However, the works of imagination, when ſubſervient to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and virtue, will never fail to be admired.</p>
            <p>The Author of the ſubſequent Memoirs looks for no other commendation than that which is merited by an honeſt attempt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, to the utmoſt of his ſlender abilities, the real felicity of his country and mankind. He thinks of his talent at compoſition as far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe of the worthy and excellent writers of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038495_0004_10122C64E2B72178"/>
an age highly improved, and advancing in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection before unknown; an age prégnant with great, and he hopes, happy events. His country may well boaſt the literary produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of eminent eſſayiſts of both ſexes: and, to the riſing generation, it is indeed a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting circumſtance, that female literary merit hath preſented ſo brilliant an addition to our national glory.—Happy talents, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, are confeſſedly thine! How ſweetly pleads thy pen in virtue's ſacred cauſe! with ſentiments ennobling, pathetic and ſublime, winning each ſelfiſh heart to charity and love! Columbia's ſons and daughters, whoſe virtues are her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhall never ceaſe to bleſs thee! future ages ſhall grateful own thy worth; and ſay, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels would write like thee! Had mines of gold been thine; and hadſt thou, with the generous patriotiſm thou haſt ſo eloquently commended, diſpenſed them for the public weal; they had been but trifles, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the rich, invaluable preſents<note n="*" place="bottom">The GLEANER, in three volumes, whoſe uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon merits, the numerous and reſpectable ſubſcribers of all ranks, moſt expreſſively proclaim.</note> thou haſt made to thy country! Who can refrain from nobleſt deeds of charity, when Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſolicits with ſofteſt moving accents;—when, with eloquence inimitably charming, angelic, ſhe intreats! when, with richeſt and moſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

colouring, ſhe preſents the lovely por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of philanthropy divine; or, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtleſs magic power of her feathery wand, ſhe calls forth every tender, every generous em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otion of the ſoul! ever memorable will be the conqueſts of thy powerful rhetoric! The moſt obdurate hath it melted to compaſſion. Even the heart of the churliſh niggard hath learned of thee to feel the ſympathetic glow! The ſelf-deſtroying children of intemperance have thy perſuaſive pages awakened to ſobriety and frugality! Painful were their efforts againſt vicious habits long indulged. But it is thou who haſt taught them to realiſe the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous conſequence of ſpeedy reform. 'Tis thou who inſpiredſt them with augmented fortitude, from the full conviction, that the more painful their virtuous ſtruggles, the more glorious their victory would prove, and the more exquiſitely reliſhed the enſuing bliſs! It is thou, too, who haſt dignified thy ſex. To thee is it highly indebted for thy excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vindication of its rights, aſcertaining its importance, and celebrating its ſhining vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. If thou art ſtill an inhabitant of the earth, long mayſt thou, live illuſtrious amid thy worthy competitors for Heaven—approving fame, who with thee adorn and enrich our country and mankind! Happy American States! ſo richly adorned with ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of refined genius and exalted virtue! happy in thy illuſtrious chiefs, ſtatesmen and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038495_0006_10122C69E78E9258"/>
legiſlators, whoſe fame reſounds through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry region of the globe! in thy civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberties, and the means of every valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able improvement! happy in thy rich and powerful reſources! firm and unſhaken be thy union, and impervious to every violence! and by thy growing exemplary virtues, accelerate the deſtined day of univerſal harmony and love. Be thine the glory of exhibiting to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the value of freedom; and of all thoſe graces and virtues which conſtitute the true dignity and happineſs of man!</p>
            <p>The Author hath attempted under the guiſe of amuſement, to inſtill thoſe active principles of piety, virtue and benevolence, which never fail of inſuring, to all who are influenced by them, the real and the moſt exquiſite enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life;—thoſe principles which are the only and ſure foundation of civil, ſocial and domeſtic felicity. It is his hearty wiſh that thouſands of pens, and every tongue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oquence may be inceſſantly employed (co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating with the brighteſt examples) in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerating the expected aera of univerſal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, when the ſigh of miſery ſhall forever ceaſe from the habitations of men.—A juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Deity, and a general convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, among all ranks, of our miſerable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and incapacity, as to the true enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of exiſtence; and application to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with unreſerved confidence in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodneſs, love and tender compaſſion,

precedes and introduces the happy period which every heart deſires, when darkneſs and fears, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and diſtreſs ſhall be no more.

            <p>IN that charming ſeaſon of the year, when ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature dreſſed in all its lovelineſs, preſents the moſt enchanting ſcenes;—the philoſophic and contemplative Nytan, Prince of China, had retired with ſeveral ſelect friends, whoſe minds were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial with his own, that they might enjoy the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries of ſpring, in a delightful retreat he had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few miles from the metropolis. It was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs romantically ſituated, almoſt encompaſſed by rocky precipices and woods, and a very high wall extending to the ſea ſhore. His building was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the moſt elegant rural taſte, containing a variety of beautiful and well furniſhed apartments. It was ſituated on a gradually riſing ground, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from its windows the moſt delightful and pictureſque ſcenes; not in the leaſt, incommoded by a number of trees nearly adjoining, which tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered gay and majeſtic, and whoſe wide ſpreading branches, tempering the ſun's meridian rays, waved over the lofty roofs. Among thoſe ſelect friends were his amiable ſiſters, with each a friend of their own ſex, beautiful and highly accompliſhed, poſſeſſed of congenial minds, exalted by nature, and refined by education. Here they enjoyed alternately the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime pleaſure of ſocial converſe, ſtudy, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation—ſometimes in delicious walks; at others,

reclined in ſome choſen ſpot on the ſoft and verdant turf; or viewing the diversified ſcenes from an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated rock amid the ſportive lambs. All the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variety of feathered ſongſters ſeemed to be here. collected on purpoſe to regale them with their ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and animated notes. Philoſophic and elevated minds, like theirs, could not fail of enjoying the pleaſures of ſo romantic and charming a receſs with the moſt exquiſite reliſh.</p>
            <p>The Emperor and Empreſs ſometimes graced this lovely retreat with their preſence; which fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to yield an highly augmented addition to its pleaſures. Here their beloved and affectionate daughters were happy indeed. In the company of their fond brother, and two worthy Mandarins, his moſt endeared friends, and who had gained the hearts of the two ſiſters by the moſt tendereſt aſſiduities. They were nearly arrived to that age when every charm expands. Their minds formed with native genius and worth were greatly improved by ſtudy and reflection, and every parental and fraternal attention. Happy lovers! ſanctioned as ſuch by the parents and relatives of each party, to enjoy, in this undiſturbed ſeclusion from the cares of life, and the hurry of buſineſs, the ſoothing, the enrapturing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the fair miſtreſſes of their affections, to aid their ſtudies in the various branches of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they were delightfully exploring! Sweetly glid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the golden hours; and every ſucceeding ſun aroſe to preſent them with new pleaſures! What matter of deep regret that ſuch felicity ſhould be interrupted by any adverſe occurrence! yet ſuch was the appointed deſtiny. The Prince was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, one day, from this delicious retirement, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his father at court. He took leave of the little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting aſſembly, with the promiſe of a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. But it was a promiſe which Heaven had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038495_0010_10122C72857775B8"/>
ſhould never be fulfilled. A long, an afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparation that moment commenced from the deareſt friends of his tender and affectionate heart. He had but lately returned from an important tour through the Empire; and had flattered himself with the ſublimeſt enjoyments of the vernal ſeason with thoſe friends, in a temporary ſeclusion from the reſt of the world. The iniquitous cauſe of his being curtailed of thoſe enjoyments, and the ſurpriſing ſucceeding events, I proceed to unfold.</p>
            <p>RENIEN had reigned till this eventful period, one of the happieſt ſovereigns that ever adorned the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious throne of the vaſt empire of China. Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the love and eſteem of his ſubjects, poſſeſſed of conſummate wiſdom and prudence, a tender and generous heart, his virtues diffuſed ſerenity and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity every where around him. Through nations, far and near, his fame was celebrated for innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able great and good actions. The miſeries of pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and oppreſſion were ſcarcely known, in China, in his propitious days:—Propitious tranquil and ſerene,—till now—towards the cloſe of his life (for no earthly bliſs is alloted unexceptionably perfect;) when the ſecret ambitious and too ſucceſsful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of Sanden one of his chief minsiſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſturb his repoſe, threatening the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſorganization of the Empire. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and growing virtues of his only ſon, Prince Nytan, were too much for the envious heart of that miniſter to endure? who, however ſpecious his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, was an inveterate enemy to the good, and, it was by the profoundeſt diſſimulation only, that he had maintained his place at court, or any degree of reſpect among mankind. He therefore employed every wicked art to fix an indelible ſtain of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hue upon the reputation of the Prince,—to blaſt the faireſt character for loyalty, virtue and probity;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038495_0011_10122C7414186CA8"/>
and to effect a period to thoſe wiſe and benevolent ſchemes for the public weal, in the forming and proſecution of which, the ſon acted in concert with his royal parent. "If, ſaid the plotting Sanden to himſelf, I can accompliſh the diſgrace of the Prince and his adherents—if I can procure them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled, if not deſtroyed; as the Emperor is now in the decline of life, and numbers are oppoſed to his virtues and political views, who will unite with me in the perfecting my deſigns; I ſhall ſoon be in a fair way of obtaining the ſovereign power, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying pleaſures uncontrouled." To accompliſh his black ſcheme of villainy, whilſt the prince was abſent on his tour, (which was near fourteen months) he had ſecretly promoted an inſurrection in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant part of the empire, and had laid his plans ſo ſucceſsfully, as to render it, an indubitable fact to millions, that the Prince was its chief promoter;—that he had perſuaded many of great influence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect the minds of the people towards the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, as imposed on by intriguing courtiers, who were aiming under the maſk of friendſhip, at a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution, This ſcheme ſo far ſucceeded that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror iſſued orders to apprehend his ſon: and his being ſent for to court was only a trick of Sanden's, to effect his confinement without alarming his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and powerful friends in the receſs; who there waited, indeed, a long time, with the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, for his promiſed return! Before he had reached Pekin, he was ſeized by Sanden's ſoldiers, and hurried away to an old caſtle on the ſea coaſts, amidſt craggy rocks, and gloomy woods; a place wholly at the diſpoſal and command of that wicked miniſter, as were its gloomy inhabitants of fiends and murderers. Such were the effects of the cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff's calumnious lies.—Vile ſlanderer! Inhuman perpetrator of the fouleſt miſchief! Ingrateful mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038495_0012_10122C767AE32648"/>
of the pureſt fame, and betrayer of innocence the moſt ſpotleſs and perfect! What dreadful pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment can atone for thy unparralelled outrage to virtue and friendſhip, loyalty and patriotiſm! A ſlanderer—an incendiary—a traitor and betrayer.—What character can be deemed more infamous, more pernicious than thine; the ſlanderer is indeed the worſt of murderers. He over whelms the univerſe with miſchiefs and deaths! He is an aſſaſsſin who ſtabs in the dark; who deſtroys his neighbour's peace and felicity by depriving him of his good name, of his affectionate friends, far dearer to him than life: and yet vile and pernicious as is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ſlanderer, how many thouſands are there, in regions called civilized, to whom it may be too juſtly imputed; and in which the defamer is every where heard, and the tongues of miſchief are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually fomenting diſcord in every family, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſociety. Are they the ſons of reaſon, are they reflecting beings, who, profeſſing the greateſt of virtues, are guilty of the worſt of vices, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like Sanden, with ſpecious pretentions to real goodneſs, are undermining the friends of virtue, and the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iours of mankind, that vice, anarchy and ruin may reign triumphant! Ah! barbarous deſtroyer of the peace and felicity of thy unſuſpecting friends! Such offences as thine are indeed of the blackeſt hue! but vengeance, juſt vengeance purſues thee! dread darkneſs and dire deſpair are on the way to arreſt thee, and thy enormous crimes ſhall affright and torture thy guilty ſoul!</p>
            <p>Too often does it happen that the wiſe are fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived—the wiſe the generous and the good—by the ſpecious the inſidious friend. It is a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of momentous inſtruction! It ſhould rouſe us to be more effectually on our guard; and it ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038495_0013_10122C7927AB0F50"/>
likewiſe inſtruct us to be more conſtantly dependent on the heavenly power. It is not in vain that we are ſuffered to feel the cruel effects of deception, of fallacious friendſhip. They are deſigned to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us more invariably ſenſible where our ſafety lies, to attach us more firmly to the celeſtial, the all-powerful the unchangeable FRIEND.—O happy expected age of perfection! when the great and the wiſe ſhall confide, unreſervedly, in the ſource of wiſdom, and nations reſt on the Almighty arm!</p>
            <p>The ſolitary ſituation, of the Caſtle in which the Prince was confined, was well adapted to the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's infamous deſign. No habitations were adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to it, only a few miſerable huts of miſerable inhabitants; and the frightful reports of its being occupied by evil ſpirits, deterred the poor wretches, oppreſſed as they were by Sanden (on whoſe lands they but barely exiſted) as well as many others, from invading its precincts, or advancing under its moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering walls. In this dreary building was the Prince immured, in a ſmall paltry detached cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with a boy only to attend him. An oath was impoſed on him not to ſtir from his chamber but by ſpecial leave from the Emperor, and not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt an eſcape from his priſon. For his enemies were ſenſible that their ſtrongeſt guards, and wiſeſt precautions might poſſibly be defeated. The boy, who was devoted to Sanden, and bribed very high, was to ſleep with him for greater ſecurity. A guard, likewiſe, was ſtationed, and ſtrongly intereſted to prevent the priſoner's reſcue, though his oath was ſufficient ſecurity, with whom it was truly ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and inviolable, though impoſed againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and humanity. Yet all theſe precautions failed to compoſe the fearful and guilty mind of Sanden A wicked magician had taught the miniſter his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments; by the power of which he imagined
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038495_0014_10122C7B41B368D8"/>
he had rendered the caſtle inacceſſible to all but his depraved minions, and the Prince's confinement moſt effectual againſt any art or ſtratagems of his own. The Prince however, was far ſuperior to him in magic ſkill; though he diſdained the uſe of it to diſhonorable purposes.—But thus it ever is with the wicked, guilty mind. Fearful and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful, it calls in every aid, to impoſe on itſelf; adding guilt to guilt, crime to crime, outrage to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; it enlarges the ſtructure of its villainies; till the pondrous load, unable to ſupport itſelf on its iniquitous baſis falls, and cruſhes the builder in its ruin!—</p>
            <p>[The hiſtorians of <hi>Xuntien,</hi> who wrote Memoirs of <hi>Ravenzer,</hi> (the nation celebrated in the following books;) do indeed give a different account of the Prince's misfortune, and of the great events that followed it: One aſſerting that he was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baniſhed to a deſolate iſland; where, finding a few men who had been ſhipwrecked, he united with them and a great number of his countrymen who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his fortune, in forming a government for themſelves. By this hiſtorian a variety of matters are related reſpecting the iſland and its inhabitants, and events there in the courſe of a hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, when the inhabitants were increaſed to three hundred thouſand. Nothing is ſaid of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful magical operations, or of the Prince's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with a ſuperior order of beings. It is only remarked, that the Prince, in his earlier years, was faſcinated by the charms of <hi>occult ſcience,</hi> and the converſation of magicians; but that he, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, thought very differently of theſe men, and their art, which may be indeed a ſtate of the matter neareſt to probability. <hi>Zerrinn</hi> aſſerts that the Prince held converſe with, and was directed by Angels; and places the epoch of his exiſtence many ages
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038495_0015_10122C7CF9AC6F50"/>
back from that in which he is ſaid to have lived by the Hiſtorian of China, <hi>Reſhang,</hi> whom in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, I chiefly follow; as he is more particular on intereſting events, more entertaining, moral and ſentimental: and his <hi>Genuis</hi> and <hi>Fairies</hi> (which we denominate <hi>Angels,</hi>) were inceſſantly employed in the works of benevolence; and, on that account, muſt be pleaſing to every benevolent mind. With Reſhang, then I ſhall proceed in compoſing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Memoirs; though not without ſometimes regarding the other writers; eſpecially <hi>Long ſhang,</hi> who aſſerts, that the guardian Fairies and Genies, (or rather Angels,) of the Prince, indulged him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while in his fancied magical advantages; as though he thereby accompliſhed his enlargement from the caſtle, and many great things, which were in reality effected by them for benevolent purpoſes to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: But they afterwards undeceived him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming him in dependence on the Deity, for every aid and valuable gift.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>If <hi>Reſhang,</hi> through the incredible marvellous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces us to a grand ſociety of the truly virtuous, to a flouriſhing nation, influenced by the moſt liberal and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſentiments; our entertainment will be ſublime and intereſting, our philanthropy inſtructed, and our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rightly directed. From the fable we ſhall derive truth; and from the illuſtrious examples, an heavenly ambition to excel in every thing worthy of praiſe, and productive of felicity the moſt refined, exalted and permanent.</p>
                  <p>Since the tales of fiction are ſo greatly multiplied, ſo entertaining, and with ſuch avidity peruſed; I would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as harmleſs and uſeful as poſſible; and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, in the moſt engaging view, the moral of every one, guard the mind of the reader, while he is travelling through the regions of fancy, into the world of realities. In this manner eſcorted, he will attend me through the enſuing pages.</p>
               </note> But to reſume the ſtory of the Prince's confinement.]</p>
            <p>—Thus he ſeemed to be effectually ſecured in his little chamber; where, too, he was liable to ſuffer on account of his health through the failure
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038495_0016_10122C7F17C69BE0"/>
of proper exerciſe. Yet ſuch was the wiſdom and ſagacity of this young man, (for he had ſcarcely ſeen his nineteenth year) that he found means, without violating his oath, both to preſerve his health, and to free himſelf from the power of his enemy. The learning and ſcience he had acquired, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe for one of his years. As he grew up from infancy he diſcovered a ſurpriſing genius. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent parent had afforded him every advantage for the moſt finiſhed education, that could be derived from the beſt inſtructors; and he ſoon outſtripped his competitors in ſtudy, making the moſt rapid advances in all the branches of polite learning, and every accompliſhment that might render him ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, reſpectable and uſeful. Nature had formed him perfectly beautiful and graceful in his perſon. With an unaffected goodneſs of heart, he united the moſt engaging and winning addreſs, which, with his benevolent actions, had endeared him to all ranks of men. It can therefore be no matter of wonder, that the news of his impriſonment, and the pretended occaſion of it, awakened aſtoniſhment and the ſincereſt grief in every heart excepting that of the infamous author, and thoſe of the few aſſimilated to his vile character. His moſt powerful friends, among which where thoſe who had, at length, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to town from the receſs, vehemently remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to the Emperor againſt ſuch harſh treatment of his ſon, but in vain. He anſwered them, that he had obtained ſome of his incendiary letters;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038495_0017_10122C812C939348"/>
(which were indeed the forgeries of Sanden,) and that he could at preſent act no otherwiſe than he had done. He however felt the moſt poignant grief, (as well may be conceived on the account of a ſon ſo greatly beloved and admired by both his royal parents, as well as by every good citizen. The Empreſs his mother, his ſiſters, and his deareſt friends were inconſolable; but could prevail noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Prince's favour. The affliction of the Empreſs was almoſt too much for her to ſuſtain. A violent fever ſeized her; and her life was ſoon deemed to be in eminent danger. The friends of the Prince uſed every means, in their power, to detect the conſpiracies formed againſt him, and to diſperſe the ſtorm gathering over the Empire. But matters were ſo managed by Sanden, and the powers he had engaged on his ſide, that they could accompliſh but little. Ereng and Yerrie the diſconſolate ſiſters, were ever urging them to exertions in behalf of their beloved brother; ſo that they were at length, conſtrained to amuſe them with flattering hopes but ill founded.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Prince Nytan was patiently enduring his confinement and improving himſelf with a few rare and invaluable books, without which he never travelled far from his father's palace. They inſtructed him in ſecrets of nature but little known in the world; and ſo vaſt was his genius, that he had already made improvements in the arts by which wonders are performed, beyond the knowledge of the authors of thoſe books; the happy effects of which improvements will be evidenced from the ſequel; from which it will appear how this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful man could appear abroad in diſtant countries, and accompliſh great and glorious things, and yet remain all the while in his little priſon, doing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing he pleaſed except embracing his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038495_0018_10122C841B2A21D0"/>
beloved parents, ſiſters and friends. Before he could enjoy that happineſs, he had great things to effect for the good of mankind; and ſtill greater were to ſucceed them.</p>
            <p>He had purchaſed, in his tour ſeveral little pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which he had fixed on the walls of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, on each ſide his couch. One, neareſt his view, (which he had picked up from a miry place in the road,) he was very frequently looking at; ſtudying certain figures of writing at the bottom of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible only to himſelf and their author. We ſhall ſee preſently the extraordinary ſervices this picture rendered him, of which he became exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fond, not without reaſon.</p>
            <p>His chamber had but one large window, which afforded him, as he reclined on his couch a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and delightful proſpect; and from which he beheld the reflected ſplendors of a magnificent tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a number of beautiful buildings that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared above the diſtant hills and groves. This proſpect entertained him in his momentary relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from his ſtudies. Literary purſuits were ever his chief pleaſure, as thereby he became more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſerving mankind. To theſe his retirement was adapted, and he knew how to anſwer the calls of health for the exerciſes of walking, riding, and the charms of converſation, by a diet adapted to his ſedentary circumſtances. He converſed with books, he ſtudied and contemplated the glorious works of nature; but he did not forget the Great Source of Being, and the underived origin of all intellectual light. He converſed with the God of nature, and his great knowledge in the occult ſcience, and the deep myſteries he had learned, were by him improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the good of mankind.—Unhappy fate! that a Prince ſo worthy ſhould be excluded from the world, after having been falſely and ſlanderously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038495_0019_10122C85AB5064E8"/>
of ſeditious practices againſt his country, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Sovereign, and a parent too for whom he would have freely laid down his life! But ſuch are often the events of this imperfect ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. The good ſuffer by the wicked. Yet let not the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Almighty be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned. For wiſe and good purpoſes are the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous defamed and proſecuted, virtue is tried, and fortitude, under trials, made illuſtrious. Thus the good are refined for the enjoyment of higher plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and more exalted bliſs. Of theſe important truths, Nytan was far from being inſenſible; who poſſeſſed a great ſoul, formed to receive every ſacred impreſſion, and ſalutary inſtruction. Now Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeng ſaid he to his boy, (who was ſitting penſive on a low ſoffa by the ſide of his bed,) I ſhall have a proof of my patience under trying circumſtances, and of the ſincerity of my profeſſed ſubmiſſion to the decrees of Heaven.—O ſage inſtructor of man! let thy preceps and example be ever preſented to my thoughts! Thy great ſoul divinely illuminated, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for perfection. I aſpire to be like thee. Thy bright examples will inceſſantly ſtrive to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and whilſt I patiently and ſubmiſſively endure, I will exert myſelf to improve in every thing by which I may, in future, ſerve and bleſs mankind, for whoſe ſervice only would I wiſh to live. All are my brethren, of one benevolent, glorious, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Father. I love them as ſuch. I weep over their miſeries, I am humbled for their errors, and my own. Without the power of doing them good, to me life would be inſipid, worthleſs and intolerable. May kind heaven protect my ſovereign parents, my ſiſters my friends and fellow citizens; and in its own time, bring to light the dark plots of our enemies, and effectually defeat their malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Then will my integrity ſhine forth with a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038495_0020_10122C88206D0680"/>
brighter luſtre. I wiſh no evil to Sanden or his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents; but their contrition, reformation and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.'—Here he could not refrain tears at the recollection of his cruel baniſhment from his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and friends, and at the thoughts of their being induced to entertain opinions of him injurious to his honour and his love.</p>
            <p>Perceiving the boy was affected, he aſked him whether he could, by any means, convey a letter to his ſiſters, without injury to the truſt impoſed in him. For Nytan would not, for the world. ſolicit of him a favor contrary to the injunctions he had received from his maſter, and the dictates of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 'No, my lord, replied Geſſeng, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der oath. I dare not attempt it.' 'Nor dare I, returned the Prince, to purſuade you to betray a truſt repoſed in you. To break an oath is to tempt the vengeance of Heaven. The vileſt that ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored our country and its laws, never yet could be ſo fool-hardy. Swear to me that you have no orders that touch my life.—Why Geſſeng are you ſilent? Then I perceive you have ſuch orders.'—' I dare not, my lord, to make you any reply on this ſubject,' anſwered Geſſeng.—'Enough—poor deluded boy! exclaimed the Prince; I well know that you, of yourſelf, can have nothing againſt me. You are bribed high. The temptations of gold and diamonds have prevailed againſt humanity, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you, perhaps, in deſign a murderer.—But O! Geſſeng; can you be proof againſt the tremendous vengeance of the Almighty, which muſt inevitably fall upon a murderer? ſooner or later you muſt feel it. What then will avail the riches heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, by your vile emyloyer?—But do you not already perceive he muſt be a villain?—Nay do you not diſcern that he muſt be your greateſt enemy who
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038495_0021_10122C8AC1A4CAA8"/>
could inſtigate you to the perpetration of ſo black a crime? Are you not, by this time, convinced, that ſuch a man muſt be the traitor and enemy to his country, and indeed to all the world; and not the perſecuted Nytan? I ſee you are convinced. I ſee you ſtagger from your horrid purpoſe, and that I have no further cauſe of fear.'</p>
            <p>The boy fell upon his knees; and with claſped hands, and tears guſhing out.—'Never, never, cried he, will I be guilty of ſo black a deed. If die I muſt—I will rather die. Forgive me, dear Prince, and I ſolemnly ſwear, in the ſacred preſence of the avenger of wrongs, that I will, henceforth, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of your life, though at the expenſe of my own.</p>
            <p>'It is well, replied Prince Nytann, and happy for you, my boy,—and Heaven be praiſed on your own account, as well as for myſelf. But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to reſt. I will love you, and conſult my pillow for our mutual ſafety. Upon which,—truſt me, my dear boy, the happineſs and ſafety of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands depend. To-morrow I will ſhew you jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of immenſe value; and you ſhall very ſoon find whoſe friendſhip and confidence is moſt valuable,—Nytan's or that wicked lord's.' They then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to bed. But Nytan ſlept but little. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved a thouſand important things in his mind. He had been now three weeks ſhut up in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with no other company than Geſſeng. For, not one of the guards of the caſtle appeared before him. He bore his misfortune with a philoſophic tranquility becoming the greatneſs of his mind, and one who foreſaw great conſequences that would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from it, important to himſelf, his family and minkind.</p>
            <p>There were a ſet of enthuſiaſts in different prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inces of China, who were wholly devoted to their hypocritical prieſts. They had never the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038495_0022_10122C8CD5C3BB48"/>
of the Emperor, though tolerated under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wiſe reſtrictions. Renien, the Emperor, who was very learned and a great writer, had, in ſome of his publiſhed works, (which were of great rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation throughout all China, and other countries,) expoſed the abſurdities of thoſe religious ſects; ſo that their prieſts were daily loſing their conſequence. The greateſt body of them was in the province where the inſurrection began. Hence Nytan was led to conclude, not without good reaſon, that his enemy had made uſe of thoſe prieſts and their diſciples to promote rebellion in the empire, and he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a letter to his father, repreſenting his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, and urging various weighty reaſons that induced him to conclude they were well founded. How to convey his letter he had not been able to determine. He had only incloſed it in one to his ſiſters, who, he was confident would be the very laſt to believe any thing derogatory to his character, hitherto unimpeached.</p>
            <p>A religion that contains in its boſom the ſeeds of vice and oppreſſion, and which tends to enflame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of deſtroying vicious inclinations, ought to be expoſed by every friend of virtue and the intereſts of mankind.<note n="*" place="bottom">Through the influence of falſe religions, that which inculcates real piety and humanity, hath but little influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced men inclined to imbibe errors—to pervert truth—to be religiouſly as well as philoſophically deceived.</note> Such was the ſentiments which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the court of Renien. The ſects of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, and the promoters of fanaticiſm, were therefore inimical to the reigning power of China, and might well be ſuppoſed to exert themſelves when they could act with apparent ſafety againſt it. 'Thoſe baſe prieſts, then, ſaid the impriſoned Mandarin, were the props on which the plotting miniſter built his revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038495_0023_10122C8E6562A9D8"/>
fabric. The diſcernment and wiſdom of my father and his council, will not be long in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out; and then they will more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſe their deteſtable principles to all the world. Their miſchievous manoeuvres will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to open a new window of light and intelligence on the minds of my countrymen, and ſerve more rapidly to accelerate the annihilation of ſuperſtition and fanaticiſm that ſtill have an exiſtence in ſo many provinces of the empire. Their total deſtruction will be the happieſt and moſt glorious aera of which the world ever boaſted. How fortunate will it prove to me; Geſſeng, if my letter finds acceſs to my father and ſovereign.' This was the general te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Prince's converſation with his boy in the morning while he was ſhewing him his jewels and diamonds, which were of ſuch high value that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them was ſufficient to purchaſe ſeveral large provinces. One he preſented to Geſſeng, as an earneſt of what he might expect in future. 'Now my dear boy, ſaid he let us waſh and dreſs for the day—and eat our breakfaſts with merry hearts. I have a ſtrong pre-ſentiment of ſome favourable event today or before we ſhall ſee the ſun riſe again above the horiſon. See you that portrait, continued Nytan, looking at his favorite picture.? Thoſe characters you ſee at the bottom of it, inform me of things that excite in me the moſt ſanguine hopes. When you go out to the guard, remember the neceſſary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have given you: be diſcreet: punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what I may have occaſion to ſay to you. The time will come, when (if you are now faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me) you will have the beſt reaſons to conſider your preſent attendance, on me, as the moſt fortunate of events. I ſhall be your faithful friend and inſtructor, and ſhall, one day, preſent you to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038495_0024_10122C9092C947C8"/>
your ſovereign as one whom he will have cauſe to love and promote.</p>
            <p>IT was on the very day of this ſeaſonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of friendſhip between Prince Nytan and his boy, that the vile miniſter of miſchief had given the latter a potion of poiſon for the priſoner, which was to be ſlow in its fatal operation, that his death might be conſidered as the effect of ſickneſs owing to his cloſe confinement, to chagrin, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of thoſe exerciſes to which he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore daily accuſtomed. The boy had delivered up the poiſon to his newly acquired friend; at the ſame time ſhewing him a large ſum of gold and ſeveral valuable diamonds which he had received from San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with the promiſe of ten times as much, when the work of death was done. 'Reserve all ſaid Nytan, for the miſerable labourers who live about this caſtle, and others. You will never want it. As ſoon, therefore, as you have opportunity diſtribute it in alms. Remember what our great law giver hath ſaid;—<hi>Be bleſſed, and render thyſelf fortunate by deeds of charity; thus reſembling according to thy meaſure, the giver of all things.'</hi> 'My dear Prince, cried the boy, (now ſoftened with contrition, grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude and love,) how bleſſed am I already in your friendſhip and ſalutary counſels! I ſhall moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do as you ſay, in this, and in every thing. Indeed, my dear and moſt reſpected ſir, I feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it were, another kind of being than what I formerly was, before I revealed the black deſign. I was far from being happy. I had fears and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, with painful reluctance; and ſuſpected my employer of a deſign upon my own life, to prevent his being diſcovered after the poiſon ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed you. But now—O how happy! How grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! Freed from the diſheartened rebukes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038495_0025_10122C9336671020"/>
and a ſlaviſh dependence upon a baſe, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man!' 'It is highly probable, anſwered Nytan, that, to prevent all poſſible means of diſcovery, he would have taken your life. Let us now act with prudence and caution; and rely upon the Supreme diſpoſer of events. Perhaps, one day more may free us from any further danger.</p>
            <p>While the boy was gone down into the caſtle to prepare dinner, Nytan ſat down before his window, conſulting one of his books; and comparing what he found in it, with the intelligence he had obtained from the characters at the bottom of his favorite picture, which hung on the wall by the ſide of his bed. He had juſt attainted to what he was in ſearch of all the forenoon, when the boy entered with their dinner. He made no communications to Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeng; and appeared, all the time of dinner, in a deep ſtudy. Geſſeng eat with him in ſilence: when the little dining table was removed, he was diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed till ſunſet to take the air, and prepare ſupper. The door being ſhut, locked and barred on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as had been uſual; Nytan laid himſelf on his couch, the window being open, contemplating the gay and beautiful proſpects before him, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Great Creator and Upholder of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe. At the head of his couch, on his right hand, ſtood a little cabinet, containing his books, and among other things, a ſmall ſpying-glaſs. He took the ſpying-glaſs in his hand and looking thro' it clearly diſcerned ſeveral large bodies of armed troops, both horſe and foot, paſſing over the hills, which greatly ſurpriſed him. An army marching through the country ſo near the capital was a ſight never ſeen but once before in his father's reign; which was the only time he had ever beheld ſuch an appearance of war as was now before his eyes. He viewed them attentively a conſiderable
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038495_0026_10122C9550EFD890"/>
while, as they deſcended one hill, marched along the valley beneath, and aſcended over another, till at lengh they paſſed out of ſight. Inflamed as he was with the deſire of knowing what was going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the deſire of being preſent where his eyes now could no more reach;—he had but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource. Folding his hands together, and fixing his eyes upon his favourite picture,—'Go, cried he pretty picture! fly quickly, and bring me intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence what buſineſſ thoſe troops are upon, and who employs them. You can do no leſs for one that loves you, and ſaved you from near periſhing in the mire. Suffer me not to die here with terror.' The pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture flew directly out of the window, and was gone out of ſight in a moment. Now, ſhall ſoon be ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied, ſaid the Prince to himſelf, my ſweet little picture, I ſee, is grateful for the ſervice I have done it. It will be here again preſently with the tidings I now am moſt anxious to hear. I ſhall learn how my father is employed, and what my mortal enemy is doing. I ſhall reap the fruits of my deep reſearches and unwearied ſtudies. I will therefore compoſe myſelf to ſleep, till Geſſeng arrives with ſupper.—And ſoundly he ſlept, till the boy's key rattling in the lock rouzed him. He aroſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſat over againſt the window to take his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The ſun was now ſetting and it was time for the picture to return. Nytan eat his ſupper in eager expectation; but the picture came not. He grew impatient, and ordered a chaffing-diſh of coals, into which he caſt a perfume. Then ſaying over a few myſterious words—the picture obeyed not the ſummons. Nytan was greatly ſhocked at this. It was a ſummons, he imagined, ever to be obeyed. But now it failed. 'Let us lie down without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing, ſaid the Prince; and, as it is very warm, leave the window open and watch—whatever be the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038495_0027_10122C9766228ED8"/>
matter I have done my duty. I ſhall certainly, therefore, know before day, whence this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed delay ariſes, if I ſleep not, and I feel not well enough to ſit up. Should I ſleep, Geſſeng, I ſhall be nearly undone.' 'Heaven forbid it, my deareſt Prince, cried Geſſing, I will moſt certainly keep you awake. I will ſing to you, and talk all the time.' 'Singing, anſwered the Prince, would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm the guard; and I would not, on any account, it ſhould interrupt me, to night. But reach me that vial and a glaſs. This, added he, will keep me awake, (drinking a glaſs from the vial) I had like to have forgot. Give me a glaſs every two hours. You ſee the vial is again repleniſhed, and do you take two little wafers, which you will find in the loweſt draw of my cabinet. They will ſerve to keep you wakeful. But they have no effect upon thoſe who have paſſed their eighteenth year: neither does the liquor in the vial anſwer any purpoſe to thoſe who are under that age.'</p>
            <p>The boy having eat the wafers, and placed a lamp at the bed's head, they both lay down and fell to reading. They read for ſeveral hours. Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeng had riſen to give the Prince his third glaſs,—when, on a ſudden, a great light ſhone into the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. The boy ſtartled, let fall the vial, which was broken in pieces. Hark! exclaimed the Prince, what ſweet muſic is that I hear? It draws nearer to the window. They liſtened till the muſic ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced directly under their window. The light was like mid-day. They diſtinguiſhed a female voice, and heard diſtinctly theſe words, Maidens, give place. Let me come under the window, and aſk leave of the beautiful and accompliſhed Prince Nytan, to preſent myſelf before him, and give him his beloved picture; and let him know what delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its return.' Nytan ſprang from his bed to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038495_0028_10122C9A07143D98"/>
window in a moment, and cryed, 'You are hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome; but whoever you are, you muſt tell me by what means you can be with ſafety, conveyed to a place ſo very high from the ground. Beſides, my chamber is ſo ſmall, that it can by no means contain half the gay company you muſt have with you, and which, likewiſe, were it in my power I ſhould be very glad to entertain. For I aſſure you I am nearly tired out with this ſolitary life.'—He was about to add further,—When a beautiful little yellow-bird flew into the window by the ſide of him, and perched on the corner of the cabinet. Nytan turned about from the windows, to ſee what a pretty bird he had in his chamber; and the boy advancing to take it in his hands. 'Touch me not, pretty youth, ſaid the yellow-bird. You ſee, Prince, I have made bold, on the welcome you have juſt giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me, and it is to put an end to your concern. I have brought you your faithful picture; and there it hangs in its place. As it is a little aſhamed on account of its keeping you ſo long in a painful ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. I have undertaken to ſpeak for it, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with what you want to know. But, firſt, I muſt inform you who I am, and of the intereſt I take in your future fortunes. Know, then, that I am the merry and good natured Fairy Leingreing, whoſe palace is at the bottom of the ſea that rolls its waves againſt the walls of this caſtle. I was journeying through the air, from Perſia, when I met your picture flying in ſuch a prodigious hurry, that one could not get a ſingle word out of it. I was almoſt affronted to ſee it paſs by without deigning to give an anſwer of two words to my kind ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So I even turned my courſe after it to know the cauſe of ſuch a piece of rudeneſs. By a taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the golden chain, which you ſee about my neck, I found the courſe the picture had taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:038495_0029_10122C9C205129B0"/>
though it was gone out of ſight; and quickening my ſpeed, I ſoon came up with it. For I could fly as ſwiftly as the fleeteſt of all the choice pictures that adorn my grandmother's palace in the iſland of pictures. I found it fluttering about among the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious troops; till, at length it darted into the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral's pocket, and inſtantly flew out again, into the air, with his written directions. Away it darted through the clouds, giving me a ſide glance, with a forbidding air. But I flew after it, with velocity enough to overtake it. You, Prince, are too wiſe and knowing, young as you are, not to diſcern, that like a good natured fairy, I had but little difficulty in being reconciled to a picture, a relation of my grandmother's, and to detain it till we had done ſomething elſe beſides getting news. For indeed no time was to be loſt. The rebel troops were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as we found by the orders, to take poſſeſſion of one of the ſtrongeſt citadels, for your enemy and falſe accuſer. Another army, under the command of a wicked Genie, was advanced, (as we likewiſe found by thoſe ſame orders) near the capital City. And your father was in eminent danger of looſing both his empire and his life. For rebellion had made a rapid progreſs, through the influence of the mad fanatics, whom the falſe miniſter had found means to engage on his ſide. But you ſhall hear in a few words how matters are at the preſent moment. The chief commander, having no orders to produce, muſt wait till he gets them renewed; and as to the commanding Genie, I have ordered him to his old confinement. His army, finding their leader to be run away, will quarrel among themſelves, and be diſperſed. The Prieſts and their ſilly dupes I am about to handle pretty ſeverely. But you Prince muſt remain no longer here.' 'Ah ſweet bird re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Nytan, that I very well know, yet an oath
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038495_0030_10122C9DAEB0F8F0"/>
confines me to this chamber, and you are ſensible it is impoſſible that I ſhould violate it. To regard it, therefore, as it becomes me; and at the ſame time to abſent myſelf from this caſtle and my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I have accompliſhed the means of ſeparating my chamber from the caſtle, and tranſporting it, with myſelf and my companion, to Mount Caucaſus, where I have ſome buſineſs.' Very well, replied the yellow-bird; but let us have ſomething to eat firſt. For I am very hungry, and ſtand in need of a good ſupper, conſidering the work I have to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to morrow night.—Yet, after a ſecond thought, we can ſup after your chamber has begun its aerial journey; (for I mean to go with you, it being noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of my way,) and, our repaſt being already prepared by my girls below; as we mount in the air, they ſhall hand it into your chamber door.' 'Thank you with all my heart, for your company, ſweet bird and accompliſhed Fairy, rejoined Nytan, we ſhall ſoon be in motion from hence." Then pronouncing ſome myſtical words well underſtood, and inſtantly obeyed by the inviſible fairies and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the chamber flew off, with a terrible noiſe, and launched into the air. Then, fixing a ſpear of gold and ſeveral other metals, in a hole on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the window, pointed towards the mount, the chamber purſued its deſtined courſe. In the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, the Fairy's girls handed into the door, two large bowls covered, one of gold, the other of burnt china, and a flaggon of wine; taking their leave with the following complimentary ſong—</p>
            <lg type="song">
               <lg>
                  <l>Lovely Prince, in ſafety fly</l>
                  <l>Far from thy envious foes;</l>
                  <l>And enjoy ſweet liberty;</l>
                  <l>And pluck the faireſt roſe!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:038495_0031_10122C9F961E9900"/>
                  <l>May the maid that ſighs for thee,</l>
                  <l>Poſſeſs an angel's form,</l>
                  <l>And mind; they both will make thee ſee</l>
                  <l>The power they have to charm!</l>
               </lg>
            </lg>
            <p>The guards were frightened out of their wits. For the caſtle ſhook and trembled as though it was falling in pieces. Some of them ruſhing forward, and thinking to enter the little chamber, fell head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long through the aperture which uſed to be cloſed at the chamber door. Others ran out into the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to hear the fine muſic in the air. See the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians they could not. For both they and the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were rendered inviſible. The happy travellers now uncovered their bowls, and fixing their table near the open window, began their midnight repaſt. Geſſeng handed them wine in cups of gold; aſking the little yellow bird's bleſſing, as he placed the cup before it. 'That you have with all my heart, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the yellow bird. Regard the councils of this amiable friend of yours, and mine: Be faith in his ſervice, and my bleſſing will ever follow you. It will not be long before your fidelity and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to this lovely, worthy young man, will be more effectually tried; and I agreeably flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that, in the trial, you will come off with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and honor. You ſerve the ſon of a great and renouned Emperor, and a ſon, worthy of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo great, ſo wiſe, and ſo good;—a ſon, whom I ſincerely love and reſpect; and whoſe intereſts I ſhall ever regard and advance, to the utmoſt of my power: and likewiſe thoſe of all his faithful adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: In doing which, I am well ſatisfied that I ſhall be ſerving the beſt intereſts of mankind.</p>
            <p>BOTH Geſſeng and the Prince were greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with thoſe generous commendations: and the little bird, or fairy, addreſſing herſelf particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038495_0032_10122CA1AF0C4BD8"/>
to Nytan, thus continued her diſcourſe. 'I ſhall leave you preſently, ſaid ſhe, and, as your ſtay will be but ſhort where you are now going, take this ring, and wear it conſtantly. If at any time, you ſhall have occaſion for my preſence, rub it, and I ſhall immediately appear before you. If you only want to hear from me, ſend the picture, which will be proud of flying on your errants as long as her deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined hour permits her. I am now going to the iſland of pictures to ſee its relations; with whom I have ſome affairs of conſequence. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I may be, hereafter, permitted to acquaint you.' They then converſed together on a variety of entertaining and improving ſubjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till day was almoſt ready to appear, and the chamber reſted on the ſummit of mount Caucaſus. The Fairy, as ſhe perceived it, bid them farewell, and bent her courſe to the iſland of pictures.—The pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace of libraries was one of the greateſt wonders in the world, for its prodigious dimenſions, and the infinite number of valuable books it contained. The good Genies who loved learning, had been for ſeveral thouſands of years collecting them for their own uſe, and for the uſe of their particular favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites. By his art, Prince Nytan could command one of thoſe Genies, who dwelt at certain ſseaſons in a magnificent grotto on one ſide of a vaſt rock. His buſineſs, then, was with the Genie, to procure from him the keys of the palace, and to obtain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about the way to it, and the admiſſion of his little chamber in the grand apartment of libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which was ſpacious enough to admit fifty ſuch chambers, and without his chamber being admitted into that apartment, which contained the books he was deſirous of peruſing, he had no means of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that pleaſure and advantage. Having, therefore,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038495_0033_10122CA45A7E8820"/>
diſmiſſed his boy in ſearch of the Genie, he next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned the picture to the yellow-bird with his letters to his father and ſiſters, which he had forgot to deliver to it; requeſting the good bird to fly into the palace window, whilſt they were at breakfaſt, and drop them into their tea-cups. Soon after the picture was gone on this errand, he beheld from his window, Geſſeng leading towards it a little fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking old man, whoſe head was ten times larger than the reſt of his whole body, and with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one large eye, which was fixed in the middle of his forehead. He wore a monſtrous cap.<note n="*" place="bottom">He wore a monſtrous Cap, reſembling female head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes in the reign of oddities.</note> He held in his right hand, a ſcimetar three yards in length; and advanced with a low and ſolemn pace. The boy would have been frightened almoſt out of his wits, had not the old man encouraged him, by telling him he was as harmleſs as a fly.—Keep your eyes off from me, ſaid he, laughing, if you don't like my looks. Nytan himſelf was, at firſt, a little ſtartled at the ſight of ſo hideous an object. For he had never ſeen him before, nor indeed, any thing half ſo ugly and diſguſting. When the old man was arrived to the door of the chamber, he lay down his ſcimitar on one ſide of it. Nytan and his boy helped him in, and ſeated him on a low ſoffa. 'I am giddy-headed, and weak with old age, ſaid he, as he dropped on the ſoffa. Nothing could have tempted me to ſo long a walk before eating my breakfaſt, but you muſt me obeyed. Let me then know your further commands; and when you have given me ſomething to eat, I ſhall go about them with more cheerfulneſs.' 'I want the keys of the palace of libraries, replied the Prince. I am going thither to ſtudy awhile in my chamber.' 'How
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:038495_0034_10122CA670ADC6D8"/>
can that be? returned the old man; or rather the Genie Eſdren. But why, continued Eſdren, would you go ſo vaſt a journey over the ocean, ſince it is in my power, on certain conditions, to procure you, in leſs than two hours, as many books, as you want.' 'What are the conditions, aſked Prince Nytan?' 'They are only, replied the old man, that you uſe your endeavours to render me a ſtrong and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome youth like yourſelf.' As Nytan was about to return an anſwer to the Genie; with a ſmile, his picture re-entered the window and took its place on the wall. 'Picture, cried the Prince, here is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Genie, above a thouſand years old, who has made me the unreaſonable requeſt to reſtore to him youth, ſtrength and beauty.' 'As de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as I am, returned the Genie, I would not change conditions with you; ſince the ſtate I am in is beſt, for the time it is to laſt, which is but very ſhort. What the Creator cauſes us to be, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the beſt condition for us, and we ought always to be reſigned and thankful. And yet, Prince, your pleaſantry being ſet aſide, ſuch are the conditions; and I would have you exert yourſelf in my behalf. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you are deſtined to be inſtrumental in that change of my circumſtances which it is appointed ſhould ſoon take place.' 'The requeſt of Eſdren is not ſo unreaſonable neither, ſaid the picture, and I believe you can do for him with my aſſiſtance. I long to ſee him in a leſs hideous form. And he ſhall fetch you twenty of the beſt volumes in the palace of libraries, which you may ſtudy in your chamber, while you are travelling over ſeas and lands: but firſt let me give you ſome little account of the man. From being one of the handſomeſt of Genies, who have the privilege of immortality, and the perpetual bloom of youth with all its vigour and activity, the accidental indulgence of a ſingle
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:038495_0035_10122CA8167E31A8"/>
thought contrary to rectitude, required the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation into this ugly figure, for a certain term of time. We, good Genies, and Fairies, are apt to err once in a while, and dearly do we ſmart for it. Such is our deſtined lot, till the hour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the higheſt abodes of perfection, to which we eagerly ſoar. But, the moment for his re-aſſuming his proper form and vigour is arrived. Catch the drops, you perceive diſtilling from me, in the palm of your hand, and pour them on his head.' Prince Nytan did as he was commanded. The old man roſe up, threw his cap out of the window, and ſtood ready for his approaching renovation.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the ſon of Renien, poured the drops on the head of Eſdren, than he ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, inſtead of a deformed old man, a youth as gay and handſome as himſelf. He threw his arms round his neck, and kiſſed him again and again. Geſſeng leaped for joy.—The chamber ſhook and trembled.—The picture congratulated Eſdren, and,—O wonderful to relate!—leaving its ſtation on the wall, ſtood before them, a lady of a moſt beautiful and majeſtic form!—It was Puria, the wife of Eſdren! ſhe flew into his open arms! rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſucceeded rapture, and congratulations ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed congratulations.</p>
            <p>All this happened within twelve minutes after the Genie had entered the Prince's chamber. Nytan thought proper to remind him how weak and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry he was, not long ſince; and aſked him whether he had loſt his appetite, or intended to live only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on love? If it be ſo, continued he, it were ill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt your careſſes. The admonition was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly received, and they were about to ſit down to eat, when, Eſdren recollecting himſelf, propoſed breakfaſting in his garden, on a terrace, from which they would enjoy a fine proſpect. This being read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:038495_0036_10122CAAD664ECE8"/>
agreed to; and Nytan fixing the ſpear in its hole they found themſelves, inſtantly on the terraſs. There is no occaſion, ſaid he, of leaving my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to which, you know, I am indiſpenſably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſince we are now in your garden, and have every advantage of the proſpect from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Here then, let Geſſeng ſpread the table, and ſet on our breakfaſt. But O! fair lady! ſay, how am I to return the ſurpriſing obligations you have laid upon me? 'By not thinking of them at all, replied ſhe. It is but juſt nothing as to what I hope to ſerve you in. When you picked me up, from the miry canal, only as a fine picture to hang in your chamber, you did me a great kindneſs, of which, in ſome future day you may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. As ſoon as we have done eating, we muſt haſten after your books, and having brought them to you, our family calls us away immediately, to look after its affairs. In the mean time, you may remain in our garden as long as you pleaſe, and make uſe of the grotto in our abſence, after we have ſerved your preſent occaſions.' 'But dear la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, returned Prince Nytan, you have not informed me about my letters.' 'I was about to tell you, anſwered ſhe, that your father, ſiſters and friends are well; the Empreſs, your mother, ſlowly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering from the diſordered ſtate of health into which your cruel uſage had thrown her. You will at a proper ſeaſon, have further communications from the Emperor's Court.' 'Alas! cried the Prince, I fear I have been too bold and forward in troubling that worthy lady, the fairy of the ſea, with my letters.' 'Far from ſo, replied the wife of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you only oblige her, in laying your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon her; and, therefore, make yourſelf perfectly eaſy and happy on her account.

Nytan was about to expreſs his grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgments, but ſilence was enjoined him, and Eſdren bid him obſerve the maidens on the green below, who were preparing to dance for the entertainment of the company. The Prince was all attention, whilſt the maidens performed ſeveral dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, after the manner of the Chineſe, and, likewiſe of the ſeveral countries in which Eſdren alternately reſided. They concluded with the following ſong, addreſſed to ſpring, it being that ſeaſon of the year; and a farewell compliment to their gueſts, the Prince and Geſſeng, whoſe uncommon beauty and loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had excited their affection, and inſpired their cheerfulneſs and vivacity.</p>

            <p>The maidens, one after another, aſcended the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, and advanced to the window; which being low, the Prince reached out, and kiſſed them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting each with a diamond ring to wear for his ſake. Geſſeng went out, and made them a low bow, as they were retreating from the window. Eſdren, and his fair partner then retired in order to proceed to the palace of libraries; fixing but two hours for their journey and return. Prince Nytan was now in good ſpirits, having received ſo many marks of regard and affection. He ſat down at his window, waiting the return of his reſpectable and kind friends. Geſſeng in the mean time, was going in and out from the grotto for his amuſement, and preparing, from the Genie's garden and kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, a recruit of proviſions, as he had been ordered, for the next adventure his lord was determined to make over the immenſe ocean.</p>

            <p>A MIND poſſeſſed of conſcious rectitude, Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en's choiceſt gift to the Denizens of earth; as it voluntarily reſts its whole deſtiny with the faithful protecting power whence it originated; it calmly beholds the viciſſitudes of life, convinced, beyond a doubt fortune that viſits or awaits it, is wiſely and benevolently appointed; and that the reſult of all will prove its higheſt good, its perfect felicity. Ah! how happy is the allotment of the being thus forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt the ills of life! That ſuch ought to be the mind of every human being, the character the Deity hath exhibited of himſelf, as the never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friend of all the intelligent creation, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinces to the wiſe and diſcerning. They are certain of a kind ſupport under, and a compleat relief from every affliction in the moſt ſeaſonable moment; for which, in the ſevereſt and darkeſt trials, they patiently wait, and with a lively reſignation. Such was the mind of the perſecuted Prince Nytan, when he experienced ſo wonderful an interpoſition in his behalf; when powers ſuperior to humanity, roſe, indignant, for the protection of virtue, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of its malicious foes. Under ſuch mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection he ſoars aloft, and traverſes the vaſt ocean to diſtant lands, bending his courſe to his deſtined iſland. Yet, though virtuous, great, and wiſe, ſome events muſt needs occur, in the courſe of ſo
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:038495_0041_10122CB62BE23120"/>
well directed a life, to remind him of his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and that he is ſtill to improve in prudence and circumſpection.</p>
            <p>Geſſeng, inadvertantly leaned againſt the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door; which being carelesly faſtened by a ſtring, the ſtring gave way, the door flew open, and he fell backwards into the ocean. The door, indeed had a lock, but it had been rendered uſeleſs by the ſhock the chamber had received on its ſeparation from the caſtle. Prince Nytan turned his head to the door, on hearing the cry of Geſſeng as he fell, and perceiving he was gone, immediately cauſed his chamber to deſcend to the ſurface of the water. But, as he was reaching out his hand to him, a monſtrous fiſh ſwallowed him down his throat. Nytan was obliged inſtantly to retreat, with his chamber, from the monſter, and the convulſions he made in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But ſuddenly recollecting himſelf, and glanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eye at the tapeſtry on the wall at ſome myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious characters and drawings, he took up his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic glaſs, and reconnoitred the fiſh. The fiſh, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving him, called out to him with a loud voice, 'O! gracious mandarin, Prince of lords! cried he, I have preſerved the boy from periſhing. In return for this piece of ſervice, ſave an unfortunate Genie from the malice of the wicked Gendor, who having thus transformed me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you ſee, confined me below the depths of the ſeas. You have only to throw your magic ſpear at me, and I ſhall appear in my proper ſhape, enter with the lad into your chamber, and place the ſpear in your hand.' 'Thou lieſt vile miſcreant! replied Nytan, thou art that very Gendor, whom thou taxeſt with malice. Inſtantly deliver up my boy; or the vengeance of Eſdren, and the ſon of Renien, ſhall inflict upon thee a more dreadful puniſhment.'</p>
            <p>The affrighted trembling Gendor, immediately
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:038495_0042_10122CB7BB089068"/>
vomited out Geſſeng, and bid himſelf in the bottom of the ocean. Geſſeng ſwam towards the chamber, and ſoon found himſelf in ſafety with his beloved lord, who helping him to ſtrip, rubbing him with cloths till his ſkin was dry, bade him repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the bed; where covering him with the ſheet and counterpane, and giving him a glaſs of cordial, he ſat down by him congratulating him on his fortuate eſcape, and at the ſame time vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſing himſelf for his neglect of the door and lock, which he ſoon after, rendered properly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. Geſſeng took all the blame to himſelf; as ſaid he, 'To look after ſuch things was my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.' Prince Nytan aſſured him he intended him not an indirect reproof, and that if one was to blame, ſo was the other. 'I ſurely, continued the Prince, ought to have looked about me a little better. But, you only, my dear boy have been the ſufferer.' Then kiſſing him, he adviſed him to endeavour to get a little ſleep, which would be of ſervice to him after the violence and purturbation he had undergone.</p>
            <p>The next morning the Iſland appeared in view, and, before the ſun had well riſen, they were land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſummit of a hill, not far from its centre. The Prince, now having his ſpying-glaſs improved to his mind, (through which he could now ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing above a thouſand miles round him, with as much perſpicuity as though he was upon the very ſpot to which he directed the glaſs;) now looked through it round the iſland, which appeared to be very large, and as he afterwards found, above three hundred leagues in length, and two hundred in breadth. It likewiſe appeared to be very fruitful and pleaſant. He next directed the glaſs to his father's palace. The windows of the palace, and of his father's cloſet being open he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly ſaw him at his table, indicting a letter, which
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:038495_0043_10122CB94E99FDC8"/>
he perceived to be to himself; having read the whole of it, he beheld his father ſign his name, with joy too, he ſaw him fold the letter, ſuperſcribe, and ſeal it; then deliver it to the meſſenger in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; who went away with it. The contents of it were congratulatory, and affectionate. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gave him his liberty, which was the greateſt joy to Nytan; who now looked upon himſelf as free from his oath, and to go in and out as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He therefore gave a ſhout of rapturous joy, embraced his beloved Geſſeng, and taking him by the hand 'Now ſaid he, my lovely friend, we will walk and reconnoiter the iſland with the greateſt pleaſure.' They went out together, and deſcended the hill into an agreeable vale encompaſſed with woods, except ſeveral openings which afforded a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful proſpect.—This iſland was inhabited by thirty men who had eſcaped from ſhipwreck, and was unknown to any others but Genies and Fairies, one of whom, whoſe name was Ravenzar, owned a palace under ground, in the heart of the iſland, and poſſeſſed vaſt riches. Thoſe men had lived on the iſland about eight years, ſubſiſting on what the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland afforded, having ſeveral pieces of ground en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed for wheat, ſheep and cattle, and little huts. Ravenzar who himſelf, unſeen found means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them into the iſland, could eaſily afford them better accommodations in a place from whence it was impoſſible for them to free themſelves; but he thought beſt for them to remain as they were, till they had acquired fixed habits of virtue, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for the vices and luxuries of the country from whence they originated. To this purpoſe the good Genie conſtantly aſſiſted them. Prince Nytan knew all this, and fell in with the noble deſigns of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar. Beſides, he had been informed, by ſome characters on his tapeſtry, than the hour was not
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:038495_0044_10122CBB64F597F8"/>
far off, when he ſhould obtain from the Genie, an immenſe treaſure for benevolent and charitable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. It was on the knowledge of theſe, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things reſpecting the iſland, that he had ſet out, and arrived to it.</p>
            <p>Geſſeng had greatly improved, under the tuition of ſo wiſe and generous a Prince, conſidering the ſhort time he had been with him. As it would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be now of great advantage to them both, Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan began to acquaint the youth with ſome of his great and benevolent deſigns. All his purpoſes were nobly diſintereſted, and effectually tending to the good of others; eſpecially of the loweſt claſſes of mankind, the poor, and the oppresſſed. Such a life as was that of this Prince was indeed invaluable. He formed, in himſelf the truly great character and no man can with propriety be called great, any further than he is benevolent and virtuous, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of the happineſs of his fellow creatures; in doing which this accompliſhed Prince and chief mandarin was ever buſy. The greater part of the nights he was inſtructing young Geſſeng; improving and invigorating his mind with the moſt uſeful learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and virtuous precepts. Geſſeng, too, was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the beſt part of each day, in the ſtudy of ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able books.</p>
            <p>Prince Nytan now communicated to this well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed youth, his buſineſs on the iſland (which he denominated the iſland of Ravenzar) and his deſign likewiſe of viſiting nations and kingdoms; and, if poſſible, to kindle the ſacred flame of philanthropy in foreign courts, where, it appeared from what he had learned, to be almoſt, if not altogether extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by vice, luxury, and intemperance. 'Thoſe, ſaid he, who are in exalted ſtations, ſhould not deſire to live but to bleſs mankind, and render them ſtill
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:038495_0045_10122CBE8AF35C28"/>
happier. The longed-for period I hope is not far diſtant, when true knowledge and virtue will diffuſe their ſalutary influence through every region of the habitable world. Let us do all in our power to bring forward the happy aera. But, it is now time for us to return and prepare breakfaſt. I expect Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar will be with us, in a few minutes. How pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and refreſhing is a walk after ſo long a confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I hope to have a more pleaſant one preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when we ſhall viſit the Genie's palace, and the few not altogether unhappy inhabitants of the iſland.'</p>
            <p>'Ah! Prince, thou wilt for once be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! for this is the only walk thou art to enjoy for ſeveral years yet to come. Power ſuperior to thine, and to mine, hath otherwiſe decreed for thee! thou muſt be again circumſcribed within the limits of thy little priſon;<note n="*" place="bottom">Heaven diſappoints man his favorite, but for his good.

Make haſte therefore, continued the voice of one unſeen, to traverſe the ocean, and viſit far diſtant countries; purſuing the different courſes, as the inſpiring and protecting power ſhall direct thee. Be wary, and omit nothing. Remember the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected lock. I am not permitted to render myſelf viſible, nor again to addreſs thee till ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou ſhalt return to this iſland. Ravenzar bids thee farewell, and proſper.

            <p>THE fortunate ſon of Renien found his tapeſtry had not deceived him, when he peruſed the deed of gift from Ravenzar, which was written on a marble ſlab in letters of gold, and witneſſed by four other Genies, his friends who lived in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior of Africa, and who had juſt called to carry him thither, on affairs of higheſt moment. The marble ſlab, on which the deed was written, was framed with gold and diamonds, and bordered with beautiful paintings of romantic ſcenes. It was hung up on the wall, in the Prince's chamber, by the ſide of his couch, in the place of his favorite picture. It was indeed a noble ornament there. His liberal benefactor could well ſpare the palace, and treaſures, as likewiſe the iſland, as he owned ſeveral other palaces in different parts of the world, equally enriched with gold and diamonds, and vaſt tracts of land, equal to any in the moſt fertile coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But rich, profuſely rich as Prince Nytan was now become, he valued not his treaſures, but as they ſerved to promote the happineſs of others. The hour when he ſhould again viſit this iſland was wrote on the ſlab; and was diſtanced three years and an half from that of his leaving it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the chamber progreſſed with an unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented

velocity, the Prince and Geſſeng, were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their ſtudies; till they found themſelves on the continent of Africa. Nytan clothed himſelf mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently, and put on his head a crown of gold, a preſent from Ravenzar, as was likewiſe a golden ſceptre. He then ſent out Geſſeng to aſſemble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, the king of the country, and his nobles on buſineſs of high import to their future grandeur and felicity; ordering Geſſeng to repreſent in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming terms, the impracticability of his leaving his habitation, or paſſing over the threſhold of his door, till he had viſited other nations, and fulfilled his high commiſſions.</p>
            <p>To contract the relation of Reſhang, let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſay, the Prince was cordially received by king Zanger and his nobility who entered into his benevolent views, and eagerly imbibed his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; gratefully accepting the uſeful books pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them in their own tongue. Here the Prince, having been ſtationary five weeks, took leave of the king, the nobility and gentlemen, and with Geſſeng, bent his courſe to other regions, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to viſit them again in ſome future period, when he hoped the king and himſelf ſhould be able to congratulate each other on the ſucceſs of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors for the good of that kingdom, and when he likewiſe hoped to find their ſalutary influence extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the neighbouring petty kingdoms. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſettled the means of their correſpondence while abſent from each other.</p>
            <p>After Prince Nytan had ſpent near three years and an half, (as was determined) inſtructing kings and their ſubjects, in a great number of barbarous nations, and laid the foundation of future happy revolutions; he at length, bent his courſe to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of Ravenzar, and haſtened to accompliſh thoſe

great and noble deſigns he had ſo much at heart. He therefore, with eagerneſs, exerciſed his ſkill to accelerate his progreſs. Perhaps, wiſe and good as he was, he was rather too impatient; and Heaven might ſee fit a little to check the rapidity of his thoughts and the incredible velocity <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

deſcended, at the moment Prince Nytan clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the window; but almoſt as inſtantaneouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain immerged from the waves, and aſcended into the air; when all was calm! The mountains were melted, rent and ſcattered; the bodies of thoſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Genies, (for ſuch they were) were annihilated; and thoſe miſchievous ſpirits, ſeized with panic terror, never afterwards dared to appear aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
            <p>Thus the fortunate ſon of Renien experienced a third deliverance from the efforts of his malicious and vengeful enemies. The ſecond was from the ſuddenly conceived ſtratagem of the huge Leviathan, who ſwallowed up Geſſeng, and whoſe further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, when the Prince ſhould have thrown his ſpear, as he requeſted of him, to vaniſh with that taliſman to the bottom of the ſea; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Prince being deprived of it, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably periſh. This ſtratagem of the wicked Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, transformed into a monſtrous fiſh, was as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly defeated, as conceived and attempted. Was not ſuch an event deſigned to admoniſh the young adventurer of the importance of the moſt careful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the minuteſt affairs? That it was ſo, was fully aſcertained to him by the memento from Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar—remember the neglected lock: and ſhould not this laſt terrible event effectually ſerve to ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize his mind, inſpire weighty reflections, ſhew him his dependance, and reſtrain his vivacity and over-eagerneſs in his purſuits? The inſtructions, deducible from both, were indeed of the laſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to his conduct and ſucceſs through life. Neither were they loſt upon the Prince any more than were the good counſels of the Fairy. He renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his confidence in the arbiter and diſpoſer of worlds, and conductor of the deſtinies of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who, he well knew, could remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:038495_0051_10122CCA2B5790D8"/>
ſhould they obſtruct his progreſs in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the good of mankind: <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> effect which was all he deſired. For, to be himſelf happy without beholding the happineſs of his fellow creatures, was the furtheſt of all things from the wiſh of his noble and generous heart. He could by no means be bleſt in himſelf, but in ſure proſpect of the felicity of every exiſtence in the creation. The fairy Leing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reing continued with Prince Nytan till his arrival at the iſland of Ravenzar. She informed him what ſhe had done with the rebellious prieſts, and of the fate of the arch rebel Sanden. The prieſts were confined to the mines for a certain time; which being expired, they were to exiſt ſeparately, and at the greateſt diſtance from each other, in a ſtate of trial, and with a ſcanty allowance. The treacherous and manoeuvering miniſter was ſecluded in a grove on the very iſland to which Nytan was now haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſurrounded with perpetual darkneſs; in which condition he was to remain till the Fairy's deſigns upon him, ſhould be accompliſhed by Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himſelf; to which purpoſe ſhe gave him ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtructions. Being now ſafely landed on the iſland, Leingreing bid him and Geſſeng an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate adieu; acquainting them that Ravenzar was ſtill in the interior of Africa, and would be ſome time detained from viſiting them; and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it was he had made over to the Prince, his iſland, palace and treaſures. She likewiſe inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that the entrance into the Genie's palace would be rendered viſible to them as they were walking.</p>
            <p>The fairy Leingreing being gone, the Prince and Geſſeng went to a fountain and bathed. The ſun was ſetting, when they returned to the chamber; where after taking ſome refreſhment, and ſecuring the door and window, they retired to bed, leaving
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:038495_0052_10122CCC9FE28960"/>
two wax candles burning on a marble table, which ſtood at the bed's head. There was nothing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb their repoſe. Nytan's was the more ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by renewed liberty. 'Though I long to be with my parents, my ſiſters, and other friends, ſaid the Prince, as he was dreſſing in the morning, yet ſo are the duties of my life circumſtanced, that it will not be in my power to enjoy ſo great a pleaſure, till I have been through Europe, and effected ſome very important things for myſelf and this iſland. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it affords me a great ſatisfaction that my dear Fairy has informed me they were in good health; that the monſter rebellion, was cruſhed, and fanat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aciſm breathing its laſt. Agreeable tidings theſe, my Geſſeng! they will animate our zeal in the cauſe of liberty, of truth and virtue. Let us haſten, then, to the little community of this iſland, which we have been ſo long prevented from viſiting. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we will deſcend into the palace of our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.'—</p>
            <p>The enterprizing ſon of Renien, had already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed exploits of benevolence, which no confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment found means to baffle, or ſchemes and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of malevolence to defeat—enterprizes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by great, but wicked ſpirits; beings endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an immortal ſtrength and activity. It is true, indeed, he was not unaided. But, who was the ſon of mortality, or, who among the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and moſt potent intelligences, that could, ever effect the accompliſhment of great deſigns without the aſſiſtance of others? Yet all—all, throughout the boundleſs regions of creation, are animated, guided, and rendered happily ſucceſsful, by its omnipotent Lord, in every glorious work of benevolence and love! Of theſe truths our enterpriſing philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt was fully ſenſible. Nor could he undertake, or hope for ſucceſs in any kind of adventure, without
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:038495_0053_10122CD01D17B930"/>
an unreſerved confidence in, and ſecret application to the great creator of worlds, and conductor of all their operations.</p>
            <p>The Prince and his companion having breakfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, walked out on the banks of the river, ſhaded by the fineſt trees, of various kinds, beſides fruit trees, which where on either ſide their way. Following the courſe of the river, they ſoon reach the huts of the inhabitants, who were not a little ſurprized at the ſight of two ſtrangers. The Prince aſſembling them under the ſhades of a venerable oak, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with his deſigns, and gained their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Moſt of thoſe men had been very infirm, the chief of the time of their inhabiting the iſland. The ſpot on which they reſided, was exceeding pleaſant. The mountains and woods formed a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent amphitheatre around them, ſituated as they were in an extenſive valley, interſperſed with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of groves and fruit trees of all kinds, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which perfumed the air, whilſt the feathered ſongſters entertained them with their charming melody. They were gradually regaining health, and were indeed greatly pleaſed and animated with the behaviour and deſigns of their new friend and benefactor, who next bent his courſe towards the lofty ridge of mountains that divided the iſland into two equal parts. Through a vaſt rock among theſe mountains, he entered the Genie's (or rather his palace, with Geſſeng. Striking the rock with his foot, it opened, and diſcovered to them a ſtaircaſe of white marble, which they deſcended, the rock cloſing upon them. There was a glimmering light, which increaſed as they deſcended, till all was bright refulgent day. As they walked on, a vaſt hall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before them, at the end of a ſpacious court paved with black marble. The gate of the hall, at their approach, unfolded its two golden leaves. On
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:038495_0054_10122CD1AB2DB218"/>
entering, they were ſtruck with the beauty, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and magnificence of every thing that ſaluted their eyes. In the middle of the hall was a large table ſpread and loaded with proviſions of the moſt exquiſite kind. Above the table, on raiſed alcoves, ſtood forty maidens, and the ſame number of young men, who all bid the Prince welcome to his palace, adding that they were his ſervants, and ready to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his commands. 'My benevolent friend, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Prince Nytan, increaſes my obligations, in commiſſioning you to ſerve me. I have buſineſs for you, which I doubt not the ſervants of ſo great and good a lord, as Ravenzar, will perform with pleaſure. But you are ſtill to conſider yourſelves as belonging to him, and only graciouſly lent to me. After we have eaten and viewed the palace and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, we ſhall find ſome agreeable employment for you. Come then, Geſſeng, let us partake of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our common friend and benefactor.' Whilſt they ſat eating, the ladies entertained them with a concert of muſic, which was performed in that charming perfection of which fairies were ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. When they were riſen from the table, the Prince deſired two of the young men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, and ſhew him the buildings and apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the palace. Leaving the hall, they walked through a ſpacious gallery, viewed a number of magnificent chambers, and the immenſe riches in the treaſury apartments. They went, next, into the gardens; which were large, and beyond deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription beautiful. But that which gave an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible addition to thoſe enchanting ſcenes, was the appearance of above thirty of the moſt charming female forms, juſt riſen from the chryſtal fountain, in which they had been bathing, and covering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their milk white robes! The Prince and his attendants, being unobſerved by them turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:038495_0055_10122CD337CDC828"/>
into another alley of the gardens. Still the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly females were in view through the grove of trees, where they made a ſtand till they advanced from the fountain. Prince Nytan then moved towards them, and addreſſed them in the politeſt terms. After which they all walked together, and ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a ſuperb ſaloon: when one of the ladies, who appeared to be the eldeſt, knowing the Prince by the deſcription that had been previouſly given of his perſon, made him the following ſenſible addreſs. 'We are commanded, noble and generous youth, by our kind protector, to acquaint you with our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hiſtory, as one who will become intereſted in the felicity of our future lives. Though you ſee us among beings of a ſuperior order, we are of the race of mortals. Snatched from deſtruction, when in ſwaddling clothes, deſerted as we were by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural parents of the different countries in which we were born, by the benevolent and compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Ravenzar; under his fatherly care we have been nouriſhed and brought up in this palace, now your property. The all accompliſhed and paternal Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar has ſpared no pains in our education, that might render us fit to appear in the world, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in whatever ſphere of life it is allotted for us to move. By him we are now committed to your care and direction. What improvements we have made you are to be the judge, and aſſign us to ſuch depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as to you ſhall appear moſt elegible. To you, therefore, we cheerfully reſign ourſelves, repoſing in you an unreſerved confidence as our friend and future guide.' When the lady uttered this laſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they all roſe from their ſeats, and paid Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the reſpect he ſo juſtly merited, who converſed with them with that modeſty and ſuperior ſenſe ſo natural to him. After which they went together into the hall. The waiting maidens and young
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:038495_0056_10122CD6ADB5C840"/>
men, paid the ladies that deference in which they had always been inſtructed. Prince Nytan then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them, that he ſhould be abſent from them a day or two in the isſland; and, if longer, he ſhould ſend them word. Then ordering the two young men who attended him into the garden, to follow him and Geſſeng, he returned into the iſland. 'I am about to ſhew you, ſaid he to the two young men, as they followed him towards the huts, our little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and to ſet you and your felllow ſervants to work for us.'—'Which we ſhall do with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſure, replied the young men. Every command of yours, moſt reſpected Prince, will be to us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable obligation. Our ſervice, time, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ever yours.' 'Well then, my friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Nytan, (for ſuch I ſhall ever call you) you now ſee before you, the diminutive dwellings of the inhabitants of the iſland. You are this day to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them with better ones. Before morning let me have thirty new houſes compleated on this ſpot of ground over which we are walking. Let them be, likewiſe, furniſhed with every thing neceſſary and convenient. Beſides there muſt be out houſes, wells and gardens, with all things needful to each. I muſt have likewiſe a large palace, with a ſpacious and magnificent garden for myſelf with every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary building and furniture. All the buildings muſt be of grey poliſhed marble The hall, which muſt be erected in the middle of my palace, muſt be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently large to entertain a thouſand gueſts, without being in the leaſt embarraſſed for want of room. In the hall, too, a table muſt be ſpread with the moſt ſuitable proviſions, by the middle of next day, with twenty waiters to attend. Before this laſt is done, one half of the gold and diamonds in the palace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground muſt be depoſited in the treaſury in my
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:038495_0057_10122CD8416ACB00"/>
palace. Several ſervants, male and female are alſo to attend, in future, on each inhabitant of the iſland, who are to dine in my hall on the morrow. When all is compleated give me notice.</p>
            <p>The two young men bowed, ſignifying their cheerful obedience, and retired. Prince Nytan, then having diſmiſſed Geſſeng to look after his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and to wait there for him, directed his courſe to the wood where his once dangerous and inveter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate enemy was confined. The darkneſs in which he had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> involved, was now diſperſed, and he found <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> employed in reading, reclined on a ſoffa under a magnificent canopy ſurrounded by fragrant trees and flowers, with a carpet of green, before him of nature's forming.</p>
            <p>'Ah! worthy and amiable ſon of the illuſtrious Renien, exclaimed Sanden, as ſoon as he perceived the Prince advancing towards him, how rejoiced am I to ſee you, now no longer your enemy, but henceforward your moſt ſincere and zealous friend! I am confident, you will rejoice in the new forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a heart very early ſeduced and perverted by evil ſpirits. I was apprized by the fairy, your friend, and mine, of your coming hither, and have been impatiently expecting you. O then, much injured Prince! let this meeting correſpond with the wiſhes and requeſts of ſo charming a fairy as Leingreing, the ſovereign lady of the ſea; and make what trial you think proper of the ſincerity of my profeſſions. I am wholly devoted to you.'</p>
            <p>'Add no more, replied the generous ſon of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nien, from henceforward, we are friends. As ſuch, let me embrace Sanden, and now, lay upon me your commands, and they ſhall be punctually fulfilled.' After many tears, Sanden reſumed his diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Though, my dear Prince, I have the moſt ardent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to viſit my family, and to throw myſelf at my

ſovereign's feet, yet I am ready, with the greateſt pleaſure, to attend you, wherever you are going, that I may be perpetually convincing you of the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my friendſhip and love.'</p>
            <p>'It is moſt reaſonable, anſwered Prince Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that you ſhould firſt return home, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in ſo doing, you will, at this juncture, beſt ſerve our common cauſe, at the ſame time that you gratify your own wiſhes, which are highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and which, I perceive, correſpond with the ſentiments of the Fairy, our common friend.—Obſerve yonder exhibition, ſtationary in the air.' Sanden lift up his eyes, and beheld, in the air, a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a large veſſel, and an Iſland to which the veſſel was arrived, and caſting anchor. As they both viewed the veſſel, the iſland diſappeared, and the veſſel moved forward, deſcending to the ſea ſhore, to which a tall figure, on its deck pointed. 'Then we muſt even follow it, ſaid Nytan. This calls you immediately home. As we are walking, I will conſider, and afterwards propoſe to you what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages I would derive from this unexpected ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.'</p>
            <p>When the two friends had walked in ſight of the ſea, they eſpied the veſſel. The iſland was on all ſides ſurrounded with rocks of that prodigious height, that no mortal could penetrate into it without the aid of ſuperior power. Before they eſpied the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, they had aſcended a mountain which overlooked the rocks. The fairy Leingreing now deſcended in a chariot, drawn by winged horſes, and ſaluting the Prince and Sanden—'Come, mount into the chariot, ſaid ſhe, and let us away. They were no ſooner ſeated with the fairy, in the chariot, than the horſes expanded their ſable wings, and courſed their way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> between the earth and heavens, down to the ſea ſhore, where the veſſel lay at anchor. In a
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:038495_0059_10122CDC314B2400"/>
few minutes the travellers, with the Fairy their conductor, were on board, and the veſſel ſet ſail. The ſon of Renien then propoſed, that after the veſſel was arrived at Pekin, and Sanden reſtored to his friends and his ſovereign, he ſhould requeſt of the Emperor, in his name, to ſend the ſhip back loaded with goods, and families of the pooreſt ſort, to ſettle in his iſland; acquainting the Emperor with the condition of the iſland, and the progreſs he was making in its ſettlement. This being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to, and a letter wrote and delivered to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, for the Emperor, they ſeparated with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate embraces; the ſhip purſued its courſe, and the fairy conveyed Prince Nytan, in her aerial cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, to his chamber; where Geſſeng was waiting his coming, and had made ready his ſupper. The ſun had now but one hour to finiſh his diurnal courſe, when the Fairy and Prince entered the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſat down to ſupper; enjoying the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpects from the window and converſing on the moſt uſeful and entertaining ſubjects. Supper being ended, they walked out, and ſeated themſelves on a moſſy couch, where the woods afforded them an agreeable ſhade. They had a fine proſpect of the river before them, of the lawns and groves on the oppoſite ſide, and a ridge of mountains covered with hanging rocks and woods. The birds charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with their harmonious notes. The whole ſcene around them was enchantingly romantic and pictureſque; and led them into an affecting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on the glorious and magnificent ſcenes of creation, till their minds were elevated, and enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured! and in the warm effuſions of their grateful and admiring hearts they poured forth in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ode:—</p>

            <p>The Fairy Leingreing was ſo well pleated with this behaviour of the enraptured youth, that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed her former bleſſing, and made him a preſent of a moſt beautiful diamond ring, as a further teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of her friendſhip and eſteem. They then roſe up, and walked, converſing together, till late in the evening, when the Fairy departed, and left her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friends to their neceſſary repoſe.</p>
            <p>'How vigilant is our amiable benefactor for our good, exclaimed Prince Nytan, as they faſtened the chamber door, and prepared for bed.—What illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious deeds of benevolence hath ſhe already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for our ſecurity and happineſs, and ſtill is ſhe exerciſing her great power and talents to the ſame generous purpoſes.—Then our other great and powerful friends—thoſe too we ſhall ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the profoundeſt reſspect, the moſt ſervent

gratitude and love! will it not be happy, Geſſeng, to ſee them all together, before we are again called to leave our iſland? I ſhall uſe all the influence I have to effect ſuch a meeting. But let us take our needful reſt. Tomorrow will be a day of more than ordinary buſineſs.'</p>
            <p>The Prince had acquainted Geſſeng with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing change effected on the miniſter, Sanden, and the buſineſs he was gone to tranſact with the Emperor, his father. 'It will probably, ſaid he, as he entered his bed, require a month or longer, to collect the families, agreeably to my requeſt. The Emperor will be very particular in his choice of them. I intend, however, by the time they are here, to have their houſes ready, and every thing completed for them that will be neceſſary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and, likewiſe, the men we have with us ſettled according to my wiſhes.' 'May benignant Heaven, replied Geſſeng, grant you every wiſh, and my felicity will be complete.' 'To that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignant Heaven, returned Nytan, let us commit ourſelves, our friends, and all mankind, till we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake in the morning, to bleſs the kind, protecting power.'—Sleep ſoon cloſed their eyes, and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned guardian angels watched around their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows!—The morning found them refreſhed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated for the buſineſs of the day. They aroſe and bathed in the fountain. Nytan walked with a book in his hand, enjoying the delicious pleaſures which ſo fine a country afforded: whilſt Geſſeng, equally happy and delighted, prepared their morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repaſt. Having breakfaſted, they walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the groves, waiting the arrival of the two young men, who were to notify the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their orders. They ſoon made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, requeſting the two friends to viſit and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine

their works.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Verres,</hi> the hiſtorian of <hi>Xuntien,</hi> hath not reared the buildings, and peopled the iſland, with the expedition of Reſhang. He, however, relates all as accompliſhed in grandeur unprecedented, and with diſpatch unparalled, the efforts of mightieſt genius and induſtry, which effect the greateſt wonders.</note> Prince Nytan with Geſſeng, haſtening with the young men, found every thing done to his mind. 'Now ſaid he go and fetch hither the beautiful company of orphans, and their reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attendants. We ſhall be waiting for them in the hall.' His ſervants obeyed, he walked on, with Geſſeng, to the men who inhabited the huts, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate, and introduce them to their new buildings, which the intervening groves prevented them from obſerving. But, when Nytan brought them forth, and in view of the buildings and gardens, great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was their aſtoniſhment and admiration. Every thing, indeed, they beheld, was beautiful, grand, and elegant. Their houſes which were of grey poliſhed marble, ſtood in a circular form, at proper diſtances from each other and made a noble and magnificent appearance. Nytan's palace, being at a conſiderable diſtance from them, was ſcarcely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, for the intervening groves. The men having viewed and examined their gardens and buildings, and expreſſed their admiration and grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude to their benefactors, followed him to his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace, which was encompaſſed with a wall of grey marble. They entered a magnificent gate, and croſſing a ſpacious court, aſcended by four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſteps, into the hall. It was a vaſt apartment, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the utmoſt magnificence. The ſoffas were of cloth of gold, the carpets of green velvet, and every thing was anſwerable. A large table ſtood in the middle of the hall, ſumptuouſly furniſhed,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:038495_0064_10122CE7545A9A10"/>
and the beaufat dazzled the eyes with a profuſion of veſſels and flaggons, cups and diſhes of gold and diamonds. Here, being all ſeated, they were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, by the Prince and Geſſeng, with delicious wines and fruits, as a refreſhment after walking. Next, he led them into his garden, which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the beauty and grandeur of the palace. it was of vaſt extent; and contained every thing in it that the Indies produce, a number of hills, and leſſer eminences, adorned with groves, and all ſorts of trees, riſing here and there to the view, gave an inexpreſſible addition to the lovelineſs of the ſcene. Here they wandered, in ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate companies, through allies, lawns, and groves, till a meſſenger arrived, and acquainted Prince Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the company, ſent for, were in the palace. He, therefore, gathered his friends about him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with them to the hall: where, all being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, they ſat down to dinner. The young men and maidens, the ſervants appointed, by Ravenzar, to attend on Nytan, retired by his order, on ſome important buſineſs. Their ſervices were never for mere oſtentation. Prince Nytan, with Geſſeng, waited on their gueſts; while cheerfulneſs and good humor enlivened the converſation. Here was an aſſembly worthy the contemplation of thoſe ſuperior beings, who, unſeen, watch over mankind. They were the firſt inhabitants of a once ſolitary iſland; the founders of a community moſt illuſtrious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable. The men had learned virtue and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the ſchool of adverſity. They were hardly paſſed the meridian of life; and through temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and proper exerciſe, were faſt recovering their former ſtrength, alertneſs and activity. Their minds were well informed, and capable of greater improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the advantages they were now to obtain, with reſpect to which, Prince Nytan had as yet but
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038495_0065_10122CE9F455E748"/>
executed a ſmall part of his generous deſigns. Their perſons were agreeable and commanded a great ſhare of reſpect. The female part of this aſſembly, (whoſe number exceeded that of the men by one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we except Geſſeng and the Prince,) might with ſtrict juſtice be called perfect beauties. For, it ſeemed impoſſible that nature herſelf, with all her art and power, could add a greater luſtre to her charms, or education to their accompliſhments. It could, therefore, be no manner of wonder, if the men became faſcinated with ſuch an aſſemblage of female beauty, luſtre and dignity. After they had dined, and ſeparated to different apartments, one of the men, who uſed the greateſt freedom with Prince Nytan, requeſted of him to be informed from what part of the creation he had drawn together ſuch amazing prodigies of beauty and lovelineſs; and where they intended in future to diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 'Alas! exclaimed he, if they are to leave us, I know not what will become of us. For all my friends appear to be enamored beyond the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of recovery. When they left the hall and bid us adieu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every man of us was ſeized with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.'—'Oh! replied the prince, you talk indeed like a romantic lover! and if all your friends are in your ſituation, we ſhall hear of nothing but flames and darts, deadly wounds from cupid's fatal bow and quiver! ſure nothing can be done for you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Prince, laughing, in ſuch deſperate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;—loſt to every thing but love! but, if my friend, it be really as you ſay,—perhaps I have but one remedy for this ſudden and violent ſtorgee, and that is to hurry away thoſe dangerous beauties as faſt as poſſible.'</p>
            <p>Prince Nytan had commiſſioned all the ſervants of Ravenzar to the ſubterranean palace, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things he ſhould have occaſion for among
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:038495_0066_10122CEC0ED4EBB8"/>
which the principal article was a large collection of books; the maiden ſervants were employed in houſehold affairs. He now retired to his chamber in the palace; where he found the books ranged in good order on the ſhelves round his cloſet. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining them he found they were a moſt valuable collection on every art and ſcience, and the beſt hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, many of them in the ſeveral languages he underſtood. He ſat down at his cloſet window which looked into the ſpacious and magnificent gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, limited only by the mountains that divided the iſland in two equal parts. The proſpect before him was ſublimely grand and beautiful, and adapted to excite, in a mind like his, the moſt noble and generous ideas. While he ſat at the window in delightful contemplation, one of the ſervants entered to know his further commands. 'To-morrow ſaid the Prince, you are to make a wide paſſage through the vaſt mountainous rocks that environ this iſland, and form a convenient and ſafe harbour for my ſhip. This done, you muſt complete a hundred more dwelling houſes, with every thing needful about them. They are for my expected countrymen. Acquaint me when all is finiſhed.'</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of the new-riſing city ſpent the afternoon in removing from their huts to the new buildings. The ladies, having apartments allotted them in the palace ſpent part of the time, after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in viewing them, and the reſt in roving in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, through the delicious garden. Geſſeng, for his part, paid a viſit to the ſolitary chamber, were he ſat alone, meditating on the unrivalled charms of the youngeſt of the female orphans. She was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his own age, that is to ſay, nearly eighteen, and had made at firſt ſight, the tendereſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon his heart. In ſhort, every man except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince, had placed his affections on a lady.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038495_0067_10122CEDCFF4FDD0"/>
So that the one and thirty orphans were all ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed with lovers, whom they likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded with equal affection: and the reſult as will appear in the following book, was exceeding hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for both parties.</p>

            <p>THE happy company, at Nytan's palace, already noticed, walked in parties, in the garden. Sometimes they reclined on the green banks, ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by lofty pines and elms; at others, in delightful alcoves. On one ſide of the garden was a large and beautiful pavilion, ſituated on one of the higheſt hills, and the windows of which afforded the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting proſpects of woods and lawns, hills and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, fields and grazing cattle, of the river, and the new buildings. A ſtream of water ran winding by it, widening to the other ſide of the garden, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaded with groupes of trees and was moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to view, from the palace windows. Nytan took with him to the pavilion, ſeveral of the men whom he chanced to meet, as he walked out; and who were converting with an equal number of ladies. Here the maidens brought them tea, wine, bread and fruit, with which likewiſe, the other parties were ſerved, in the alcoves, and under the ſhades, where they were found reclining. In this manner they paſſed great par of ſeveral days ſucceſſively. At night they were all aſſembled in the hall to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In the mean time love ever active and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:038495_0069_10122CF36238FC80"/>
was perpetually exerting itſelf, in all its various and refined arts of perſuaſion and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the hearts of the two ſexes, whether in companies ſeparate, in one aſſembly, or alone, in the receſſes of the chamber, or the groves. Thoſe with Nytan in the pavilion, were diſcerned by him to have made great progreſs in the tender, mutual affection which ſhould ever precede the intimate and indiſſoluble tie of Hymen's bands. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation turned upon the refined and exalted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of domeſtic life. The men, who had been well educated, diſcovered excellent minds, and juſt ſentiments, in diſcourſing upon that ſubject. The ladies appeared to be exceedingly gratified by every thing they advanced. Nytan ſung them a fine ſong, in praiſe of a domeſtic life, and the marriage ſtate; and the company applauded him with the higheſt commendations. Several inſtruments of muſic were on one of the tables. The ladies, at the requeſt of the Prince, took them in their fair hands, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tuned them, played ſeveral fine airs, accompanied with their charming voices. The men were in raptures! and prevailed upon them to gratify them over and over again with their inimitable perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. This continued, till night brought all the company together in the hall. Geſſeng was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe returned to them. He had an unuſual air of gaiety that night, and made ſwift advances in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the fair miſtreſs of his heart. Supper being over, the remainder of the evening was ſpent in muſic and dancing and ſprightly converſation, till the ſeaſonable hour, of repoſe admoniſhed them to retire to their ſeveral apartments. At parting the men ſignified, their intentions of lodging, in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in their new habitations. Nytan gave to each man two ſervants to attend upon him till they ſhould hereafter be better provided for, on that ſcore, as
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:038495_0070_10122CF4EF787740"/>
he told them with a great deal of gaiety. The men, however, continued their daily viſits to the palace, to enjoy the charms of female converſation.</p>
            <p>The ſix hundred houſes, which Prince Nytan had ordered to be built, being compleatly finiſhed, he took ſeveral of his workmen to his little chamber, which ſtill remained where it firſt landed; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to erect a female ſtatue on its roof, with a globe in one hand, and an olive branch in the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and the emblematical dove on its head. The whole to be ornamented with gold and diamonds. This was done in half an hour, and made a grand and beautiful appearance. Nytan looked on the workmen with admiration, to ſee with what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing rapidity, and conſummate ſkill and ingenuity they worked off, and erected the ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue; which being compleatly finiſhed, ſeemed to be a real living exiſtence, and to repreſent the Prince's ſweet and amiable diſpoſition, and peace and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity to the world: He, being perfectly ſatiſied with the workmanſhip, immediately ſet all the workman to building houſes, and laying out roads. Two, on each ſide his palace, were cut out through the mountains. And the river, which had many branches winding about the iſland, and which ran under the rocks into the ocean, was rendered navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, from the harbour two hundred miles, and within twenty of its ſource. Whilſt theſe vaſt works were going on, our diligent philanthropiſt retired to his little chamber for the reſt of the day, where he paſſed the time in reading till the ſun was ſitting. When, riſing, and about to return to the palace, a ſplendid and beautiful picture came flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the window, with a little cage of gold wire hanging to it, encloſing a fine blue-bird. The picture fixing itſelf on the wall of the chamber. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt the Prince, cried, 'O moſt excellent
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:038495_0071_10122CF6B4F33CA0"/>
Prince and chief mandarin of China! behold what a lovely bird I have brought you! I was commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, with it to you, from my good aunt, the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perieng. The bird is to accompany you in your travels, and you will find it a very diverting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. You muſt hang the cage cloſe to your win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that it may enjoy the ſweet refreſhing breezes, and the fine proſpects. But, Prince, though it is now ſun-ſet, you muſt take a trip with us to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of pictures, and ſee how we live. There is no night there. However, you may eaſily get back to your palace before bed time.' 'Thank you, gracious, lovely picture! replied Nytan, for your ſweet bird, as likewiſe for your kind invitation, of which I ſhall avail myſelf, and ſet out this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.' So ſaying he ſet his chamber in motion through the air; and half an hour conveyed them to the iſland of pictures. But how greatly was the Prince aſtoniſhed, to ſee there, a vaſt and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent palace, of an amazing height, and almoſt bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs dimenſions! and illumined by four ſuns at each corner of the lofty open roof! which dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſpendor beyond mortal ſuffrance! but Prince Nytan was, for a while, rendered capable of endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. They deſcended into the court, and walked up to the grand porch.<note n="‡" place="bottom">This is not unlike ſome myſterious deſcriptions of the affairs of the ſuperior order of beings. Men, in all ages, have effected or pretended to know much of thoſe magnalia.

            </p>
            <p>This iſland was famous for nothing beſides the palace, and its inhabitants, in a vaſt wood, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of which was the fairy Perieng, who was ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038495_0072_10122CF8D4461FE0"/>
thouſand years old. The pictures of the palace were wives of Genies, who though good genies, were, for ſome little inadvertences, ſentenced to a ſtate of gentle diſcipline, and baniſhment from their conſorts, who were ſtationary in the vaſt hall of the palace, in a ſtate of contemplative confinement, till their huſbands ſhould be reſtored to them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed they were allowed to make excurſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or were ſent on important errants, at which times they were to take ſpecial care not to fall aſleep, leſt ſome diſagreeable accident ſhould befall them; as was the caſe with the one Nytan picked up from a miry canal, ſomewhat diſfigured, but ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its internal luſtre. The fairy Perieng was her aunt, and all the others were her relations. Hence it was that ſhe took care of them, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attentive to their fortunes, and happy in their rational improvements, and progreſs in virtue and wiſdom. She gave them the form of pictures, likewiſe, in compliment to her ſex as the faireſt part of the creation. Some of them, in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, went through a variety of adventures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could get back again to the palace, and their happier ſtations in the hall.</p>
            <p>After they had gone through the grand porch, they beheld before them an old lady, of very dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utive ſize, (for ſuch was her deſtined figure for two hundred years,) ſtanding at the foot of her throne, waiting their approach. It was the fairy Perieng. 'I wanted much to ſee you young man, ſaid ſhe to Prince Nytan. Follow me into my cloſet. Then ſending away the picture, on ſome new errand, ſhe uſhered the Prince into her cloſet, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with him in converſation for the ſpace of three hours and an half, giving him many ſage counſels for the direction of his future conduct.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:038495_0073_10122CFB72384320"/>
She then carried him into the great hall, where ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing he ſaw, was amazing, and paſt adequate deſcription. The walls were looking-glaſs mixed with flames of fire. In theſe were the pictures fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in frames of fire, gold and diamonds; appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every moment, of the pictures, the living orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inals, and that, with a ſplendor too dazzling for the eyes of mortals. They ſang ſeveral charming ſongs, complimenting the Prince, and his blue-bird. The hall being wholly open above, the ſplendors of the palace overpowered the Prince, and he fainted. The fairy Perieng therefore ordered her ſervants to convey him to his chamber, where coming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he heard the voice of the Fairy—'Return quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beloved Prince, and proſperity attend thee.</p>
            <p>The Prince found his blue-bird very merry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany on the way home. 'But what am I to do? ſweet bird, cried he, as the chamber reſted on the ground in its former ſtation, will you ſuffer me to take you with me to my palace?' 'O by no means, replied the bird. But I will tell you how to pleaſe me. Tranſport the chamber into your garden, in ſome obſcure grove, there to remain inviſible to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one but yourſelf: and come and ſee me every day, and as often, each day as poſſible. I ſhall then be very well contented, with the window and door of the chamber left open, and ſomething to eat and drink.' 'I will do every thing you ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,' returned Nytan,—'Then love me exceſſively, rejoined the blue-bird, and I will ſing you the moſt charming and diverting ſongs in the world, and tell you the fineſt ſtories, when you ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to hear me.' 'Which will be as often as poſſible, added Nytan, for you talk, and look ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantingly, that nothing can pleaſe me like your ſweet company.' 'Ah! returned the blue-bird. I wiſh with all my heart you may never be weary of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:038495_0074_10122CFD89F9C988"/>
me.' 'Heaven forbid exclaimed the Prince, ſuch excellence ſhould periſh! and now my charming prattler! we are in the place of your choice. See what a lovely grove of trees and fragrant flowers ſurround us, except the little opening before your window, which commands ſome of the fineſt views of the garden. What further orders have you for your devoted friend?' 'Go, anſwered the bird, to your company in the hall, bid them good night, and go to bed, and dream of your little lovely blue-bird till morning.' 'I will obey you to the utmoſt of my power, replied the Prince and ſo ſweet lovely bird, good night.' Good night, good night, cried the blue-bird: adieu charming young man, adieu!</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Dream all the night, and only dream of me,</l>
               <l>And, if I ſleep, I'm ſure to dream of thee.'</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Prince Nytan was ſhewn, by the fairy Perieng, ſeveral moſt valuable curioſities, among which was a moſt ancient Chineſe manuſcript, tracing that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to its original, and relating many great and wonderful things of which the world is ignorant. She promiſed him, the manuſcript ſhould be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his poſſeſſion, after a cerrtain number of years. 'Be very careful and tender of the little blue-bird I ſent you, added the Fairy; and you may one day, find your account in it, and know further than you can at present, how much your powerful friends are intereſted in your happineſs and proſperity. To-morrow, you muſt go to the palace of libraries, and load your chamber with the beſt books compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Genies and Fairies, and likewiſe, by men of the greateſt learning and experience. There, alſo, you will find many finely wrote books by learned and ingenious women. Thoſe you have divide among the men and women you have with you. You will

find no difficulty in gaining admiſſion into the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace: here are the keys.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the Prince furniſhed his men with a further ſupply of books from his own col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and ſet out with his chamber and blue-bird, for the palace of libraries. He ſpent ſeveral hours there, examining the books. Each diſtinct libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was compoſed by one author only. Having load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his chamber, leaving ſcarcely room for himſelf and the blue-bird, (which entertained and charmed him all the while, with its ſweet melody and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,) they returned before ſun-ſet. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing following he ſupplied his friends with books. Then taking his ſpying-glaſs, he went up to the roof of his palace, and looked out for his expected ſhip; though the time was far from being elapſed which he had allowed for the voyage, yet he knew not with what expedition the Emperor might tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act his affairs. Beſides, he had a mind to ſee his father and the family. He viewed the palace—the grand metropolis and all the great cities, as far as the glaſs could afford the proſpect. At length, he ſaw the ſpacious windows of his father's breakfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apartment open, the Emperor, Empreſs, his ſiſters, and ſeveral other ladies enter and ſeat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the breakfaſt table. They all appeared to be very merry and in good health; which gave the ſincereſt pleaſure to ſo affectionate and dutiful ſon. After viewing them again and again, he was obliged to deny himſelf of ſo delightful a gratification, and deſcend to look after his important affairs. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made uſe of his glaſs, and never failed of ſeeing his friends in good health, rendering thanks to Heaven for ſo deſirable a privilege, when ſo far ſeparated from his paternal home. The Prince frequently took Geſſeng with him to his cloſet, for ſeveral hours, and like wife the men,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:038495_0076_10122D013974B998"/>
three or four at a time, that they might conſult to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on affairs of conſequence to their future proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. And they were all daily employed, beſides, in the moſt uſeful ſtudies.</p>
            <p>In the mean time his little blue bird was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. There was an inchanting ſweetneſs in its tongue, which often drew him to the cage. In honor to his lovely bird, which was perpetually talking and ſinging of love, he erected, on the roof of the little chamber, at the four corners, cupids of gold, whoſe ſpread-out wings were ſtudded with diamonds, as were the architives of the door and window. So that the whole outſide of the chamber being gold and diamonds, made a moſt ſplended and glorious appearance; eſpecially when open to the ſun. Whereas, to gratify the favorite bird, it was now concealed in a retired grove. The Prince took his bird out to view thoſe ornaments. He was anxious to know whether, (as ſhe examined them with apparent eagerneſs and ſurpriſe,) they afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an additional pleaſure to his ſweet companion. 'My dear Prince, ſaid the blue-bird, you have highly honored me, and convinced me more than ever of your friendſhip. Ah Prince! let us make us friends to the utmoſt, whilſt in this ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; for, if we gain no friends here, we can by no means expect to find them on our appearance in the future world. You have many and valuable friends. Go, Prince, haſten and make us as many as you can. We can never poſſeſs too many worthy heorts. Gain them in every region. Your talents, your accompliſhments, your engaging perſon and manners, your divine philanthropy; theſe will ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery where commend you to the great and good.'</p>
            <p>At length, the expected ſhip arrived. From the lofty roof of his palace, Nytan with joy beheld her ſafe moored in the harbour. He beheld and recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038495_0077_10122D045FF25840"/>
the countenances of his beloved countrymen, and haſtened in his chariot to the ſhore; leaving orders for twenty chariots to follow him. His friends were quickly advertiſed of this arrival, and wanted no other ſummons to follow their beloved benefactor. What a glorious ſcene was it to ſee this noble ſon of Renien embracing and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating his countrymen, though the pooreſt in all his fathers extenſive empire! They were men, women and children; and though poor, yet wiſely ſelected. Not a few among them, poſſeſſed knowledge and virtue, in a very eminent degree, though hitherto unfortunate, through various cauſes. They were conducted, ſome to the palace, others to the houſes of the inhabitants; beſides large tents were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately erected, that every individual might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably accommodated. Feaſts and entertainments now ſucceeded each other every day. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of the ſhip was conveyed from the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and divided among the new ſettlers, who now became rich. At length they were conducted to their new-prepared habitations, with their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in chariots, and other convenient carriages, attended by Prince Nytan, Geſſeng, and a few of their friends; the new roads being compleatly laid out and finiſhed for eaſy travelling. This was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a pleaſant journey to them all, through a fine country, abounding with every thing, and which might well be called the garden of the world. The Prince and his friends continued with them ſeveral days, when all being ſettled to their wiſhes and far beyond their moſt ſanguine expectations;—the Prince returned to be witneſs to a new and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſcene of wonder and joy. As he came within view of his palace, and the thirty new buildings, he was ſurpriſed to ſee the ſpacious openings crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with men, women and children, who, by their
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038495_0078_10122D05EE50C7F0"/>
dreſs appeared to be of foreign countries. He knew too much to fear an invaſion, nor was he long in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining by what means ſo vaſt a multitude of people had found their way into an iſland guarded by powers that no human wit or force could ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully oppoſe. He, therefore juſtly concluded his friendly fairies and Genies had brought ſome worthy ſettlers to repleniſh it. This was indeed the caſe. A meſſenger on horſeback, rode up to the prince, and acquainted him that Ravenzar wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him in the hall of his palace. As he was haſtening thither with the utmoſt expedition, he ſoon diſtinguiſhed his friend the Genie, by the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and benevolence of his countenance, advancing from the outer court of the palace to meet him. Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan alighted from his chariot. They were inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in each other's arms. After many endearing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, the Prince preſented to him Geſſeng, and his other friends, whom the Genie cordially embraced. Shouts aroſe from the chariots—' For ever live the great Ravenzar, and the all accompliſhed Nytan! Hail! happy friends and inhabitants of this highly favored iſland! in true glory and ſplendor forever flouriſh!—The two friends, and thoſe about them, bowed to the people, and then went up into the hall, where the orphan ladies, and their attendants, received them with joyful congratulations. An entertainment was ſoon prepared, at which they all ſat down, and every countenance expreſſed the moſt heartfelt pleaſure. The converſation at table, was gay and lively, and becoming gueſts ſo worthy, ſo all-accompliſhed. After eating and converſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, the company retired to the garden to walk; all but the two illuſtrious friends, who remained, converſing in the hall till towards evening, when Ravenzar went down into the ſubterranean palace. The new ſettlers, who were no leſs than eighteen
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038495_0079_10122D0781C199A8"/>
thouſand, were accommodated with magnificent tents, ſerved with every thing for which they had occaſion, beſides the beſt proviſions the iſland afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This multitude, of all ages and ſexes, had been long training up, by good fairies and genies, in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral receſſes, and ſubterranean palaces, for this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored iſland; this happy aſylum from a world of vice, luxury and oppreſſion. A fleet, of twelve vaſt ſhips, wafted them to the abodes of peace, freedom and virtue.—The genie Ravenzar retired not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſt, but to provide for the new inhabitants. He, therefore, who could eaſily perform the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things, cauſed his immenſe palace, with its buildings and gardens, to immerge from the bowels of the earth, and form themſelves into four ſpacious ſtreets, of elegant buildings. His gardens were divided into a great many, and one to each dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. Beſides, a great number of houſes were built, gardens laid out, and all compleatly finiſhed that very night. So that, in the morning, the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies had nothing to hinder them from taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their new habitations, and preparing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon their ſeveral occupations. Ravenzar hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very early given them notice, and ordered eight hundred ſervants to aſſiſt them in conveying to their houſes, their wives, children, and goods; before ſun-ſet they were all happily ſettled. The Genie then repaired to the palace, and requeſted Prince Nytan to aſſemble, in the hall, the thirty original inhabitants, with the one and thirty orphan ladies. He then ſeated himſelf at the upper end of the hall, waiting their attendance. When they were all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, together with Geſſeng and the Prince, Ravenzar addreſſed them in the following ſpeech:</p>
            <p>'Reſpectable and beloved friends! as I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of leaving you in a few hours, I have called you together, that I may fulfil the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:038495_0080_10122D09A6D9FFC8"/>
offices of friendſhip and love, which are to conduce to the perfection of your future felicity. Myſelf and my worthy frend and fellow labourer, Nytan, have been conſtantly attentive to every thing that might effectually conduce to your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory. You will, from henceforward, be left a long time to yourſelves, to form agreeably to your wiſhes, a perfect happy nation, which will encreaſe, in ſtrength and efficacy, through every ſucceeding age. Our beloved Nytan, muſt viſit other countries. Yet, ſtill, though abſent from you, we ſhall be attentive to your intereſt. The great power and abilities, with which I am inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt be in perpetual exertion: it is my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that they ſhould be ſo;—whilſt I ſoar on high, inviſible to mortals, or viſit every region of the hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable world; promoting as much as poſſible, its welfare, and defeating the nefarious plots of its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies. I boaſt not of my powers. Having noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but what I derive from the benificence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.—Should the Supreme withhold his benign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, I muſt ſoon be bereft of all my worth and abilities; even become unworthy the attention of the lovely, amiable children I ſnatched from ruin, and nurtured; whoſe minds I have formed to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and adorned with every valuable accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let our eyes be ever directed to the author of our exiſtence, and from whom we derive every bleſſing. Let unfeigned virtue, and true glory be our invariable practice and purſuit. True glory is founded only in the works of benificence and love; in theſe it will be impoſſible for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, without the ſacred energy of the glorious Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Being, whoſe we are. In him, therefore, let us place the moſt unreſerved confidence. His power will ſupport, his wiſdom will direct, his love
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038495_0081_10122D0C4C452CA0"/>
will render us compleatly bleſſed.—You, the firſt inhabitants of this fertile and delightful iſland.; you only, of all the happy thouſands that have arrived here to live with you as brethren; you, I ſay, are the only perſons deſtitute of female partners for life, and, of conſequence, your happineſs is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compleat. But this muſt be no longer. Take, then, the partners your eyes have already ſelected. They ſtand before you. Take, each of you, the fair ones hand you have choſen; their hearts I know, are yours.'—He ceaſed ſpeaking.—Each man then advanced to the fair orphans, and took the hand he had choſen;—Nothing loth.—Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar then proceeded:—'One is yet left ſolitary. My admired, and loved Geſſeng, ſhe is yours. I know her to be the choice of your heart.'—Take then the fair one's hand.—Geſſeng was not long in obeying.—The attendants were witneſſes to their mutual vows of conſtancy and love, and the Genie pronounced each couple married in the ſight of Heaven. Each ſaluted his bride. The two friends congratulated them, and gave them their bleſſing. Their attendants followed their example: and mirth and feſtivity concluded the day, and the evening. The day following, too, was a day of general feaſting and congratulation; and perfect felicity reigned throughout the whole iſland; if we except the poor ſolitary blue-bird, concealed in the grove. All the reſt of the birds were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.—O Prince! could you not have found a place, at leaſt, in one of the hall windows, for ſo lovely and beautiful a bird, whoſe ſweet notes out-rivalled all the ſongſters of the grove! Haſten Prince! you can do no leſs than carry the merry tidings to your lovely travelling companion. She will welcome you with a thouſand careſſes!—The truth is, the little blue-bird choſe rather to remain in its retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and was ſufficiently content with viſits from
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:038495_0082_10122D0E6448DD38"/>
the Prince, two or three times a day, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for it to eat, and the ſight of his engaging per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe mariages being happily conſummated, the Genie Ravenzar departed; and the newly arrived families being moſt advantageouſly ſettled in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the iſland, moſt of them applied themſelves to agriculture and manufactures. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, of both ſexes, were appointed for the children. A magnificent hall was erected, for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic buſineſs. Legiſlators were choſen; a council of Elders, and a Preſident. Laws and regulations eſtabliſhed. A book of records was kept in the hall chamber. In a word, every thing neceſſary, and advantageous, was eſtabliſhed with the moſt conſummate wiſdom. The leading men were of the thirty firſt inhabitants; (who had made large ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the knowledge and diſcernment they bro't with them into the iſland,) and likewiſe, of thoſe who were from the Empire of China. The beſt inſtructors were choſen for the youth, from fifteen years of age to twenty—who were educated in the principles of virtue and liberty, and every art and ſcience. The grand metropolis was called Xun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien,<note n="*" place="bottom">Xuntien, alias Pekin. The former name was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted.</note> after that of China. To the houſes of the firſt inhabitants, (who now took their wives home) were added, by the ſervants of the Genie, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, as yet unimproved, being reſerved for the Chineſe whom Geſſeng, (now ambaſſador to China) was commiſſioned to bring in the fleet, which was to ſail immediately for that kingdom of ſplendor.<note n="‖" place="bottom">A modern name for China, is ſaid to be Tamin, i. e. the Kingdom of Brightneſs.</note> Thoſe houſes, with the thirty belonging to the firſt

inhabitants and the great number erected by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar, now compoſed the firſt city and grand me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of the iſland, containing, at this period, twenty thouſand buildings all inhabited, except thoſe reſerved for the Chineſe expected.</p>
            <p>Geſſeng having ſailed with the fleet, Prince Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan took a ſolemn and affectionate leave of his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous friends, aſſembled in the public hall, in a valedictory addreſs, which he concluded with the following ſolemn and truly intereſting words:—</p>
            <p>'We who are ſo highly favored—we, who are ſo eminently enlightened, can never fail in the reſolves we have formed, to ſeek thoſe pleaſures to indulge thoſe gratificatioas, to purſue thoſe ſchemes of life only which Heaven approves. Every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence contrary to this, we well know to be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, and muſt tend to the ſubverſsion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled tranquility, health and happineſs we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Heaven's high will is our felicity. Its will therefore muſt be ours, ſo long as conſcious recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of heart is known to inſure our bliſs. Yes: rectitude will ever diſtinguiſh and ennoble our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the will of the Supreme will be ever our guide.</p>
            <p>'Many of us, (in preceding years, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which gave us birth,) have been ſated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with men who would have deprived us of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and enſlaved our minds. But we have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely taught to think and act as becomes the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born children of the Higheſt; and our liberties and privileges are here perfectly ſecure from invaſion. Let all our actions unchangeably evince our grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Heaven is guide, our guardian friend,</l>
               <l>Whoſe richeſt favors know no end:</l>
               <l>So let our love forever prove;</l>
               <l>And all in ſweeteſt concert move!</l>

               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:038495_0084_10122D12C8F1EEA8"/>
'Let us be ever pointing out to each other, in every ſublime view, the unrivalled beauties of pure virtue, the tranſporting pleaſures of undiſſembled love and benevolence, while a ſtrict uniform, invariable temperance, inſures to us all the bliſs of which our natures are capable.</p>
            <p>'We are now become a nation;—a nation col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected indeed, by Divine Providence, from many others;—a nation trained and diſciplined to real virtue. Such we ſhall continue, if we ceaſe not to reverence ourſelves. For we ſhall think with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and abhorrence of every vice. No more ſhall any of us glory in infamy and court deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in other countries which celeſtial interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone can ſave. Alas! to what a plight are ſome of them reduced! to what inexplicable miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are they ſwiftly haſtening! they are ſtruggling in fires that will ſhortly conſume them, unleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the kind interference of the gracious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But I go, citizens to plead with them. I ſhall remind them of the dignity of their origin; and ſhew them how beautiful they will look, when adorned with real goodneſs. To many I ſhall ſay, (and many I ſhall convince) the truly happy, worthy and illuſtrious, are the virtuous, the generous and the benevolent. It is ſuch the Creator loves, approves and bleſſes;—the tender, ſympathizing hearts in ſacred uniſon with his own, by virtue ſweetly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Many, (I ſhall ſay) have harangued finely on religion, benevolence, humanity, who in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them were errant cowards. And who are more mean and daſtardly than thoſe, that, with all their fine ſpeeches, pious and benevolent pretenſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold unmoved their fellow-creatures ſuffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round and in the midſt of them; yea, add to their miſeries by their oppreſſive meaſures! what kind
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:038495_0085_10122D1569617D98"/>
of religion is that, without bowels of compaſſion? ye vile pretenders to goodneſs! ſhrink and hide your heads forever; or, yet become worthy the human forms ye wear! Whence, (I ſhall add) whence ariſe the greateſt diſtreſſes among mankind, but from the ſelfiſh contemptible tempers of the powerful and rich among you? when we can brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny ourſelves to ſerve the indigent and reclaim the vicious; when we can give up our ardent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of ambition and ſenſuality, and perſevere, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt all embarraſſments, in promoting the good of every individual, however low and debaſed:—when we can thus nobly live to the creation, we ſhall wear, with real honor, the name of men, of a ſpecious gloriouſly formed, by omnipotence and love, for the true enjoyment of exiſtence. But your ignoble ideas, your churliſh diſpoſition, your deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table pride and vanity, your vices, of every kind, place you below the brutal creation. Nay; the moſt noiſome and loathſome of the inferior tribes of exiſtence are far more excellent than you. If there be a ſpark of goodneſs buried among you, let it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge from the darkneſs and ruin in which it hath been ſo long involved. Awake to real honour and glory! and become brilliant conſtellations in the unſullied galaxy of the virtuous ſons and daughters of freedom and truth, whoſe ſplendors illuminate the world, and are as unfading as the day of Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en! Experience the exalted pleaſures of undiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled virtue and benevolence, and henceforward la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to do good, to render others happy. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous labors of love, while they exalt and refine you for the high and grand enjoyments of immortals, will likewiſe add the greateſt ſtrength and glory to your national intereſts, and evince, in the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious point of view, how dear they are to Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.'</p>

'In this manner, citizens, ſhall I inculcate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred intereſting truths in the Countries to which I am called. As for us, confirmed as we are in the enjoyment of virtue, freedom and truth, we ſhall act like thoſe who rightly eſtimate their value: and, reſpecting, adoring and loving the benificent author of our being we ſhall love and reſpect each other as the wonderful and glorious workmanſhip of his hands, reared into exiſtence, and clothed with his comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be ever glorious and amiable in his eyes and in the eyes of each other. And let the ennobling diſpoſition, which we have embibed, be uniformly cheriſhed;—of preferring one another in both men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and civil eminences;—in wealth, in honor:—a diſpoſition ſo oppoſite to the low, mean, ſelfiſh tempers that are ſo prevalent in other nations;—well knowing it to be our chief buſineſs, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, to promote every one's happineſs, that not a ſingle ſigh of infelicity be heard. This truly phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropic diſposſition builds us up in real grandeur, advancing us nearer to the perfection of that Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from whence it originates. Let, therefore, this ſweet harmony and love increaſe which perfects our enjoyment of life, enhancing all its variety of genuine pleaſures—enſuring to us ſtill greater.</p>
            <p>Our intercourſe with other nations will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by that divine power on which we feel our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves continually dependant, whilſt we, at the ſame time, glory in ſuch dependance; that power which we always conſult with a filial confidence; and are happy indeed—Dear citizens—in every application the gracious being who ever takes delight in doing us good.

            <p>THE king of Perſia at his deceaſe, having no other child than a daughter, left her the heir of his dominions. She was poſſeſſed of a ſuperior underſtanding and incomparable beauty. Her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging manners and ſhining accompliſhments had attracted univerſal love and reſpect. It was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with univerſal ſatiſfaction the people ſaw her aſcend the throne of Perſia. Every day ſhe gave freſh proofs of her ſuperior talents, wiſdom and prudence, and though ſcarce two and twenty, her illuſtrious actions raiſed her a fame beyond any of her predeceſſors; and drew to her court, princes of the neighbouring kingdoms, who ſolicited her hand; but in vain. Her affections being engaged, ſhe had neither a hand nor a heart to yield them. Thoſe princes, therefore, gave over their ſolicitations, and returned home with diſappointment and chagrin. One of them carried his reſentment ſo far, as to enter the Queen's dominions with a great army, which ſpread ruin and devaſtation wherever it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The Queen oppoſed this deſtroying power with all the force ſhe could raiſe in an emergency ſo ſudden and unexpected. But victory was decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in favor of her enemy, when Prince Nytan ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the confines of her dominions, where he
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:038495_0090_10122D209B83A3E0"/>
ſoon became informed of thoſe unjuſt and cruel dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redations. 'I muſt go, ſaid he to his blue-bird, and chaſtiſe this invader, if Heaven condeſcends, to aid my arm.' 'Go, replied the blue-bird, and when you have ſucceeded, marry the Queen of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and bring her hither, that I may ſee a Princeſs of whom I heard ſo much talk. I ſhall wait impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for you, and may proſperity attend you.' 'Ah! fair and beautiful bird! (if ſuch thou really art) I ſhall have no fancy to marry any Queens, whilſt I can enjoy thy ſweet company. What bird ever ſang, ever talked like thee? I was never half ſo well entertained and charmed!' Such was the Prince's return to the blue-bird; which he had long before conjectured to be more than a mere bird; though who, or what, he was ſtill at a loſs. 'Well, rejoined the blue-bird, dear flattering Prince! haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten away to the ſuccour of the oppreſſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn quickly to the bird who beſt loves you.' 'If ſo, returned he, I have the higheſt reaſon to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But, tell me moſt accompliſhed lady! (for ſuch I have long eſteemed thee,) wherefore this tranſformation, and this reſerve of ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſecret to your loving and faithful friend, whom you ſay, too, you love? Why was you ſent to me? was it that fate had decreed I ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to your reſuming your proper perſon? or, are you cruelly baniſhed, in this ſhape, from all you hold dear? forgive me, if I have, in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, acted unbecoming your merits; and no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conceal from me your true name, and the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this tranſformation. I have been purchaſing ſome lands here, with an elegant houſe, in which I have furniſhed you an apartment for the night; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting another for myſelf in a diſtant part of the houſe; that I may not be wanting in ſhewing you the difference and reſpect you juſtly merit. I am
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:038495_0091_10122D2281095D98"/>
now ready to convey you to your apartment. In my abſence, (which I hope will be but a few hours) three young women will attend you, whom I have bribed largely to be faithful to the truſt I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in them.'—What is all this fine ſpeech to a poor little blue-bird? exclaimed the bird. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever take me, if you pleaſe to the apartment you have provided for me.' 'Alas! reſumed Prince Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, think not to deceive me, I know too well what for a bird thou art; yet lovely in whatever ſhape you are pleaſed to aſſume.' 'As to my name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the blue-bird which you deſire to know, as, likewiſe who, or what I am, I am not permitted, dear Prince, to inform you till your return with victory'—'And to lay my laurels at your feet, interrupted the Prince. 'Shew me, reſumed the bird, the houſe; O! is not that it yonder, and my apartment with the windows open? Make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, noble mandarin! but haſten quickly, to fight the battle of God and mankind. You have not a moment to delay. Thus ſaying ſhe flew out of her window, and the Prince ſaw her enter that of her new apartment.' Therefore, fixing his magic ſpear in its place, directed towards the field of war, which he had reconnoitred with his glaſs, his chamber mounted aloft in the air, and its ſplendors glittered to the ſun.</p>
            <p>When Prince Nytan was arrived to the martial field, he found the Perſians almoſt vanquiſhed and ſurrounded by the enemy. With ſword in hand he ſoon fought his way through the thickeſt of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers; joined and rallied the Perſian army, and in leſs than an hour, obtained a compleat victory; taking the Prince, and twenty thouſand priſoners.—'Go, ſaid the victorious ſon of Renien to the captive Prince, and by afflictions, learn humanity and virtue. To you, humiliation and ſufferings are
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:038495_0092_101224D16CFD6138"/>
neceſſary; while, at the ſame time, they are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered glorious to me, only as an inſtrument in the hand of the uncontrouled Sovereign of the Univerſe, to bring good out of evil. Sooner or later, O haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impetuous Prince! we muſt all learn juſtice and mercy. It is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe. When you have been taught to think with me, we ſhall perhaps, meet again.' Having ſaid thus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Ravenzar's counſel, he ordered the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al priſoner to be chained in a dark room, and, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a madman, till the public affairs of Perſia were ſettled. Then he was to be baniſhed human ſociety, and conveyed into a vaſt foreſt, far diſtant from the kingdom, which, by his manners, he had diſgraced and forfeited. 'We take no lives, added the hero; nor hath one been loſt. We ſeek the reformation, not the annihilation of our brethren of mankind; whom God hath taught us to reſpect and love, and to live but for their good.</p>
            <p>Having ordered the numerous priſoners, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and guarded, till it ſhould be determined in council, in what manner they were to be diſpoſed of; Prince Nytan haſtened to ſeek the Queen.—But no queen was to be found. This cauſed a great alarm, and excited the deepeſt concern. For the queen Selina, was loved by all, almoſt to adoration. She had gone abroad on pretence of hunting and retured not. Her attendants, ſuddenly miſſing her, ſearched every where in vain;—returned to the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace with the melancholy tidings;—with great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers they went back to the foreſt renewing their ſearch after their Queen; in which they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally employed. The aſtoniſhed hero diſpatched a ſtill greater number on the ſame important errand; and taking leave of the officers of the army, only for the night, haſtened to his expecting bird. 'Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038495_0093_10122D26AD570670"/>
brave Nytan! I ſee victory triumphs in your countenance: and yet ſomething appears to diſturb you. How is the Queen of Perſia?' 'Alas replied he, I know not. The Queen is miſſing, and no where to be found. Early muſt I go in queſt of her.'—'Hardly ſo, anſwered the voice of one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the apartment. The Prince turned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Fairy of the iſland of pictures advancing to the blue-bird which deſcended from the corner of a ſoffa, (where it was ſitting) to meet her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Prince Nytan had time to ſpeak, the fairy Perieng, touched the bird gently with her wand. She had no ſooner ſpoken, when, inſtead of a little blue-bird, a moſt charming lady, and of a majeſtic countenance, appeared before them, arrayed in a robe of ſky-blue ſatin, and her head adorned with a crown of gold and diamonds!—'There cried the Fairy Perieng, is the Queen you would go in queſt of. Carry home to her palace and marry her. But ſtay, on ſecond thought, I will go with you. Fetch hither thy chamber. For this purpoſe, am I come to give you Queen Selina in marriage, and to make merry with you on ſo happy on occaſion. Let us haſten, then to put and end to the grief of the moſt loyal ſubjects, who deplore their beloved Queen as loſt.' Nytan ſoon brought his chamber to the Fairy and Queen; who entering with him, they were in a minute, at the gate of the Queen's palace. When the Queen appeared before her houſehold and thoſe of the nobility and ladies, who were at the palace, their joy was unbounded! The glad tidings ſoon circulated far and wide, and thouſands flocked to the palace to bleſs their eyes with a ſight of their beloved Queen whoſe abſence they had ſo deeply regretted, and whom they had almoſt given over as irrecoverably loſt! The Queen conducted her vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious hero and lover, with the fairy Perieng, to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:038495_0094_10122D294B06E428"/>
her great hall, and placed them on her throne. The hall was immediately crowded with the nobility and ladies, and vaſt numbers of others, congratulating their Queen, and beſtowing a thouſand bleſſings on Prince Nytan, who ſat by her ſide. The dignity, majeſty, and benevolence that ſhone forth in the countenance of the fairy Perieng excited their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt reſpect and eſteem. They bowed to the ground before her; when, riſing from her ſeat, ſhe thus addreſſed the numerous and joyful aſſembly.—'My worthy and reſpected friends! In the hero before you, I preſent you the ſon of Renien, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the vaſt Empire of China; the illuſtrious ſon, of an illuſtrious father, who has been, ſo many years, every where celebrated for wiſdom, virtue, bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant accompliſhments an dinnumerable great and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent actions. The ſon is worthy to ſhare, with your Queen; the throne of Perſia; your Queen, an ineſtimable gift of Heaven to you, and the man who found worthy of her hand. That man is the valorous Prince before you,—Prince Nytan, who in one happy moment, has turned away deſtruction from your kindom, and reſtored to you your belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Queen. They have ſometime loved, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to each other; however myſterious my words may appear to you. Superior powers direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deſtiny. Since, then, it is the will of the Supreme, let their hands be united, whoſe hearts are already one. And, long may they live, under the guidance of Heaven, to diffuſe bleſſings through Perſia; and far and wide wherever their influence is, in future times, to extend.' The ſpeech of the fairy Perieng was received with univerſal approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and acclamations of joy. The marriage was, that day, ſolemnized; and great rejoicings were made throughout the kingdom, with feaſtings, which laſted a whole month. Prince Nytan's wonderful
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038495_0095_10122D2AF85A0E50"/>
chamber was placed on a pleaſant hill in the Queen's garden, in a grove, till his further occaſions ſhould call for it. But, that which was very ſurpriſing to the Prince, was, to find the Queen's palace and garden exactly like thoſe at Ravenzar. The apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the palace, the courts, the avenues;—in a word, he could find nothing about the palace and gardens, within or without but what, was as much like thoſe in Ravenzar, as if the one was copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the other. So that when the Queen introduced him to the chamber for his private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, he imagined himſelf ſuddenly and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly tranſported to his own in the iſland. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when he entered the cloſet, and looked out of the window, and viewed the lovely proſpect, he coudl not refrain crying out to the Queen, 'Why, Selina, can you explain to me theſe phenomena. Am I in my own palace, or am I not? if not, never was there, in every thing, ſo perfect a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. The chamber, its furniture, the cloſet, books, garden, hills, groves, and the whole proſpect, have the moſt perfect likeneſs! How can all this poſſibly be? 'I can account for theſe wonderful things, (anſwered the fairy Perieng, entering the cloſet) much better, I believe, than your Queen. It is the work of Ravenzar, who foreſeeing every thing, ordered his ſervants to build, and finiſh off your palace and gardens exactly like thoſe of your Selina; that you who ſo greatly reſemble her in perſon and accompliſhments, might reſemble her in every thing elſe.' 'How much replied the Prince, am I in all things obliged to that great and good Genie! one might be almoſt ready to think, continued the Prince, that Ravenzar was as much in love with Selina—'As who? interrupted the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I hope you are not going to be jealous. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every, it is eaſy to ſee, that one who has been in love,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:038495_0096_10122D2D15F72758"/>
and who takes ſuch infinite pleaſure in obliging his friends, muſt well know the delight lovers take in forming every thing to each other's fancy. And, as the Queen's palace, and garden's were unrivalled in beauty and perfection, how could he better oblige you both than by taking care, that thoſe of yours ſhould want in nothing of the original from which they are copied?' 'Dear fairy, returned Prince Nytan, you inflame my love and gratitude, to my worthy benefactor to the higheſt pitch.' 'Well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined the fairy Perieng, I foreſee, it will not be a great many months, before Queen Selina's curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will conduct her to Ravenzar, that ſhe may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine with her own eyes ſo perfect a copy of her own taſte in building and laying out magnificent gardens. For, I can aſſure you, that all you find here, was built and compleated by her own direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Her father's buildings being old and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, all was renewed, and the gardens enlarged and laid out as you ſee them. Beſides, the more you ſhall examine, the greater will be your convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perfect likeneſs.'</p>
            <p>They ſat down at the cloſet window, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed a great while, on the beauties of the proſpect and the grand and magnificent appearance of the diſtant mountains. Here they examined four caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, whoſe contents were of immenſe value in jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and intereſting papers. They were preſents from the fairy, containing memoirs, delightful, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining and inſtructive.</p>
            <p>The fairy Perieng, having ſpent above a month with the new married pair, and ſeen Prince Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan eſtabliſhed, with Queen Selina, in the throne of Perſia; bid them and the court adieu, and returned to her iſland; promiſing to viſit them often, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their happy deſtiny ſhould ſtation them.</p>
            <p>

The generous attention, of this royal pair, to the intereſt and happineſs of the kingdom of Perſia, was ſoon manifeſted in numberleſs acts of generoſity and humanity, and the effects of the wiſeſt policy were felt and enjoyed by every individual through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdom. The pooreſt of their ſubjects were conſidered, and treated by them as their own children. This conduct lays the only ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the happineſs of kingdoms, ſtates, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths; when that attention to the loweſt claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in ſociety, and to the wants and morals of the pooreſt, is paid, which unfeigned humanity dictates, in oppoſition to the covetous diſpoſition, which falſe ideas and falſe taſtes have rendered ſo univerſally prevalent. Such an attention, ſo becoming men of genius, wealth or power, meet with the approbation of Heaven, and enſure true glory and felicity. Such an attention is the never failing fruit of real virtue and benevolence: and without it, no nation ſhall long flouriſh. The want of it has ever been 'followed, and ever will be by the decline and ruin of the beſt ſtates or kingdoms.—Such were the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents entertained by Nytan and Selina, the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns of Perſia; and to which all their actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly agreed. To render every claſs, and every individual of ſociety induſtrious, virtuous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, their efforts were unremitted. And as to ſo benevolent and noble a purpoſe, they ſpared no pains, ſo likewiſe, they withheld no coſt or expence. They journeyed through their dominions, enquired into the circumſtances of every one, and ſupplied ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery want. They appointed weekly feaſts and alms for the poor and helpleſs; and perſons, worthy of ſacred truſt, to look after them, and afford them ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery aſſiſtance, every convenience, every inſtruction. Such inſtances of celeſtial humanity and love to mankind were never before exhibited with half the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:038495_0098_10122D3148B9B038"/>
ſincerity, and perſevering attention. Perſia ſcarce ever knew what felicity and proſperity were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this happy aera! or ſaw, as now, crowned heads feaſting with the pooreſt and meaneſt of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects! this was a glory reſerved for Nytan and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina! every heart loved them; Every tongue bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, and cried, O celeſtial king and Queen! Live forever! Here all the public affairs were tranſacted with the moſt conſummate ſkill and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All officers were diligent and faithful. For true and able men were appointed to every office, in every department. All inſtructors were as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere as learned, and as faithful as wiſe; ſelected from the moſt accompliſhed and moſt bevolent. But as the royal philanthropiſts were of too great value and too much wanted in the world, to remain always in one kingdom; and as the time drew nigh when they were to viſit other regions, and inſtruct the citizens of other nations in true wiſdom and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, they became indefatigable in making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the future peace and ſecurity of Perſia. Seminaries were founded; and the king had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a number of Genies to preſide over them. Nothing was omitted, by the royal pair, that could conduce to the happineſs of the kingdom in their ſucceſſors in the ſovereignty. The fineſt pieces were wrote, both in proſe and verſe, embelliſhed and enforced with all the beauties, elegancies, and pathos of the moſt perſuaſive eloquence, in praiſe and commendation of every virtue, and of the ſtudy of the works of the glorious and benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent creator, and in commendation of arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, agriculture, induſtry, ſocial and domeſtic happineſs. Theſe were publiſhed, and diſtributed gratis, in every family, beſides thouſands of copies being for ſale, in every great town or city. A great many noble examples enforced every precept and
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:038495_0099_10123FB3534F5C00"/>
inſtruction, and with a charming authority, every argument. The adorers of fire were no where to be found, in thoſe happy days; but the true knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of, and reſpect to the Deity, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly influential throughout all Perſia. The ladies of higheſt rank, and the nobility were virtuous, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous, and exemplary. See, ye great! what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ye may diffuſe! and learn what it is to be truly great and illuſtrious; to be worthy of life and all its rich variety of bleſſings! the amiable Queen had done wonders in training up her ſubjects to virtue and happineſs, ſo that the work of reformation became the eaſier, eſpecially when two ſuch great minds, as her own and her royal huſband's, acted in concert, ſeconded, too, with the cheerful and unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of great numbers of the higheſt order.</p>
            <p>As for the royal priſoner, he was committed to the hands of a genie, who took pleaſure in fulfilling the commands of Nytan, ever tending to accompliſh both public and private good. The priſoner, then, was borne away by inviſible hands to a far diſtant wilderneſs, and there left a ſolitary and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heing; yet ſtill under the eye of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble genie, whoſe name was Pharenon, and who took care, with ſeveral occaſional aſſiſtants, like himſelf inviſible and unperceived, to preſerve him from the fury of the wild beaſts of the deſert. After he had worn out his clothes, he wondered about naked, his intellects for the moſt part being deranged, ſo that he ſcarce knew what he did, living upon any thing he chanced to find except that now and then, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than the deſert afforded was thrown in his way, by means of Pharenon. One day towards its cloſe, as he was wandering, perfectly naked, a company of Banditti came upon him; who, after diverting themſelves with him awhile, tied him up by his hands to the limb of a tree, beat him
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038495_0100_101224E1E9F70EA8"/>
cruelly, and left him hanging. Night came on He was near expiring. Two hungry lions ruſhed from the thickets, and made the wilderneſs reſound with their tremendous roaring. They were juſt upon tearing in pieces the naked and helpleſs prey, when the Genie Pharenon appeared in a flame of fire! The lions inſtantly fled. The benevolent and compaſſionate Genie, aſſuming the form of a young man, untied the naked ſufferer, laid him on the ground, and forced down his throat a cordial, at which he revived from a fit of fainting. He then anointed him all over with an healing ſpecific oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wrapped him in ſheets which he had ordered to be brought, and conveyed him, from the woods to a houſe, where he was put in bed, and ſerved with things neceſſary and comfortable. The Genie could not refrain weeping over him, and exclaiming—'It is enough ill-fated Prince! thy ſufferings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace are at an end! thy mind hath been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed, and will preſently appear refined, like gold from the furnace. Be comforted, happy days are before thee! here you will want for nothing, and when capable of eaſy travelling, you will be conducted to a more agreable manſion.' The Prince expreſſed his gratitude to Heaven, and to Pharenon for his kindneſs. 'I am now inſtructed, ſaid the Prince, to be humane; and I hope the inſtruction will not be loſt upon me and that I ſhall live to be grateful.' Pharenon was as good as his word to the Prince. As ſoon as he was capable of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he removed him by eaſy ſtages, to a palace he owned in that country; nor failed of any kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. In his hands he remained till he was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered.</p>
            <p>When the royal and illuſtrious pair were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by Pharenon, of the miſeries to which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince had been ſubjected, (though their
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:038495_0101_10122D32D7CB4730"/>
ſource was his ungovernable paſſions) they neither could refrain from weeping, notwithſtanding they were acquainted with his happier ſituation. Such were their ſympathiſing feelings for the human race. All indeed were grieved for his ſufferings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to find they were ended; that he was in ſuch good hands, and that there was reaſon to hope he would now render himſelf worthy, who was once ſo deſpicable, and become, in future, a bleſſing and ornament to his country. Their hopes were not diſappointed. After continuing a year with Phare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, he was reſtored to his family and kingdom. the twenty thouſand priſoners were ſent home, full of the praiſes of Nytan and Selina, and of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented kind and generous uſage they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. Their Prince now became the father and benefactor of his people, reformed, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, every thing amiſs. In a few months after his reſtoration, he viſited the Perſian court, where he was cordially received, and entertained with that reſpect and magnificence which none but ſuch as Nytan and Selina knew how to exhibit.</p>
            <p>Nytan had paid ſeveral viſits to the confines of Perſia, where he had purchaſed himſelf an houſe, and ſome lands, with the deſign of ſettling upon the lands a greater number of poor people, that could ſcarcely get bread to eat. This deſign he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and left the poor people, in a fair way of improvement in virtuous induſtry; intending ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them for Ravenzar. To people that iſland with valuable citizens, and to ſow the ſeeds of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the hearts of men. He now ſet out for Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, bidding adieu to his Queen, and the court. They were much affected at the thought of parting. For the king ſoon but an end to their grief by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his lovely queen and all preſent that they had no cauſe for parting with him ſo reluctantly; that
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:038495_0102_10122D3517D17538"/>
he was going on Heaven's errands; and knew his own ſafety and theirs; likewiſe, that by means of his expeditious mode of travelling, he ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener with them than they were imagining. Thus all tears were dried up, and they parted in good ſpirits!</p>
            <p>King Nytan had been now about 13 months al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly in the court and kingdom of Perſia. By means of Pharenon, he had heard from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror his father, and the court of Pekin. His ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were married to the worthy mandarins; who, with the Emperor and Empreſs, were in good health. Under the influence of a wiſe and good ſovereign, virtue and induſtry generally prevailed; which was the more extraordinary conſidering of what an immneſe body of people the Chineſe empire is compoſed. There being no leſs than three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred millions under the government of one man. They allow of no embaſſies but from Ravenzar. As ambaſſador Geſſeng had been there; from whom, on his return, Nytan had received letters informing him of his arrival with two thouſand families, of the health of every one, and that all things were proſperous; nothing being capable of adding to their felicity, but his preſence. The king having anſwered Geſſeng, and ſent away his letters, ſet out for Europe, where his chamber ſoon reſted, on the borders of a vaſt foreſt; not far from which was a flouriſhing city. Leaving his chamber, rendered inviſible and inacceſſable, he travelled on foot, to the city, and entered one of the beſt inns, which was crowded with company. He introduced himſelf as a foreigner, making the tour of Europe. Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating himſelf with the company, he ſoon learned all he wanted to know. In the morning, hiring horſes, and a ſervant, he rode on to the next city, and put up at the inn moſt frequented by the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and by travellers. He walked alone, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

on what adventures might await him in this new ſcene. 'Have I ſaid he to himſelf, exchanged my happy ſituation for theſe cities, where par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtrive and rage, and every dire form of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtalks at noon day. Deſtitute of acquaintance and friend to adviſe and aſſiſt. But I correct my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A friend I have; and one of infinitely more value than the wiſeſt, the beſt, the lovelieſt the moſt powerful and moſt faithful of all I have left behind.—A friend, though inviſible, yet ever preſent and ever ready to aid. O how dared I to indulge a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle deſponding thought, ſince the beſtower of friends is mine. O let me never again a moment forget my friend omnipotent and omnipreſent, in whoſe ſervice too, I am engaged. I will walk, and ſee what adventure will greet me.' He was ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a war juſt commenced between that and the neighbouring kingdom. He enquired into the merits of their controverſy, introduced himſelf to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal men; entered a volunteer in the ſervice; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipping himſelf as a ſoldier, was received at head quarters. The occaſion of the war appeared to be juſt and neceſſary. He was ſoon promoted; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſuch wiſdom, prudence and valor, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared him to the whole army in that country. In a word, he became chiefly inſtrumental in gaining a ſpeedy and deciſive victory, and peace on the moſt juſt and honorable terms. While in the army, he was ſucceſsful in correcting and reforming many errors in diſcipline, (for he had ſtudied war as well as peace) and reforming ſeveral vicious officers. His preſence every where excited, in the minds of men, the juſteſt notions of the dignity of human nature. He commanded univerſal reſpect, eſteem and love. With ſeveral he formed an agreeable friendſhip. In the metropolis, he was received with the honours he merited. The monarch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:038495_0104_10122D39D9308068"/>
him, and cloſeted him for ſeveral days. He found the king to be highly accompliſhed, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the intereſting ſubjects on which Nytan converſed: that on which he moſt inſiſted was of the neceſſity of a greater attention's being paid to the loweſt claſſes in ſociety. He reaſoned with ſuch juſtneſs and energy, that the monarch's eyes were opened to ſcenes of national happineſs, which he had before imagined could never be realiſed. He reſolved, therefore, upon new ſchemes for the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and happineſs of his kingdom.</p>
            <p>Having performed theſe important ſervices he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his chamber, where he paſſed two days and nights in contemplation, and reſt from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant exertions for the good of his fellow creatures. Solitary as the hermit, he prepared his own meals; and walked in the day-time, with a book, under the ſhades of the foreſt. He feared no banditti, or ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age invaders, having it in his power, by his art, to preſerve both himſelf and his chamber from the rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of wild beaſts, or the ſons of violence.<note n="*" place="bottom">There he ſervently implored Heaven's guidance in his future actions.</note> On the third day, he cauſed his chamber to aſcend, and in a few minutes, was in his garden in Perſia. The Queen was juſt riſen, and opening her window, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her beloved lord advancing from the grove. She quickly deſcended the ſtair caſe, and ran into his arms! words fall to expreſs the joy of the loving pair!—I have but just called, ſaid King Nytan, to ſee how you do, and then I muſt away again to Europe, where I have ſcarcely done half my allotted work.' 'One day, at leaſt, my dear lord!' replied the Queen.' 'No my Selina, it cannot be, returned the king: at noon I muſt leave you. Let us retire
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:038495_0105_10122D3BF0E5AB70"/>
unnoticed, to your apartment, or rather to my cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; where you muſt aſſiſt me in chuſing ſome books I mean to carry with me. Let breakfaſt be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. I ſhall be with you, a few hours; and I would be unnoticed by more than one or two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that I may not be too long hindered from my return. I ſhall order matters ſo that this will be my laſt journey to Europe, at leaſt for ſome years. Then my lovely Selina, I hope to give myſelf up to you at Ravenzar, for ſeveral months.' Before noon, Pharenon brought a packet of letters from the African monarch, which gave them a vaſt deal of pleaſure. That monarch had greatly improved his ſubjects, and expreſſed his gratitude to Nytan in the warmeſt terms; who had but juſt time enough to return his anſwer, by the Genie. He embraced Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, who attended him to his flying chamber. She left not the hill, till the chamber, aſcending the ſkies, and traverſing the airy regions, was out of ſight. The Queen excuſed to her houſehold and the court, ſo ſecret and haſty a viſit from her lord, on account of the neceſſity he was under of diſpatching his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Europe, that he might return to them the ſooner, to lay before them matters of great moment, which concerned their future welfare. Nytan now ſpent near eight weeks in travelling through other parts of Europe than thoſe he had viſited.—His time was wholly employed with the pooreſt peaſants, at the greateſt diſtance from cities and large towns. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them he diſtributed the books, with which he had loaded his chamber. They were in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the country in which they lived. The king was perpetually giving them good advice and inſtruction. He ſettled them on good farms, which he purchaſed. He ſelected ſuch perſons as he ſound moſt capable of receiving good councils, and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them in a more comfortable ſituation of life.
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:038495_0106_10122D3D84A0B528"/>
Of theſe, he had under his tuition, about twelve thouſand, in different parts of Europe. Among them were a number of inſtructors, to whom the royal philanthropiſt was very much attached, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their virtues and good underſtandings. He ſupplied them with books, as likewiſe a number of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, who merited his attention, as capable of the greateſt improvements.</p>
            <p>Theſe great things being ſo far happily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the king bade his ſocieties farewell. A thouſand bleſſings followed him to his travelling chamber; which he now ſaw fit to render viſible. The peaſants, with wondering eyes, beheld it aſcend in the air, and convey their benefactor to diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
            <p>It was night when he arrived at his palace in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. He went directly to his apartment and ſolaced himſelf in the arms of his lovely Queen.</p>
            <p>In the morning the king preſented himſelf to his people, and appointed a number of the nobility, and plebians to attend him, and the Queen, on a tour through the kingdom. The pleaſure and joy of their loving ſubjects, wherever they appeared, can ſcarely be deſcribed, on the one hand; and on the other, their grief, when they acquainted them of their propoſed departure, from Perſia. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was only mitigated by their promiſe of viſiting them as often as poſſible, and providing ſucceſſors in the throne who would in every thing, follow their examples. The laſt was fulfilled without delay, on their return from the tour. Raveſco and Fatima, were crowned and proclaimed king and queen of Perſia. Their known virtues and accompliſhments render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them highly acceptable, and their whole conduct ever gave univerſal ſatisfation. Nytan and Selina now prepared for their departure. The Queen would carry nothing away, excepting a few things
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:038495_0107_10122D4027E1D6C0"/>
neceſſary and convenient: and would allow of but one maid and one man ſervant to attend them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſhe had none, though numbers of dear friends, with whom ſhe know not how to part. Nytan how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever adjuſted that affecting circumſtance to her ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction, by propoſing that thoſe to whom ſhe was moſt attached, ſhould, after a while, be tranſported to Ravenzar.</p>
            <p>On the morning of their departure, the palace, courts, and gardens were crowded with weeping ſpectators. Nytan and Selina, from the hill lifted up their hands and bleſſed them; and, entering the aerial vehicle, ſoon loſt ſight of Perſia, and their diſconſolate friends! ſuch indeed were the whole kingdom! men, women, and children, every where, with ſighs and tears, bewailed the loſs they had ſuſtained, in a king and queen, who loved them as they were beloved! but ſuch alas! are the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and viciſſitudes of human life! in which we are only relieved by the lively expectation of a ſtate of higher, of conſummate perfections where no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges can effect even a momentary grief!—So rapid was their voyage to the iſland of Ravenzar; ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their exchange of one country of friends for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; that whilſt the Perſians were lamenting their loſs, and returning with tears and ſighs to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective abodes, the citizens of Ravenzar were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing and congratulating them on their arrival there! Nytan and Selina had now diſrobed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted themſelves of the enſigns and honors of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and were become only members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Ravenzar. But, their great accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their ſhining virtues, their unparalleled mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty and ſweetneſs of behaviour, procured them a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration and love, an eſteem and honor, which few crowned heads, in any age or country, were ever capable of commanding; and which daily increaſed
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038495_0108_10122D4243AF92B0"/>
as they progreſſed in life;—like rivers, enlarging as they flow on from their ſource, enriching their banks on either ſide, till they mingle with the vaſt expanſe of waters!</p>
            <p>But, left it ſhould be imagined, that Selina's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues poſſeſſed not that degree of refinement eſſential to the rendering her fame as pure and unfullied as it hath been exhibited; in that ſhe was unjuſtifiable in retiring from her invaded country, to confine her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Prince with whom ſhe had become en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured merely from the deſcription and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations given of him by the fairy Perieng; it ſhould be related, that the queen was governed by that wiſe and good fairy, who knew what was to happen; and who ſaw no harm in transforming a fair lady for awhile, into a beautiful blue-bird.</p>
            <p>Geſſeng was ſitting with his lovely partner, at one of the palace windows, which looked into the garden, when the chamber deſcended to its wonted ſtation in the retired grove. They ſoon beheld its dazzling ſplendors; and ſat not gazing till it became ſtationary on its flowery lawn, and viſible only to the ſongſters of the wood. Inſtantly they left their ſeats, and Olivia her pencil and drawings. They obſerved two unknown perſons, (as they glanced their eyes through the ſtaircaſe window, in their deſcent) emerge from the grove. But, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appeared in a becoming dreſs for company, they had no new arrangements to make, on the ſcore of dreſs. They therefore immediately ran out in queſt of their friend and benefactor, whom they had no doubt of finding returned. How great was their ſurpriſe to ſee him leading up the alley a beautiful lady, attended by a man and maid ſervant; as they now diſcerned them to be, whom they glanced at from the ſtair caſe window! As Nytan and Selina
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:038495_0109_10122D43ED79F3D8"/>
approached, they ſoon perceived how matters were;—the intimate union of the happy pair was viſible in their countenances!—Joy! cried Geſſeng, and ran into the welcome arms of his friend.—'All hail! lovely pair,' exclaimed gayly, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually lovely partner of Geſſeng, and embraced Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. Their embraces were renewed with ſweeteſt congratulations! The domeſtics gathered round them, and followed them into the hall. Selina thought ſhe was in that in Perſia! The news of their arrival made a rapid progreſs through the city, and the palace was ſoon crouded. Meanwhile, Nytan led his Selina through the palace, and up to his chamber and cloſet. She was filled with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, admiration and delight, in obſerving the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſemblance of every thing to the palace and gardens ſhe left in Perſia. 'Why, cried ſhe, have I been travelling, in a few minutes all over the world, and now find myſelf on a ſudden, in my own palace, when I imagined myſelf to be diſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it thouſands of miles? What wonders are theſe?'—'What wonders? replied Nytan, you are indeed in your own palace; and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from the window your own gardens. Is all this ſo ſtrange?—'If I am in poſſeſſion of ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, I owe it to the kindeſt of men! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Selina.'—'O my incomparable Selina! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the enraptured huſband, what infinite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations am I under to be ever kind, tender and affectionate to the firſt of women! all I am all I ever ſhall be are thine—forever thine! May Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven daily and hourly increaſe the power of Nytan to render himſelf worthy of its ineſtimable gift! as the happy years roll on, the charms of Selina ſhall receive new luſtre, and every day add to the felicities of her life! Every ſucceeding hour ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the tenderneſs and affection of the happieſt of
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:038495_0110_10122D4613344280"/>
men! may that of his Selina be ever equal to her worth! it will then be complete and permanent.' He would perhaps, have exhauſted himſelf in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of love and gratitude, had not the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Geſſeng, and the ſhouts of the people arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his attention. He went down into the hall, and mingled embraces with his congratulating friends. Joy and gladneſs circulated throughout the iſland of Ravenzar. None could be greater. None could be more ſincere. Nytan propoſed, to his numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friends, an entertainment, the next day at his own expence, in the city hall. Accordingly, there a grand feſtival was celebrated; when the wonders of Ravenzar were commemorated. The ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing week, Nytan and Geſſeng, with their conjugal partners, went through a courſe of viſits in the city. Geſſeng ſurpriſed his lord with a relation of the great things Ravenzar had been doing in his abſence. Through the vaſt ridge of mountains, he had made eight more roads, with gradual aſcents, on each ſide the roads, to the mountains heights; on which he had built houſes and furniſhed them with inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. He had likewiſe, built a number of towns and cities, and ſettled a family in every houſe. So that the whole number of citizens, men, women and children, that compoſed the community, were an hundred thouſand. An amazing populating rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity! but, what cannot fairies and genies perform? and there were many of them aſſiſting in this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and benevolent work. 'I muſt ſoon further contribute my ſhare towards increaſing the number of our citizens, ſaid the admiring ſon of Renien, I have numbers in different parts of the world pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for our iſland: and I intend it ſhall not be long before they are here. You muſt go my Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeng, and fetch more from China.' 'Many of theſe laſt, replied Geſſeng, are from thence. Beſides,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:038495_0111_10122D48B4C64100"/>
they are all inſtructed in the Chineſe language, like thoſe ſettled here before them.' 'Very well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Nytan, you will however, I hope proceed with your fleet, once more, on this buſineſs, to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and when you are there, I ſhall ſoon be with you. We will take our wives with us, and may kind and indulgent Heaven proſper us, as it hath hitherto done.' Nytan was as good as his word; and Geſſeng returned with his fleet, to China tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him his wife Olivia. His friend with Selina, ſoon followed them, in his aerial vehicle. But before Nytan ſat out he ſummoned two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful genies. 'Haſten ſaid he to them, to Perſia, and fetch hither the men, women and children I have appointed. They will cheerfully obey your orders. And when they are here, furniſh them with houſes and lands, and all things they ſhall want.' The genies immediately proceeded on their errand. To conclude in a few words, Nytan and Selina, Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeng, and Olivia, were for ſeveral days, happy with their friends in China. After which the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, promiſing another viſit the next year, took leave of the Emperor and Empreſs, their ſiſters, brothers in law, and the court, and returned to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar; where not long after, Geſſeng and Olivia ſafely arrived in the fleet, having three hundred fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies. The genies likewiſe brought from Perſia, ſeven thouſand new citizens, all of whom were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to their ſatiſfaction, and far beyond their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>

            <p>AMONG thoſe who were laſt introduced into the iſland, by Ravenzar, was a beautiful and highly accompliſhed lady Amelia. She was of high deſcent in a foreign country; but perſecuted and driven thence, on account of her inflexible attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to liberty, and to a few friends, of both ſexes, who nobly dared to oppoſe the oppreſſive meaſures of an arbitrary an tyrannical government. Through their influence and exertions, great numbers became reſolutely engaged in freedom's cauſe. War was its inevitable conſequence. The zealous friends of the beſt of cauſes were indefatigable and perſevering till they had formed, and brought into the field, an army of twenty thouſand men, which unhappily was far exceeded by the oppoſing tyrants; whoſe innumerable cohorts poured in upon them, from all quarters, like a reſiſtleſs torrent. Victory was then permitted to decide in favour of the ſcourgers of mankind. Amelia and her friends being defeated, ſhe found means with a few adherents, to eſcape to a foreſt, under whoſe gloomy ſhades, they imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they might reſt awhile ſecure from purſuers. But there they found but a temporary retreat. A party of the enemy, which had been ſearching the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038495_0113_101224D69DA4E1E8"/>
foreſt, came upon them. They bravely oppoſed force to force. But valorous and deſperate as they were, they were incapable of long reſiſting ten times their number; and, had not unexpected aid appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they muſt at leaſt, have yielded to death, or the chains of tyrants.—A man in flaming armour, dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like lightning upon their conquering foes; and inſtantly they were ſcattered, like pillars of ſmoke before the tempeſtuous wind! the terrific warrior no ſooner aſſaulted than he defeated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and, not a ſingle oppoſer, was from that moment either to be ſeen or heard. Whilſt Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia and her little company were wondering at this ſudden deliverance, the Victor approached, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed them in the following terms—'Valiant and worthy friends! Heaven be praiſed, that ſent me to reſcue you from the power of a deteſtable herd of tyrants and debauchees, who are the diſgrace of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Your brave reſiſtance of thoſe murderers of the human ſpecies, does you the greateſt honor. Forſake then, this land of ſlavery and oppreſſion, and follow me to a country of freedom and bliſs. Thither will I conduct you in ſafety; even where you will find that virtue, glory and felicity, which you have in vain though nobly exerted yourſelves to promote and eſtabliſh here.' It was the great, the mighty genie Ravenzar who addreſſed them; who was anſwered with the moſt grateful acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgments, and ready acceptance of his proffered friendſhip and protection. He led them out of the foreſt, taking Amelia's hand, and committing two little girls ſhe had with her, to the care of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who were then juſt come up to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He converſed with them, as they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the road, on ſuch ſubjects as tended to inſpire them with just sentiments of his character and diſintereſted views, informing them who he
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:038495_0114_10122D4C66B57838"/>
was, and giving them a conciſe hiſtory of the place whither he intended to conduct them. 'How fatally ſaid he, do thoſe tyrants, under the ſpecious pretexts of liberty, and virtue, amuſe millions of people! You have ſeen, how little they could reliſh your juſt remonſtrances againſt their covetous diſpoſitions, their vanity, intemperance, and hypocriſy. I will convey you my worthy friends, to a country, where truth and virtue are underſtood, and where liberty is more than an empty ſound to impoſe upon thoſe who are willing to be deceived.'</p>
            <p>Amelia and her adherents readily followed the genie Ravenzar on board his fleet, and arrived in ſafety to the happy iſland; where they ſoon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the unbounded generoſity of their new friends; who placed them in ſituations of life moſt agreeable to their inclinations, and the wiſe poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and arrangements of the country, enriching them at the ſame time, far beyond their expectations, or even their deſires. Amelia, with her two beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful girls, choſe a retired ſituation. Thoſe girls, the one eight, the other nine years of age, were the orphan daughters of her deceaſed brother, and had lived with her ever ſince the loſs of her parents. As ſhe was exceeding fond of them, ſhe had ſpared no pains in their education. She was therefore, furniſhed, agreeably to her wiſh as, with a large and well built houſe delightfully ſituated about twenty miles from Xuntien, at ſome diſtance from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic road, and ſurrounded by the nobleſt growth of trees; having a fine large garden, in which it ſtands upon an eminence that affords a fine proſpect of the country, a branch of the river, hills, lawns, fields and groves, and the dwellings of the farmers on each ſide the water. In this romantic villa, Amelia ſettled, with her lovely nieces, and a few attendants, of both ſexes. After a while, ſhe kept
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038495_0115_10122D4F0C6C9290"/>
open doors, entertaining all ſorts of company. For, in Ravenzar, there were none unworthy of her hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, friendſhip, or eſteem. A large number, of both ſexes, of learning and fine accompliſhments, conſtantly reſorted to her villa, often continuing there for ſeveral weeks. With theſe ſhe enjoyed all the ſuperior pleaſures of a country life. Though the ſituation, was retired, it was by no means a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary one to her, who loved ſociety. Some times they walked in the extenſive garden and groves; at others they viſited the induſtrious farmers, who were far from being ignorant, or unconverſible, as is the case in ſome countries. Amelia likewiſe, had her hour of profitable employment, ſtudy, embroidering and drawing. From her company and aſſociates, great mutual advantages were derived, and which extended to the community; which is every greatly ſerved by the rich, who are virtuous, in whatever ſphere of life they move. Amelia not only read, and ſtudied, but ſhe wrote elegantly and ſublimely, in proſe and verſe: and her converſation was always highly entertaining, as well as beneficial and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If her perſon was beautiful, her mind was ſtill more ſo: and though not exceeding twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>three years of age, there were not many in the world, much older, that, poſſeſſed a greater ſhare of knowledge, wiſdom and diſcretion. Among the gay young noblemen of her native country, ſhe had many admirers, who ſought her hand. But their manners and principles ſhe abhorred; and the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of accumulated ſplendor and magnificence, which they ſet before her, ſhe deemed not worth a ſingle thought. But a few weeks before ſhe was driven from her native home, ſhe was addreſſed by a merchant of fine accompliſhments, and gentle manners. His name was Philenor. For him ſhe entertained the tendereſt ſentiments, and they had
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:038495_0116_10122D516E617578"/>
exchanged mutual vows of love and conſtancy. But he was now loſt to Amelia! Philenor had ſailed to a far diſtant country; where he was ſuppoſed to have bid adieu to this life. To indulge in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, unnoticed grief for one, to whom ſhe once fondly hoped to be united, was that which gave the firſt riſe to her inclination for retirement. But, reaſon and virtue came to her aid; and, at length, convinced of the criminality of yielding to ſecret unavailing ſorrow; with her former views, ſhe therefore, changed her plan; and courted ſociety.</p>
            <p>Amelia however, frequently indulged herſelf in ſolitary walks; enjoying the moſt delicious pleaſure in the contemplation of the beauties of nature; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting her thoughts from the wonders of creation, to the conſideration of the power, glory and majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Creator. As ſhe rambled through, the fragrant groves; as ſhe walked over the carpets of living green, and amidſt the flowers and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſweets which exuberant nature had ſpread around her;—ſhe ſeemed to tread on enchanted ground, or as roving amid the luxuries of a ſecond paradiſe!—In ſome choſen ſpot ſecure from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſhe would often take from her pocket, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle writing deſk; and reclining on the moſſy bank, pour out, on paper, the effuſions of a heart ever grateful to its divine former. The following peice may ſerve as a ſpecimen of her talent in poetry. It was undeſignedly dropped, in one of her morning walks: and to that accident we owe the pleaſure of tranſcribing it for the peruſal of thoſe who have a taſte for poetical compoſition. It is addreſſed to the Creator, on the diſplay of his glory and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Creation and perfection of man.</p>

            <p>Not long after the return of Nytan, and his friends, from China, Selina propoſed an excurſion into the country, of which ſhe had heard ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common panegyric's. Nothing could have been propoſed more agreeable to him, as he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it would greatly conduce to the health as well as pleaſure of his fair ſpouſe. Geſſeng and Olivia were equally pleaſed with it, for the like reaſons. They ſat out on a fine morning, on horſeback. As they rode through the city, they made an addition of two couple to the company; two ſervants only attending them. They rode ſeveral miles on the verdant flowery banks of the river. The tall and majeſtic oaks afforded them an agreeable ſhade and defence from the ſcorching beams of the ſun. Turning into one of the great roads that were cut out through the mountains, the proſpects before them, and on each ſide, were luxuriantly magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; which were ſucceeded by thoſe of alternate groves, fields and vales, buildings and planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. After travelling near two hours, through thoſe dellghtful ſcenes, they entered a gloomy wood.
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:038495_0124_10122D633B088C80"/>
Though the road was excellent: yet the dark ſhade of the lofty trees, excluding the rays of the ſun, gave the appearance of night; exciting a pleaſing horror and agreeable ſolemnity for the ſucceeding hour; and they converſed but little. Having rode through the wood, they ſaw before them a large well built houſe, with an high wall of black marble, which they obſerved to extend through groves of trees, and over hills, to a great diſtance. This was Amelia's Villa. On one ſide appeared to them part of a branch of the river, which in various windings, ran through the iſland; and a number of well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed houſes on its banks. The ſcenes, here, were delightfully romantic! 'Every thing invites us, ſaid Olivia, to reſt here; and ſee who inhabits this retired manſion.' 'You are very right lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Nytan. My curioſity is excited, and, I doubt not, that of every one. Beſides it is high time for us to reſt, and procure ſome refreſhment, where there is no doubt of our being welcome. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Ravenzar are the moſt hoſpitable people in the world. I will ride on, if you pleaſe, and make the firſt appearance. He then quickened his horſe's pace. But Selina's did not chooſe to be left behind, ſo they both advanced together to the gate, which they found open. Alighting, and leaving their horſes, they croſſed the court to a large hall, in which Amelia was reclining on a ſoffa; who ſeeing two ſtrangers advancing, aroſe to meet them with an air of gaity and engaging familiarity.—'Sweet lady, ſaid Nytan, give me leave to preſent you with a ſiſter, who muſt certainly look upon you as her ſecond ſelf, you ſo greatly reſemble her.' He was indeed ſtruck with the fine appearance of Amelia, and her likeneſs to his Selina. They ſaluted and embraced her, as was cuſtomary in this iſland of pure undiſſembled love. The Prince ſaid a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:038495_0125_10122D64CE48D858"/>
pleaſant things. None could be a more gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and compaſſionate admirer of the fair ſex. Struck, and enraptured, as he was, with the loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and likelineſs of the two ladies, Which cried he, is Selina, and which is Amelia? Sure you are twin-ſiſters—what a ſurpriſing reſemblance of two of the moſt perfect beauties nature ever formed!' The ladies were quite merry with his gallantry. 'I think however, added he, Silena may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a little paleneſs. Then, conſcious of the occaſion of this diſtinction, which could not but excite ſome anxious ſenſations, at the ſame time that it flattered his moſt pleaſing hopes; he tenderly ſeated them both on a ſoffa, calling upon his fellow travellers, who were entering the hall, to participate with him in the joy and pleaſure of ſo unexpected and invaluable an acquiſition to their ſociety. Amelia roſe to receive them but inſtantly ſunk lifeleſs on the ſoffa! Every one was frightened, and ran to her aſſiſtance. Two lovely girls who were at work in a contiguous apartment, the door of which opened into the hall, flew to her with a ſmelling bottle. It ſoon produced ſigns of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life! when Amelia opening her eyes, fixed them on the aſtoniſhed and enraptured Philenor! it was indeed Philenor himſelf whoſe ſudden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked-for appearance had overcome the tender A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia. 'O! exclaimed ſhe, Philenor, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned you to Heaven; as loſt to me for the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent life!'—'Heaven, replied he has rewarded your reſignation by reſtoring to you, your faithful lover, who will never more leave you! little indeed, did I ever expect this felicity! But my misfortunes are now amply recompenſed. Yes. It was for this joyful event, that I was invited to the happy iſland of Ravenzar, and introduced to the illuſtrious
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:038495_0126_10122D66749C27A8"/>
friends who have conducted me to the treaſure of my heart!</p>
            <p>Great was the joy of the company on ſo fortunate an occurrence, which was brought forward in the manner following. Philenor was taken off a wreck by Geſſeng, juſt before his laſt arrival. The men would moſt probably all have periſhed, had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance been ſo ſeaſonably ſent them. A friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſoon commenced between two young men ſo nearly reſembling each other, as did Geſſeng and Philenor, both in age and ſentiment. The latter had been in the country with the ſeamen, ſaved with him from the wreck, to view a ſpot of land which has been recommended to them for their preſent reſidence, or future ſettlement, if they choſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on the iſland; with regard to which they were to be wholly at their own aption. Geſſeng had mentioned them, to Nytan with good commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; highly praiſing Philenor, as one who would do great honor to their ſociety. Adding, that he intended to introduce him, on his return from the country. It had been the intention of Philenor to return to his native home, as ſoon as poſſible by ſuch means as ſhould be concerted between himſelf Geſſeng and Nytan. To return thither he pleaded indiſpenſable obligations. He, therefore, purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be at court, as ſoon as he had determined mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with his ſeamen. Nytan, with his party of pleaſure had been gone from the palace, but an hour, when Philenor arrived there: and receiving directions had immediately followed them: over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them juſt as Nytan had preceded his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and entered Amelia's gate. Thus it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſo unexpectedly appeared before her; who, having now recovered her preſence of mind, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered refreſhments to be brought into the hall. In the mean time, her new friends were congratulating
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:038495_0127_10122D689EA882C0"/>
her and her lover on ſo happy a meeting, and ſaving a thouſand pleaſant things. 'But I hope, ſaid Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, we are not ſoon to loſe you. Philenor, I have learned, intended to return in a few days, to his country, doubtleſs, in queſt of his Amelia. But, now he has found her, I hope that intention will be laid aſide; eſpecially when he is informed what has happened. He cannot, ſcarcely, imagine it can be for his Amelia's ſafety, (if for his own) to return, at preſent, whatever he may do hereafter.' 'I think with you, my lord, replied Philenor on this ſubject. But I leave all to Amelia.' 'Then, ſaid Selina, we may all keep up our ſpirits! mine I confeſs were a little deranged, at the very idea of looſing Amelia. But, I dare to ſay, ſhe will not he in a hurry to viſit a country ſo abandoned as to perſecute ſuch excellence, and force her to flee from her native home. What ſay you, my charming friend!' O! dear lady, replied Amelia, I can add nothing to your arguments for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining here, as in a happy aſylum; after I have related to Philenor my misfortunes;—only that if I may take his word, we are never more to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.' 'No anſwered Philenor, moſt certainly never. The idea of being ſeparated, is intelerable for a moment! beſides, if you, Amelia, chuſe to continue here for life, I muſt of neceſſity make the ſame choice. Here, money, or eſtate, I have none. But I cannot fail of ſeeing you happy in the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of thoſe who will never ſuffer us to want any thing in their power to grant. At home, indeed, I have large interest, which, I doubt not, may be transferred here.' 'You will make yourſelf eaſy, replied Geſſeng, on all accounts. Our friend Nytan, can inform you, there are the beſt of lands at your ſervice.' 'And the ſincereſt friends, ſaid Nytan. Whatever aſſiſtance you may require, in reſpect of
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:038495_0128_10122D6B51C39F68"/>
your eſtate, or friends, we ſhall cheerfully afford you. Amelia hath here a valuable eſtate, and the ſame hour that unites you in one, you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lawful poſſeſſor of a thouſand acres of land adjoining to hers. Beſides you will have apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in my palace, and a ſpacious elegant building of your own, nearly oppoſite to it, in the city. We have, likewiſe treaſures of money and jewels, which you are to command as your own. Let us then, my friends haſten to Xuntien, and ſee theſe amiable lovers united. Afterwards, we ſhall find means to procure them intelligence from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country.' Philenor and Amelia, with the moſt grateful acknowledgments, yielded themſelves to the advice and conduct of their generous friends; who propoſed to conduct them immediately to Xun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien.</p>
            <p>Refreſhments were now brought in, and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the company. Nytan and Selina, after they had all dined, propoſed a walk in the garden, which being agreed to, they went thither. They found it to be laid out in taſte. The two little girls were likewiſe with them, and admired for their beauty and behaviour. Olivia propoſed to take them to Xuntien, declaring they ſhould not be buried in the country. It is time for them, added ſhe, to ſee company. 'Have they been always, Amelia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, thus ſecluded from the world?' 'Far from ſo, replied Amelia: my houſe is frequented by all ſorts of people. We have ſeldom two days without company, and the girls have always their ſhare of it.' 'Well returned Olivia, we muſt have them up to town, however.' 'By all means, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Nytan, we ſhall on no account, conſent to their being left; and I believe, Amelia, muſt ſhut up her houſe, for two or three months at leaſt. We
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:038495_0129_10122D6D6EDE1BA0"/>
ſhall be very loth to part with her, and her beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neices, in leſs time.' Amelia expreſſed the warmeſt acknowledgments to her friends; adding that all ſhould be as they thought proper. 'Well, then, replied Nytan, let us prepare to ſet out, or it will be night before we reach Xuntien.' When they were returned to the houſe, Amelia was not long in arranging her affairs. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the care of her villa to her faithful ſervants, and her carriage was brought to the door; in which ſhe, with Philenor, and her two neices, entered, and all ſet forward for Xuntien. The weather was fine, the company gay and cheerful. They made but one ſhort ſtage, about half way; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſun-ſet, reached Nytan's palace; who led his company into a ſpacious and magnificent apartment, the windows of which where open to the garden. Nothing could ever exceed the gaiety and ſplendor of this apartment! It ſeemed to be all alive with portraits large as were once the living originals; and paintings of romantic rural ſcenes, all done in the utmoſt perfection of art. Theſe were the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry work of the orphan ladies. Neither would it be eaſy to find any fine proſpects ſuperior, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, to thoſe which the windows of this apartment afforded. Here tea was brought, and other refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuitable to the time and and occaſion. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one took what they pleaſed from a large marble table, which ſtood under the window, loaded with every delicacy which nature provides to recruit <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> travellers. After ſitting an hour as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening was delightful, and the moon ſhone out with unuſual luſtre, they walked out into the garden. The air was perfumed with nature's ſweets, and the brightneſs of the evening invited them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue walking till the hour of ſupper. This was ſerved up in the pavilion; the moſt pleaſant ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:038495_0130_10122D6F06D70D88"/>
the garden afforded; commanding ſeveral grand views of the country. It can ſcarcely be imagined—magnificent, delicious and inchanting as was every thing around them, that ſo reſpectable and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed a company of friends could be wanting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on ſuch delightful and intereſting ſubjects as the wonders of creation, the events of life, and their own knowledge and experience muſt inſpire and dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. When they met from the alleys and winding paths, in which each party had been ſtrolling, Philenor introduced ſome obſervations on the various man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of nations, and the heights of luxury and falſe magnificence to which ſome had arrived; and on the fatal conſequences of vice and diſſipation. He inſtanced ſeveral flouriſhing kingdoms, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction he ventured to prophecy, would ere long be the neceſſary reſult of their extravagancies and vices. These subjects were renewned in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and led to others equally intereſting. 'One great cauſe ſaid Nytan, of the miſery and ruin of nations, (little attended to) is intemperance in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking. Men drown their rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by indulging their appetites. They load their bodies with bad humours, and ſtrengthen the falſe appetites which they have acquired, weakening and deſtroying their conſtitutions. When the body is diſordered by intemperance, the powers of the mind are, likewiſe weakened and depraved. Falſe ideas of the enjoyment of life, are entertained, and produce innumerable expenſive luxuries which render the rich bankrupt and oppreſſive. Their tables of luxury muſt be ſupplied, at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The univerſe muſt be ranſacked for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies; and mankind plundered, oppreſſed, enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fill the purſes of extravagant luxurious ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice. Religion, too, muſt be proſtituted to the ſame infamous and deteſtable purpoſes.'</p>

               <pb n="132" facs="unknown:038495_0131_10122D71207524A0"/>
'All this have I ſeen realized, added Eudemon, [he being one of the company who joined the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at Xuntien,] in the country from which I origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. In former times, continued he, when the leading men of ſociety were virtuous and wife, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and temperate, my countrymen were influenced by their example; and enjoyed in a very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree the happineſs of civil and domeſtic life. But an unhappy negligence and overſight in the all-important care and education of children, cauſed intemperance gradually to take root, till it ſpread, like an infectious diſeaſe, in every family; till, at length, temperance and ſobriety, were words which had wholly loſt their original ſignification, and muſt now be conſidered as importing a decent kind of viciouſneſs, very well comporting with virtue or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In fine, every amiable grace and virtue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came quite different things from what they formerly were; and men of intereſt and influence, who val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelves upon the excellency of their moral characters, were, accordingly, eſteemed as good men—the beſt of men; whilſt faſhionable temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was undermining their conſtitutions, and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with diſeaſes; having already polluted their minds.—O unhappy country! how art thou eſtranged from thy ancient ſimplicity of manners, which arrayed thee with glory; from thoſe illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious virtues, with which thou waſt anciently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned! how diſgraceful is the diſtinction of men of character, wealth and influence now become, in diſcerning eyes, if there is any reality in virtue, if there be, in nature, any ſuch things as true glory and real felicity!—diſgraceful—becauſe ſuch paſs for great and good, benevolent and uſeful, generous and brave, whoſe only real ſolicitude is to gratify their avarice and ambition, their paſſion for luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous extravagant pleaſures, and fooliſh magnificence;
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:038495_0132_10122D73CE02F5B8"/>
—who proſtitute religion to their deteſtable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and fail not to call in fanaticiſm to their aſſiſtance, in eſtabliſhing ſlavery and oppreſſion! So long as they can gratify their ruling paſſions, their hearts are ſteeled againſt humanity, yet with a great parade of patriotiſm, philanthropy, and civilized manners; and they can have no attention to Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en's juſtice, and that ſhame and ruin which muſt one day overtake them!'</p>
            <p>'You indeed ſpeak melancholy truths, rejoined Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. What ſcenes of miſery and diſtreſs have ſuch men brought upon mankind in every age, as well as in the preſent; ſome of which I have myſelf been witneſs to, not long ago: and where the lower claſſes of ſociety, who ought to be cheriſhed and cultivated to the utmoſt, are uſed as beings crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only for ſlavery and impoſition. They have religion: and what is it? The engine of cruelty and oppreſſion: the religious leaders op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the people, at the ſame time that they groſsly deceive them: in this they are leagued with thoſe who are called the great ones; but who may more juſtly be denominated beaſts of prey, devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monſters, or, the plagues and tormentors of mankind. Such are the effects of unreſtrained ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and paſſions; rendering them never-ceaſing plagues to each other, deſtroying virtue and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, truth and humanity from the world. Cuſtom has long rendered their vices and hypocriſy conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with virtue, piety, ſincerity and uprightneſs. And many, impoſing upon themſelves, imagine that for their virtue and good deeds (reſpected as ſuch) their names will be immortaliſed. But the immortality of their fame, will prove the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of their diſgrace! The luxury, the profuſe magnificence of the rich and powerful are totally
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:038495_0133_10122D75EA53C120"/>
repugnant to the principles and ſentiments of a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virtuous mind. Though in a ſituation like ours, magnificence and ſplendor are unavoidable. Since gold, diamonds, and pearls are our readieſt and cheapeſt materials for building and ornament; and the treaſures we poſſeſs, can ſcarcely ever be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; by means of which likewiſe, we are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more capable of extenſive uſefulneſs. But perfect temperance preſides at our tables, and real virtue regulates our actions. Theſe are all the gifts of our heavenly benefactor. It is through his ſovereign will and pleaſure that we are temperate and virtuous, and gratitude inſpires and animates our exertions to render others as happy as ourſelves.—But alas! What multitudes are there who moſt miſerably ſuffer through the miſtaken ideas of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they have imbibed and cheriſhed! and how many are there, who endure every hardſhip for a name or to accompliſh ſome imaginary valuable purpoſe; and that with a ſurpriſing fortitude and perſeverance; who yet have not the courage to practice a juſt temperance, and thereby procure to themſelves health, true pleaſure and tranquility, for a long ſeries of years!—What abſurdity and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency is here!—and which, thoſe who could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due armies, and eſtabliſh empires, have not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to themſelves to obviate! To what purpoſe do they glory in their courage and fortitude, who have not, after all, the courage, the fortitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain their appetites within the limits of that juſt temperance, which would inſure to them true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, true glory, permanent felicity and honor, and make them illuſtrious by real uſefulneſs to mankind. Thoſe who practice a juſt temperance, enjoy a thouſand pleaſures unknown to others: In them we may ſee its happy effects in every ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumſtance.

ſaid to enjoy life. Our happineſs greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the proper government and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our thoughts; which can never be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged and governed without the ſtricteſt temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance both in eating and drinking, and bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. For by the prevalency of bad humors, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from intemperance, the mind becomes clouded and enervated; the reaſoning powers are deprived of their natural freedom and influence. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and pamper themſelves to that degree, that they can hardly think or crawl: others ſtupify their ſenſes, and drown their rational faculties with ſtrong drink. No man can enjoy the free exerciſe of the powers of his body or mind, who lives intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately. What a wide difference ſubſiſts between ſuch an one, and the man who is governed by the ſtricteſt temperance! The former is erroneous in his judgement, wild in his projects, diſordered in imagination, unhappy in his memory, depraved in his principles, a ſlave to his paſſions, reſtleſs, ſick, diſeaſed and haſtening to a premature and miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able death. The latter is wholly from thoſe evils; ſuffers no inconveniences from his own conduct; his paſſions and appetites being ſubſervient to his reaſon and his felicity. He enjoys a ſound mind in a healthy and vigorous body increaſes in wiſdom and experience; and armed with virtue and manly reflection, is always prepared for every event of life. He lives quietly through a long ſeries of happy years, and grows ripe for a glorious immortality. Temperance and ſobriety are indeed of the higheſt conſequence, both to the happineſs and the uſefulneſs of life. Experience evinces to every one who has made a fair trial of the ſalutary effects of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that, as is a man's temperance in his diet, ſo is the ſerenity, freedom and equality of his mind: and if there is a perpetual ſameneſs in

the one, ſo, likewiſe, will there be in the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. To a juſt temperance is to be attributed that conſtant ſerenity and rationality in the ſages of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and which prevailed in them <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>'I have frequently, ſaid Laertes, [the other citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen from Xuntien,] obſerved of perſons, who were perpetually complaining of their ill health, that they were very unwilling to believe what ſound reaſon teaches; namely, that whatever is received into the ſtomach more than it can readily digeſt, or that agrees not with it; excites thoſe humors which occaſion a variety of diſorders. That thoſe humors fill the brain with noxious fumes, and prevent the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:038495_0136_10122D7C40B47F08"/>
proper exerciſe of the mental powers; render the perſons reſtleſs and uneaſy with every thing about them, which they impute to wrong cauſes. At length fevers were brought upon them, and a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſymptoms and forerunners of incurable diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in the end ſeized them. Whereas, thoſe who were guided by their reaſon (few as they were) were free from thoſe complaints, and enjoyed a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of health to old age. Their health would have been more perfect, and they would have lived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years longer had they been more perfect in the art of temperance. But moſt of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, (for I am ſpeaking of my former coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen) ſeemed to act more like children, who hankèr and fret after every thing that is to be eat or drank: and with regard to children, the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent parents very readily gratify them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, too often to their ruin. Ah! Cruelly indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent parents! happy were it for you, and your off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, did you refrain from ſuch pernicious kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Yet you ſtill follow the beaten path of cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary folly in which, yourſelves being induced, you have dragged heavily on, a burthenſome life; this was owing to the abuſe of your ſtomachs; and for which you are denied the exhilirating proſpects of a long life of health and happineſs!'</p>
            <p>'Your obſervations, reſumed Nytan, are ſuch as may very juſtly be made on many other countries beſides your own; though not I believe in this. We are ſenſible, the ſtomach is a moſt curious and delicate workmanſhip of nature, ſoon feeling injurious treatment, and terrible, are its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments. There are too many, who, owing to the fatigue of labour and buſineſs, have been induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give way to their appetites to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and often, ruin of their conſtitution. But, it ought to be conſidered, that temperance is requiſite
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:038495_0137_10122D7E58593B08"/>
in buſineſs and labour, as well as in the uſe of food and drink. The ſteady practice of uſing the ſame quantity of meat and drink every day, or at every meal, regarding, at the ſame time, its quality, as well as the meaſure of their ſtomachs, is what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures long life, and a perfect ſtate of health; even as the great ſyſtem of the creation is conſtantly maintained in the ſame condition, by an exact ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from the divine ſource of its exiſtence and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity. Order and regularity were obſerved in the compoſition of our bodies; and how can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they can be maintained in their proper ſtate of health and vigor, without temperance? Pherneone of Greece, thus uttered to me, lately, his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly complaint. 'My former tranquility is no more. I reliſh not my uſual pleaſures. I walk through the ſame delightful ſcenes of nature; but they yield not the wonted ſublime enjoyment to me. The delights of the preceding years—alas! they are vaniſhed!' 'To what, my friend, ſaid I, is this unhappy change to be attributed? Is not your temperance the ſame? (for I more than ſuſpected the real cauſe.) 'No replied Pherneone, it is not, I muſt freely own. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> have not been able to afford myſelf my uſual diet; and have made too much uſe of what agrees not with my conſtitution.'</p>
            <p>I amply furniſhed him with the means of reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his temperance. His tranquility returned, and he enjoyed his delicious walks, his ſtudies and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements as before. But if men will eat and drink, or labour and toil beyond what their natures can endure, they muſt ſuffer the terrible conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Ardenly is it to be wiſhed, their eyes were effectually opened to ſuch inexcuſable folly, and that they might be induced to renounce intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that baneful ſource of both public and private calamities; the plague and ruin not only of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:038495_0138_10122D80413E5FE8"/>
but families, ſocieties, ſtates and empires!—But, look into the families-attentively conſider the country, where temperance and freedom, thoſe conſtant companions, are united;—who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the felicity and glory there enjoyed! To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch a glory and felicity, amongſt mankind, let every exertion be made, and every power of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oquence be uſed, deeply to impreſs upon the minds of men men who deſire to be free; that the rich invaluable bleſſings of liberty, can never be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obtained, ſecured or enjoyed, if temperance is neglected. The men of temperance and ſobriety are the wiſeſt patriots and legiſlators, the beſt cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens, the moſt benevolent, faithful and ſucceſsful inſtructors. It is with ſuch only, wiſdom dwells, and with whom are found prudent counſels. It is ſuch only who can poſſeſs undiſſembled benevolence. I have obſerved a cuſtom in Europe, which hath doubtleſs, given riſe to the greateſt evils. It is that of urging, and even compelling gueſts to drink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of ſobriety, which may very juſtly be called a barbarous cuſtom; it having often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the ruin of many a promiſing young crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I am confident the number is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiderable, of thoſe who can derive, from this inglorious practice, the fatal debauchery of their minds, and all the melancholy and diſtreſſing conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which have imbittered their lives, and that there are thouſands now living (if living it may be called) the miſerable victims of intemperance; who could atteſt to the truth of what I have advanced, as awfully verified in themſelves.</p>
            <p>But, how ſhall we addreſs our miſguided fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures, ſo as to gain their attention on ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting a ſubject.'</p>
            <p>'Powerful and perſuaſive arguments, anſwered Philenor, ſhould be urged upon them, and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſcenes of virtuous happineſs preſented to their view. I would urge them frequently to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the glorious advantages, the inexpreſſible hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to which, by a juſt temperance, they would attain. I would likewiſe preſs home to them the fatal conſequence that inevitably follow intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate indulgencies. I would endeavour ſedulouſly to induce them to reaſon each one with himſelf after the following manner. 'Shall I then riſk en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering with the great, the accumulating evils which intemperance produce; eſpecially when I ſee them making ſuch terrible havoc with thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round me? Is there not horror in the thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to deter me? Beſides what can be more ſhameful than to refuſe to be wiſe! On the other hand, how inviting are the benefits the rich varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of permanent bleſſings to which a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> temperance calls me! To be free from diſquietude and pain, from diſtreſſing anxieties, diſeaſes and agonies; to enjoy the free exerciſe of my rational powers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual health and ſerenity, to live long in felicity and honor; and when the period of this ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence arrives, that period which nature hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, to exchange it for immortality,—Surely theſe are glorious advantages worthy the contention againſt lawleſs indulgences though they were even more alluring than a falſe taſte hath rendered them.' 'Men think, added Laertes, that to reſtrain their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites is to render themſelves miſerable; till you can perſuade them, that though the reſtraining them is ſomewhat irkſome at firſt, yet it afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes to them a ſecond nature to live in the ſtricteſt temperance. When you have induced them to dwell in the ſubject, and to hear your arguments with pleaſure; they may preſently be animated to every neceſſary exertion; till at length they attain to an experimental knowledge of thoſe felicities
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:038495_0140_10122D858A5946D8"/>
with which temperance crowns her faithful vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trires. I would addreſs them, continued Laertes, in ſuch moving language as the following:—If tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance be the beſt preſervative of health, the friend of nature, and the offspring of virtue, the ſource of induſtry, and of every great and good action; if ſhe leads to true glory and renown, as ſhe fits the mind and body for every valuable purpoſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; if ſhe gives length of days, and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent enjoyment; and if, on the other hand an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate courſe inevitably leads to irreparable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; then let theſe weighty conſiderations rouze you from your unmanly indulgencies! break looſe from the ſhameful the diſgraceful fetters with which vice would forever enſlave you, before they become too firmly rivited to be rent aſunder.—Before it be too late, be intreated to ſpare yourſelves, ere the wanton waſte of your natural ſtrength can never be repaired; before unavailing regret and anguiſh be forced upon you, and cruel reflection awakes, like a giant refreſhed with wine; at once daſhing in pieces, every deluſive hope, and inflicting tortures that can never be fully expreſſed! For what can be conceived more dreadful than the condition of a perſon, who by his intemperance, has filled his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with loathſome, incurable, tormenting diſeaſes! add to this the agonizing reflection, that by his own folly he hath rendered, the pleaſant and delightſome ſummer of life, a dreary winter of premature old age, loaded with infirmities, diſorders, and racking pains! Thus would I endeavor to awaken my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures to a juſt ſenſe of their folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in deſtroying themſelves by their intemperance, and may ten thouſand tongues and pens be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſo laudable an attempt, with all the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive and alluring charms and parapraſe of unrival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:038495_0141_10122D871750DB58"/>
eloquence, exhibiting the unſpeakable happineſs of a life of ſobriety.—For is there a ſubject more worthy of the ſtrongeſt genius, or that more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately calls for the diſplay of the moſt ſhining talents, when viewed in all its high relations!'</p>
            <p>It was thus this worthy company paſt the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in converſing on ſubjects the moſt intereſting to mankind; whoſe perfect felicity was among their fondeſt wiſhes, and to promote which they were never wanting in the moſt vigorous exertions. The ladies had their ſhare in the converſation, and every ſentence they uttered did honor to their good ſenſe, their education, and their philanthropy. The time of repoſe being arrived, they retired, to their ſeveral apartments. In the morning after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſting, they reſumed their garden walks. Not that buſineſs was neglected. Philenor was not wanting in his addreſs to haſten his marriage. Nytan exerted himſelf to the ſame purpoſe—and Amelia, though em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in contemplation, ſtudy and writing, on the retired ſide of a hill ſhaded with groves, found ſome intervals of time to think on the ſame ſubject. She aroſe very early in the morning, and, entering the garden alone, ranged from grove to grove, and from hill to hill; till, at length, ſhe ſeated herſelf on the ſide of one that commanded a grand and engaging view of nature's variegated works. Here ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the hour of breakfaſt; and indulging her poetic and proſaic genius, compoſed the following little pieces on temperance and the glories of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>'Sacred temperance! with thee are d allied all the graces and virtues that adorn human nature, which render us worthy <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that exiſtence which Heaven hath beſtowed, and which its goodneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. Thou art the faithful guardian of human felicity. All ſhould celebrate thy merited praiſe,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:038495_0142_10122D88CD4AF058"/>
and every tongue ſhould ſpeak with rapture, of the invaluable bleſſings which thou doſt procure! yet, worthy as thou art of univerſal regard, and, ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable as are thy labours, too few are there to be found, of mankind, and even among thoſe called civilized nations, who pay a juſt attention to thy ſalutary laws! ſuch is the deplorable depravity of human nature! what a continued ſeries of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hath thy oppoſite—intemperance, brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the human race! Nor are either ſex to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.—With what wretched kings and rulers haſt thou peopled the world! what miſerable heads of families, parents, teachers and children! To rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy thy growing evils, inſtructions and warnings have been but to little purpoſe inculcated.—Cold and lifeleſs treatiſes on the virtues of temperance and ſobriety, however frequent, could accompliſh, upon the voluptuaries, no ſalutary effect. When diſtempers aſſail them, when ſickneſs and diſeaſes make depredations on their frames, they reluctant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit to the neceſſary reſtraints from luxurious indulgencies, and to an abſtemious diet; which is afterwards deſpiſed and miſimproved, when a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of health returns. A prudent and regular diet, ſo eſſential to health, is then no longer regarded, and they return to their former phrenzy.—If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who are inſtructors, underſtood and practiſed a juſt temperance, what happy conſequences might be expected to follow this example and inſtruction! if poſſeſſed of ſuperior abilities, they could not fail to recommend to every one, within the ſphere of their influence, the virtue they exemplified in their lives and manners, with the moſt alluring charms of eloquence; which doubtleſs muſt produce a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utary effect.—Happy would it be for the country, where I firſt drew my breath, could ſuch valuable inſtructors be obtained there! I might hope for a

Prince Nytan had tranſacted the affairs of his friend, effected an happy revolution in his native country, which held for ſeveral years, in which Rodrigo ſwayed the ſceptre. A counter revolution dethroned him. He was the friend of Nytan, the pupil of Ravenzar. By their aid, he with a few adherents to virtue, was ſoon rendered ſecure and happy in this favoured iſle. The Prince with his illuſtrious friends, had viſited the court of Renien, after having compleated his other affairs abroad.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It was about this time, (as related by a Chineſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Leinſhan</hi>) the Emperor Renien paid a viſit to his ſon, and was received by his friends and fellow citizens with the greateſt reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Another writer relates, that the veſſel which conveyed the Emperor, was by a ſtorm, drove on the rocks and ſplit to pieces. That the fairy Leingreing deſcended to his reſcue, in a magnificent vehicle drawn by dragons. She was accompanied by two females of exquiſite beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The ſpacious vehicle received the whole company of the Emperor, his two daughters and attendants. Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred minds, when they meet, ſoon become united in the bands of endearing friendſhip. They were all ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, by the fairy to Prince Nytans palace, where they remained ſeveral days when the Fairy announced her purpoſe of departing with her lovely companions. Ereng and Yerrie, the Emperors daughters, were ſeized with the moſt poignant grief at the thoughts of a ſeparation from their newly-acquired friends. They were twin ſiſters; and the Fairy had lately taken them into her protection, having relieved them from the deepeſt poverty and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This ſtory is affecting and intereſting. The Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Leingreing was conveying them to a receſs ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them; where they were to compleat their ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation, and after a ſeries of happy events they were to become inhabitants of Ravenzar. The Fairy perceiving the grief occaſioned by this ſeparation, aſſured them of an happy meeting in a few months in the Emperors palace. The Emperor after enjoying ſeveral weeks the pleaſures of Ravenzar returned to his own dominions, full of its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's; and it was a pleaſure to a mind like his to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſuperiority of Ravenzar.</p>

This was the day of their return to their beloved fellow-citizens. The ſhore was crowded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and congratulate their arrival. The ſun beamed forth with unuſual ſplendors, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture added new graces to her enchanting ſmiles!</p>
            <p>A grand feaſt was ſerved up in the hall and the courts and lawns around it; and the whole city en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, without the leaſt confuſion among ſo vaſt a multitude. There were concerts of muſic at proper intervals, and the illuſtrious aſſembly broke not up till long after the uſual hour of repoſe.</p>
            <p>Philenor and Amelia had been perſuaded to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038495_0148_10122D9682D714D0"/>
and the neices of Amelia were become ſo attached to the families of Prince Nytan and Geſſeng, that nothing could afford them more pleaſure than the reſignation of the villa. They were now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with buildings and gardens adjoining the Prince's. For which purpoſe the mountains were levelled to a great extent. One high wall encloſed all the gardens and buildings of the three friends. Nothing ever equalled their beauty and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The reſigned villa was made a preſent to Randor, one of the ſailors ſhip-wrecked with Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenor. He manufactured the fineſt of linen. Thus was this ſailor raiſed from the loweſt ſtate of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, by means of Ravenzar and the three friends; and placed in the happieſt ſituation in the fineſt country in the world. The unfortunate and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed are jyoifully received by the citizens of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar, formed by Heaven to benevolence. The Deity ever looks with melting pity on the uniſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſtitute. Not one eſcapes his all-ſeeing eye; and for every one he appears, at the proper hour and moment of relief. The Prince frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent a ſolitary hour in his chamber in the grove, the chamber which reminded him of paſt affecting ſcenes. There he often thought of his rural retreat in China, and the happineſs it afforded his friends. He was ſtill fond of that pleaſant receſs of his own forming. There he likewiſe wrote to his ſiſters. The following extract from one of his letters is at once expreſſive of his fondneſs for that retirement, and the affectionate and exalted ſentiments of his heart. And his memoirs of Elvina are far from unentertaining. The ſiſters, when they received the epiſtle, were ſitting together in one of its moſt delightful chambers over their tea. It gave indeed an heightened reliſh to their evenings repaſt. The Prince, after relating ſome intereſting domeſtic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:038495_0149_10123F4812B064B0"/>
thus continues, 'And why are we ſevered from each other at ſo great a diſtance? Is it not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our pleaſure more extatic, when we meet? Add to this, the other pleaſures of abſent friends in each other, and the pleaſing, the tranſporting expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of futute meeting.—O! my dear ſiſters, how far ſurpaſſing the moſt ſanguine hopes is our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here? With what an illuſtrious groupe of friends am I encircled! what aſtoniſhed ſucceſs hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended our benevolent exertions! and what a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine acceſſion of celeſtial aid hath exalted our glory and happineſs, beyond the power of language to expreſs! But ſoon, very ſoon will you converſe with a few of us, in your happy receſs. Ah! ſacred, volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous retirement!

How far, how exceeding far, are mankind diſtanced from juſt ideas of living—from the true enjoyment of exiſtence. Theſe ariſe only from a juſt knowledge of the Deity, conſtant dependance upon and unreſerved confidence in him. Hence we reaſon juſtly, think and act wiſely; and our day is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways clear and ſerene.

There real worth and true modeſty are ſtrangers.

            <p>'The retired Elvina, (of whom I formerly gave you ſome anecdotes) hath lately entertained ſome of us in her romantic abode. You will be ſurpriſed when I acquaint you ſhe married to the venerable Dargenn. They have enlarged the boundaries of their dwelling in the foreſt.

            <p>Elvina ſtill retains, in a great meaſure, her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities and gloomineſs of mind, notwithſtanding her change of condition. She hath expreſſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, and her melancholy turn, in a paper, which I found on the carpet in her little temple (as ſhe calls it) embowered with trees, that give a deep ſhade, ſuited to the gloom of its owner. It is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the creator, and is the following.</p>
            <p>'Wherefore, O ſource of intellectual light! am I thus perpetually involved in darkneſs—in the groſseſt ignorance. What crimes did I perpetrate in my former ſtate of exiſtence, ere I had a being in this world of wretchedneſs? Why am I thus miſerable—thus diſtanced from thee by whom only I exiſt?</p>
            <p>'Thou art good—unqueſtionably good and kind. Wherefore are ſo many millions deſtitute of real happineſs—involved in vice and miſery? Why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineſt thou at a diſtance from thoſe who ſeek thee? And why am I thus iſolated from ſociety, as not like the reſt of the human ſpecies;—thus incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſocial converſe? I cannot attain it. But I would converſe with the good, the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; with thoſe only would I aſſociate, wherever they are to be found. But I am void of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

            <p>'Reach forth the hand of benignity and love, O beſt and lovelieſt of beings—heal, raiſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the loweſt of thy creatures; that ſhe may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cheerful and glad in thee tranquil and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene—at reſt and peace in thee—that ſhe may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a gaiety of heart that is of thee; not like that of the fooliſh, And why haſt thou deſtined ſo very few to be wiſe and good?

Yet thou art moſt aſſuredly good tender and kind: and thy juſtice ariſes from thy goodneſs.

Then ſhall I ariſe on the wings of love, and diffuſe light, and joy, and felicity around. Draw us to thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Unveil thy beauties to our ſight. Then, and then only ſhall we live. For moſt ſurely thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt our felicity, and nothing can thwart thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Thou who art happy, perfectly happy; and good, perfectly good; muſt delight in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and happineſs. Whence, O whence this veil of darkneſs? Haſte to rend it from our hearts! But I fear alas! I aſk that which I deſire not. We are in love with our eccentricity. We delight to wallow in our pollution. We deſire felicity, but are averſe to the means through which it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. We would feign effect impoſſibilities; and

reap the delicious fruits of virtue in the thorny fields of vice. Thou Almighty! All-benificent! art able to rectify theſe diſorders, and diſpoſe each heart to good.</p>
            <p>'Elvina, thou loveſt thy huſband: but alas! to attract his affections, thou haſt nothing—nothing lovely or amiable. He married thee to take care of thee and thy intereſt.

            <p>'The preſent ſituation of Elvina's mind is owing to former ill-uſage, and bad health. The regimen preſcribed for her will be effectual. She will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. A large fortune afforded her the means of forming her ſolitary habition. Dargenn conducts with much prudence.<note n="*" place="bottom">'Yes, I believe the purpoſe of Heaven is our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal felicity, ſaid Dargen, I pretend not to deny it. Indeed the argument appears unanſwerable againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. Do they imagine, ſaid he, the Creator formed creatures to curſe their maker? Which they muſt do, if he made but to deſtroy; gave exiſtence but to annihilate. For a continuation of that being is of all things the moſt deſirable. And do we know we muſt forever ceaſe to exiſt, that our life may be the more miſerable? This makes the Creator a malevolent being, who merits the curſe of his creatures. Then every thing great, good, and glorious, are ſources of miſery, and vain is virtue. Neither have we need of grateful hearts. What have we for which to be thankful, if born only to ſee good, and then forever to be deprived of it. If it be ſo, God and his creation are utterly contemptible. No wonder men depraved and vicious, proud and inſolent harbor ſuch ideas; they are the offspring of vice and ill-nature. But the virtuous are as ſore of their future, as of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being and bliſs. They know infinite perfection accompliſhes endleſs being the happineſs; and that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more impoſſible than our total annihilation.</note> Her few attendants are

very good. I ſhall ſee my wiſhes accompliſhed. Dargenn will be happy with Elvina; and they will become inſtrumental of much good in future life. What a variety of miſerable ſituations is the allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the children of men; which ariſe from want of judgment, prudence and foreſight, and a readineſs of apprehenſion and diſcernment, and of ſeaſonable recollection; as well as from the want of good health, the ſure conſequence of intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or inattention to their peculiar conſtitutions! When mankind have the wiſdom and fortitude to be truly temperate, their grievances will ceaſe;—when Deity puts forth the healing hand. The cure, the effectual cure is from Heaven; and ere long will it be accompliſhed. The gift of exiſtence to men—how ineſtimable! In contemplating it, I am filled with adoring admiration and a pleaſure extat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic. To live—to live to God in heavenly converſe with the Deity, and with each other; in all things to ſee, to enjoy the all-beneficent ſource of life and worlds;—this, my ſiſters, is life; life overflowing with bliſs!'</p>

Thus writes Prince Nytan, to his beloved and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable ſiſters, from his little retired chamber; once the priſon of his confinement, when decoyed from their agreeable ſociety in the receſs; in which they ſtill, with their invaluable friends, ſpent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a delightful hour.</p>
            <p>One day when he was enjoying a ſolitary hour in his little chamber in the garden, who ſhould enter its door but Sanden and Roderigo, arm in arm.—He was both ſurprized and tranſported. Springing from his ſeat—How agreeably ſudden and unlooked for is this! cried he. Welcome dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends! I am overjoyed to ſee you! 'Ah my Prince! returned Sanden, this ſituation, this apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! well am I reminded of a cruel traitor and enemy, and of his attrocious crimes! What celeſtial goodneſs would he have blaſted!' A ſhower of tears ſucceeded thoſe words. The inſide of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he knew, notwithſtanding ſome alterations, to be the ſame in which his Prince had been formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and deſtined to death. The Prince was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected for a moment. But recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—'My deareſt Sanden, cried he, how happy have my little misfortunes rendered me, by procuring me your invaluable friendſhip! Such, my Roderigo, is Sanden, both to you and me, that nothing can ever diſturb our mutual felicity.' 'Well replied San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, our worthy and amiable friend ſhall, at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time, be made acquainted with all. You muſt haſten with us to the palace, to ſee the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious company we have brought you, and learn how it has happened, that we, whom you believed to be thouſands of miles diſtant from each other, now meet in Ravenzar.</p>
            <p>Geſſeng was arrived with his fleet from China, and Ravenzar and Roderigo from the country of the latter, with great numbers of worhty families.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:038495_0155_10123F5671BDBFD8"/>
Inexpreſſibly joyful was the meeting of theſe friends and the newly acquired citizens. They were feaſted ſeveral days by the inhabitants of Xuntien. Ravenzar left them on the third day from their arrival: and, as the fleet was ſoon to return to China, Roderigo choſe to accompany Sanden, and viſit that renowned empire; from whence, after a few weeks, he returned to his beloved friends; and was accommodated with Philenor's manſion in Xuntien, till further arrangements were made in his favor by the vigilence of the Prince and the citizens.</p>
            <p>The principle men of Xuntien and the other cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, now often aſſembled with Prince Nytan to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on the intereſts of their country, and plan ſchemes of utility the moſt wiſe, the moſt benevolent and the moſt extenſive. Here (writes an hiſtorian of Xuntien) was a government of a moſt ſuperior kind; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembling that of an higher order of beings, whoſe exiſtence is beyond the ken of human ſight, except when ſuch of them as are commiſſioned from Heaven render themſelves viſible, and hold converſe with the wiſe and virtuous of mankind.—Here (in this new-formed community) was diſplayed the moſt conſummate wiſdom, and the moſt excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of virtue, piety, and diſintereſted benevolence. Here was become univerſally habitual, a tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and happineſs for incalculable years. Here the citizens, of both ſexes, increaſe beauty, and vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and every amiable accompliſhment, as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in life. Many, ſeveral hundred years old have ſtill all the bloom and energy of youth, the moſt perfect exerciſe of the mental powers; and wait, in cheerful expectation of the approaching period when, with immortality, all nations ſhall be forever united in the moſt pure and the moſt ſublime enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:038495_0156_10123F5980AD6E70"/>
of exiſtence. Happy community ſo highly privileged! with whom exalted intelligences ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to humanity often aſſociate! here, too, the ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ants of the foreſts have have put off their ſavage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and rejoice with man! here no noxious ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal lives, nor a creature perpetrates miſchief, or excites a fear! Such is the reward of virtue like that of the citizens of this favored iſle!</p>
            <p>Roderigo now employed moſt of his time in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the affairs and manners of the country; was exceedingly happy in the friendſhip of his fellow-citizens, and ſoon became moſt eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for his abilities and his exertions for the public good. A peculiar circumſtance had attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, even from his earlieſt years, and very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, conſidering his many amiable qualities:—He affected not female ſociety, though few were more capable of rendering themſelves agreeable to the moſt engaging of the fair. His mind was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, his heart tender and benevolent, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior perfectly formed. This peculiarity is to be accounted for only from the ſecret influence of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar on his mind, leaſt an attachment ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with a ſeries of events that were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of his future felicity in the connubial ſtate. Neither is it unfrequent, in this world of myſteries and eccentricities, that things, unaccountable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſdom and diſcernment, are in the chain of events wiſely ordered, and in their proper place. However, the perfection of the female character, now preſented to him, began to inſpire other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in his heart, than ſuch as he perhaps with too muſt reaſon had indulged in his native country.</p>

            <p>THE mild and calm region of peace and health; where unaffected modeſty and ſweet affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rendered beauty and wit enchanting, and minds cultivated with real ſcience; was the bliſsful lot of Nytan, and the friends with whom he was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—in a country deſtined to be the richeſt ſample, to the world, of nature in all her lovelineſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and felicity. But his generous heart, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding with benevolence towards the human race, admitted not of his confinement, even to friends and citizens ſo worthy and amiable, or to an iſland ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, ſo extenſive, and populated by thouſands of inhabitants, every individual of which were ever ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of affording him the moſt agreeable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſincereſt pleaſure. They were citizens who delighted only in real virtue, and whoſe manners were pure and refined; and therefore could not fail of being always pleaſing and engaging to a mind formed like his. But he loved to range a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in queſt of adventures indeed of the moſt excellent and ſuperior kind; not in the purſuit of vain, fooliſh ambition, wanton pleaſure; but

after objects of benevolence ſuch objects as moſt expreſſively called for thoſe friendly aids, thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous attentions, which Nytan was formed, by the ſource of goodneſs, to in a world adminiſter, in olved in the diſgraces and miſeries inſeparable from folly and vice; in nations whoſe great are ſo meanly lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and whoſe inſtructors and guides are ſo baſely degenerate, ſo uninformed in real wiſdom and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.—In the purſuit of ſuch adventures, through which only true glory is acquired, he was unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, bold and enterpriſing; diſcouraged by no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or difficulties, deterred by no dangers.</p>
            <p>It was on one of his benevolent excurſions to Bagdad, he was accompanied by Philenor, Silena, Amelia and her lovely neices. Aledden, the grand vizier's ſon, had no power to reſiſt the charms of Maria. He firſt beheld her at the country ſeat his father poſſeſſed a few miles from the city; at which he, with his gueſts, were only refreſhing themſelves, in order to proceed to his moſt favoured ſeat twelve miles further, where were the moſt magnificent gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. It was there the grand vizier, having lately become a widower, chiefly reſided. Aleddin's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs prevented his attending the company to that ſeat, and the next day he was to go on urgent affairs to a far diſtant town. He had therefore but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments converſation with Maria, in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to her how painful was the obligation he was under to ſeparate himſelf from her and her worthy and amiable friends. When they were gone forward on their route, he gave way to chagrin and grief at being ſo unfortunately circumſtanced: when, on looking over the papers he was to take with him on his journey, he found to his joy, an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential document miſſing. This made it neceſſary that he ſhould ſet out in the evening to wait on his father for the paper he had neglected to leave.

When he arrived within view of the houſe, he was in raptures to ſee Maria on the road, far diſtanced from the reſt of the company, who were walking. He haſtened to her, and, diſmounting from his horſe, begged leave to attend her; informing her of the circumſtance that rendered him ſo happy as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her once more before he ſat out on his journey. In expreſſing to her his affection he was heard by Maria with greateſt apparant indifference; and at length ſhe inſiſted upon his entirely dropping the ſubject. When they were arrived to the houſe, he waited on his father in his cloſet, who ſurpriſed at his own negligence, gave him the paper, inſiſting on his returning after ſupper, and haſtening his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. He knew the neceſſity of this too well to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. He was happy however in the preſence of the fair object of his affection at ſupper, and with the company and converſation of her illuſtrious friends. Ritiring to a chamber, he penned an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Maria, which having finiſhed, and left with a ſervant on whom he could depend to deliver to her, if poſſible, that evening, he returned to the company, bade them adieu, and departed to prepare for his journey on the morrow.</p>
            <p>When Maria peruſed the epiſtle, it preſented to her a mind formed to her fondeſt wiſhes. At the bottom of it ſhe read the following lines—</p>
            <q>
               <l>A mind ſo ſweetly form'd to love</l>
               <l>As thine, ſure ne'er can cruel prove,</l>
               <l>Hence hope the lover's heart ſuſtains;</l>
               <l>Deſpair ſuſpends, and ſooths his pains.</l>
               <l>Then view him, fair one, as he is,</l>
               <l>Without deceit and mean diſguiſe.</l>
               <l>O! <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his fondeſt purpoſes,</l>
               <l>And kindly ſeal his future bliſs!</l>
               <l>The faithleſs and inconſtant lover</l>
               <l>Thy piercing eyes muſt ſoon diſcover:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="161" facs="unknown:038495_0160_10123F63287888E0"/>
But Aleddin his heart reveals,</l>
               <l>And not a ſingle thought conceals.</l>
            </q>
            <p>As Aleddin had intreated for an anſwer to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle; Maria after ſeveral hours muſing on the ſubject of it, in a delightful grove whither ſhe often retired, at length took her pen, and complied with his requeſt. Their correſpondence continued till his return when they became conſtant viſitants to the grove, and admired together the pleaſant ſcenes around it,</p>
            <p>After a few days Philenor attended the grand vizier to his houſe in town to aſſiſt him ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Amelia and Silena viſited the Sultana. Prince Nytan having ſpent an hour in writing, walked out alone.</p>
            <p>At a ſmall diſtance from the houſe, was a large wood. A pleaſant opening in it invited him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. One agreeable view ſucceeding another, drew him forward, till he found himſelf on the further ſide of the wood; and a vaſt plain before him, which ſeemed bounded only by the horizon. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſtill inclined to walk, and excited by ſome degree of curioſity to know what terminated ſo extenſive a plain, he purſued his courſe over it till he ſaw before him, a large building, environed by an high wall, be perceived one of the leaves of the gate open, which an increaſed curioſity deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him to enter. When he had entered the gate, he walked through a grand porch of marble, furniſhed with ſoffas and a carpet of cloth of gold. He made a ſtand in the court, and looked on all ſides to ſee if any one obſerved him. But no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appeared, at which he was greatly ſurpriſed. He walked on to the hall, the gate of which was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, having a curtain of ſilk and gold partly drawn before it. Here he made another ſtand, and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:038495_0161_10123F64D144CAA8"/>
with his ſtaff, at the gate. No one yet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he repeated knocking, but could make nobody hear. He then put aſide the curtain, and entered the hall, calling aloud as he advanced into it; but to no purpoſe. He neither ſaw nor heard any perſon or creature. The hall he obſerved to be furniſhed with the moſt profuſe magnificence. The windows being open, preſented to his view an extenſive and delightful garden, and the birds charmed him with ſweet melody; the only exiſting beings he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. He ſat to one of the windows, ſome time, to reſt and entertain himſelf with the beautiful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of beds of flowers, ſpacious gravel walks lined with fruit trees, and diſtant groves, and raiſed grounds which extended a great diſtance before him. At length he imagined he heard human cries in a diſtant part of the garden; and a door, which led into it, being open on the right hand, he haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through it, and walked down the garden, on the ſide from whence the ſounds he heard ſeemed to ariſe. As he advanced nearer he was convinced they were the cries of a perſon in diſtreſs. He quickened his pace, and entered, through a ſmall gate, into a thick grove. In few minutes, he beheld too plainly, what had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed him. In the centre of the grove, was a large vacancy, where three Africans were beating a man who was almoſt naked.</p>
            <p>The building and the grounds about it, were the property of a rich Turk; who having loſt a lovely and amiable wife, the month after his marriage, had retired thither from ſociety. He was attended only by a few African ſlaves, who taking advantage of his deep retirement, and incenſed againſt him on account of former rigorous treatment, aimed at his death, and the poſſeſſion of his treaſures. Prince Nytan having freed the ſufferer, and ſecured the blacks was entertained by the Turk, Siedden, with
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:038495_0162_10123F67680047B8"/>
the moſt grateful acknowledgments. One of the ſlaves, (diſſenting from the wicked purpoſes of the aſſaſſins,) they had confined; not daring to touch his life, becauſe he was of a great family in their own country; to which they intended returning; having ſecretly provided every thing for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. To this honeſt and worthy ſlave, Sieddin gave his freedom, and a ſum of money, by which he was enabled to return to Africa, if he thought proper. Nytan likewiſe perſuaded him to free the others, to pardon and diſmiſs them; offering a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of money from his own purſe to defray their expences in returning home. He converſed with them in their own language. He enlightened their minds and inſpired them, at length with unfeigned contrition. Few ſons of Kings thought and acted like this Prince and heir to the Chineſe empire. Sieddin admired his virtues, liſtened with eagerneſs and delight to his inſtructive converſation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded with pleaſure, by him before unfelt, to his benevolent deſigns.</p>
            <p>Thus was our amiable philanthropiſt acting in concert with Heaven in deducing good from evil. The diſſenting ſlave, whoſe name was Zaddguin, was tranſported with joy at this unexpected turn of affairs, this divine interpoſition to reſcue the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed and reclaim the vicious and abandoned. Prince Nytan learned of Zaddquin, that Africa ſcarcely ever produced a more amiable and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous monarch than was Mingeng, the ſovereign of the realm of which he was a ſubject. 'He was an enemy to every ſpecies of ſlavery (ſaid Zaddquin.) He ſuffers none of his ſubjects to be concerned in that inhuman traffic. The Almighty, ſaid he, will avenge it by a dreadful puniſhment.' 'Yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Nytan, the emancipation of the human race from every ſpecies of ſlavery is not far diſtant. The
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:038495_0163_10123F6A1C831280"/>
miſts of ignorance are faſt diſperſing. You, Zadd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin, ſhall carry a letter from me to your ſovereign. He is the friend of humanity, and will become an inſtrument of much good in the African world.'</p>
            <p>Thus by the benign interpoſition of Heaven and the friend of mankind, Zaddquin again beheld his native country, and his family. He preſented the Prince's letter to his ſovereign. Mingeng profited by its inſtructions, and many of his ſubjects, after a correſpondence was opened between him and king Zanger, whom the Prince recommended to his friendſhip, beſides furniſhing him with ſuitable books in his own language. Uſeful knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make a rapid progreſs through thoſe two Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican realms.</p>
            <p>Sieddin became a convert to the principles of freedom and truth; between whom, and Prince Nytan, a correſpondence was ſettled; when the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, taking leave of his newly acquired friends, ſat out on his walk back to the grand vizier's. On his way through the wood, he beheld a youth engaged with two others, and fighting valiantly for his life. They were robbers who attacked him. The Prince advanced unobſerved, and, aiming a ſtone at the head of one of the robbers, brought him to the ground: and a ſecond ſtone levelled the other robber at his ſide. The young man found himſelf at liberty, without ſeeing the hand that did the execution on his adverſaries. Nytan ſoon diſcovered himſelf; and advancing to the youth congratulated him on his ſafety, offering himſelf for company through the reſt of the wood.</p>
            <p>'I am an inhabitant of this wood, replied the young man. The manſion of my friends is not far from hence: and, as I am obliged to you for my life, let me prevail with you, my noble and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friend, to walk home with me, and take ſome
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:038495_0164_10123F6BC78AE498"/>
refreſhment, that I may there have an opportunity of ſhewing my gratitude.'</p>
            <p>This youth was of an handſome and engaging form; and there was ſomething in his countenance that gave an additional charm to his addreſs, which agreeably compelled the Prince to accept of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation. They walked together in a path that led through the thickeſt of the wood. At length a grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual opening diſcovered the young ſtranger's ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abode, which they ſoon reached. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was elegant, and ſurrounded with a variety of fruit trees. They entered a handſome apartment, in which ſat a man and a woman, who appeared in the vigor and bloom of youth. 'O reward the man who hath ſaved me from robbers,'—Exclaimed the youth. 'Welcome Prince Nytan, cried they, riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Your appearance exactly agrees with the grand vizier's deſcription of the firſt of men.' And they cordially embraced. 'Such as I am ſaid the Prince, I profeſs myſelf your friend and ſervant, and a ſincere lover of you and yours.' 'What we ſpeak, ſaid the beautiful woman, is warm from our hearts. The character given you by the grand vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, was ſufficient to inſpire our love, reſpect and eſteem, amiable Prince, without the additional ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to affection and gratitude, on account of the ſervice you have rendered this youth, the richeſt treaſure of which we boaſt. Pray Prince be ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and henceforward call this houſe, and its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, your own, and likewiſe all they poſſeſs. Now we have ſeen Prince Nytan under our roof, we can ſay we have lived to ſome valuable purpoſe.' The Prince, bluſhing, ſat down, ſaying he was bound to exert himſelf to become worthy of their affections. And I find continued he, I have more worthy and ineſtimable friends than the grand vizier
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:038495_0165_10123F6EEEFEF9B0"/>
had adviſed me of. But, pray let me be no longer ignorant by what names to call them.'</p>
            <p>'Call me Debournon, ſaid the elder, and the young man, whom you have made forever obliged to you, Parcellus. My fair partner's name is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina. Is ſhe not fair and handſome, Prince, for a woman who has ſeen her two hundred and fiftieth year? and I am only a year older. There hath been no very perceivable alteration in our health's or perſons, for above two hundred and thirty years. We are both the adopted children of your illuſtrious friend Ravenzar.' How you aſtoniſh me! replied Nytan. This day hath been to me a day of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: and you, ſire, will be of my opinion, when I have related to you its events! But why are not you, with your little family (if I ſee all of it before me) inhabitants of the iſland of Ravenzar? For I am perſuaded you have been long (ere now) quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for that happy country.' 'I will inform you, returned he, preſently. But firſt let my Sabina ſet before us refreſhment. And while we are eating and drinking together, I will relate to you our little hiſtory. Sabina then laid the cloth in another room, and placed the table before them, near a door, which being open, commanded a view of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, fields, and groves; the woods being on either ſide of the delightful proſpect; which the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſun rendered the more beautiful and charming; whilſt the variety of birds entertained them with their ſprightly ſongs.</p>
            <p>Debournon reſumed his diſcourſe.—'My dear Prince, ſaid he, illuſtrious as you are, and of nobleſt deſcent; yet your mind, far more noble, diſdains not the man of meaneſt birth, whoſe virtues render him a uſeful member of ſociety, and prepare him for the enjoyment of ſublimer pleaſures and honors than this tranſitory ſcene affords? Permit me to ſay, my
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:038495_0166_10123F70D79EFB58"/>
beloved and revered ſire, (interrupted Nytan) that I value not myſelf for being born a Prince, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that degree of virtue and uſeful knowledge, which, by the bounty of Heaven I poſſeſs. I have renounced kingdoms; diſdained the titles of royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nobility, (they are beneath my ambition) and glory in being only a citizen of Ravenzar, formed by men, who had no honors of which to boaſt, but ſuch as aroſe from their probity and benevolence. Thoſe only convey real honor to their poſſeſſors. Pardon, ſire my interruption, and let me intreat you to proceed in your relation.' 'My parents reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Debournon, were the meaneſt of mechanics in Bagdad; yet, free from diſgrace—they were honeſt and induſtrious. I loſt them very early, and was left a poor friendleſs deſtitute orphan. At a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy date, from my exiſtence, the benevolent genie Ravenzar was pleaſed to take notice of me; and, after a few neceſſary gifts and good counſels, he one day told me that if I inclined to agriculture, he would buy me a piece of ground, ſtock it, and provide me with a ſervant to aſſist my labour. I expreſſed my gratitude, and the pleaſure I ſhould take in a country life, provided I might have time to proſecute my ſtudies. For I was exceeding fond of books, and poſſeſſed an eager deſire of learning every thing that was attainable from the few left me by my father. The Genie highly applauded my paſſion for ſcience, and promiſed me his aſſiſtance, and a number of books. Labour, added he, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with a juſt temperance, will be of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to your health; and render you better ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſtudy. In a word, before another month c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed from the deceaſe of my father, who ſurvived my mother but a year, that generous friend of the poor, ſettled me on a part of theſe lands which I now poſſeſs, and afterwards added to my farm a tract
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:038495_0167_10123F7404D80168F"/>
of land containing two thouſand acres. In a few years, by his aſſiſtance, I built this houſe, and let out the ſmaller one I had occupied, to a tenant of his chuſing, who had ſons old enough and capable of cultivating a thouſand acres to great advantage. My income increaſed, I ſoon grew rich, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of affording aſſiſtance to others, after the noble example of my benefactor. Without my inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him he knew of the charities I had beſtowed, and applauded my generoſity and the prudence and diſcretion with which I exerciſed it. When I was arrived to the age of five and twenty, he entered my apartment with a young damſel fair as the morn. 'I have brought you a worthy female partner, ſaid he, ſay do you like her for a wife?' 'Who, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, can be otherwiſe than charmed and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with ſo much beauty and lovelineſs. If I might be ſo happy as to gain the affections'—'You have gained them already, interrupted Ravenzar, ſhe is yours. I brought her up for you. Stand forth then and be married.' And married we were, before we knew, ſcarely, what we were about. The Genie having married, embraced, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his bleſſing upon us, left us to ourſelves; ſaying as he went away, 'I will call upon you in the morning, and ſpend ſome time with you. Let your wife riſe early, and prepare us a good break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.' As he refuſed to ſtay to ſupper, (it being that hour) we eat and drank by ourſelves, and went to bed.</p>
            <p>'Before ſun-riſe, the Genie was at the door, in his chariot drawn by eight horſes. We were aſhamed to be found in bed; and riſing with the utmoſt expedition, went out to receive him, with the beſt excuſes we could make for not being earlier riſers, and being in waiting for his coming. Four men-ſervants followed him into the houſe, bearing
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:038495_0168_10123F7658697748"/>
a trunk, which they ſat down, and then retired. 'The trunk, and its contents are a preſent to you, my friends (ſaid Ravenzar). It contains the moſt valuable of diamonds. Exchange the greater part of them with the jewellers in Bagdad.—They are worth twelve thouſand pieces of gold.—Share them among the needy and unfortunate. Inviſible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will direct your minds aright.' 'Ye are our guardian angels! exclaimed Sabina.' 'We are your beſt friends on earth, returned he. Unſeen by you we inſtruct you; and ſave you from innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dangers, of which you are inſenſible, and yet we ourſelves are likewiſe inſtructed and ſuſtained by ſuperior power. All the happy intelligences, throughout the creation, of various orders,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are continually ſerving each other in kindeſt offices of love; and are attentive to the affairs of mankind. O! how great is the ſource of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Creator and upholder of the Univerſe! How good! how kind! how tender!—It is this—it is this, my friends, that enflames our love, and inſpires us, with unremitting activity, in copying after his works of benevolence and love I Renew then your ſtrength, ye children of my affection—from the ſame divine impetus <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the labours, of your happy choice—of diffuſing true knowledge and felicity, wherever your influence is appointed to extend!' Breakfaſt being ready, we ſat down; with our reſpected gueſt, feaſting our minds more rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and luxuriantly with his diſcourſe; which charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enlivened, while it inſtructed. 'The city of Bagdad, ſaid he, (reſuming his diſcourſe at the breakfaſt table) is large and full of people, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nations and religions as abſurd as they are inimical to the real proſperity and happineſs of the profeſſors. There are a few, however, and but a
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:038495_0169_10123F78B77D2F58"/>
few, whoſe minds are not wholly perverted by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous principles and depraved manners. Thoſe I ſhall, in a ſhort time, carry you to ſee; that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing friendſhip with them, you may become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental of confirming them in real virtue and juſt ſentiments. The preſent Sultan is endowed with a great ſhare of wiſdom, conſidering in what a depraved world he was brought up, and the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and political errors of the times. He is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying a greater reform among his ſubjects; by which, he will anſwer the wife purpoſes of Heaven, as to future events. He is a friend to liberty, but will by no means ſucceed in his endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its cauſe. His life is thereby endangered: yet Heaven, for its own wiſe reaſons, ſuffers him to be too eager and too violent.'</p>
            <p>'To live in a land of liberty, ſaid Debournon, and under a mild government, where peace and good order are not only objects of ſolicitous attention, but actually maintained; are temporal bleſſings high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be eſtimated; not the leaſt of which is liberty of conſcience, and free enquiry.' 'I am going to take you on a tour through Europe in a few days, returned the Genie, and then you will ſee what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe men make of liberty, and mild govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But the moſt flouriſhing of mere ſelfiſh things, can be but of ſhort duration, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance very uncertain. The glory and happineſs, derived from undiſſembled virtue and benevolence, can have no period to their exiſtence. They ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the riſe and fall of kingdoms and empires. They reach into eternity! Happy, thoſe minds el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evated above the follies and trifles that engage the attention of the greater part of mankind! they are Heaven-taught! they are divine! and are qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the regions of uninterrupted bliſs! I was intending to ſay more of the Sultan, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:038495_0170_10123F7B3AB9B4E8"/>
of ſome of the principal men of ſeveral nations of Europe, but we ſhall underſtand each other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after we have made the tour of Europe. And I fancy, when you are again returned hither, you will be apt to prefer your recluſe ſituation, to the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proſpects you will have found in the civilized nations, whoſe leading men have been too unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in forgetting to take proper care of themſelves, before they undertook the care of others. A ſad time of blunders, when wiſe men and politicians begin at the wrong end! you look as though you wondered how it ſo happens. But I will tell you the cauſe in a few words. They want good hearts. They have exiſtence, but know not how to enjoy it: they boaſt in themſelves, and are ignorant of their own weakneſs, and blind to futurity, they ſet their wills againſt God's. Yet for their good we gladly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and the happy reſult is not far off.'</p>
            <p>Ravenzar now roſe from table, and bid us adieu. 'I ſhall ſee you again, in two or three days, ſaid he, as he entered his chariot, in the mean time, all happineſs attend you—the happineſs of virtuous and benevolent minds!'</p>
            <p>'But not to weary you with too many particulars of a life of more than two hundred years, let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to add—that, I found myſelf vaſtly improved in knowledge, after travelling, with Ravenzar, through the nations of Europe. On my return, I beheld, with rapture, my Sabina holding two lovely babes in her arms! they were twins, a boy and a girl. No words are capable of expreſſing our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joy on this happy meeting, after an abſence of near eleven months. But, to contract my relation in as narrow limits as poſſible,—in twenty years, Sabina bore me fifteen children, ſix daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and nine ſons. Ravenzar viſited us often; and carried away with him all our children as ſoon
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:038495_0171_10123F7D96C18BD8"/>
as they were arrived to years of diſcretion, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled them in different parts of the world, under his particular care and inſpection. We were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to his proceedings, from the excellent reaſons he produced. But they are now citizens of your Republic, though as yet, to you not perſonally known. We ſhall however, ſoon be with them there. And then they will be ready to afford you ſome agreeable entertainment in the hiſtory of their lives, till they commenced citizens of Ravenzar. With their hiſtory are neceſſarily interwoven ſome remarkable anecdotes of Sabina and myſelf. The Genie carried us, a number of times, to viſit them. Sometimes we travelled with him in his aerial car, at others in his chariot, or on horſeback; which pleaſingly varied the delights of our journeys, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning ſome curious and profitable, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable adventures. My children's children are likewiſe diſperſed in various countries. After the ſame manner, and for the ſame reaſons as were ours, were they ſeparated from their parents; who, however, cheerfully reſigned to ſuperior wiſdom, patiently wait the day when they are to behold them in Ravenzar. Parcellus, the youth before you, is a native of China; and, (however it may ſurprize my friend) is the brother of Geſſeng, the compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of your former travels. He was no one knew how) ſeparated from his parents, at the age of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven. Ravenzar brought him to me, at the age of ſeventeen. He was my aſſiſtant, friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Here he purſued his ſtudies, and made the greateſt proficiency in all valuable ſcience. His mind was early formed to virtue. He is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your friendſhip and love.'</p>
            <p>Nytan aroſe from his ſoffa—'Let me, then, ſaid he, embrace the brother of Geſſeng. You have, continued he, my friendſhip, and my love. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:038495_0172_10123F8004521828"/>
ſhare with me, with Geſſeng and our other friends, in the bounties which indulgent Heaven hath beſtowed upon us. What a new and unlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for joy awaits your worthy and amiable brother, in which I ſhall likewiſe have the pleaſure of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating with him and his family! A happy fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, ſurrounded with happy friends; amongſt whom I hope ſoon to ſee you, my Parcellus, and you, my reſpected and loved friends!' We wait only leave from Ravenzar, replied Debournon.—But night admoniſhes us of reſt, and you will not leave us till morning. The grand vizier, promiſed to introduce us to you, and your friends; which I expected he would have done before this.' 'Let us then retire to reſt, if you pleaſe, returned the Prince; tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I purpoſe to bring my friends hither. They then retired to apartments, which, opening into each other, allowed them the pleaſure of converſing, till ſleep gently cloſed their eyes.</p>

            <p>THE variety of ſurpriſing adventures and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcoveries, conſequent upon a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's excurſion, afforded Nytan the moſt agreeable entertainment, as he walked to the Grand Vizier's ſeat, after breakfaſting with Debournon, and his engaging little family; to whom he was delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with the thoughts of introducing his friends, as he entered the grand viziers court. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena and Amelia, who ſaw him, from the window of the apartment in which they were mournfully ſitting, aroſe haſtily, and went out to meet him. Their grief was too great to be concealed, however alleviated by her appearance. 'Alas! cried he, my lovely women! whence the ſorrow ſo ſtrongly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictured in your countenances, for the firſt time, ſince the happy moments that united our hearts in the pureſt affection?' O my dear lord, replied Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, (as they mutually embraced) can you inform us of Julia and Maria?—Julia and Maria! returned he, ſurpriſed, are they not with you? hath any thing ill befallen our lovely girls?'—Amelia was ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with grief. She received the embraces of Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in ſilence; but with flowing tears, expreſſive of the deepeſt affliction. They ſat down in the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:038495_0174_10123F841881D590"/>
porch. Be comforted my dear Amelia, ſaid Nytan. Your nieces, I perceive, have abſented themſelves longer than you expected, and you fear ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter. But yield not to ſuch fear. Repoſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. At this moment, I perceive my error, which hath occaſioned your affliction.—My error, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Amelia, in bringing my girls abroad in this evil and diſaſtrous world.' 'Blame not yourſelf, my dear friend, rejoined Nytan. Of myſelf I have had too good an opinion, I only am to blame. Nor will I reſt a moment till I reſtore your nieces to your arms. Silena, inſtruct me what courſe to purſue. I will ſet out immediately. Where are Philenor and the grand Vizier?' 'They are gone in ſearch, anſwered Amelia.' 'We have, added Silena ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where in vain. But I am not without great hopes—if you enquire once more in Bagdad, where they were laſt ſeen.'—Selina then related all that had happened the preceding day, and that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 'I go then to Bagdad, ſaid he, but I conjure you, my dear ladies, he comforted. I ſhall bring you agreeable tidings.</p>
            <p>After ſome anxious enquiries, the Prince, by means of his little ſpying glaſs diſcovered the girls in Philenors new built manſion. He immediately gladdened the hearts of Amelia and his Selina, with a relation of his ſucceſs, and carried them to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bournon's At dinner they expreſſed a wiſh to ſee their admired hoſt, with his little family ſettled in their happy country, and likewiſe the grand vizier, whom they equally admired and reſpected.</p>
            <p>They had ſcarcely riſen from table, when they perceived Ravenzar's chariot. Debournon and Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan haſtened into the court to receive him. Alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the chariot, he was followed by Parcellus, who then handed out Sabina. 'I picked up theſe good people, ſaid Ravenzar, in yonder field; and I
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:038495_0175_10123F87353E0CF8"/>
aſſure you, my dear friends, I value myſelf on the acquiſition. It is of that ineſtimable worth that we ſhould not know how to do without it. Such (contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he, taking a hand of Debournon's, and one of Nytan's, and directing his expreſſive eyes on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina and Parcellus; then on Selina and Amelia, who were advancing towards them, as they walked up the court)—ſuch are the links of mutual affection, in which we are united by the divine ſource of life and love; that we muſt be inevitably unhappy in the loſs of one. But, the chain of love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can never be broken or impaired, by momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſeparations, or caſualties incident to the preſent ſtate. It will grow ſtronger and brighter with the increaſe of years, and be perpetuated, through end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs revolving ages, in the world of perfection. Permit me, my dear friends, added he, (when the laſt mentioned ladies joined them) to felicitate you on this happy meeting; and which I may ſafely venture to ſay, we ſhall ever recollect with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.' 'It is, I am perſuaded, replied Nytan, an unſpeakable happineſs to us all, to ſee and hear our noble and generous friend and benefactor. Some of us have been afflicted of late: yet the indulgence of Heaven has converted that affliction into increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy; and your preſence, moſt beloved and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected friend, exalts it to the higheſt.' 'The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of my friends, and their joy, are mine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Ravenzar.—But, added he, perhaps, what I have to communicate, may ſerve to convince us, that our mutual joy and pleaſure is not now ſo conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but that it may admit of an higher elevation.' Being entered the apartment, and ſeated, the Genie continued his diſcourſe; having by his laſt words, excited the curioſity, and raiſed the expectations of every one.</p>
            <p>'The time is fulfilled, ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:038495_0176_10123F89A714CA90"/>
to Debournon and Sabina. You are no longer to live in this ſtate of ſeparation from your children. I am come to convey you to Ravenzar, and our oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er friends, excepting Philenor, who will remain with the Grand Vizier, till, with his aſſiſtance, his affairs are ſettled; after which the aerial chamber will waft them to the abodes of peace and bliſs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his ſon Aleddin. I am further to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you—The Sultan was ſlain by his janiſſaries a few hours paſt; ſo that there can be no ſafety here for the grand vizier and his ſon; nor for the amiable Sultana. She is to embark with us, in a veſſel of my providing, which waits on the ſhore. Your eſtate here, Debournon, you will not want. I have given it to the two robbers, who would have killed your beloved Parcellus.' He ceaſed ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The company looked aſtoniſhed! but their aſtoniſhment was but momentary. They were too well taught, to miſconſtrue the ſentiments and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence deſigned to be conveyed, in a gayly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manner, by the laſt words of Ravenzar.—'O my benefactor and friend! the friend of all! exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Debournon, then your beneficence will be rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-repaid;—incapable as you are of irrational lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality. Something ſublimely great has influenced your procedure! the robbers then were not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlain, as we imagined. They live—but no longer plunderers and aſſaſſins. They greatly live, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py converts to virtue, and will become the friends; no more the oppreſſors of mankind. It muſt be ſo. And our joy will be boundleſs to day!' So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatic is the pleaſure which the reform of the vicious excites in the friends of humanity.</p>
            <p>'They are indeed rendered converts to virtue, reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Ravenzar. Extreme neceſſity drove them to the road for plunder; whilſt others were doing the ſame,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:038495_0177_10123F8C041EBFA0"/>
with more ſafety, in thrones or temples. While robbers they were under my eye. But I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your attention, at preſent, in relating the means I have uſed with them; the murders I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from being perpetrated by their hands. On ſome future day, they will have it in their power to entertain you with their own hiſtory. Let it ſuffice to ſay, that as they are men of knowledge and penetration; they are likewiſe now become men of virtue and benevolence. And, as ſuch, they are to ſucceed my Debournon in the ſame labours of love to mankind, in which he hath been here, ſo ſucceſſfully employed. He hath, in Ravenzar, a ſpacious and delightful manſion prepared; which he will exchange for this, and double the number of acres he enjoyed here; ſituated near the road to Terman, and about five miles from that city. The Sultana we ſhall call upon. And what is there my friend, to hinder our ſupping to night in Debour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's manſion in Ravenzar?'</p>
            <p>The will of their powerful guardian friend, was to them a law. They learned it with an extatic pleaſure, and that night was it happily fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Every thing fortunately occurred to haſten the marriages of the ſeveral parties. Almira, and ſoon after her ſiſter Sapphira, embraced their mother, from whom they had been long ſeparated. Her name was Adeline. She was full of the praiſes of the benevolent Ravenzar; who ſaid ſhe, (relating her ſtory to Almira) ſoothed my griefs, aſſiſted me with his advice, and at lengh conducted me to this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred aſylum, placed me in a pleaſant village amongſt men and women, who are more like angels and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphs than like children of the earth.' Sapphira had been ſold for a ſlave to Mahumed, though never treated as ſuch. Roderigo was vanquiſhed by her beauty and uncommon mental accompliſhments
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:038495_0178_10123F8DC48549A0"/>
and their union was to take place on the ſame day of that of Maria with Alexis, Julia with Aleddin, and Parcellus with Almira. A large and brilliant company were aſſembled for ſeveral days at Debour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's; from whence they rode out in parties on different routs. Ravenzar and Parcellus directed their courſe to the boundaries of the iſland, on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, through a vaſt foreſt. I am about to ſhew you, ſaid Ravenzar to the latter, my private apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that you may enjoy them at your leiſure, in my abſence. Then I ſhall introduce you to the ſeat of our future reſidence, which you will find el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egant, and in every reſpect adapted to your taſte. As they rode through the foreſt, Ravenzar diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the expected future glorious date of the world. 'Many have wrote, ſaid he, on this ſubject; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine it to be only a ſtate of uninterrupted ſenſual enjoyments; in which they are greatly deceived. It will be a ſtate of the ſublimeſt enjoyment, and of the conſummation of every wiſh of the heart divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed for perfect and endleſs felicity. It is then the Deity will unfold his beneficent plan. To that ſtate of perfection all things tend. It is then the divine architect will, with the moſt exquiſite ſkill, adorn his creation in his own beauty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the moſt eminent degrees. For this, he began his ſtupendous work. For this light ſprang from darkneſs, creation ſhone forth in its various luſtres, and intellectual day dawned upon the world. Nature had been very liberal in the beſtowment of her gifts on the youth now travelling with Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar. He had a clear perception of moral and natural beauties, and was a moſt affectionate admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of every thing beautiful, grand and ſublime. He was enraptured with the magnificent ſcence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the progreſs he had already made in phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, both natural and moral, excited in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:038495_0179_10123F90DBE0E2F8"/>
wonder, and raviſhing delight in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the great power and goodneſs of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The excellent thoughts he expreſſed, and his agreeable manners, were highly gratifying to his guardian friend and inſtructor. 'My dear Parcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, ſaid he, words fail to expreſs the pleaſure I I take in your happy turn of mind, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you have made in ſcience and virtue. You will be a rich acquiſition to all our dear and worthy friends, and one of the brighteſt ornaments of their ſociety. Infinitely happy will ye be in each other. Such are the recompenſes of attention to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the wiſe; and vaſt are the advantages you are now going to enjoy in this ſecure aſylum from the many evils to which mankind are ſtill ſubject. Let us ſtrengthen each others hearts and hands in the performance of our ſeveral duties, co-operating with the Deity in his works of beneficence and love.'</p>

            <p>YOU ſee yonder towering pile of rocks, whoſe craggy ſummits ſeem blended with the ſilver clouds, ſaid Ravenzar, as they approached the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of the iſland. It is through <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> we are to enter my apartments. You muſt remain here, whilſt I proceed forward to open us a paſſage. When it is accompliſhed, you will perceive it, and ride up to me. Alight then, my Parcellus, and reſt awhile under theſe lofty trees, whoſe tufted foliage will defend you from the meridian rays.' Having ſaid this, he rode on to the rocks. Parcellus ſeated himſelf on a moſſy hillock, under the ſhade of a Palmetto; ſo as that he could diſtinctly obſerve the Genies progreſs. When the Genie was advanced to thoſe ſtupendous rocks, a dark vapour ſuddenly concealed him wholly from the view of Parcellus. The Heavens lowered and gathered blackneſs! A tremendous peal of thunder ſhook the ſolid world! All nature trembled around! The youth was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with terror and conſternation; It was as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ruin had commenced its awful deſolating ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer! but, ſoon his fears were diſſipated, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning light, and cheering ſerenity of day. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar again appeared to his view; he beheld a
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:038495_0181_10123F9640CF5238"/>
wide aperture in the rocks, through which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie entered, making a ſign to him to haſten forward. Then mounting his horſe he rode on to the aperture; which he had no ſooner entered, following Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, than it was rendered impenetrable by a black, fiery cloud; which ſerved as a barrier againſt any intruſion from without. But it is impoſſible juſtly to deſcribe the beauty and lovelineſs of the proſpect before him! The apartments, ſeven in number, ſtood, at ſome diſtance from each other, in a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious garden, laid out and furniſhed with inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able magnificence and gaity. They were of ſolid gold; their roofs and windows of pureſt chryſtal glaſs; and partially ſhaded by tall and broad-leaved trees, whoſe wide ſpreading branches waved gently over them; and had a moſt enchanting effect on the whole ſcenery to the eyes of thoſe either within or without the apartments. The gardens of Nytan, and ſeveral others on the iſland, with a number of buildings, are very far from being equalled in any part of the world. But here was a richneſs, a lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriancy and ſplendor, exceeding thoſe. The groves, the fruit trees, and beds of flowers and fruits, were diſpoſed with inimitable art. The ſpacious alleys were of gold and marble. The walls of this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den appeared to be of looking-glaſs and of a vaſt height; reflecting the gay and beautiful ſcenes they encloſed. At the diſtance of about twelve rods from the apartments, and on the right hand, as they advanced towards them, the ground was raiſed a number of feet, with a gradual aſcent by ſeveral flights of ſteps of ſolid gold; beyond which at ſome diſtance, appeared, numbers of hills, clothed with verdure, riſing one above another and bounding the delicious proſpect. Ravenzar and Parcellus, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting their horſes, and turning them looſe on the lawn, over which they had rode, walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:038495_0182_10123F982BD9AD70"/>
the firſt apartment in their way. A beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful youth to appearance, clothed in a white flowing robe, ſtood at the door. It was Eſdren: who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Ravenzar and Parcellus, advanced to meet them: 'We have been expecting you, my broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſaid he, to Ravenzar, but were not aware of your being attended by ſo lovely a companion, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our pleaſure.' 'This is Parcellus, replied Ravenzar, of whom you have often heard me ſpeak, your friend and mine.' 'Let me then embrace our friend, ſaid Eſdren, folding Parcellus to his boſom. You have other friends within, added he, lovely youth, who will rejoice to ſee you; and embrace you with a ſincere affection.' They then walked into the apartment, where Parcellus was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with pleaſure, and the careſſes of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious friends of Ravenzar; who were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in this paradiſe, agreeably to their yearly cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. There were the fairy Perieng, Puria the conſort of Eſdren, the fairy Leingreing, and five others from the palace of pictures, attended by their huſbands, who had been lately reſtored to them; all arrayed in robes; immortal youth and beauty blooming in their countenances! None other, than the regions of the bleſt above, could boaſt an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more illuſtrious and brilliant; of manners and intercourſe more refined; or whoſe mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments were more extatic! After they had din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they walked in parties; Parcellus with Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, and Eſdren, who undertook to ſhew him the other ſix apartments, which lay in their way, at convenient diſtances, and in the moſt delightful ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations towards each other; having cluſters of tall elms, and other beautiful trees, placed between them, ſo as to afford an agreeable ſhade to thoſe paſſing from one to another. The fourth apartment was the largeſt; having five galleries, and large cloſets,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:038495_0183_10123F9A9C577670"/>
one within another, filled with ſhelves of books of the moſt ſuperior kind. Having viſited them all, they proceeded forward through the garden, and aſcended the hills, from whence they had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſurvey of the whole garden, and its innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able beauties. They ſeated themſelves in an alcove under the ſhade of mulberry trees, and entertained themſelves a long time with the lovely enchanting proſpects. Eſdren diſplayed the brighteſt talents in converſation, greatly to the inſtruction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus, to whom his diſcourſe was chiefly directed, ſpeaking of the delightful wonders of the place—'There was a time, ſaid he, in my remembrance, (though many ages have ſince revolved) when this iſland, and moſt of the neighboring continents, were buried in the ocean. By ſlow degrees, in ſome places, and in others by ſudden convulſions, the land emerged from the waters. At that diſtant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, other countries became loſt in the ocean, as theſe revived from it.' He enlarged upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious changes he had obſerved on the face of the globe, and on the revolutions amongſt mankind: then deſcanted on the beauties of creation. He likewiſe made a variety of ſublime obſervations on the diſpenſations of Heaven towards the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent creation. Ravenzar had his ſhare in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; whilſt Parcellus was all attention to the great and wonderful things he heard. His memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ever retained the whole, and he then imagined he underſtood every thing uttered by thoſe ſages; whoſe long experience had perfected them in the knowledge of the force and meaning, both of words and things. But an hundred years after convinced Parcellus, that he had but ſuperficially and partially under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the greater part of the converſation of that memorable day, evening and enſuing morning. Being at length diſpoſed to walk further—'Come,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:038495_0184_10123F9DA27DAE70"/>
ſaid Ravenzar, I will ſhew you the baths on the other ſide the hills.' They aroſe, and, walking through a grove of fir trees, over the ſummits of the hills, deſcended to the baths, which were ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the wall of looking glaſs which there ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the garden. Three golden buildings cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the chryſtal fountains; on the hither ſides of which were rich ſoffas covered with ſilk and gold, and tables of ſolid gold, ſeparated from the fountains by partitions of glaſs, with curtains of green velvet: the roof of each building was of glaſs, and arched, like thoſe of the ſeven apartments, with the branches of tall and majeſtic elms and oaks bending over them. They were ſurrounded by a ſpacious lawn, on which were cluſters of palm trees, orange, fig, and other fruit trees. On one ſide was a grove of pines, of a young growth, which aſcended part of the hills. On the other ſide was a wide alley, bordered with flowers, and various kinds of berries of a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious taſte. This alley wound round the hills and communicated with others of the garden. 'Here; ſaid Ravenzar, after refreſhing ourſelves in one of the fountains, we will recline on ſoffas, and wait the arrival of our friends, who have already bathed and purſued another walk. The ladies will return in carriages for the purpoſes of bringing us proviſions and inſtruments of muſic: for here we ſhall ſpend the afternoon and evening.'—After they had bathed; Ravenzar opened a cloſet door; and ſhewed a ſmall library of entertaining volumes. They took each a book, and, reclining on ſoffas, amuſed themſelves an hour with reading. After which, they aroſe, and aſcended the hills, looking round for their friends, who, by this time, ſaid Eſdren, muſt be on the way hither. But not perceiving them, they ſeated themſelves in the alcove, and liſtened awhile to the charming muſic of the variety of birds. 'How
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:038495_0185_10123F9F44E933C0"/>
inceſſant, ſaid Eſdren, are the ſylvan choriſters of nature's temple, in the praiſes of the creator! how lively and animating their notes; as if they emulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the celeſtial muſicians, who ſweep their golden lyres in the heavenly temple above!—but ſee, our friends are approaching who will begin their melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious concert when the feathered ſongſters ſhall have ceaſed; not to reſume their ſprightly lays till the morning's dawn. Let us join our company on foot while the ladies proceed forward in their carriages, and make ready our evening's repaſt.' Being unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they took a different alley from that which the carriages purſued, which led them round the hills, on the right hand, through ſeveral delightful groves, and prolonged their walk till the ladies were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſet at table. Having arrived, they all ſat down to coffee, wine and cakes. All the variety of birds ſeemed to have aſſembled on the trees, in that delicious receſs below the hills, to regale them with their ſweeteſt melody! They advanced as near as poſſible to the apartment, perching on the branches that hovered over and around it; exerting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as inſpired with freſh vigor to raiſe their higheſt and moſt melodious notes, the nearer the hour of their reſt approached. The raviſhed Parcellus could not refrain from expreſſing it as his opinion, that the birds had attained a skill and vivacity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their ordinary reach. It is really ſo replied the fairy Perieng. Our preſence and the divine complacency, inſpire and exalt them; the divine complacency, which delights in rewarding our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and indefatigable labours for the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with ſuch pleaſurable retirements, as this, for our relaxation, by means of which we renew our ſtrength and vigor to purſue the works of ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evolence and love.'</p>
            <p>After their repaſt was finiſhed, ſome of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:038495_0186_10123FA1D7C9DFD0"/>
joined in a concert of vocal and inſtrumental muſic; which with agreeable intervals of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, laſted till day began to appear, and the milder ſplendors of the moon to give way to brighter glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. They returned to their partments; where the company taking leave of Ravenzar and Parcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, aſcended their ſplendid cars, and diſappeared. Parcellus lamenting their departure, expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the following extemporary diſtich, with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tears.—</p>

            <p>'Your lines, obſerved Ravenzar, are true with regard to the preſent ſtate of the world. But it is a ſtate that will ſoon be over. Then all will be like us.—Come, my Parcellus, let us return to our lovely friends at Debournon's. Do you not long to ſee them? 'Indeed I do, my kind patron, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he. Their company will reconcile me to the abſence of thoſe who have juſt left us.' 'We ſhall return in a four-wheeled carriage, reſumed Ravenzar. I have ſundry articles to convey to your manſion, to which I ſhall carry you; it being ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated but half a mile on one ſide of our road. A carriage will likewiſe follow us with two large cheſts filled, the one with gold the other with dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, for your uſe.' He then touched with his fore-finger a little golden ball, that hung by a wire to one of the pillars of the ſoffa on which they were ſitting; immediately the ſound of a large bell was heard, as at diſtance: and preſently a door opened, and two ſervants appeared. Ravenzar ordered two four wheeled carriages to be made ready, the two
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:038495_0187_10123FA38863B098"/>
cheſts to be placed in one of them, and a trunk, that he deſcribed in another. 'And, added he, let eight ſervants be ready to attend me.' The ſervants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſappeared to fulfil his orders. 'While they are obeying my orders, ſaid Ravenzar, I will ſhew you where my ſervants live. When, at any time, in future you are here, and want attendants, you have only to touch this golden ball, and a ſervant will appear, and call others if you ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them.' Saying this they deſcended a ſtair caſe, through the door by which the ſervant entered. At the bottom of the ſtair-caſe was a long gallery. They walked through it to an opening, which brought them into a ſpacious lawn, where ſtood four handſome buildings of grey marble. They entered the firſt in their way; in which were two young men and women ſitting at breakfaſt. 'We are come, ſaid Ravenzar, to breakfaſt with you this morning.' 'You greatly honor your ſervants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied one of the young men, who are always rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee our good maſter and his friends.' This he ſaid riſing and placing two chairs at the table in which Ravenzar and Parcellus ſeated themſelves; the young women preſenting them with tea, cakes and honey. Ravenzar and Parcellus converſed with them with the greateſt cheerfulneſs and familiarity. When they had all breakfaſted Ravenzar conducted his friend attended by the two young men, into the fields, cultivated by his ſervants, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and in the moſt flouriſhing condition. 'There is not now time, ſaid the Genie, to view the mines of gold, and the pits where the diamonds are gathered, and the various employments follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. But my people will ſhew you every thing at ſome other time.' A number of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of very agreeable appearances, came from the other houſes to pay their reſpects to their beloved
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:038495_0188_10123FA7567EAAC0"/>
employer, who received them with an affectionate regard; and bleſſing them, he, with Parcellus, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the two young men, haſtened back to the ſtair caſe, where the young men took their leave, and returned to their houſe. 'Some of my people, ſaid Ravenzar, at proper ſeaſons, work in my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, keeping it always in good order. But none of them are seen, at any other time, above theſe ſtairs, except when called. Their cheerful labours ſupply me with whatever I want, while here; and they are amply rewarded; living always in plenty, and happy in each other. Their fields and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are encloſed, on one ſide, by the wall of my garden; and, on the other, by the mountainous rocks which bend their craggy ſummits over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean. Here is the broadeſt extenſion of theſe rocks, which run further, by a mile, into the iſland, than in any other part of it.'</p>
            <p>The two carriages and the ſervants being ready, they entered them and ſat forward for the aperture; four of the ſervants attending on horſeback When arrived to the Aperture, the Genie pronounced ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral words, and the clouds retreated on one ſide to make way for the carriages and horſemen. As ſoon as all were paſſed through, the cloud reſumed its ſtation. As they purſued their way, Ravenzar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Parcellus with a medal.—'On this medal, ſaid he, are engraved the words which I uſed for the removing the cloud. You will therefore be ſure to have it with you, my friend, whenever you ſhall deſign entering my apartments. But, ſee, before us, your buildings. They ſtand in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of two hundred acres. We will, now, but juſt look at them, depoſit the cheſt and trunk, and give orders to the eight ſervants, henceforwards yours, and then haſten on to our dear friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:038495_0189_10123FA8F6A019B0"/>
Having viewed the buildings and gardens, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited the trunk and cheſsts, they expedited their courſe to Debournon's.</p>
            <p>On the evening following the marriages were ſolemnized in the preſence of great numbers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating friends. They were the next evening, to meet in Nytan's palace.</p>
            <p>It was a moſt agreeable entertainment to thoſe illuſtrious friends on the intervening day, to read a paper publiſhed by Philenor, and diſperſed in his native country, and the neighbouring kingdoms, and to learn the recent events conſequent upon it, which, at once ſhew in a ſtriking light the depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of human nature; and how ineffectual, and to themſelves fatal, is the rage and vengeance of the ſons of pride againſt the children of virtue under the immediate protection and guardianſhip of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The paper was entitled The Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, of which the following is a part.—</p>
            <p>'By that wiſdom which never errs is it decreed, that every atom of the creation, and every intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as well as ſenſitive exiſtence, performs their deſtined rounds. To conſummate the plan of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal love a day—a glorious deciſive day is fixed;—a day, to which every revolution and every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation invariably tend;—when the ſtupendous plan of Deity ſhall open to the view of admiring and applauding worlds! All events, through all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, have reſpect only to this illuſtrious, this faſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching day. In the preſent Criſis which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts univerſal attention among the nations, happy are thoſe who with inceſſant benevolent exertions, coincide with the deſigns of heaven, wholly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of every ſordid view and immoveably attentive to the univerſal good!</p>
            <p>How little doth it appear to be realized, that ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing miſuſed or mis-ſpent muſt be accounted
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:038495_0190_10123FAB52E6A750"/>
for;—that the conſequences of the abuſes of nature are terrible. We have learned from every age (as far as hiſtory inſtructs) the awful effects of living without that attachment to the Supreme, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone inſures human felicity. Why are we no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter improved by experience of paſt times and our own? Is it that the moſt dreadful deſtruction is to reprove the abſurdity and perverſeneſs of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, the madneſs of our conduct?</p>
            <p>The Deity is infinitely good and kind, as infin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itely perfect and glorious. To reſemble him is man's happineſs, his honor, his greatneſs. Alas! we are poor realiſers of the ineſtimable bleſſings of exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and celeſtial liberality. We are ſhamefully unmindful of him who taught our ſouls to think! No wonder therefore we are miſerable; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we are ſo diſappointed, embarraſſed, blaſted in our projects and purſuits. In vain do we look for tranquility and bliſs, whilſt we reſpect not, love not the author of our being. What then is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of which we make ſuch a parade? What the worſhip we offer to Heaven? How much more like true worſhippers would your religious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies appear, did they meet, both rich and poor, on the appointed days, like affectionate brethren; in the genuine ſpirit of love, relieving every want, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging each other in true virtue and real good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the ſweetly perſuaſive eloquence of the heart? then would they unqueſtionably chant forth the ſongs of acceptable praiſe, and the air would reſound with truly ſacred melody. Then would they utter a thouſand charming things, ſuch as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels might with delight and admiration liſten to hear. New ſcenes of pleaſure would open, as yet to them unknown. Then would they diſcern, that in each other, which the Deity beholds as infin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itely attractive—beauty and charms that never
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:038495_0191_10123FADD5AB4978"/>
cloy or fade. Such is the only worſhip by Heaven approved. Away then—forever away with that deteſtable kind by which divinity and humanity are inſulted.—* * *</p>
            <p>* * *—O ye rulers!—Ye rich and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential! Is it not high time ye learned wherein true grandeur conſiſts? How far are ye from entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt ideas of living—of pleaſure—policy—oecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy—of virtue—of humanity—of true glory! oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe, would ye reſt day or night, till by the ſpirit of the Eternal, ye became well inſtructed to bleſs mankind? Haſten then, ye great, ye leading men of the nations!—Seek him with affiance by whom alone ye live! cry mightily, and take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial!—be bleſt and bleſs mankind! realiſe how highly ye are accountable—'</p>
            <p>But this is but a ſlender part of that intereſting and alarming paper. The enraged powers ſent out vaſt fleets to deſtroy Ravenzar. They could never find it. A dreadful ſtorm diſperſed them. They all miſerably periſhed. Such is the inevitable doom of the implacable enemies of God and man! The grand the benevolent purpoſes of the ſovereign of worlds can never be fruſtrated.</p>

            <p>EARLY in the evening the company were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Prince Nytan's hall. It is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to imagine than deſcribe the refined ſocial plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of thoſe illuſtrious friends, who with heaven's propitious ſmiles, had attained to the accompliſhment of their utmoſt wiſhes. Selina made a number of rich preſents to the newly married ladies, moſt el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egantly adapted to the friendſhip and the liberality of her heart. Several weeks they paſſed together in a round of convivial pleaſures in the palace and in the city. But the Prince was now ſuddenly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away to the continent of Africa In the height of ſweeteſt ſocial bliſs, the deareſt friends muſt part, and cheerfully ſubmiſſive, yield to Heaven's great beheſts. A courier, ſwift as the wind, had brought intelligence of an alarming nature.—'I am inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leave you my happy friends!—It is your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and mine that ſummons me hence; ſince we
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:038495_0193_101224D498152D28"/>
are alike deeply intereſted in the felicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and, under the direction of the ſovereign parent, inceſſantly employed in promoting its weal, in preventing or mitigating its woe. Dire miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief lours tremendous where we have been long labouring to inſure mild virtue's tranquil reign! In ſilence, with pity's ſofteſt eye, you urge me to be gone; nor reluctant do I obey.'—It was thus Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan bid his gueſts adieu. He reſted on the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſhore in Zanger's favored realm, and on the ſpot where his royal friend had erected, in honor to his memory, a magnificent dome, and where, at the inſtant of his arrival, he reſided. Enraptured he embraced his moſt beloved of friends.</p>
            <p>After mutual careſſes, Zanger haſtily informed his friend of what he already knew too well; that Mingeng, (the King whoſe hiſtory a preceeding page has introduced) was depoſed and baniſhed his kingdom, now diſtracted and torn by party rage, and in danger of ſoon becoming a prey to ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing barbarous nations.</p>
            <p>'Hinder me not a moment cried Nytan, I muſt inſtantly be gone. On my return I am to take you, my dear Zanger, to our happy iſle, where my friends long to embrace you.'—He was ſoon in the midſt of the divided people. Seaſonable was his preſence, and happy in its conſequences was his benevolent interpoſition. The leading men of each party he highly blamed, accuſing them roundly of ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſingenuous conduct towards each other, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily hath in civil diſſentions, been too often the caſe). All were highly incenſed againſt him, and began to threaten his life. But they were ignorant of his worth, his abilities and powerful reſources—in peace or war—in the cabinet or in the field; and how eaſily he could fruſtrate their nefarious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. At the moſt intereſting criſis he appeared in
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:038495_0194_10123FB53AFC76C0"/>
their aſſembly, and having ſolicited attention, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the following memorable oration, with that pathetic all-commanding eloquence ſo peculiar to himſelf.</p>
            <p>'Reſpected citizens, the freedom of my interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, I perceive, hath excited againſt me your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. Yet ſuffer me once more to addreſs you, before I bid you adieu. Alas! what are men, when hurried and agitated by impetuous paſſions. You are dear to me as my own exiſtence; ſince we all are the indulged children of one common parent, that glorious being from whom originates every thing great, every thing good, every thing amiable and lovely. We muſt reſemble our kind beneficents Creator, to be happy, to be honorable. Our devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from rectitude is certain incalculable miſery and diſgrace. But let us no longer deceive our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor forget we are accountable for our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Alas! it is high time the nations were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awakened to ſentiments more becoming the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their nature as the offspring of Heaven! How inconſiſtent hath our tempers and conduct been towards each other?—Inconſiſtent with what we would be, and with what we are ſo ready to flatter ourſelves we are! men of virtue and honor, great and good! We differ in our political views; and we are ever irritating each other by inſulting language. From the public advertiſers how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully is it evidenced. I have ſeen your reſentments and your perſonal altercations! In ſecret I wept—my heart bled for my brethren!</p>
            <p>By what motives are we actuated in our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal exertions? We, who profeſs to glory in virtue, generoſity, courage, magnanimity;—in being pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, philanthropiſts? Of what ſpecies is our future public and private felicity to conſiſt? You have peruſed hiſtories, and have learned the follies of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding

times.—Are we never to be really wiſe and good; to riſe ſuperior to the degrading ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of falſe ambition, or ſenſuality? And are we created only to wrangle and fight, afflict and devour each other? Wherefore do we pretend to poſſeſs the noble-exalted rational powers, while we thus act like irrationals?—If we poſſeſs a courage and fortitude to riſk our health, our limbs and lives in hoſtile conflicts; to endure every thing in arduous, hazardous enterprizes;—Why have we not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to arreſt the fatal deranging progreſs of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly ſelfiſhneſs? The man uninfluenced by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, undiſſembled philanthropy, (which indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts not but with every virtue) however he may plume himſelf, and figure in the world, is but a cowardly puſillanimous wretch: and, ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the preſence of ſuperior beings, he muſt be covered with ſhame. Nothing can be more true, or more worthy of ſolemn thought.—What <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

What, my breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, have we been purſuing! Alas! it is true that we have been purſuing only our ſhame!—Can there be any thing more contemptible in the eyes of the glorious and beneficent beings who encompaſs the eternal throne, than thoſe ſelfiſh minds that prefer their own gratifications to the good of thouſands, whom they might greatly ſerve by their affectionate attentions, and reform by their precepts and engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examples? But we, by our temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and ſordid private views, are blaſting every benevolent purpoſe of the generous heart. What a diſgraceful circumſtance is it—how baſe and pregnant with the moſt terrific ruin—that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine gifts of ſpeech and language are proſtituted to the cruel murderous purpoſes of ſlander and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation!

—Unhappy beings!—that would oppreſs and deſtroy thoſe we ought to embrace and cheriſh! and this, is it for power, or wealth, that we would triumph in the miſery of our brethren—in our ſhame?</p>
            <p>But how, ſay you, ſhall we induce each other to think alike, (who entertain ſuch oppoſite ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and annihilate party ſpirit?</p>
            <p>Let us ponder well the dire reſult of our preſent conduct. Let us with ſolemnity apply to the ſource of wiſdom. To its guidance we muſt yield, or be inevitably undone: to exiſt without it is dreadful; there are deepeſt horrors in the idea!</p>
            <p>O my friends! let us ponder well at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous criſis! let us be awakened to ſalutary healing truth before it be too late; nor plunge madly into diſtreſſing deſolations beyond concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the moſt terrible! let us henceforth, then, unite in cheriſhing the ſacred gentle ſpirit of love. Let us determine to act diſintereſtedly;—to conduct as in the preſence of innumerable glorious pure and happy intelligences, who ever lean on om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence; and as in his preſence. Whoſe all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading eye ſearches into the moſt ſecret receſſes of every heart. Let us for ever baniſh, (from this moment) pride and vain glory, and little-ſordid ſelf with all the cowardly fears that always attend it. Let us have done with every ſpecies of vice and intemperance. True temperance will be attended with every virtue—every attractive grace. Few indeed can be fairly allowed to poſſeſs ſo ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a gift of Heaven. Ignorant of its excellencies, men have not deſired it;—they have not therefore aſked it. For the ſincere requeſt would never have been denied by the ſource of tenderneſs and love. A juſt temperance would render us tranquil, ſerene and happy. It would meliorate our hearts.

it our grandeur and fame are contemptible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unworthy the acquiſition of rationals—im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortals—who ſeek the glory founded only on gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine heaven-born virtue. It would regenerate us, and render us divine. Yet every ſenſe would be regaled with the variety of delicacies which liberal nature yields. But without a genuine temperance we can enjoy nothing. Poſſeſſing it, we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all things. Freed from the ſolicitations of falſe appetites, and racking deſires, and of conſequence, from expences that oppreſſion only can ſupport; we ſhall really poſſeſs more to enjoy, as we ſhall have more to give;—like the giver of all, exiſting to relieve the helpleſs, and communicate happineſs. We ſhould then taſte the bliſs, we ſhould prove the enrapturing felicities of wiſdom and philanthropy, divine, and no longer labour and rage to oppreſs and deſtroy each other. Innumerable pleaſures, in endleſs bliſsful ſeries, would then be ours.—Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens with a true magnanimity, let us ſurmount ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery oppoſing paſſion, and become the nation ſo rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed! But the reputed temperance is below the grade to which I would have you ſoar. The truly temperate enjoy perpetual health, have the due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the paſſions; and practice, with ſublimeſt pleaſure every virtue. E'er long ſome of you ſhall behold the divine and ſalutary effects of genuine temperance in the country where I dwell:—O' cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens! I know not how to part with you till I have effectually convinced you wherein true glory and permanent happineſs conſiſt! Alas! we have widely erred! We have been unhappily miſtaken!—but I perceive many of you are affected. Give me leave to point out our future courſe.

But we ſhall now renounce them, and become hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the embraces of celeſtial virtue!</p>
            <p>O citizens! what do we not owe to our benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent creator, who hath formed ſo glorious a world for our reſidence; who hath laid himſelf out for our felicity? what do we not owe to the bright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences of the heavenly worlds—to ourſelves—to all mankind—to the whole creation! let us dwell on the momentous thought! let us aſpire to attain all that will in future be valuable, and which we ſhall rejoice that we have purſued after millions of ages have revolved! We cannot endure the idea of being deſpiſed in the future world; let us conduct conſcientiouſly and honorably in this; ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the Omniſcient and Omnipreſent diſcerns every ſecret motive of the human heart; and that he can delight only in that real goodneſs which cheerfully denies itſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the peace and happineſs of all.'</p>
            <p>The eloquent and perſuaſive orator ceaſed. The audience was deeply affected. A new light ſprang up in each mind. Numbers convinced, (and now angry only with themſelves) immediately retired from public buſineſs. They retired to reflect, and reform. The ſacred influence ſpread. The flame of celeſtial love was enkindled. And thouſands of brighteſt genius' ſoon became gloriouſly active nobleſt deeds of fame which Heaven itſelf records. They were kindeſt deeds of benevolence and ſelf-denial, wiſely adapted to render every individual vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

and happy. What wonders the moving elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the heart and tongue accompliſh when employed on a ſubject like this! The baniſhed and depoſed king was immediately recalled and reinſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nytan ſwayed every mind. It was influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he merited there to hold. And, though himſelf united to a Republic (great indeed) in ſtrongeſt bands of love, he attempted not innovations. The monarchy was rendered there propitious and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, becauſe the people became the children and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of undiſſembled virtue. To leave his new converts in the purſuit of virtue, wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was his aim: and, happy conſequent events in that kingdom a future page may unfold. At preſent, the narrator hath arrived to the utmoſt lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of his intelligence. The ſucceſsful philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, after three days, took leave of Mingen and his grateful applauding ſubjects, and repaired to the centre of a vaſt wilderneſs of Africa, in which, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed by impaſſible rocks and impervious woods, the ſplendors of Ravenzars palace glittered to the ſun. Prince Nytan now for the firſt time beheld it, being previouſly informed of its ſituation by that illuſtrious friend. There, ſecluded from the world, a large ſociety, conſiſting of both ſexes, were train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, by Ravenzar, for the republic. Ravenzar was preſent to receive the friend of his heart. Sev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral days they converſed together on ſubjects of higheſt import. After which, and having been moſt agreeably entertained by the ſociety, they took leave of each other, and Nytan haſtened to king Zanger, who feaſted him two days with truly royal magnificence, all the principal men and women of the court being preſent. Yet was it a feaſt where true temperance preſided, however unuſual at the tables of the great; and from which every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned happy, rational and divine.</p>

On the morning the king took leave of the court, and with Nytan, followed by the bleſſings of the people, bid a long farewell to the continent of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>'How bleſt exclaimed Zanger (as they gently prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed through the air) are thoſe who render the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of art and ſcience conducive to human felicity. What advantages have we in Africa thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And what an acceſſion of happineſs is thence derived to two powerful nations!' 'It is indeed glorious for us, replied his friend, that the divine gifts have enriched us with the power and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to ſerve each other. Ever new and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapturing are the ſenſations of the benevolent mind. Divine love inſpires its poſſeſſors with all that is great and good: it views every object in its its true light; and conſtantly realiſes the delightful truth that the creator beholds, in the children of humanity, forms infinitely lovely and engaging; and, by his wonder-working power, moulds and refines them to perfect purity and innocence; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning them in his own comelineſs, and rendering them for ever lovely to each other. Such a view animates us to every poſſible exertion in ſerving each other: and we contemplate, with horror and diſdain, thoſe ſenſual indulgencies which effemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the mind, and cauſe it cowardly to ſhrink from philanthropy's glorious, unparalleled career. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties ſerve but to invigorate our reſolution, and ſtrengthen our confidence in the Supreme. What rich bleſſings grow upon mankind from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied deeds of benevolence! their increaſing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects both on the receiver and the beſtower, may be compared to thoſe prolific germs, which from the ſlendereſt ſize advance in growth till they become the moſt beautiful and the moſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

of trees. But here the compariſon fails. Thoſe trees, however ornamental and uſeful, muſt decay and die: but the works of benevolence undecaying flouriſh; and are the permanent ſources of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the moſt refined. The delightful ſenſations, ariſing from the works of charity, are indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. From the ſource of love and kindneſs they originate; and, like every thing divine, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exiſt, and forever beatify the beings in whoſe breaſts they are naturaliſed! How glorious is it, my friend, to be employed in the important work, however arduous, of correcting the errors of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, of awakening their attention to virtue, of promoting univerſal peace and harmony! though it be indeed the moſt difficult of all works. How long are men gaining juſt ideas of virtue and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs! ideas ſufficiently powerful to rouze all the energies of their minds to action! What difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ariſe from paſſions and the ignorance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of men! but the more difficult the work, the more glorious will it appear in its final accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment by the great, the wonder-working pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, with whom we co-operate. Its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea, impoſſibility, with us alone, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs impeding cauſes of genuine reform, lead us to reflect how conſummate muſt be the bliſs when it is univerſally effected.</p>
            <p>'Our growing numbers are indeed a ſacred pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful confederacy of illuſtrious perſonages under a divine influence, againſt every ſpecies of vice and oppreſſion; aconfederacy not only for our own feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but for the promotion of real virtue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for the relief of the wretched, the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and the oppreſſed, in every region.

Every individual of our nation is well known to the adminiſtrators of the government, is induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, virtuous and happy.

A long liſt I might produce of female worthies, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent precepts and examples are eagerly followed by every one of that amiable and reſpectable ſex. The Philanthropic ſon of Renien was upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorite topics.

He ſeemed to riſe ſuperior to humanity; and Angels might well liſten to the ſweet accents of his tongue, whilſt he dwelt on the wonders of his happy iſle, the virtues; the felicities of his citizen-friends. He eulogiſed thoſe who indeed merited the higheſt praiſe. 'Such concluded he, are the inhabitants of this favored iſle, and ſuch are the exalted ſentiments by which they are inſpired and ſo fervent is the ardor of their philanthropy, that all the energies of their minds are exerted to the utmoſt, without ceſſation or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, in the ſervice of their beloved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected brethren of mankind of every country and nation; wherever diſperſed or however deranged; and with the moſt cheerful and unreſerved filial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

By Heaven's direction and aid I gave them exiſtence as a nation; then leaving them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to adopt the form of government that beſt pleaſed them, they choſe ſuch an one as they conceived moſt ſuitable to their circumſtances. The Lord of Nature is indeed their ſovereign, and they are ſubjects of his peculiar care. Though I am heir to the empire of China; and though my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would place me in the throne, I have prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being a citizen amongſt this illuſtrious people whoſe felicity is ſo perfect.

            <p>ZANGER, having by the aid of Pharenon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the European languages, had made the grand tour. In which he ſaw indeed, much to admire, but more to lament. Nothing excited in him more of ſurpriſe and reſentment than thoſe principles, and that conduct, which tended to eraſe the belief of the ſouls immortality, and of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's kind attentions to the works of his own hands; thoſe tenets which are eſtabliſhed indeed, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, in the heart of every citizen of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzar. 'One would think ſaid he, it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that men of ſenſe and learning could enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the idea, that beings capable of ſuch ennobling energies; refined ſentiments and endearing affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as are evidently the human ſpecies, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the enjoyment only of a temporary exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and then utterly to periſh, to be forever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged from the creation. No wonder, continued Zanger, men of ſuch ſentiment are among the chief oppreſſors of mankind, the perpetual plagues of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.' He became however, acquainted with a
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:038495_0206_10123FD00BD7B530"/>
few of thoſe: who were worthy of his eſteem and affectionate attention. Yet no ſociety of men in the world appeared to him comparable to this, in which, through the friendſhip of Prince Nytan, he was now initiated. And he could not refrain from renewed expreſſions of the high admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and exquiſite pleaſure with which he was affected, as they walked on to the pavilions of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingreing, their common benefactreſs, 'O my friend, cried he, with what raviſhing pleaſureable ſenſations am I overwhelmed, in beholding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled charms of your country! wherever I walk, here, I meet only endearing countenances, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kindeſt greetings; and am received with the moſt hoſpitable, the moſt cordial entertainment in every dwelling I enter. Here all is perfect love and ſweetneſs! and the women—never did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold more lovely! They are rather celeſtials, who have condeſcended to dwell on the earth to conſole, to harmoniſe, to beatify mankind! What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would a party of theſe angels effect, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions which gave me birth! their divine allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would be irreſiſtible—the tout-enſemble of their matchleſs perſonal and mental charms—their ſuperior knowledge, their perſuaſive eloquence, their unparalleled modeſty, engaging manners and virtuous examples!—It muſt be ſo, my dear Prince—our fleet muſt bear away a few of theſe invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commodities; ſince you have already told me, it is in contemplation in your aſſembly to ſettle ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral families abroad, at different future periods, for the moſt benevolent purpoſes.'</p>
            <p>'And would it not, think you, replied Prince Nytan, be very hard parting with citizens, with friends ſo dear?' 'The love of true glory, replied the king, removes every difficulty. Neither, my friend, would it be ſo very hard parting, ſince all
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:038495_0207_10123FD28FC65C50"/>
would often meet again, notwithſtanding the great diſtance of the countries from each other. Beſides, we are to reckon the peculiar pleaſures of epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary correſpondence.' 'You argue eloquently, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the philanthropic friend, and, I believe, when you make your benevolent and patriotic claim, it cannot fail of being approved and ſanctioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſſenting voice. Our females will indeed be excellent inſtructreſſes and guards to youthful age againſt the errors to which they are liable. They will ſeaſonably relieve them from the often fatal effects of thoſe sſudden and unlooked-for incidents and aſſaults on their minds, which have deranged youth, who have, with determined ſteps, ſat out in the career of virtue, and have not been ſufficiently watched againſt by either parents, inſtructors, or guardians, in the countries, where I have viſited.</p>
            <p>Zanger was about to introduce the former ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of diſcourſe when Nytan placed in his hands an epiſtle wrote by Amelia, to a young female whom ſhe had educated, and who reſided with Randor in her former manſion. 'This epiſtle, ſaid the Prince, is a valuable ſpecimen of the ideas with which our women inſpire their children. Amelia is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent tutoreſs. But we have many ſuch in our country. Heaven is peculiarly intereſted in the education of our children, and hath bleſſed them with wiſe, faithful and indefatigable inſtructors and inſtructreſſes.

Nor does ſhe leave us ignorant, that the genuine, ruling motive for acquiring every mental charm, muſt be indiſputably, the lively conſciouſneſs of its being pleaſing to the infinitely lovely and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent author of our exiſtence; who, as he is the ſource of every perfection, (himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the perfection of beauty and lovelineſs) infinitely and immutably great and glorious, good and kind; it becomes his grateful daughters whom he hath bleſſed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel forms, to love him ſupremely; to aſpire, with the moſt fervent ardor, to pleaſe him who firſt and beſt deſerves to be pleaſed.

Thus, my Chloris, to live is to live to God, to the happy country we are deſtined to adorn, and to the world; and juſtly to merit that diſtinguiſhing and inchanting appellation—The fair part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to be hourly improving in mental beauty and luſtre; to ſhine with a ſtill brighter and more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant effulgence, till the illuſtrious day of Heaven unfolds to our enraptured ſight!

The pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions were ever open to all the citizens, and were moſt agreeable reſting places; affording every kind of refreſhment after walking in the adjoining groves and gardens, or along the banks of the river, or after excurſions in pleaſure-boats elegantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and always ready for every one's uſe.
