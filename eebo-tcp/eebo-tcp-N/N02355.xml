            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And further, as my Friend told me, he Claimed by the ſaid <hi>Manifeſto</hi> an Indefeazible Right to be <hi>Hereditary</hi> keeper of the Seal of this Government, and treated a worthy honeſt Gentleman, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Governour, with moſt <hi>Scurrilous Language,</hi> becauſe he would not deliver up the Seal into his hands, and go Blindfold into whatſoever he Propoſed. who can Imagine then, but as you ſay, Maſter, The honeſt well meaning People muſt think ſuch an Extravagant Fellow to be horn-mad; for my part I never heard of the like, except at <hi>Bedlam Hoſpital</hi> many Years ago, where <hi>Oliver's Porter</hi> uſed to Rant upon Kings and Government.</p>

                  <p>That is all true, Maſter; but if I be rightly informed, this ſame Government here is not an Office of that Nature which you ſpeak of, being the Nomination of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is in the hands of a Subject, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits or Sallary entirely depends upon the People themſelves, from year to year, according to his Behaviour; ſo that what can a Courtier get by putting any Creature into this Office, who will not do their Duty to the Peoples Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as, undoubtedly, he ought to do.</p>

                  <p>Why truly. <hi>Roger,</hi> I muſt own I did not know ſo much of this Conſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you now tell me; and I think it very happy for the People, if it be ſo, becauſe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperably unites the Intereſt of every Governor unto that of the Country, as in all free States it truly ought to be; however, ſuch is the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude of human Affairs, and the force of Ambition, or ſomething elſe, that men are

                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, but <hi>Maſter,</hi> Let us ſuppoſe then, that one of thoſe ſame Tools you mention was to come over Governour here, in the room of a Gentleman who is generally beloved, and to whom even his Enemies, for what I hear, can aſſign no Fault which they dare own to his Conduct, what would be the Conſequence, do you think?</p>

                  <speaker>Obſerv.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, if the Conſtitution really is ſuch as you have told me, the Conſequence, in all Probability, would be, that in a Short time the Tool, as you call him, would find himſelf under ſome Neceſſity of Returning Home as great a Fool as he came out; and let High-flyers talk as they pleaſe, it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth, That there can be no better Teſt of a good King or a good Governour, than to poſſeſs the Hearts and Affections of the People they Rule over; for that can proceed only from a natural and grateful Senſe of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which from his Impartial Conduct has been equally ſhared amongſt them. And you may depend upon it, <hi>Roger,</hi> that all Men of any Senſe &amp; Knowledge, who Deſpiſe or Ridicule
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002794_0015_0FE63A6A2AD2BCF0"/>
this very plain Maxim, let them pretend <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Religion,</hi> or what elſe they pleaſe, to gull and cheat the Ignorant and Weaker ſort of People, it is only a Mask to cover ſome ſecret Vice, or to introduce one or more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Favourites, who cannot be ſupported but by an Arbitrary and Partial Power in the Government.</p>

                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Maſter, you know it was always my Mind that Kings and Rulers were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the good of the People; and can any Man tell me who is or can be a better Judge of the Peoples good, than they are themſelves? As for your Learned Schollards, tho' perhaps they will not allow Us poor Country Folks to put Our Thinking Faculty in the Ballance with theirs, on many Subjects, which, in truth, We do not pretend to, yet ſurely they muſt own, We are made of the ſame Fleſh and Bones, and after the ſame manner with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to that our Senſe and Feeling of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Miſery, Juſtice and Injuſtice, good Fortune and ill Fortune, are much the ſame in Us all. And I appeal to you, Maſter, if a quiet Enjoyment of, and an equal Support under theſe oppoſite States in Life, reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be not the chief End, if not the whole Buſineſs of all Civil Government?</p>

be more fairly ſtated, or a better Judgment given upon it, than what you have done in a very few Words; Wherefore, I think, at preſent, we will leave that Subject as it ſtands, and after a good nights Reſt, think of ſome New Entertainment for to Morrow.</p>

But to proceed, from hence I went in courſe to wait upon the next Greateſt Man of the place, Unto whom, I know, that I was very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and warmly Recommended by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Perſons of ſome Figure and great Subſtance in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and being Charged to deliver them with my own hand, I deſired the ſervant Maid to acquaint her <hi>Maſter,</hi> that a Gentleman come over from <hi>London,</hi> in the laſt Ship, waited to ſpeak with him, and had ſome Letters for him; but the Maid was imploy'd in celaning the Parlour, and very briskly replyed, That it was not yet the hour of her Maſters coming down from his Study, and that if I wanted to ſpeak with him, I might wait in the Porch until he came down; I ſaid, I would, and ſo ſate down upon the Bench at the Door, pleaſing my ſelf with Obſerving the Air and Dreſs of the People, as they went along. When I had waited about an hour, a Poor Shabby-like fellow called to ſpeak with the Gentleman of the houſe, but the Maid in a rude Tone bid him be gone, for a ſorry follow,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002794_0020_0FE5F576F850B3C8"/>
as he was, did let think that her Maſter muſt be diſturbed at this time of Day for ſuch a one as him: The Country Man being thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, made a good dear of Noiſe in the ſtreet, and Complain'd much of the Injuſtice and Hardſhip that in many particulars had been put upon him. This diſturbance, however, brought the Gentleman down from his ſtudy, in his Diſabila, being wrap'd in an old ruſty dark colour'd Calaminco Night-Gown, which forced my Imagination to repreſent to my thoughts One of our <hi>London</hi> Conjurers or Fortune-Tellers, only he did not carry ſo much Temper and Gravity about him, as they uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do; for he immediately fell open Mouth'd upon the Poor Fellow in the ſtreet, and bid him inſtantly be gone, or he would ſend him to the Correction-houſe to beat Hemp, until he ſhould learn more Manners; at which the Country-man ſcratch'd his Head, and walk'd off. Then the Senator turning himſelf very Solemnly about towards me, ſaid, <hi>Friend, haſt thee any buſineſs with me this Morning</hi>? Very little, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid I, only a few Letters here from <hi>London,</hi> which I was Charged to deliver with my own hand. He took the Letters, told me, it was very well, and ſo walk'd up Stairs to his ſtudy again, without ſaying One word more or leſs. Now, <hi>Roger,</hi> What do you think of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment from One, who, I do aſſure you, amongſt ſome of the beſt People in the City of

                  <p>With all my heart, Maſter, I approve your Counſel, which, tho' I ſay it, is as good Doctrine as ever was preach'd out of a Pulpit. But, now I think on't, Maſter, and to divert us from dull and melancholly Reflections, I met with a Skipper this Morning upon the Wharff, Tearing, and Runing about like a Mad-man, becauſe the C—or had ſeized his Sloop for the Value of half a piece of courſe Holland that was found in one of the Mens Cheſts, which the poor Devil had brought home to make his Wife ſome Aprons. The Mob gathering about the Man, they hearken'd attentively to his ſtory, and at laſt their Spleen got vent, by ripping up the C—r's Character, at ſuch a Rate, you'd have been amaz'd to hear it; for there was ſo many particular down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Villanies, with the Times, Places and Circumſtances mentioned, that one could not

That is not what I mean, it is that ſame Vaſſalage or Slavery that ſticks in my Gizzard; for my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord aſſures me, that a great and a Wiſe Man, not far from this Town, has been Plodding above theſe three years upon a Scheme to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the <hi>Old Engliſh Vaſſalage,</hi> you was ſpeaking of, into this New Country, which he Affirms, cannot thrive until that be done; and, for my part, I had as lief be a Slave in <hi>Algiers,</hi> as to ſubmit to ſuch a form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>That would be hard indeed, <hi>Roger,</hi> if it was ſo; yet ſurely None but a Mad-Man, or a Vagabond, would dare to broach ſuch a thought in a free Country; beſides, the thing it ſelf is ſuch a Contradiction to Law, Nature and Common Senſe, that it is altogether Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, and the very Propoſal a meer Jeſt.</p>

                  <p>Why ſo I ſaid, Maſter, but my Landlord, who is a very honeſt Civil Man, aſſured me, that he heard the Gentleman ſpeak of it himſelf, and he talk'd ſo big as if he was ſure to bring it about ſpeedily; for, they ſay, he is a very Rich Cunning Man, and ſees a great way off, ſo that he ſeldom or never

                  <p>Very true, Maſter, it is to be hoped that ſuch a mad Attempt will Probably termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the Overthrow of the Contrivers; but in the the mean time, both publick and private Intereſt muſt ſuffer conſiderably, while ſuch miſchievous Deſigns are hatcht and flyly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie'd On by Men of any Credit; wherefore, methinks, it is pitty but ſuch Helliſh Schemes ſhould be expoſed as ſoon as they can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and intirely blown Up.</p>

                  <p>What's the matter, <hi>Roger?</hi> I am ſorry to hear that poor <hi>Humphry</hi> ſhould meet with any Diſcouragement; I thought he had got his Ax on his ſhoulder and been at work in the Woods; for I know he's a ſober Lad, and eats no idle Bread.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Why truly, ſo he is, <hi>Maſter,</hi> and I thought I had done very well for him, upon our arrival, the very firſt week
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002794_0038_0FE63A7EF0E96490"/>
here, when I Purchaſed three Hundred Acres of good Rich Land, from an honeſt Country-man in <hi>Bucks County,</hi> about Twenty Miles from Town; I am ſure it coſt me Fifty good Guineas in Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides two to the Scrivener for drawing the Deeds, and a good Supper at the cloſe of the Bargain; and yet, for all, we are like to be Trick'd out of it, for what I can ſee, by an Old half hanged ill looking Dog, who keeps the Books of what they call a Land-Office in thir Town. Now, <hi>Maſter,</hi> you know, in <hi>England</hi> every Free-holder keeps his Writings or Deeds for his Land himſelf, in a good Iron Box or ſtrong Cheſt; but this Gallimafry will have it, that our Deeds are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becauſe the Return of the Survey was not in due time (as he ſays) Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Office upon the Books; and the Old Rogue pretends it is too late now, becauſe, forſooth, (the Land being very good) he has taken care to have it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurveyed, and a Return duly entred upon his Books, in another Mans Name. And now, <hi>Maſter,</hi> is not this, do you think, a very hand Caſe upon the poor Boy
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002794_0039_0FE63A7EF518F8C8"/>
                     <hi>Humphry,</hi> who has almoſt Cry'd his very Eyes out of his Head about it.</p>

                  <p>It ſeems to me to be a very hard Caſe indeed, <hi>Roger,</hi> and according to my ſlight Notions of ſuch Things, I cannot ſee how the ſuperficial Neglect of a Surveyor for not Returning the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Duty into a certain Office, at a certain time, ſhould invalidate a Prior and give a legal Preference to a Poſterior Right to Lands, which in <hi>England</hi> we hold to be the moſt Sacred and Valuable of all Property whatſoever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, Maſter, in <hi>England,</hi> you ſay Right, no ſuch thing could be ſuffer'd or born with; for it is to be ſeen very lately, how our juſt and good Parliament at Home can Trounce even a Lord High Chancellor for Defrauding the Subject, and Invading their Rights. But, Alas! <hi>Maſter,</hi> if I be rightly informed, it is not ſo here, where we are told, the Soil originally belongs to a Proprietary, and this ſame Proprietary keeps an Agent or Secretary, as ſome call him, to Sell theſe Lands for ready Money; and this
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002794_0040_0FE63A46CB7F40A8"/>
ſame Secretary keeps Two Under-ſtrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers at one Table in his Office, the one to make out and Return Surveys, while the other is ſtriking or Recording of Patents, or Original Deeds, all which you may ſee them Toſs from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if they were ſhuffling a Pack of Cards at Put; ſo that an honeſt Country-Man has but a poor Chance for his Money amongſt ſuch a parcel of Rooks, who are Abſolute in their Mannagement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of Check or Controul.</p>

                  <p>Thou giveſt a very odd Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Land-Office, <hi>Roger;</hi> ſurely the Proprietor muſt have a careful Audit upon theſe Officers Accounts, if he puts any Value upon his Property here.</p>

                  <p>Why, <hi>Maſter,</hi> the Proprietor, they ſay, is a very Worthy Honeſt young Gentleman, of Spirit enough, but having a good Eſtate at home, he likes <hi>Old England,</hi> and does not much Trouble himſelf about the ſtate of his Private Affairs here, which this ſame Cuning Agent has Artfully involved, by raiſing

a Claim upon it from ſome younger Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Family, who are at Law with the Heir, which is a fair opportunity for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Folks to make ſomething, not as the Old Saying is, <hi>While the Sun shines,</hi> but rather <hi>While he is under a Cloud.</hi>

                  <p>Lord, <hi>Maſter!</hi> is it a plain Caſe, if they can once get in to be Proprietors of the Lands, they will ſoon be the Law-Makers themſelves; for you muſt know, that the Aſſembly or Legiſlature here, is chiefly compoſed of a Landed Intereſt, as indeed it is with Us in the Houſe of Commons in <hi>England;</hi> but God be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our Rights are better ſecured There; and until ſomething be done to render Property more certain Here, I cannot but pity the poor People whoſe Children, in all Probability muſt depend on this
