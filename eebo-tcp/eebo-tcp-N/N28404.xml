            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>How happy, but how fleeting is that time of life, when one is unacquainted with ambition, which ſacrifices every thing to the deſire of fortune and the glory that follows in her train, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The confident of all the ſecrets of M. de P—, I myſelf undertook nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt intruſting him with my deſigns; his counſels regulated my conduct, mine determined his reſolution; our youth had no pleaſures which were not ſhared, no misfortunes which were not ſolaced by our mutual attachment.</p>
            <p>With what chagrin did I not perceive that fatal moment arrive, when my friend, obliged by the commands of a father to depart from Warſaw, prepared to take leave of me!

my leiſure moments with ſome uſeful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. I therefore cultivated the French language, already eſteemed throughout all Europe; I read with delight thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous works, the eternal monuments of genius, which it had produced; and I wondered, that notwithſtanding ſuch an ungrateful idiom, ſo many celebrated po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, ſo many excellent philoſophers and hiſtorians, juſtly immortalized, had been able to diſtinguiſh themſelves by its means.</p>
            <p>I alſo applied myſelf ſeriouſly to the ſtudy of geometry; I formed my mind in a particular manner to the purſuit of that noble profeſſion which makes a hero at the expence of one hundred thouſand unfortunates, and which men leſs human than valiant have called the grand art of war! Several years were employed in theſe purſuits, which are equally difficult and laborious; in ſhort, they ſolely occupied my thoughts. M. de P—, who often wrote to me, no longer received any but ſhort replies, and our correſpondence began to languiſh by neglect, when at length love finiſhed the triumph over friendſhip.</p>
            <p>My father had been for a long time intimately connected with Count Pulaſki.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037849_0005_100F848D7270BC28"/>
Celebrated for the auſterity of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, famous on account of the inflexibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his virtues, which were truly repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, Pulaſki, at once a great captain and a brave ſoldier, had on more than one occaſion ſignalized his fiery courage, and his ardent patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>Inſtructed in ancient literature, he had been taught by hiſtory the great leſſons of a noble diſintereſtedneſs, an immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtancy, an abſolute devotion to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Like thoſe heroes to whom idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous but grateful Rome elevated altars, Pulaſki would have ſacrificed all property to the proſperity of his country; he would have ſpilled the laſt drop of his blood for its defence; he would even have immolated his only, his beloved daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lodoiſka.</p>
            <p>Lodoiſka! how beautiful! how love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! her dear name is always on my lips, her adored remembrance will live for ever in my heart!</p>
            <p>From the firſt moment that I ſaw this fair maid, I lived only for her; I aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned my ſtudies; friendſhip was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten. I conſecrated all my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Lodoiſka. My father and hers could not be long ignorant of my attachment; they did not chide me for
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037849_0005_100F848D7270BC28"/>
it; they muſt have approved it then? This idea appeared to me to be ſo well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I delivered myſelf up without ſuſpicion, to the ſweet paſſion that enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; and I took my meaſures ſo well, that I beheld Lodoiſka almoſt daily, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at home, or in company with my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who loved her tenderly:—two ſweet years flew away in this manner.</p>
            <p>At length Pulaſki took me one day aſide, and addreſſed, me thus: "Your father and myſelf have formed great hopes of you, which your conduct has hitherto juſtified; I have long beheld you employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your youth in ſtudies equally uſeful and honorable. To-day—(He here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I was about to interrupt him) What would you ſay? Do you think to tell me any thing I am unacquainted with? Do you think that I have occaſion to be hourly witneſs of your tranſports, to learn how much my Lodoiſka merits to be beloved? Is it becauſe I know as well as you the value of my daughter, that you never ſhall obtain but by merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her? Young man, learn that it is not ſufficient that your foibles ſhould be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, to be excuſable; thoſe of a good citizen ought to be turned entirely to the profit of his country; love, even
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037849_0006_100F848F6372D440"/>
love itſelf, like the baſeſt of the paſſions, is either deſpicable or dangerous, if it does not offer to generous hearts an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional motive to excite them towards honor.</p>
            <p>"Hear me: Our monarch for a long time in a ſickly habit of body, ſeems at length to approach towards his end. His life, become every day more precarious, has awakened the ambition of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. They doubtleſs prepare to ſow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions among us; and they think that by over-awing our ſuffrages, they will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to force upon us a king of their own chuſing. Foreign troops have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dared to appear on the frontiers of Poland; already two thouſand Poliſh gentlemen have aſſembled, on purpoſe to puniſh their audacious inſolence. Go and join yourſelf with thoſe brave youths; go, and at the end of the campaign return covered with the blood of our enemies, and ſhew to Pulaſki a ſon-in-law worthy of him!"</p>
            <p>I did not heſitate a ſingle moment; my father approved of my reſolutions, but being unable to conſent without pain to my precipitate departure, he preſſed me for a long lime againſt his boſom, while a tender ſolicitude was depicted in

He inſtructed his daughter in my preſence, both of my departure, and of the motives which determined me to it. Lodoiſka grew pale, ſighed, looked at her father with a face ſuffuſed with bluſhes, and then aſſured me in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling voice, that her vows ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up for my ſafe return, and that her happineſs depended on the ſafety of Lovzinſki.</p>
            <p>Encouraged in this manner, what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers had I to fear? I departed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in the courſe of that campaign, there happened nothing worthy of nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the enemy, equally careful with ourſelves to avoid any action which might produce an open war between the two nations, contented themſelves with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing us by means of frequent marches:
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037849_0007_100F8490F96567B8"/>
we, on the other hand, bounded our views to following and obſerving them; and they only ſeemed to oppoſe themſelves to us, in thoſe parts where the open coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try afforded them an opportunity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good their retreat.</p>
            <p>At the end of the campaign they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to retire on purpoſe to take up their winter quarters in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and our little army compoſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly of gentlemen, ſeparated ſoon after.</p>
            <p>I returned to Warſaw full of joy and impatience; I thought that Love and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were about to beſtow Lodoiſka on me. Alas! I no longer had a father. I learned, on entering the capital, that Lovzinſki died of an apoplexy on the night before my arrival. Thus I was deprived, of even the ſad conſolation of receiving the laſt ſighs of the moſt tender of parents; I could only offer up my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows at his tomb, which I bathed with my tears!</p>
            <p>—"It is not," ſays Pulaſki to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was but little moved with my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſorrow—"it is not by barren tears that you can do honour to a father ſuch as thine. Poland in him regrets a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen—a hero, who would have been of

            <p>"Of all the rights which the death of your father tranſmits to you, the moſt noble is undoubtedly that of aſſiſting at the Diet, in which you are to repreſent him; it is there, where he will revive in you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is there, where you ought to exhibit a courage infinitely more difficult to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained than that which conſiſts only in braving death in the field of battle!</p>
            <p>"The valour of a ſoldier is nothing more than a common virtue; but they are not ordinary men who on awful emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, preſerving a tranquil courage, and diſplaying an active penetration, diſcover the projects of the powerful who cabal, diſconcert the enterpriſes of the intrigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and confront the deſigns of the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; who, always firm, incorruptible, and juſt, give not their ſuffrages but to thoſe whom they think moſt worthy of them; whom neither gold nor promiſes can ſeduce, whom prayers cannot bend, whom menaces cannot terrify.</p>

your father; this is the precious inheritance which you ought to be deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſuſtaining.—The day on which the ſtates aſſemble for the election of a king, will be the epoch on which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of many of our fellow-citizens, more occupied with their private intereſts than jealous of the proſperity of their country, will be manifeſted, as well as the pernicious deſigns of the neighbouring powers, whoſe cruel policy it is, to deſtroy our ſtrength by dividing it.</p>
            <p>"I am deceived, my friend, if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal moment is not faſt approaching, which will forever fix the deſtinies of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—its enemies have conſpired its ruin; they have ſecretly prepared for a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but they ſhall not conſummate their purpoſes while my arm can ſuſtain a ſword! May that God, who is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the republic, prevent all the horrors of a civil war! But that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, however frightful it appears, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps become neceſſary, I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"You ſhall ſecond my efforts, Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinſki; the feeble intereſts of love ought
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037849_0008_100F8494D0238010"/>
to diſappear before more ſacred claims. I cannot preſent my daughter to you du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this awful moment of ſuſpenſe, when our common country is in danger; but I promiſe to you, that the firſt days of peace ſhall be marked by your union with Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka.</p>
            <p>Pulaſki did not ſpeak in vain. I felt that I had now more eſſential duties to fulfil than thoſe of love; but the cares with which my mind was occupied, were hardly able to alleviate my grief. I will even avow to you, without bluſhing, that the ſorrow of my ſiſters, their tender friendſhip, and the careſſes more reſerved but no leſs pleaſing of my miſtreſs, made a ſtronger impreſſion on my heart than the patriotic counſels of Pulaſki. I beheld Lodoiſka tenderly affected with my irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loſs, and as much afflicted as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the cruel events which forced us to defer our union; my chagrin, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus divided with that lovely woman, ſeemed inſenſibly to diminiſh.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the king dies, and the Diet is convoked. On the day that it was to open, at the very inſtant when I was about to repair to the aſſembly, a ſtranger preſented himſelf, and deſired to ſpeak to me in private. As ſoon as my
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037849_0009_100F849892FBAA38"/>
attendants were retired, he enters my apartment with precipitation, throws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into my arms, and tenderly embraces me. It was M. de P—! Ten years, which had elapſed ſince our ſeparation, had not ſo much changed his features as to prevent me from recognizing him, and teſtifying my joy and ſurpriſe at his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected return.</p>
            <p>"You will be more aſtoniſhed," ſays he to me, "when you know the caſe. I have arrived this inſtant, and am about to repair to the meeting of the Diet; would it be preſuming too much on your friendſhip to reckon on your vote?"</p>
            <p>"On my vote! and for whom?"</p>
            <p>"For myſelf," continues he with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity; "it is not now time to recount to you the happy revolution that has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place in my fortune, and which at preſent permits me to entertain ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted hopes: it is ſufficient to obſerve, that my ambition is at leaſt juſtified by a majority of ſuffrages, and that it is in vain that two feeble rivals would attempt to diſpute with me the crown which I pretend.</p>
            <p>"Lovzinſki," adds he, embracing me again, "if you were not my friend, and I eſteemed you leſs, perhaps I ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

            <p>"I behold it with grief, and you know it as well as myſelf, that for ſeveral years paſt our Poland, become enfeebled, owes its ſafety to nothing elſe than the diſtruſt of the three great powers<note n="*" place="bottom">Ruſſia, Pruſſia, and the Houſe of Auſtria.</note> which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round it, and the deſire to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with our ſpoils, may in one moment re-unite our divided enemies.</p>
            <p>"Let us prevent, if we can, this inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious triumvirate from diſmembering the republic. Undoubtedly, in more fortunate times, our anceſtors were able to maintain the freedom of their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it is neceſſary however that we ſhould yield to that neceſſity, which is become inevitable.</p>
            <p>"Ruſſia will neceſſarily protect a king, whom ſhe herſelf has elevated; in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the ſovereign of her choice, you will defeat the views of that triple alliance which will render our perdition certain, and we ſhall acquire a powerful ally, who will oppoſe herſelf with ſucceſs to the two enemies that remain to us.</p>
            <p>"Theſe are the reaſons which have determined my conduct; I do not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don part of our rights, but to preſerve the moſt precious of them. I wiſh not to aſcend a fickle throne, but with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, by the means of a ſage policy, to give it ſtability; I conſent not to alter the conſtitution of the commonwealth, but to preſerve the kingdom entire."</p>
            <p>We repaired to the Diet together; I voted for M. de P—. He in effect obtained the majority of the ſuffrages; but Pulaſki, Zuremba, and ſome others, declared themſelves in favour of Prince C—. Nothing was decided amidſt the tumult of this firſt meeting.</p>
            <p>When the aſſembly broke up M. de P— invited me to accompany him to the place, which his ſecret emiſſaries had already prepared for him in the capital.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Diet for the election of the kings of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is held half a league from Warſaw, in the open air, on the other ſide of the Viſtula, near the village of Vola.</note>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:037849_0010_100F849A7037DF40"/>
We ſhut ourſelves up together during ſeveral hours, and renewed the promiſes of a friendſhip that ſhould endure forever. I then too informed M. de P— of my intimate connection with Pulaſki, and of my love for Lodoiſka. He repaid my confidence with more important commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications; he informed me of the events which had led to his approaching gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; he explained to me his ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; and I left him, convinced that he was leſs occupied with a deſire of his own elevation, than with that of reſtoring Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to its ancient proſperity.</p>
            <p>Poſſeſſed with theſe ideas, I flew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my future father-in-law, burning with the deſire of adding him to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my friend. Pulaſki was walking at a great pace up and down the chamber of his daughter, who appeared equally agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with himſelf.</p>
            <p>"Behold," ſaid he to Lodoiſka, the moment that he ſaw me enter, "behold that man whom I eſteem and whom you love! He has ſacrificed us both to his blind friendſhip." I was deſirous to reply but he went on—"You have been connected from your childhood with M. de P—. A powerful faction is about to place him on the throne; you know you are acquainted
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037849_0011_100F849C4BAE3048"/>
with his deſigns; this very morning at the Diet, you voted for him; you have deceived me:—but do you think that you ſhall deceive me with impunity?"</p>
            <p>I beſought him to hear me, and he conſtrained himſelf ſo far as to preſerve a ſtern ſilence: I then informed him that M. de P—, whom I had for a long time neglected, had agreeably ſurpriſed me by his unexpected return.</p>
            <p>Lodoiſka appeared charmed to hear me commence my juſtification.—"You ſhall not deceive me in the ſame manner as if I were a credulous woman," ſays Pulaſki.—"But it ſignifies not—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>I then recounted to him the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the ſhort converſations that I had with M. de P— before I repaired to the aſſembly of the ſtates.</p>
            <p>"And theſe are your projects!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims he. "M. de P— ſees no other remedy for the misfortune of his fellow-citizens than their ſlavery! He propoſes this, one of the name of Lovzinſki, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it; and they deſpiſe me ſo much as to tempt me to enter into this infamous plot! Shall I behold the Ruſſians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in our provinces in the name of a Pole?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:037849_0011_100F849C4BAE3048"/>"The Ruſſians, ſay I with fury; the Ruſſians reign in my country!" On this Pulaſki, advancing towards me with the greateſt impetuoſity, cries out: "Perfid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious youth! you have deceived me, and you would betray the ſtate! Leave my houſe this very moment, or know that I ſhall order you to be dragged out of it!"</p>
            <p>I frankly acknowledge that an affront ſo cruel, and ſo little merited, diſarmed me of my prudence: in the firſt tranſports of my fury, I placed my hand upon my ſword; and quicker than lightning Pulaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki brandiſhed his in the air.</p>
            <p>His daughter, his diſtracted daughter, ruſhed forward, and precipitated herſelf upon me, crying out: "Lovzinſki, what are you about to do?" On hearing the accents of a voice ſo dear to me, I recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my wandering reaſon; but I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that a ſingle inſtant was about fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to bereave me of my Lodoiſka! She had left me to throw herſelf into the arms of her father. He, cruel man, beheld my grief, and ſtrove to augment it: "Go, traitor!" ſays he, "be gone—you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Lodoiſka for the laſt time!"</p>
            <p>I returned home in a ſtate of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The odious names which Pulaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037849_0012_100F849F69DDC9E8"/>
had laviſhed on me, returned uncea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly to my reflection. The intereſts of Poland, and thoſe of M. de P—, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſo intimately connected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that I did not perceive in what manner I could betray my fellow-citizens by ſerving my friend; in the mean time I was obliged either to abandon him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Lodoiſka forever. What was I to reſolve? what part ſhould I take? I paſſed the whole night in a ſtate of the moſt cruel uncertainty: and when the day appeared, I went towards Pulaſki's houſe, without yet having come to any determination.</p>
            <p>The only domeſtic who remained there informed me, that his lord had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted at the beginning of the night, with his daughter, after having firſt diſmiſſed all his people. Think of my deſpair on hearing this news. I aſked to what part Pulaſki had retired. But my queſtion was in vain, he informed me that he was certainly ignorant of the place of his deſtination.</p>
            <p>"All I can tell you," ſays he, "is that you had ſcarce gone away yeſterday evening, when he heard a great noiſe in the apartment of his daughter. Still ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at the ſcene which had taken place
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037849_0012_100F849F69DDC9E8"/>
between you, I approached the door, and liſtened. Lodoiſka wept: her furious father overwhelmed her with injuries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his malediction upon her, and I myſelf heard him exclaim: "To love a traitor, is to be one! Ungrateful wretch! I ſhall conduct you to a place of ſafety, where you ſhall henceforth be at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from ſeduction."</p>
            <p>Could I any longer doubt the extent of my miſery? I inſtantly called for Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlas, one of the moſt faithful of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics: I ordered him to place truſty ſpies about the palace of Pulaſki, who ſhould bring an account of every thing that paſſed there; and commanded that if the count returned to the capital before me, he ſhould follow him wherever he went. Having given theſe inſtructions, and not yet deſpairing of ſtill finding the family at one of their ſeats in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, I myſelf ſet out in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of my miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>I accordingly ſearched through all the domains of Pulaſki, and aſked concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lodoiſka of all the paſſengers whom I met, but without ſucceſs. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent eight days in fruitleſs enquiry, I reſolved to return to Warſaw, and I was not a little aſtoniſhed, on my arrival, to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037849_0013_100F84A0FA9DFB40"/>
find a Ruſſian army encamped on the banks of the Viſtula, almoſt under the very walls of that city.</p>
            <p>It was night when I entered the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: the palaces of the grandees were all illuminated, an immenſe multitude filled the ſtreets; I heard the ſongs of joy; I beheld wine flowing in rivulets in the public ſquares: every thing announced to me that Poland had a king.</p>
            <p>Boleſlas, who expected me with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, informed me that Pulaſki had returned alone on the ſecond day after my departure; and that he had not ſtirred from his own palace but to repair to the Diet, where, in ſpite of his efforts, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendancy of Ruſſia became every day more manifeſt. "During the laſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly held this very morning," adds he, M. de P— united almoſt all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages in his favor, and was about to be declared king, when Pulaſki pronounced the fatal <hi>Veto:</hi> at that inſtant twenty ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres were brandiſhed in the air. The fierce palatine of —, whom the count had inſulted in the former aſſembly, was the firſt to ruſh forwards, and gave him a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wound on the head. Zaremba, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſome others, drew to the defence of their friend: but all their efforts would have
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037849_0013_100F84A0FA9DFB40"/>
been unable to have ſaved him, if M. de P— had not ranged himſelf on their ſide, exclaiming at the ſame time, that he would ſacrifice with his own hand, the firſt perſon who dared to approach him. On this the aſſailants retired. In the mean time Pulaſki, fainting with the loſs of blood, was carried off the field in a ſtate of inſenſibility. Zaremba departed alſo, ſwearing to avenge his friend. Having thus become maſter of the deliberations, the numerous partizans of M. de P— inſtantly proclaimed him ſovereign.</p>
            <p>"Pulaſki, who had been carried to his palace, was ſoon reſtored to life; and the ſurgeons who attended him, declared that his wounds, although dangerous, were not mortal. In that ſtate, although lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing under the moſt cruel torments, contrary to the advice of all his friends, he ordered himſelf to be lifted into his carriage, and before noon he left Warſaw, accompanied by Mazeppa and a few male-contents."</p>
            <p>It was ſcarcely poſſible to have announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced worſe news to me. My friend was upon the throne, but my reconciliation with Pulaſki appeared henceforth impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and in all appearance Lodoiſka was loſt forever. I knew her father ſo well

as to be under apprehenſions leſt he ſhould proceed to extremities with his daughter. I was affrightened at the preſent, I durſt not look forward towards the future; and my heart was ſo devoured with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin, that I did not go out, even to felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the new king.</p>
            <p>One of my people, whom Boleſlas diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched after Pulaſki, returned at the end of the fourth day: He had followed him fifteen leagues from the capital; when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that diſtance, Zaremba, who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſtranger at a little diſtance from the carriage, began to conceive ſuſpicions. As they proceeded, four of his followers, who had concealed themſelves behind the ruins of an old houſe, ſurpriſed my courier, and conducted him to Pulaſki. He, with a piſtol in his hand, forced him to acknowledge to whom he belonged. "I ſhall ſend you back to Lovzinſki," ſaid the fierce republican, "on purpoſe to announce from me, that he ſhall not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape my juſt vengeance." At theſe words they blindfolded my ſervant, who could not tell where they carried him. At the end of four-and-twenty hours they returned, and tying a handkerchief once more about his eyes they put him into a carriage, which having ſtopped at length,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037849_0014_100F84A688996698"/>
after a journey of ſeveral hours, he was ordered to deſcend. Scarce had he put his foot upon the ground but his guards departed at a full gallop: on which he removed the bandage, and found himſelf preciſely on the ſame ſpot as that on which he had been firſt arreſted.</p>
            <p>This intelligence filled me with uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the menaces of Pulaſki terrified me, much leſs on my own account than on Lodoiſka's, who remained in his power: In the midſt of his fury he might ſacrifice her life! I reſolved therefore to expoſe myſelf to every ſpecies of danger, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſcover the retreat of the father, and the priſon of his only child.</p>
            <p>On the ſucceeding day, after informing my ſiſters of my deſign, I left the capital: Boleſlas alone accompanied me, and I paſſed for his brother. We wandered over all Poland, and I then percieved that the fears of Pulaſki were but too well juſtified by the event. Under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of obliging the inhabitants to take the oath of fidelity to the new king, the Ruſſians ſcattered about in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, deſolated the country, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a multitude of exactions in the cities.</p>
            <p>After having ſpent three months in
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037849_0015_100F84A8314914A8"/>
vain enquiries, deſpairing of being able to find Lodoiſka, touched with the moſt lively grief for the fate of my country, and weeping at one and the ſame time for her misfortunes and my own, I was about to return to Warſaw, to inform the new king of the exceſſes committed by thoſe foreigners in his ſtates, when an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture that at firſt ſeemed to be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auſpicious, forced me to a very different reſolution.</p>
            <p>The Turks having declared war againſt Ruſſia, the Tartars of Budziac and the Crimea made frequent incurſions into Volhynia, where I then was. Four of thoſe robbers attacked us one afternoon, as we were leaving a wood near Oſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. I had imprudently neglected to load my piſtols; but I made uſe of my ſabre with ſo much addreſs and good luck, that in a ſhort time, two of them fell cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with wounds. Boleſlas encountered the third: the fourth attacked me with great fury; he gave me a ſlight cut upon the leg, but received a terrible ſtroke in return, that diſmounted him from his horſe and felled him to the ground. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlas at the ſame moment perceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſencumbered from his enemy, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037849_0015_100F84A8314914A8"/>
took to flight. He whom I had juſt van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, then addreſſed me in very bad Poliſh, and ſaid, "a brave man like you ought to be generous. I beg my life of you; inſtead of putting me to death, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me, relieve me, bind up my wounds and aſſiſt me to ariſe."</p>
            <p>He demanded quarter with an air ſo noble, that I did not heſitate for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I accordingly deſcended from my horſe, and Boleſlas and myſelf hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helped him to ariſe, we dreſſed his wounds. "You behave well:" ſays the Tartar to me; "you behave well!" As he ſpoke we beheld a cloud of duſt, and in a moment after, more than three hundred Tartars ruſhed upon us full ſpeed. "Be not afraid, dread nothing," ſays he whom I had ſpared; "I am the chief of this troop." Accordingly, by means of a ſign, he ſtops his followers, who were on the point of maſſacring us; and ſpeaking to them in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which I was unable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, they inſtantly opened their ranks on purpoſe to permit us to paſs.</p>
            <p>"Brave man," exclaims their captain, addreſſing himſelf to me once more, "had I not reaſon to ſay you behaved well? You left me my life, and I now ſave

yours: it is ſometimes right to ſpare an enemy, and even a robber! Hear me, my friend: in attacking you, I followed my profeſſion, and you did your duty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering me. I pardon you, you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pardoned me; let us therefore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. He then adds: "The day is waſting, and I would not adviſe you to travel in theſe cantons during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent night.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037849_0016_100F84AAEB156370"/>
I therefore ſaid to Boleſlas; "Let us immediately make for the caſtle that he has now pointed out to us; I am well acquainted with this ſame Dourlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſki by name; Pulaſki has ſometimes ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to to me concerning him: he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is not ignorant of the place to which the Count has retired; and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that with a little addreſs we may be able to draw the ſecret from him. I ſhall ſay at all events that we are ſent by Pulaſki, and this recommendation will be of more ſervice to us than that of Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſican; in the mean time, Boleſlas, do not forget that I am your brother, and be ſure not to diſcover me.</p>
            <p>We ſoon arrived at the ditch of the caſtle; the ſervants of Dourlinſki de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded who we were; I anſwered that we were come from Pulaſki and wiſhed to ſpeak to their lord, and that we had been attacked by robbers, who were ſtill in purſuit of us.

               </gap> ſee Dourlinſki, but that on the next day at ten o'clock he would give us audience. They then demanded our arms which we delivered up without any difficulty, and Boleſlas ſoon after took an
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037849_0017_100F84AE9F3CC7C8"/>
opportunity of looking at my wound, which was found to be but ſuperficial.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> frugal repaſt was ſerved up for us in the kitchen. We were afterwards conducted to a lower chamber, where two beds were prepared for us. The domeſtics then left us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any light, and immediately locked the door of the apartment.</p>
            <p>I could not cloſe my eyes during the whole of the night. Titſican had given me but a ſlight wound, but that which my heart had received was very deep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At day break, I became impatient in my priſon, and wiſhed to open the ſhutters, but they were nailed up. I attacked them however, ſo vigorouſly, that the faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings gave way, and I beheld a very fine park. The window being low, I cleared it at a leap, and in a ſingle inſtant found myſelf in the garden of the Poliſh chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>After having walked about for a few minutes, I ſat down on a ſtone bench, which was placed at the foot of a tower, whoſe ancient architecture I had been ſome time conſidering. I remained for a few ſeconds enveloped in reflection, when a tile fell at my feet. I thought it had dropped from the roof of this old
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037849_0017_100F84AE9F3CC7C8"/>
building; and to avoid the effects of a ſimilar accident, I went and placed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the other end of the ſeat. A few moments after, a ſecond tile fell by my ſide. The circumſtance appeared ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing: I aroſe with ſome degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, and attentively examined the tower. I perceived at about twenty-five or thirty feet from the ground, a narrow opening. On this I picked up the tiles which had been thrown at me, and on the firſt I diſcovered the following words, written with a bit of plaiſter:</p>
            <p>"LOVZINSKI, IS IT YOU! DO YOU STILL LIVE!"</p>
            <p>And on the ſecond theſe:</p>
            <p>"DELIVER ME! SAVE LODOISKA."</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to conceive how many different ſentiments occupied my mind at one and the ſame time: my aſtoniſhment, my joy, my grief, my embarraſſment, cannot be expreſſed. I examined once more the priſon of Lodoiſka, and plotted in my own mind how I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her liberty. She at length threw down another tile, and I read as follows:</p>
            <p>"At midnight, bring me paper, ink, and pens; and to-morrow an hour after ſun-riſe, come and receive a letter.— Begone."—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:037849_0018_100F84B3401A5630"/>Having returned towards my chamber, I called to Boleſlas, who aſſiſted me in re-entering through the window. I then informed my faithful ſervant, of the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident that had put an end to my wanderings and redoubled my inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude.</p>
            <p>How could I penetrate into this tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? How could we procure arms? By what means were we to deliver Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka from captivity? How could we carry her off under the eye of Dourlinſki, in the midſt of his people, from a fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed caſtle? and ſuppoſing that ſo many obſtacles were not unſurmountable, could I attempt ſuch an enterprize during the ſhort delay preſcribed by Titſican?</p>
            <p>Did not the Tartar enjoin me to ſtay with Dourlinſki three days, but not to remain longer than eight?</p>
            <p>Would it not be to expoſe ourſelves to the attacks of the enemy, to leave this caſtle before the third, or after the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the eighth day? Should I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe my dear Lodoiſka from a priſon, on purpoſe to deliver her into the hands of robbers, to be forever ſeparated from her either by ſlavery or death? This would be a horrible idea!</p>
            <p>But wherefore was ſhe confined in ſuch
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037849_0018_100F84B3401A5630"/>
a frightful priſon? The letter which ſhe had promiſed would doubtleſs inſtruct me: It was therefore neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure paper, pen and ink. I accordingly charged Boleſlas with this employment, and began to prepare myſelf for acting the delicate part of an emiſſary of Pulaſki in the preſence of Dourlinſki.</p>
            <p>It was broad day light when they came to ſet us at liberty, and informed us that Dourlinſki was at leiſure and wiſhed to ſee us. We accordingly preſented our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before him with great confidence; and we were introduced to a man of about ſixty years of age, whoſe reception was blunt, and whoſe manners were repulſive. He demanded who we were. "My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and myſelf," replied I, "belong to Count Pulaſki. My maſter has entruſted me with a ſecret commiſſion to you. My brother accompanies me on another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Before I explain, I muſt be in private, for I am charged not to ſpeak but to you alone."</p>
            <p>"It is very well," replies Dourlinſki<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "your brother may retire, and you alſo," addreſſing himſelf to his ſervants; "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone! As to him (pointing to a perſon who was his confident) he muſt remain, and you may ſpeak any thing before him."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:037849_0019_100F79A1D0B5F828"/>"Pulaſki has ſent me,"—"I ſee very well that he has ſent you," ſays the Palatine, interrupting me—"to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you—" "What?"— "news of his daughter." "News of his daughter! Did Pulaſki ſay ſo?"— "Yes my lord, he ſaid that his daughter was here."—I perceived that Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſki inſtantly grew pale; he then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards his confident, and ſurveyed me for ſome time in ſilence.</p>
            <p>"You aſtoniſh me," rejoins he at length, "In confiding a ſecret of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to you, it neceſſarily follows that your maſter muſt have been very imprudent."</p>
            <p>No more than you, my lord, for have not you alſo a confident: Grandees would be much to be pitied if they could not rely upon any of their domeſtics. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſki has charged me to inform you, that Lovzinſki has already ſearched through a great part of Poland, and that he will undoubtedly viſit theſe cantons."</p>
            <p>"If he dares to come here," replies he with great vivacity, "I will provide a lodging for him, which he ſhall inhabit for ſome time. Do you know this Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinſki?"</p>
            <p>"I have ſeen him at my maſter's houſe in Warſaw."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:037849_0019_100F79A1D0B5F828"/>"They ſay he is handſome?"</p>
            <p>"He is well made, and about my ſize."</p>
            <p>"His perſon?"—"is prepoſſeſſing; it is—"</p>
            <p>"He is a wretch," adds he, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me in a great paſſion—"Oh that he were but to fall into my hands!"</p>
            <p>"My lord, they ſay he is brave—".</p>
            <p>"He! I will lay any wager, any ſum of money, that he is only calculated to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce women! O that he would but fall into my hands!" Then aſſuming a leſs ferocious tone, he continues thus, "It is a long time ſince Pulaſki wrote to me— where is he at preſent?"</p>
            <p>"My lord I have preciſe orders not to anſwer that queſtion: all that I dare to ſay, is, that he has the ſtrongeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for neither diſcovering the place of his retreat, nor writing to any perſon, and that he will ſoon come and explain them to you in perſon."</p>
            <p>Dourlinſki appeared exceedingly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed at this information; I could diſcover ſome ſymptoms of fear in his countenance. At length, looking at his confident, who ſeemed equally embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with himſelf, he proceeded: "You ſay that Pulaſki will come here ſoon:" "Yes, my lord, in about a fortnight, or a little
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037849_0020_100F84B7A3D5D7E8"/>
later." On this he again turned to his attendant; but in a ſhort time affecting as much calmneſs as he had before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered embarraſſment; "Return to your maſter." added he; "I am ſorry to have nothing but bad news to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to him—tell him that Lodoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſka is no longer here." I myſelf became ſurpriſed in my turn at this information. "What! my lord, Lodoiſka—"</p>
            <p>"Is not longer here, I tell you!— To oblige Pulaſki, whom I eſteem, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, although with great repugnance, the taſk of confining his daughter in my caſtle: nobody but myſelf and he (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his confident) knew that ſhe was here. It is about a month ſince we went, as uſeful, to carry her proviſions for the day, but there was nobody in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I am ignorant how it happened; but what I know well is, that ſhe has eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, for I have heard nothing of her ſince.—She muſt undoubtedly have gone to join Lovzinſki at Warſaw, if perchance the Tartars have not intercepted her in her journey."</p>
            <p>My aſtoniſhment on this became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. How could I reconcile that which I had ſeen in the garden, with that which Dourlinſki now told me? There
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037849_0020_100F84B7A3D5D7E8"/>
was ſome myſtery in this buſineſs, which I became exceedingly impatient to be acquainted with: I was however ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely careful not to exhibit any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of doubt. "My lord, ſaid I, "this is bad news for my maſter!"— "Undoubtedly, but it is not my fault."</p>
            <p>"My lord, I have a favour to aſk of you."</p>
            <p>"Let me hear it."—"The Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars are ravaging the neighbourhood of your caſtle—they attacked us— we eſcaped as it were by a miracle. Will you permit my brother and myſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here only for the ſpace of two days?"</p>
            <p>"For two days only I give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,"</p>
            <p>"Where do they lodge?" ſays he to his attendant. "in an apartment below ground," was the reply.</p>
            <p>"Which overlooks my gardens?" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins Dourlinſki, interrupting him with great agitation.</p>
            <p>"The ſhutters are well faſtened," adds the other.</p>
            <p>"No matter— You muſt put them elſewhere." Theſe words made me tremble.</p>
            <p>"It is not impoſſible, but,"— continues the confident, and then whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037849_0021_100F84BA371793A0"/>
the reſt of the ſentence in his ear.</p>
            <p>"Right," ſays the Baron; "and let it be done inſtantly." Then, addreſſing himſelf to me, know that your brother and you muſt depart the day after to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow: before you go, you ſhall ſee me again, and I will give you a letter for Pulaſki."</p>
            <p>I then went to rejoin Boleſlas in the kitchen, where he was at breakfaſt, who ſoon after preſented me with a little bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ink, ſeveral pens, and ſome ſheets of paper, which he had procured without difficulty. I panted with deſire to write to Lodoiſka; and the only difficulty that now remained, was to find a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place where I might not be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the curioſity of Dourlinſki's people.</p>
            <p>They had already informed Boleſlas that we could not again be admitted into the apartment where we had ſpent the preceding night, until the time ſhould arrive when we were to retire to reſt. I ſoon, however, bethought myſelf of a ſtratagem which ſucceeded to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The ſervants were drinking with my pretended brother, and politely invited me to help them to empty a few flaſks.</p>
            <p>I ſwallowed, with a good grace, ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

glaſſes of bad wine in ſucceſſion: in a few minutes my legs ſeemed to totter, my tongue faultered: I related a hundred pleaſant and improbable tales to the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous company; in a word, I acted the drunken man ſo well, that Boleſlas him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf became a dupe to my ſcheme, and actually trembled leſt, in a moment when I ſeemed diſpoſed to communicate every thing, my ſecret ſhould eſcape.</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen," ſaid he, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bacchanals, "my brother's head is not very ſtrong to day: it is perhaps in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his wound; let us not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either ſpeak to or drink any more with him; for I am afraid of his health, and indeed you would oblige me exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly if you would aſſiſt me to carry him to his bed,"—"To his own bed?" ſays one of them: "that is impoſſible! But I will moſt willingly lend him my chamber." They accordingly laid hold of me, and conveyed me into a garret, of which a bed, a table, and a chair formed the ſole moveables. Having ſhut me up in this paltry apartment, they inſtantly left me. This was all I wanted, for the moment that I was alone, I immediately ſat down to write a long letter to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:037849_0022_100F84BE1F973C08"/>I began by fully juſtifying myſelf from the crimes of which I had been accuſed by Pulaſki: I then recounted every thing that had occurred ſince the firſt moment of our ſeparation, until that when I had entered the caſtle of Dourlinſki: I detail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the particulars of my converſation with the Baron: I concluded by aſſuring her of the moſt tender and the moſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful paſſion, and ſwore to her, that the moment ſhe gave me the neceſſary inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation concerning her ſituation, I would expoſe myſelf to every danger, in order to finiſh her horrid captivity.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as my letter was ſealed, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered myſelf up to a variety of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which threw me into a ſtrange per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. Was it actually Lodoiſka who had thrown thoſe tiles into the garden? Would Pulaſki have had the injuſtice to puniſh his daughter for an attachment which he himſelf had approved? Would he have had the inhumanity to plunge her into a frightful priſon? And even if the hatred he had ſworn to me had blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo much, how was it poſſible that Dourlinſki would thus have condeſcended to have become the miniſter of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance?</p>
            <p>But, on the other hand, for theſe three
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037849_0022_100F84BE1F973C08"/>
laſt long months, on purpoſe to diſguiſe myſelf, I had only worn tattered clothes: the fatigues of a tedious journey, and my chagrin, had altered me greatly; and who but a miſtreſs could have been able to diſcover Lovzinſki in the gardens of Dourlinſki? Beſides, had I not ſeen the name of Lodoiſka traced upon the tile? Had not Dourlinſki himſelf acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Lodoiſka had been a priſoner with him? It is true, he had added that ſhe had made her eſcape: but was not this incredible? And wherefore that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which Dourlinſki had avowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, without knowing my perſon? What occaſioned that look of inquietude, when it was told him, that the emiſſaries of Pulaſki occupied a chamber that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his garden? And why above all that look of terror, when I announced to him the arrival of my pretended maſter?</p>
            <p>All theſe circumſtances were well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>minated over this frightful and myſterious adventure, which it was impoſſible for me to explain. For two hours, I un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>aſingly put new queſtions to myſelf, to which I was exceedingly embarraſſed to make any reply; when at length Boleſlas came to ſee if I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037849_0023_100F84C0D6299198"/>
from my debauch. I had but little difficulty in convincing him that my inebriety was mere affectation; after which we went down together to the kitchen, where we ſpent the reſt of the day. What a night! none in my whole life ever appeared ſo long, not even that which followed.</p>
            <p>At length the attendants conducted us to our chamber, where they ſhut us up, as on the former occaſion, without any light: it was yet two tedious hours until midnight. At the firſt ſtroke of the clock, we gently opened the ſhutters and the caſement. I then prepared to jump into the garden; but my embarraſſment was equal to my deſpair, when I found myſelf obſtructed by means of iron bars. "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold," ſaid I to Boleſlas, "what the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed confident whiſpered in his ear! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what his odious maſter approved, when he ſaid, <hi>let it be done inſtantly!</hi> behold what they have been working at during the day! it was on this account that they prevented us from entering the chamber."</p>
            <p>"My lord, they have ſtood on the outſide," replies Boleſlas: "for they have not perceived that the ſhutter has been forced."</p>
            <p>"Alas! whether they have perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037849_0023_100F84C0D6299198"/>
it or not," exclaimed I with violence, "what does it ſignify? This fatal grating deſtroys all my hopes: it inſures the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Lodoiſka—it inſures my death."</p>
            <p>"Yes without doubt it inſures thy death!" repeats a perſon, at the ſame time opening the door: and immediately after, Dourlinſki, preceded by ſeveral armed men, and followed by others car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying flambeaux, enter our priſon <hi>ſabre in hand.</hi> "Traitor!" exclaims he, while addreſſing himſelf to me with a look in which fury was viſibly depicted, "I have heard all—I know who you are—your ſervant has diſcovered your name. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! Of all the enemies of Lovzinſki, I am the moſt implacable!"</p>
            <p>"Search them continues he, turning to his attendants: they accordingly ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in upon me; and as I was without arms, I made a uſeleſs reſiſtance. They accordingly robbed me of my papers, and of the letter I had juſt written to Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſka. Dourlinſki exhibited a thouſand ſigns of impatience while reading it, and was ſcarce able to contain himſelf.</p>
            <p>"Lovzinſki," ſays he to me, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to ſmother his rage, "I already deſerve all your hatred; I ſhall ſoon merit it ſtill more: in the mean time
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037849_0024_100F84C3B4AA8B40"/>
you muſt remain with your worthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in this chamber, to which you are ſo partial."</p>
            <p>After uttering theſe words, he left me; and having double-locked the door, he placed a centinel on the outſide, and another in the garden, oppoſite to the window.</p>
            <p>Figure to yourſelf the horrible ſituation into which Boleſlas and myſelf were now plunged. My misfortunes were at their height; but thoſe of Lodoiſka affected me more than my own! How great muſt be her uneaſineſs! She expects Lovzin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſki, and Lovzinſki abandons her! But no—Lodoiſka knows me too well; ſhe can never ſuſpect me of ſuch baſe perfidy. Lodoiſka! ſhe will judge of her lover by herſelf; ſhe will think Lovzinſki par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes her lot, ſince he does not ſuccour her— Alas! the very certainty of my misfortunes will augment her own!</p>
            <p>On the next day, they gave us provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions through the grating of our window; and by the quality of the viands which they furniſhed us with, Boleſlas augured the moſt ſiniſter events. Being however leſs unhappy than myſelf, he ſupported his fate much more courageouſly. He offered me my ſhare of the mean repaſt
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037849_0024_100F84C3B4AA8B40"/>
which he was about to make; I would not eat: he preſſed me; but it was in vain! for exiſtence was become an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable burden to me.</p>
            <p>"Ah! live!" ſaid he at length, ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a torrent of tears: live! and if not for Boleſlas, let it be for Lodoiſka! Theſe words made the moſt lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my mind; they even reani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated my courage: and hope having once more re-entered my heart, I embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my faithful ſervant. "O my friend!" exclaimed I at the ſame time with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, "my true friend! I have been the occaſion of thy ruin, and yet my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes affect thee more than thine own! Yes, Boleſlas! yes! I will live for Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka; I will live for thee: if juſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall reſtore me to my fortune and rank, you ſhall ſee that your maſter is not ungrateful!" We now embraced once more.</p>
            <p>Ah! how much do misfortunes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect men together! how ſweet it is, when one ſuffers, to hear another unfortunate addreſs a word of conſolation to him!</p>
            <p>We had groaned in this priſon for no leſs than twelve days, when ſeveral ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians came to drag me forth on purpoſe to conduct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Dourlinſki. Boleſlas
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037849_0025_100F84C77348E418"/>
wiſhed to follow, but they repulſed him with violence: However they permitted me to ſpeak to him for a ſingle moment. I then drew from a private pocket a ring which I had worn for ten years, and ſaid to Boleſlas: "This ring was given to me by M. de P. when we were at col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege together at Warſaw: take it, my friend; and preſerve it for my ſake. If Dourlinſki this day conſummates his treaſon by my aſſination, and if he ſhould at length permit you to leave this caſtle, go find your king, recall to his memory our ancient attachment, recount my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes to him: he will recompenſe you, and ſuccour Lodoiſka. Adieu my friend!"</p>
            <p>After this, I was conducted to the apartment of Dourlinſki. As ſoon as the door opened, I perceived a lady in a chair, who had juſt fainted away. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her—it was Lodoiſka! Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! how much did I find her altered! but ſhe was ſtill handſome! "Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an!" exclaimed I, addreſſing myſelf to Dourlinſki; and at the voice of her lover, Lodoiſka recovered her ſenſes.</p>
            <p>"Ah, my dear Lovzinſki," ſays ſhe, looking wiſtfully at me, "do you know what this infamous wretch has propoſed?
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037849_0025_100F84C77348E418"/>
do you know at what price he has offered me your liberty?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," cries the furious chieftain, "yes, I am determined upon it: you ſee that he is in my power; and if in three days I do not obtain my wiſhes, he ſhall be no more!" I endeavored to throw myſelf on my knees at the feet of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka; but my guards prevented me: "I behold you again, and all my ills are forgotten, Lodoiſka—death has now no longer any thing terrifying in its aſpect."</p>
            <p>"Wretch," added I, looking ſternly at Dourlinſki, "know that Pulaſki will avenge his daughter! know that the king will avenge his friend!"</p>
            <p>"Let him be carried away!" was the only reply made by the ferocious Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atine.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Lodoiſka, "my love has been your ruin!" I was about to anſwer, but the attendants dragged me out, and re-conducted me to priſon.</p>
            <p>Boleſlas received me with inexpreſſible tranſports of joy; he avowed to me that he thought me loſt for ever, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to him that my death was but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. The ſcene of which I had been a witneſs confirmed all my ſuſpicions; it was evident that Pulaſki was ignorant
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:037849_0026_100F84C910041900"/>
of the unworthy treatment which his daughter experienced; it was alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Dourlinſki, old, amorous and jealous, was determined, at any rate, to ſatisfy his paſſions.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, two of the days allowed by Dourlinſki for the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lodoiſka, had already expired; we were now in the midſt of the night which preceded the fatal third; I could not ſleep, and I was walking haſtily about my priſon. All at once I heard the cry of "to arms! to arms!" The moſt frightful howlings prevailed on the outſide, and a great commotion took place within the caſtle. The centinel placed at our window, left his poſt. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlas and I were able to diſtinguiſh the voice of Dourlinſki, calling and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his followers; and we ſoon diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard the claſhing of ſwords, the cries of the wounded, and the groans of the dying. The noiſe, which at firſt was very great, ſeemed at length to die away. It recommenced ſoon after; it redoubled; and at length we heard a ſhout of "Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory!"</p>
            <p>To this frightful tumult, a ſtill more frightful ſilence enſues. In a ſhort time, a low crackling ſound is heard to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

us; the air ſeems to hiſs with violence; the night becomes leſs dark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the trees in the garden aſſume a red and warm tint; we fly to the window: the flames are devouring the caſtle of Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linski! they approach the chamber in which we were confined, from all ſides; and, to overwhelm me with new horror, the moſt piercing ſhrieks are uttered from that tower in which I knew Lodoiska was impriſoned!</p>
            <p>The fire becoming every moment more violent, was about to communicate to the chamber in which we were ſhut up, and the flames already began to curl around the baſe of the tower in which Lodoiska was immured!</p>
            <p>Lodoiska uttered the moſt dreadful groans, to which I anſwered by cries of fury. Boleſlas ruſhed from one part of the priſon to another, like a madman; he ſent forth the moſt terrible howlings; he attempted to burſt open the door with his hands and feet. As for myſelf, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at the window, and ſhook, amidſt my tranſports of fury, thoſe maſſive iron bars which I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nable to bend.</p>
            <p>All of a ſudden, the domeſtics who had lately mounted the battlements, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend with precipitation, and open the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:037849_0027_100F84CBDB4B4630"/>
gates: we heard the voice of Dourlinski himſelf, begging for quarter. The vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors inſtantly precipitated themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the flames; and being at length attracted by our cries, they force open the door of our priſon with their hatchets.</p>
            <p>By their dreſs and their arms, I know them to be Tartars: their chief arrives —it is Titſican!</p>
            <p>"Ah! ah!" exclaims he; "it is my brave friend!"</p>
            <p>I inſtantly throw myſelf on his neck: —"Titſican!—Lodoiska!—a lady!—the faireſt of women!— in that tower!—about to be burnt alive!"</p>
            <p>Theſe were the incoherent expreſſions by which I made my feelings known.</p>
            <p>The Tartar inſtantly gives the word of command to his ſoldiers—they fly to the tower—I fly along with them—Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlas follows us. They burſt open the the doors; and near to an old pillar we diſcover a narrow winding ſtair-caſe, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſmoke.</p>
            <p>The Tartars, affrighted at the danger, ſtart back: I prepare to aſcend.</p>
            <p>"Alas! what are you about?" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims Boleſlas.</p>
            <p>"To live or die with Lodoiska!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:037849_0027_100F84CBDB4B4630"/>"And I will either live or die with my maſter!" was the reply of my gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervant.</p>
            <p>I ruſh on—he follows me! At the risk of ſuffocation, we aſcend about forty ſteps; by the light of the flames we diſcover Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiska in a corner of her priſon; who feebly utters: "Who is it that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es me?"</p>
            <p>"It is Lovzinski! it is your lover!"</p>
            <p>Joy inſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tly lends her new ſtrength; ſhe riſes and flies into my arms: we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her away; we deſcend a few ſteps; but volumes of ſmoke now fill all the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and we are forced to re-aſcend with precipitation. At that very inſtant, too, a part of the tower gives way!— Boleſlas utters a dreadful ſhriek, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiska falls into a ſwoon.</p>
            <p>That which was on the point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, ſaved us! The flames, formerly ſmothered, began to extend with greater rapidity; but the ſmoke was diſſipated. Laden with our precious burden, Boleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las and I deſcend in haſte—I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate; every ſtop trembled under our feet! the walls were all on fire! At length we arrived at the gate of the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Titſican, trembling for our ſafety, was expecting us there; "Brave men!"
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:037849_0028_100F84CE5CE815E0"/>
exclaimed he, on ſeeing us appear again. —I placed Lodoiska at his feet, and fell down lifeleſs by her ſide!</p>
            <p>I remained nearly an hour in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. They tremble for my life; and Boleſlas weeps aloud. I again recover my ſenſes, on hearing the voice of Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iska, who returning to herſelf, calls me her deliverer. The appearance of every thing was altered; the tower was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ruins. The Tartars, however, had ſtopped the progreſs of the flames; they had deſtroyed one part of the caſtle, on purpoſe to ſave the remainder; in fine, we had been carried into a large ſaloon, where we were ſurrounded by Titſican and ſome of his ſoldiers. Others of them were occupied in pillaging and in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the gold, ſilver, jewels, plate, and all the precious effects which the flames had ſpared.</p>

            <p>In the mean time, my lovely miſtreſs holds my hand claſped in hers. "Alas," ſays ſhe at length, with tears in her eyes, "alas! you have ſaved my life, and your own is ſtill in danger! Nay, even if we eſcape death, ſlavery awaits us!"</p>
            <p>"No, no, Lodoiska, be comforted, Titſican is not my enemy; Titſican will put a period to our misfortunes—"</p>
            <p>"Undoubtedly, if I am able," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the Tartar, interrupting me: "you are in the right, brave man!

            <p>On this I embrace Boleſlas:—"yes, Titſican, yes, I have a friend, who ſhall always be dear to me!—"</p>
            <p>The Tartar again interrupts me:— "What! were not you both confined in an apartment below ground, and was not this lady in a tower? What was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that?

(pointing to Dourlinski) and you are in the right; for he is a dotard, and ſhe is beautiful! Come—inform me of every thing."</p>
            <p>I now diſcover my own name to Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſican, that of Lodoiska's father, and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery particular that had occurred to me until that moment. It belongs to Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iska, I obſerve in concluſion, to make us acquainted with what ſhe has been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſuffer from the infamous Dourlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski, ever ſince ſhe has been in his caſtle!</p>
            <p>"You know," replies Lodoiska, "that my father obliged me to leave Warſaw, on the day that the Diet was opened. He firſt conducted me to the territories of the Palatine of—, at only twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leagues diſtance from the capital, to which he returned, on purpoſe to aſſiſt at the meeting of the ſtates.</p>
            <p>"On that very day when M. de P.— was proclaimed king, Pulaski took me from the caſtle of the Palatine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me here, thinking that I ſhould be better concealed. He charged Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linski to guard me with, extraordinary ſtrictneſs; and, above all things, to take eſpecial care to prevent Lovzinski from diſcovering the place of my retreat.

to aſſemble and encourage the good citizens to defend his country, and to puniſh traitors. Alas! theſe important avocations have made him forget his daughter, for I have never ſeen him ſince.</p>
            <p>"A few days after his departure, I began to perceive that the viſits of Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linski had become more frequent than uſual; in a ſhort time, he hardly ever quitted the apartment aſſigned me for a priſon. He deprived me, under ſome trifling pretext, of the only female attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant whom my father had left me; and to prevent any perſon (as he ſaid) from knowing that I was in his caſtle, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf brought me the food neceſſary for my ſubſiſtence, and paſſed whole days along with me. You cannot conceive, my dear Lovzinski, how much I ſuffered from the continual preſence of a man, who was odious to me, and whoſe infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous deſigns I was ſuſpicious of: he even dared to explain himſelf to me one day: but I aſſured him that my hate ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be the price of his tenderneſs, and that his unworthy conduct had drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him my ſovereign contempt.</p>
            <p>"He anſwered me coldly, that in time I ſhould accuſtom myſelf to ſee him, and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:037849_0030_100F84D4D75C1A40"/>
to ſuffer his aſſiduities; nay, he did not in the leaſt alter his uſual conduct, for he entered my chamber in the morning, and never retired until night. Separated from all I loved, I had not even the feeble conſolation of being able to enjoy the ſweet recollection of paſt happineſs. A witneſs to my misfortunes, Dourlinski took pleaſure in augmenting them.</p>
            <p>"'Pulaski,' ſays he to me, 'com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a body of Poliſh troops; Lovzin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski betraying his country, which he does not love, and a woman concerning whom he is indifferent, ſerves in the Ruſſian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where he will be cut off during ſome bloody engagement: beſides, if he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives, it is evident that nothing can ever reconcile your father to him.'</p>
            <p>"A few days after, he came on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to announce to me, that Pulaski, during the night, had attacked the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians in their camp; and that, amidſt the confuſion that enſued, my lover had fallen by the hand of my father. The cruel Palatine even made me read a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of this event, drawn up with every appearance of the truth, in a kind of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic gazette, which doubtleſs he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to be printed expreſsly for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: beſides, on perceiving the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:037849_0030_100F84D4D75C1A40"/>
joy which he affected on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I thought the news but too true.</p>
            <p>"Pitileſs tyrant! cried I, you enjoy my tears and my deſpair; but ceaſe to perſecute me, or you will ſoon ſee that the daughter of Pulaski is herſelf able to avenge her own injuries!</p>
            <p>"One evening that he had left me ſooner than uſual, after I had retired to bed, I heard my door open very ſoftly. By the light of a lamp, which I kept al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways burning, I beheld my tyrant advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards my bed. As there was no crime of which I did not believe him to be capable, I had foreſeen this event; and I had even taken meaſures to render it unſucceſsful. I accordingly armed myſelf with a long ſharp knife, which I had the precaution to conceal beneath my pillow; I overwhelmed the wretch with the reproaches which he ſo juſtly merited; and I vowed, if he dared to advance, that I would poignard him with my own hand.</p>
            <p>"He retired, with ſurpriſe and affright viſibly delineated on his countenance: 'I am tired,' ſaid he as he went out, 'with experiencing nothing but ſcorn; and if I were not afraid of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, you ſhould ſoon perceive what a
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037849_0031_100F84D91E2BE850"/>
woman's arm could effect againſt mine! But I know a way of vanquiſhing your pride! By and by you will think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but too happy in being able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe your pardon, by the moſt humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſubmiſſions.'</p>
            <p>"He now withdrew. A few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after, his confident entered with a piſtol in his hand. I muſt however do him the juſtice to ſay, that he wept while he announced to me the orders of his lord.</p>
            <p>"'Dreſs yourſelf, madam; you muſt inſtantly follow me!'—This was all he was able to ſay to me.</p>
            <p>"He then conducted me to that very tower, where, without you, I ſhould this morning have periſhed: he ſhut me up in that horrible priſon; it was there that I had l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nguiſhed for more than a month, without fire, without the light of heaven, and almoſt without clothes; with bread and water for my food; for my bed a few truſſes of ſtraw: this was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate to which the only daughter of a grandee of Poland was reduced!</p>
            <p>"You ſhudder, brave ſtranger, and yet believe me, when I aſſure you, that I do not recount to you any more than a ſmall part of my ſufferings. One thing
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037849_0031_100F84D91E2BE850"/>
however, rendered my miſery leſs inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable: I no longer beheld my tyrant. While he expected with tranquility that I ſhould ſolicit my pardon, I paſſed whole days and nights in calling on the name of my father, and in bewailing my lover! * * * * * * * * * * * * * O Lovzinski! with what aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment was I ſeized; with what joy was my ſoul penetrated, on that day when I once more beheld you in the gardens of Dourlinski! * * * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>Titſican was liſtening to the ſtory of our misfortunes, with which he appeared to be deeply affected, when one of his centinels approached, and ſounded an alarm. He immediately left us in great haſte, on purpoſe to run to the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. We heard a great tumult, and began to preſage ſome inauſpicious event.</p>
            <p>While we remained plunged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,—"Lovzinski, Lodoiska, cowardly and perfidious pair!" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dourlinski, unable to contain his joy, —"you have hoped to be able to elude my vengeance, and eſcape my chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Tremble! you are once more about to fall into my hands. At the

the noiſe of my captivity and misfortunes, the neighbouring nobility are undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſembled, and have now come to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me."</p>
            <p>"—They can only revenge you, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain!" cries Boleſlas, interrupting him in the midſt of his threats, and ſeizing at the ſame time an iron bar, with which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to knock him down; I, however, inſtantly interpoſed and prevented him from executing this act of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Titſican returned in a few minutes: "It is only a falſe alarm," ſaid he to us; "it is nothing more than a ſmall detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I diſpatched yeſterday, on purpoſe to ſcour the country—they had orders to rejoin me here; and they have brought me ſome priſoners: every thing is quiet, and the neighbourhood does not appear to be in the leaſt commotion."</p>
            <p>While Titſican yet ſpoke to me, a number of unfortunates, whoſe luckleſs fate had delivered them into the hands of the enemy, were dragged before him. We firſt beheld five, who b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

great difficulty, and that was the reaſon why he was bound hand and foot!</p>
            <p>The ſixth now appeared: "O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! it is my father!" exclaims Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iska, running at the ſame time towards him—I, too, threw myſelf at the feet of Pulaski. "Are you Pulaski?" ſays the Tartar chieftain, "'tis well; the event is lucky! Believe me, my friend, it is no more than an hour ſince I firſt heard of you.

the meaſure of your crimes, that you ſhould league with robbers!"</p>
            <p>"With robbers!" cries Titſican— "with robbers indeed, if it ſo pleaſe you to call us: but you yourſelf muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that deſcription of people to be good for ſomething; for without me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, your daughter, by to-morrow's ſun, would no longer have been a maiden! Be not alarmed," ſaid he, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me: "but I know that he is proud, and I therefore am not angry."</p>
            <p>We had by this time placed Pulaski in a chair; his daughter and myſelf bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his manacles with our tears; but he ſtill continued to frown at and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm me with reproaches.</p>
            <p>"What can you wiſh for?" cries the Tartar, once more addreſſing his captive: "I tell you that Lovzinski is a brave man, whom I intend to ſee married; and as for your Dourlinski, he is a rogue, whom I am about to order to be hanged.</p>
            <p>"I repeat to you once more, that you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are more <hi>hot-headed</hi> than us three put together. But hear me, and let us finiſh thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that you will be ſincerely reconciled to Lovzinſki, and give your daughter to him for a wife, I will reſtore you to your liberty."</p>
            <p>"He who can brave death," replies the haughty Pulaſki, "can ſupport ſlavery. My daughter ſhall never be the wife of a traitor."</p>
            <p>"Do you love better that ſhe ſhould be a Tartar's miſtreſs?—If you do not promiſe to give her, within the ſpace of eight days, to this brave man, I myſelf ſhall eſpouſe her this very night! When I am weary of you and of her, I will ſell you to the Turks. Your daughter is handſome enough to find admittance into the <hi>haram</hi> of a baſhaw: and you yourſelf may perhaps ſuperintend the kitchen of ſome janiſſary."</p>
            <p>"My life is in your hands; do with it whatſoever you pleaſe. If Pulaſki falls beneath the ſword of a Tartar, he will be lamented, and even his enemies will agree that he merits a more glorious deſtiny: but if he were to conſent: No! no! I rather choſe—I prefer death!"</p>
            <p>"I do not deſire your death! I wiſh only that Lovzinſki ſhould eſpouſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka.—What!—Shall my priſoner

give the law to me? By my ſabre!—this dog of a Chriſtian—but I am in the wrong he is furious, and is aſſuredly deprived of his reaſon."</p>
            <p>I now beheld the Tartar's eyes ſparkle with fury, and therefore recalled to his memory the promiſe he had made me, that he would not give way to his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>"Undoubtedly! but this man wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries out the patience of a favourite of our prophet! I am but a robber!—Yet Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſki, I repeat it to you again, that it is my command that Lovzinſki eſpouſe your daughter. By my ſabre, he has fairly gained her; but for him ſhe had been burnt laſt night."</p>
            <p>"But for him?"</p>
            <p>"Yes! Behold thoſe ruins; there ſtood a tower in that place; it was on fire, and no perſon dared to aſcend it: he, however, mounted the ſtair-caſe, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Boleſlas—and they ſaved your daughter."</p>
            <p>"Was my daughter in that tower?"</p>
            <p>"Yes! that hoary villian had confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her there; that hoary villian, who attempted to violate her?—Some of you muſt relate the whole to him; but make haſte, as it is neceſſary he ſhould decide

inſtantly; I have buſineſs elſewhere, for I do not intend that your militia<note n="*" place="bottom">The troops ſtationed on purpoſe to watch over the ſafety of the frontiers of Podolia and Volhuia, and preſerve them from the incurſions of the Tartars, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Quartuaires.</note> ſhall ſurpriſe me here: it is otherwiſe in the plains; there I ſhould laugh at them."</p>
            <p>While Titſican ordered the rich booty which he had taken, to be ſtowed in little covered waggons, Lodoiska informed her father of the crimes of Dourlinski, and mingled the recital of our affection ſo artfully with the hiſtory of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, that nature and gratitude at one and the ſame time began to beſiege the heart of Pulaski.</p>
            <p>Affected in the moſt lively manner with the misfortunes of his daughter, and ſenſible of the important ſervices which I had rendered her, he embraces Lodoiska, and at length beholding me without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, he ſeemed to wait impatiently for an opportunity to be reconciled to me.</p>
            <p>"O Pulaski!" I exclaim, "you whom Heaven hath left me, on purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole me for the loſs of the beſt of fathers;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037849_0035_100F84E39225C080"/>
you for whom I have an equal friendſhip and veneration; why haſt thou condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thy children unheared? Why haſt thou ſuppoſed a man who adores thy daughter, guilty of the moſt horrible treaſon?</p>
            <p>"When my vows were offered up in favour of that prince who now fills the throne, I ſwear to you Pulaski, by her whom I love ſo tenderly, that I looked upon his elevation to be an event highly auſpicious to the happineſs, the ſafety, and the proſperity of my country.</p>
            <p>"The misfortunes which my youth did not foreſee, thy experience had anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but becauſe I have been wanting in prudence, ought you to accuſe me of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy? Ought you to have reproached me for loving my friend? Can you now look upon it as a crime, that I ſtill give him my eſteem? For the three laſt months, I have beheld the misfortunes of my country in the ſame point of view as your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: like you, I have mourned over them; but I am ſure that the king is ſtill igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their extent, and I ſhall go to Warſaw on purpoſe to inform him of all that I have ſeen."</p>
            <p>Pulaſki here interrupts me:— "It is not there that you ought to repair: you
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037849_0035_100F84E39225C080"/>
tell me that M. de P*** is not informed of the wrong done to his native country, and I believe you: but whether he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, or whether he is entirely ignorant of them is now but of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Inſolent foreigners, cantoned throughout our provinces, ſtrive to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves in the republic, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the king, whom they have cauſed to be elected. It is no longer in the power of an impotent or a mal-content king, to chaſe the Ruſſians from my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try!</p>
            <p>"Let us truſt only to ourſelves, Lovzin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſki; and let us either avenge our country, or die in her defence. I have aſſembled 4000 noble Poles in the palatine of Lublin, who wait for the return of their general, to march againſt the Ruſſians: fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to my camp—on this condition I am your friend and my daughter ſhall be your wife!"</p>
            <p>Pulaſki, I am ready to obey you: I ſwear to follow your fortunes, and to participate in your dangers. And think not that it is Lodoiſka alone, who has exacted from me this oath; I ſwear by her, and before you, that the enemies of the republic have always been, and ſhall never ceaſe to be mine; I ſwear that I
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037849_0036_100F851592F272D8"/>
will ſpill the very laſt drop of my blood, to chaſe thoſe foreigners out of Poland, who reign there in the name of its king!"</p>
            <p>"Embrace me Lovzinſki! I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſe you; I adopt you for my ſon-in-law—My children, all our misfortunes are at an end!"</p>
            <p>Polaſki deſired me to unite my hand to Lodoiſka's, in token of our union; and we were embracing the brave palantine at the very moment that Titſican re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
            <p>"Good! good!" exclaims the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: this is what I wiſhed; I am fond of marriages, Father, I ſhall inſtantly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you to be unbound.</p>
            <p>"By my ſabre!" adds the Tartar, while his followers were cutting the cords with which the hands and feet of Pulaſki were tied; "by my ſabre! I ſhall do a noble action, but it will coſt me a world of wealth! Two grandees of Poland! a beautiful maiden! They would have produced me a ranſom!"</p>
            <p>"Titſican, ſuch a thought is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of you!" ſays Pulaſki, interrupting him.</p>
            <p>"No! no!" rejoins the Tartar, "it is a mere reflection only—it is one of thoſe ideas which a robber cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:037849_0036_100F851592F272D8"/>
My brave and unfortunate friends, I demand nothing from you—nay, more, you ſhall not retire on foot; I have ſome charming horſes, with which I intend to preſent you.—And, for this lady, if you pleaſe, I will give you a litter, on which I myſelf have been carried for theſe laſt ten or twelve days. This young man here had given me ſuch a wound, that I could no longer ſit on horſeback.—The litter is indeed a bad one, clumſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, by means of branches of trees; but I have nothing except that or a little covered waggon, to offer you: chooſe which ever of them you pleaſe."</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Dourlinſki, who had not as yet uttered a ſingle word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with his eyes fixed on the ground, while an air of conſternation was ſpread ever his countenance.</p>
            <p>"Unworthy friend!" ſays Pulaſki to him, "how could you ſo cruelly abuſe the confidence I repoſed in you? Were you not afraid to expoſe yourſelf to my reſentment? What demon blinded you!"</p>
            <p>"Love!" replies Dourlinſki, "an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous love! You, perhaps, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to what exceſs the paſſions may hurry on a man, violent and jealous by nature. This frightful example, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037849_0037_100F79AC8A1A97F8"/>
ought to teach you, that a daughter ſo charming as yours is a treaſure which one ought not to entruſt to any perſon.</p>
            <p>"Pulaski, I have indeed, merited your hatred: but I am ſtill worthy of your pity. I have rendered myſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly culpable; but you behold me cruelly puniſhed. I loſe, in one ſingle day, my rank, my riches, my honor, my liberty! more than all this, I loſe thy daughter!</p>
            <p>"O, Lodoiska! lovely maiden, whom I have ſo much outraged, will you deign to forget my perſecutions, your danger, and your grief? Will you deign to grant me a generous pardon?</p>
            <p>"Ah! if there are no crimes which a ſincere repentance cannot expiate, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiska, I am no longer criminal. I would I were able at the price of all my blood, to redeem thoſe tears which I have occaſioned you to ſhed.

            <p>Lodoiska, without the leaſt diſtruſt, now leaves my ſide, and advances towards him without ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>At that very moment I beheld a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard glittering in the hand of Dourlinski!</p>
            <p>I precipitate myſelf upon him.—It was too late; for I could only parry the ſecond thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Pulaſki, furious at the horrid treaſon, drew his ſabre quick as lightning, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to avenge his daughter's fate.</p>
            <p>"No! no!" exclaims the Tartar, at the ſame time withholding his arm, "you are about to make this wretch ſuffer too gentle a death!"</p>
            <p>"It is well, "ſays the infamous aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, addreſſing himſelf to me, and at the ſame time contemplating his victim with a cruel joy. "Lovzinſki you appeared but now eager to be united with Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſka; why do you not follow her? Go,

            <p>Dourlinſki was not allowed to utter another ſentence, for the Tartars ruſhed in upon him and threw him into the midſt of the burning ruins. * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>What a night! how many different cares, how many oppoſite ſentiments, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated my unhappy mind during its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance! How many times did I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the ſucceſſive emotions of fear, hope, grief and joy! After ſo many dangers and inquietudes, Lodoiska was at length preſented to me by her father, and I was intoxicated with the dear hope of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her: a barbarian had but now aſſaſſinated her in my preſence.</p>
            <p>This was the moſt cruel and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate moment of any during the whole courſe of my life!—But my happineſs, eclipſed, as it were, in a ſingle inſtant, was not long in ſhining forth with all its former ſplendor.</p>

               </gap>famous Dourlinski, conſtrained by his chains, and blinded by his deſpair, had happily been prevented from giving any other than an ill directed blow.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Titſican was informed that the life of Lodoiska was not in any danger, he prepared to take leave of us.</p>
            <p>"I leave you," ſaid he, "the five do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics who accompanied Pulaski; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for ſeveral days, arms, ſix excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent horſes, two covered waggons, and the people belonging to Dourlinski in chains. Their baſe lord is no more: Adieu! the day is about to appear; do not leave this place until to-morrow; I ſhall then viſit the other cantons. Adieu, brave Poles, tell to your countrymen that Titſican is not ſo bad as he has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them, and that he ſometimes reſtores with one hand what he takes with another. Adieu!"</p>
            <p>At theſe words he lifts his hand to his head, and having ſaluted us graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the manner of his country, he gives the ſignal to depart: the Tartars mount their fleet courſers in an inſtant,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037849_0039_100F84E661ABF6F0"/>
paſs along the draw-bridge, and make for the neighbouring plain at a full gallop.</p>
            <p>They had been gone ſcarcely two hours, when ſeveral of the neighbouring nobility, ſupported by a detachment of militia, came on purpoſe to inveſt the caſtle of Dourlinſki.</p>
            <p>Pulaſki himſelf went out to receive them: he related the particulars of all that had occurred; and ſome, gained over by his eloquence, promiſed to follow us to the palatinate of Lublin.</p>
            <p>They aſked for only two days to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare every thing neceſſary for the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and actually came and rejoined us at the appointed time, to the number of ſixty.</p>
            <p>Lodoiſka having aſſured us that ſhe was now able to undergo the fatigues of a journey, we placed her in a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous carriage, which we had luckily been able to procure for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After having reſtored Dourlinſki's people to liberty, we abandon the two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered waggons to them, in which Titſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, acting with his uſual generoſity, had left part of his immenſe booty: this we divided among them in equal proportions.</p>
            <p>We arrived, without meeting with any accident, at Polowiſk, in the Palatinate
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037849_0039_100F84E661ABF6F0"/>
of Lublin, this being the place which Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſki had appointed for the general ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous. The news of his return hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone abroad, a croud of mal-contents in the ſpace of leſs than a month, flocked to, and increaſed our little army to ſuch a degree, that we ſoon found it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to no leſs than 10,000 men.</p>
            <p>Lodoiſka entirely cured of her wound, and perfectly recovered from her fatigues, had regained her uſual ſpirits, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in poſſeſſion of all her former beauty. Pulaſki one day called me into his tent, and ſpoke as follows. "Three thouſand Ruſſians have appeared, as you well know, upon the heights above, and at no greater diſtance than half a league from us: take, in the courſe of the enſuing night, three thouſand choſen men, and go and chaſe the enemy from the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous poſts which they now occupy. Recollect that on the ſucceſs of a firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt depends almoſt always that of the campaign; recollect that you are about to avenge your country's wrongs; recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect too, my friend, that to-morrow I ſhall learn thy victory, and that to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row alſo thou ſhalt eſpouſe Lodoiſka!"</p>
            <p>I began my march about ten o'clock. At midnight we ſurpriſed our enemies in
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037849_0040_100F84EA2745E4E0"/>
their camp. Never was a defeat more complete: we killed ſeven hundred men; we took nine hundred priſoners; we ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed all their cannon, the military cheſt, and the ammunition.</p>
            <p>At break of day Pulaſki marched out to join me with the remainder of the troops: he brought Lodoiſka along with him: we were married in Pulaſki's tent. All the camp reſounded with ſongs of gladneſs: valour and beauty were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in joyous epithalamiums: it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the feſtival of Venus and Mars; and it might be truly ſaid, that every ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier appeared to be impreſſed with the ſame ſentiments as myſelf, and that they all partook of my happineſs.</p>
            <p>After I had given up the firſt days of ſo dear an union entirely to love, I began to think of recompenſing the heroic fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Boleſlas. My father-in-law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with one of his caſtles, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at ſome leagues from the capital; and Lodoiſka and myſelf added to this princely donation, a conſiderable ſum of ready money, on purpoſe to enable him to lead an independent and tranquil life.</p>
            <p>He firſt refuſed to leave us; but we commanded him to go and take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his caſtle, and live peaceably in
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:037849_0040_100F84EA2745E4E0"/>
that honourable retreat which his ſervices had ſo amply merited. On the day of his departure I took him aſide: "You muſt go in my name," ſaid I, "and wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our monarch at Warſaw: inform him that I am united in the bonds of Hymen to the daughter of Pulaſki: ſtate to him that I am armed on purpoſe to chaſe out of his kingdom thoſe foreigners who are ravaging it; and tell him, in particular, that Lovzinſki, a foe to the Ruſſians, is not the enemy of his king."</p>
            <p>The recital of our operations during eight ſucceeding years of bloody war would be unintereſting. Sometimes van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed; much oftener victorious; equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great in the midſt of a defeat, as formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable after a victory, and always ſuperior to events, Pulaſki attracted and fixed the attention of all Europe, whom he aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his long and vigorous reſiſtance. Obliged to abandon one province, he made incurſions into, and performed new prodigies of valour in another: and it was thus, that, in marching ſucceſſively thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the palatinates, he ſignalized in each of them, by ſome glorious exploit, that eternal hatred which he had ſworn againſt the enemies of Poland.</p>
            <p>Wife of a warrior, daughter of a hero,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:037849_0041_100F84ECF7CA5558"/>
accuſtomed to the tumult of a camp, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka accompanied us every where. Of five children which ſhe had borne me, an only daughter remained to us, about eighteen months old. One day, after a moſt obſtinate engagement, the victorious Ruſſians precipitated themſelves towards my tent, on purpoſe to plunder it. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſki and myſelf, followed by ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, flew to the defence of Lodoiſka, whom we ſaved with difficulty; my daughter, however, had been carried off.</p>
            <p>This lovely child, by a ſage precaution which her mother had wiſely made uſe of in thoſe times of inteſtine commotion, had the arms of our family impreſſed, by means of a chemical preparation, under her left breaſt: but my ſearch after my daughter has hitherto been ineffectual.— Alas! Dorliſka, my dear Dorliſka, either exiſts in ſlavery, or exiſts no more!</p>
            <p>This loſs affected me with the moſt lively ſorrow. Pulaſki, however, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt inſenſible to my misfortunes; either becauſe his mind was occupied at this moment with the great project which he ſoon after communicated to me, or becauſe the miſeries of his country alone could affect his ſtoic heart. He, as uſual, re-aſſembles the remains of his army,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037849_0041_100F84ECF7CA5558"/>
takes poſſeſſion of an advantageous poſt, employs ſeveral days in fortifying, and maintains himſelf in it for three whole months, againſt all the efforts of the Ruſſians.</p>
            <p>It, however became at length neceſſary that he ſhould abandon this ſituation, as proviſions were beginning to be ſcarce. Pulaſki, on this occaſion, came to my tent; and having ordered every one to retire, when he alone remained, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed me as follows:</p>
            <p>"Lovzinſki, I have juſt reaſon for complaining of your conduct. Formerly you ſupported, along with me, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of command, and I was enabled to divide with my ſon-in-law a part of my laborious avocations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, for theſe two laſt months, you do nothing but weep; you ſigh like a woman! You hate aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned me in a critical moment, when your aſſiſtance was become the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary! You ſee how I am attacked on all ſides; I fear not for myſelf; I am not unhappy for my own life: but if we periſh, the ſtate has no longer any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
            <p>"Awake, Lovzinſki! how nobly you once participated in my cares! Do not now remain the uſeleſs witneſs of them.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037849_0042_100F84EEB5E8DB88"/>
We are indeed bathed in Ruſſian blood: our fellow citizens are avenged; but they are not ſaved: nay, even in a ſhort time we may be able no longer to defend them."</p>
            <p>"You aſtoniſh me, Pulaſki! Whence theſe ſiniſter auguries?"</p>
            <p>"I am not alarmed without reaſon. Conſider our preſent poſition: I am forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to awaken in every heart the love of its country; I have found no where but degenerate men born for ſlavery, or weak ones, who, although penetrated with a ſenſe of their misfortunes, have bounded all their views to barren complaints.</p>
            <p>"Some true citizens are indeed, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged under my ſtandards; but eight long and bloody campaigns have leſſened their number, and almoſt extinguiſhed them. I become enfeebled by my very victories; our enemies appear more numerous after their defeats."</p>
            <p>"I repeat to you, Pulaſki, once more, that you aſtoniſh me! In circumſtances no leſs diſaſtrous, no leſs unhappy, than the preſent, I have beheld you ſuſtain yourſelf by your courage. * * *</p>
            <p>"Do you think that it now abandons me? True valour does not conſiſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blind to danger, but in brav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for my defeat; however if you chooſe, Lovzinſki, the very day which they point out for their triumph ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be deſtined to record their ruin, and achieve the ſafety of our fellow-citizens!"</p>
            <p>"If I chooſe! Can you doubt my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents? Speak! what would you have done?"</p>
            <p>"To ſtrike the boldeſt ſtroke that I ever meditated! Forty choſen men are aſſembled at Czenſtachow along with Kaluvſki, whoſe bravery is well known; they want a chief, able, firm, intrepid— It is you whom I have choſen."</p>
            <p>"Pulaſki, I am ready."</p>
            <p>"I will not diſſemble to you the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the enterprize; the event is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and if you do not ſucceed, your ruin is inevitable."</p>
            <p>"I tell you that I am ready, therefore explain yourſelf."</p>
            <p>"You are not ignorant, that ſcarce four thouſand men now fight under my command: with theſe undoubtedly I have ſtill an opportunity of tormenting our enemies; but with ſuch feeble means I dare not hope to be ever able to force them to leave our provinces. All the nobility would flock beneath our banners, if the king were in my camp."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:037849_0043_100F84F1A80E5948"/>"What do you ſay? Can you hope that the king would ever conſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair hither?"</p>
            <p>"No: but he muſt be forced to do ſo."</p>
            <p>"Forced!"</p>
            <p>"Yes! I know that an ancient friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip connects you with M. de P—: but ſince you have ſupported, along with Pulaſki, the cauſe of liberty, you know alſo that you ought to ſacrifice every thing to the good of your country; that an intereſt ſo ſacred—"</p>
            <p>"I know my duty, and I am ready to fulfil it; but what is it that you now propoſe to me? The king never leaves Warſaw."</p>
            <p>"True; and it is, therefore, at War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that you muſt go and find him: it is from the heart of the capital that he muſt be forced."</p>
            <p>"What preparations have you made for ſo great an enterprize?"</p>
            <p>"You behold you Ruſſian army, three times as ſtrong as mine, and which has been encamped three months in ſight of us: its General, tranquil at preſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his entrenchments, impatiently waits until, forced by famine, I ſhall ſurrender myſelf at diſcretion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:037849_0043_100F84F1A80E5948"/>"Behind my camp are marſhes which he thinks impracticable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the moment it is night, we ſhall traverſe them. I have diſpoſed of every thing in ſuch a manner that the enemy will be deceived, and not perceive my retreat until it is too late. I hope therefore to be able to ſteal more than an hour's march upon them, and if fortune ſeconds me, perhaps a whole day. I ſhall advance ſtraight forward to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw by the great road that leads to the capital, notwithſtanding the efforts of the little Ruſſian bands who hover continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in its neighbourhood. I ſhall either encounter and conquer theſe ſeparately, or, if they form a junction on purpoſe to ſtop my progreſs, I ſhall at leaſt be able to occupy their attention in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they will not be able to impede your operations.</p>
            <p>"In the mean time, Lovzinſki, you will have preceded me. Your forty fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers diſguiſed, and armed only with ſabres, poniards and piſtols concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their clothes, ſhall have arrived at Warſaw by different roads. You muſt wait there until the king has left his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace; you are then to carry him off, and to bring him to my camp.

If you are vanquiſhed, if you are taken priſoner, you will periſh, Lovzinſki, but you will periſh a martyr to liberty! and Pulaſki, jealous of ſo glorious an end, ſighing at being obliged to ſurvive you, ſhall ſend Ruſſians, thouſands of Ruſſians to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you to the tomb!</p>
            <p>"But on the contrary, if an all-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Deity; if a God, the protector of Poland, has inſpired me with this hardy project to terminate her evils; if thy good fortune ſhall procure a ſucceſs equal to thy courage, what a glorious proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be achieved by means of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble daring!</p>

            <p>Pulaſki kept his word. That very night he accompliſhed his retreat, with equal ſkill and ſucceſs, by traverſing the marſhes in profound ſilence.—"My friend," ſaid my father-in-law to me, as ſoon as we were out of the reach of the enemy, "it is now time that you ſhould leave us. I know well that my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has more courage than another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but ſhe is a tender wife, and an unfortunate mother. Her tears will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you, and you will loſe in her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces that ſtrength of mind, that dignity of ſoul, which now becomes more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to you than ever: I adviſe you, therefore, to be gone, without bidding her farewel."</p>
            <p>Pulaſki preſſed me, but in vain, for I was unable to conſent. As ſoon as Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka knew that I ſhould depart alone, and perceived that we were reſolved not to inform her whither, ſhe ſhed torrents of tears, and ſtrove to detain me. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to heſitate.</p>
            <p>Lovzinſki, cries my father-in-law at this critical moment, Lovzinſki, depart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wife, children, relations, all ought to be
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037849_0045_100F84F75174CBB8"/>
ſacrificed, when it is neceſſary for the ſalvation of your country.</p>
            <p>I inſtantly mount my horſe, and make ſuch haſte, that I arrive by the middle of next day at Czenſtachow. I here found forty brave men waiting for me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for the moſt hazardous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen," ſaid I to them, "we are now met on purpoſe to carry a king out of the midſt of his own capital.— Thoſe capable of attempting ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, are alone capable of effecting it: either ſucceſs or death awaits on us!"</p>
            <p>After this ſhort harrangue we prepare to depart. Kaluvſki, forewarned of our deſign, had already procured twelve wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, loaded with hay and ſtraw, each of which was drawn by four good horſes.</p>
            <p>We inſtantly diſguiſe ourſelves as pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants; we hide our clothes, our ſabres, out piſtols, and the ſaddles of our horſes, in the hay with which our waggons were partly filled; we agree upon certain ſigns, and I give them a <hi>watch-word,</hi> to be uſed according to circumſtances. Twelve of the conſpirators, commanded by Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvſki, enter into Warſaw, accompanied by as many waggons, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conduct. I divide the reſt of my
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:037849_0045_100F84F75174CBB8"/>
little troop into ſeveral brigades, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to avoid ſuſpicion: each is ordered to march at ſome diſtance from the other, and to gain the capital by different gates.</p>
            <p>We depart, and on Saturday the 2d of November, 1771, arrive at Warſaw, and lodge together at a convent belonging to the Dominicans.</p>
            <p>On the next day, which was Sunday, and which will for ever form a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble epoch in the annals of Poland, one of my people of the name of Stravinſki, being covered with rags, places himſelf near the collegiate church, and ſoon after proceeds demanding charity even at tho gates of the royal palace, where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves every thing that paſſed. Several of the conſpirators walked up and down the fix narrow ſtreets, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the great ſquare, where Kaluvſki and myſelf were poſted. We remain in ambuſcade during the whole day, and part of the afternoon.</p>
            <p>At ſix o'clock at night the king leaves the palace; he is followed, and is ſeen to enter the hotel of his uncle, the grand chancellor of Lithunia.</p>
            <p>All our followers receive notice of this event, and aſſemble inſtantly: they throw off their miſerable cloaths, ſaddle
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037849_0046_100F84FB61637088"/>
their horſes, and prepare their arms, in the large ſquare belonging to the convent, where their movements are entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. They then ſally forth, one after the other, under favour of the night. Too well known in Warſaw to hazard appearing there, without diſguiſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I ſtill wear my peaſant's dreſs, and I mount an excellent horſe, capariſoned, however, after the common manner.</p>
            <p>I then point out my followers the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent poſts in the ſuburbs, which I had aſſigned them before our departure from the convent, and they were diſperſed in ſuch a manner, that all the avenues to the palace of the grand chancellor were carefully and ſtrictly guarded.</p>
            <p>Between nine and ten o'clock at night, the king comes forth on purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home; and we remark, with joy, that his attendants were far from being numerous.</p>
            <p>The carriage was preceded by two men, who carried <hi>flambeaux,</hi> ſome offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his ſuit, two gentlemen and an eſquire followed. I know not what was the name of the grandee in the coach along with the king. There were two pages, one to each door, two hay dukes running by the ſide of the equipage, and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:037849_0046_100F84FB61637088"/>
three footmen, in the royal livery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
            <p>The king proceeds ſlowly: part of my people aſſemble at ſome diſtance; twelve of the moſt determined ſpring forward: I put myſelf at their head, and we advance at a good pace.</p>
            <p>As there was a Ruſſian garriſon at that very moment in Warſaw, we effect to ſpeak the language of thoſe foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo that our petty troop might be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for one of their patroles.</p>
            <p>We overtake the carriage at about a hundred and fifty paces from the grand chancellor's palace, and exactly between thoſe of the biſhop of Cracow and of the late grand general of Poland.</p>
            <p>All of a ſudden we paſs the heads of the foremoſt horſes, ſo that thoſe who preceded, found themſelves ſeparated from thoſe who ſurrounded the royal equipage.</p>
            <p>I inſtantly give the ſignal agreed upon. Kaluvſki gallops up, with the remainder of the conſpirators: I preſent a piſtol to the poſtilion, who inſtantly ſtops; the coachmen is fired upon, and preci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itated beneath the wheels. Of the two hay-dukes who endeavoured to defend their prince, one drops, pierced with two
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037849_0047_100F84FDA3E671E8"/>
balls; the other is overturned by means of a backhanded ſtroke from a ſabre, which he receives on the head; the ſteed belonging to the eſquire falls down cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with wounds; one of the pages is diſmounted, and his horſe taken; piſtol-balls fly about in all directions—in ſhort, the attack was ſo hot, and the fire ſo violent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I trembled for the king's life.</p>
            <p>He himſelf, however, preſerving the utmoſt coolneſs in the midſt of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, had now deſcended from his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and was ſtriving to regain his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's palace on foot. Kaluvſki arreſts and ſeizes him by the hair; ſeven or eight of the conſpirators ſurround, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm, overpower him, and, preſſing him between their horſes, make off at a full gallop towards the end of the ſtreet.</p>
            <p>During this moment, I confeſs that I thought Pulaſki had baſely deceived me; that the death of the monarch was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon, and that a plot had been formed to aſſaſſinate him.</p>
            <p>All of a ſudden I form my reſolves; I clap ſpurs to my horſe, overtake the little band, cry out to them to ſtop, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to kill the firſt perſon who ſhould dare to diſobey me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:037849_0047_100F84FDA3E671E8"/>That God who is the protector of good kings, watched over the ſafety of M. de P—! Kaluvſki and his followers ſtop at the ſound of my well known voice. We mount the king on horſeback, make off at full ſpeed, and regain the ditch that ſurrounded the city, which the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch is conſtrained to leap, in company with us.</p>
            <p>At that moment a panic terror takes poſſeſſion of my troop; at fifty paces diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from the ramparts, there were no more than ſeven who ſurrounded the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the king.</p>
            <p>The night was dark and rainy, and it was neceſſary to diſmount every inſtant, on purpoſe to ſound the moraſs with which we were ſurrounded.</p>
            <p>The horſe on which the monarch rode fell twice, and broke his leg at the ſecond fall; during theſe violent move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his majeſty loſt his <hi>peliſſe,</hi> and the ſhoe belonging to his left foot.</p>
            <p>"If you wiſh that I ſhould follow you, (ſays he to us) you muſt furniſh me with another horſe and a pair of boots."</p>
            <p>We remount him once more, and, on purpoſe to gain the road by which Pulaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki had promiſed me to advance, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to paſs through a village called
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037849_0048_100F85005C89FFF0"/>
Burakow; but the king exclaims, "Do not go that way; there are Ruſſians there!"</p>
            <p>I immediately change our <hi>route</hi>; but in proportion as we advance through the wood of Beliany, our number continues to diminiſh. In a ſhort time, I perceive nobody around me but Kaluvſki and Stravinſki: a few minutes after, we are challenged by a Ruſſian centinel on horſehack, at whoſe voice we inſtantly ſtop, greatly alarmed for our ſafety.</p>
            <p>"Let us kill him!" cries the ferocious Kaluvſki, pointing to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly avow to him, without diſguiſe, the horror which ſuch a propoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired me with. "Very well, you may then take upon you the taſk of conducting him," adds this cruel hearted man who immediately after precipitates himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woods. Stravinſki follows him, and I alone remain with the king.</p>
            <p>"Lovzinſk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>," ſays he, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me, as ſoon as they were out of ſight; "it is you, I can no longer doubt it; it is you, for I well remember your voice!" I utter not a ſingle word in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. He then mildly adds, "It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you Lovzinſki! Who would have thought this ten years ago?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:037849_0048_100F85005C89FFF0"/>We find ourſelves at that moment near to the convent of Beliany, diſtant no more than a ſingle league from War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw.</p>
            <p>"Lovzinſki," continues the king, "per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to enter this convent, and ſave yourſelf."</p>
            <p>"You muſt follow me," was my only anſwer.</p>
            <p>"It is in vain," rejoins the monarch, "that you are diſguiſed; it is in vain that you endeavour to aſſume a feigned voice: I know you well, I am fully aſſured that you are Lovzinſki: ah, who would have ſaid ſo ten years ſince? You would then have loſt your life, on condition of preſerving that of your friend."</p>
            <p>His majeſty now ceaſes to ſpeak; we advance ſome time, in profound ſilence, which he again breaking, exclaims. "I am overcome with fatigue—<hi>if you wiſh to carry me alive, permit me to repoſe myſelf for a ſingle moment.</hi>"</p>
            <p>I aſſiſt him to deſcend from his horſe; he ſits down upon the graſs, and making me ſit down by his ſide, he takes one of my hands and preſſes it between his own:</p>
            <p>"Lovzinſki, you whom I have ſo
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:037849_0049_100F8503727340B0"/>
much loved, you who know better than any one the purity of my intentions, how comes it obout that you have taken up arms againſt me? Ungrateful Lovzinſki! ſhall I never find you but amongſt my moſt bitter enemies? Do you return but on purpoſe to ſacrifice me?"</p>
            <p>He then, in the moſt affecting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, recapitulates the pleaſure, of our early youth; our more intimate connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at an age approaching to manhood, the tender friendſhip which we had ſworn to each other, and the regard which he had ever treated me with ſince that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. He ſpoke to me of the honours with which he would have loaded me du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his reign, if I had been ambitious to merit them: he reproached me more particularly reſpecting the unworthy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of which I appeared to be the leader, but of which, he ſaid, he was well aſſured that I was no more than the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>He threw all the horror of the plot upon Pulaſki, repreſenting to me, at the ſame time, that the author of ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was not the ſole culpable perſon; that I could not charge myſelf with its execution without committing a crime; and that this odious complaiſance, ſo
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:037849_0049_100F8503727340B0"/>
highly treaſonable in a ſubject, was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more in a friend. He concluded by preſſing me to reſtore him to his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: "Fly," ſaid he to me; and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, if I encounter any of the Ruſſian patroles, I ſhall tell them that you have purſued an oppoſite road from that which you have taken."</p>
            <p>The king continued to preſs me with the moſt earneſt entreaties: his natural eloquence, augmented by the danger of his ſituation, carried perſuaſion to my heart, and awakened the moſt tender ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents there.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that I ſtaggered; I balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the circumſtance for ſome time in my own mind, but Pulaski at length tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed.</p>
            <p>I thought that I ſtill heard the fierce republican reproaching me with my puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity. The love of one's country has perhaps its fanaticiſm and its ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but if I was then culpable, I am ſtill ſo; I am more than ever perſuaded that in obliging the king to remount his horſe again, I performed an action that reflected honour on my patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>"Is it thus," ſays he to me, in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy accent, "that you reject the prayer addreſſed to you by a friend?
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:037849_0050_100F850782A19968"/>
that you refuſe the pardon offered to you by your king? Well then, let us be gone. I deliver myſelf up to my unhappy fate, or rather I abandon you to yours."</p>
            <p>We now re-commence our journey once more; but the entreaties of the monarch, his arguments, his reproaches, his very menaces, the ſtruggles which I felt within myſelf, effected me in ſuch a manner, that I no longer could diſcern my way. Wandering up and down the country, I kept no one certain road: after half an hour's fatigue we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at Marimont, and I was greatly alarmed at ſeeing us thus return towards Warſaw, inſtead of leaving it at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>At about a quarter of league beyond this, we unfortunately fell in with a party of Ruſſians. The king immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelf to the commanding offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and then inſtantly adds. "In the courſe of the preceding afternoon, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to bewilder myſelf during the chace; this good peaſant, whom you ſee here, inſiſted on my partaking a frugal repaſt in his cottage; but as I thought that I perceived ſome of the ſoldiers of Pulaski roaming in the neighbourhood, I was deſirous of returning to Warſaw immediately, and you will oblige me
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037849_0050_100F850782A19968"/>
much by inſtantly accompanying me thither.</p>
            <p>"As to you, my friend," continues he, turning at the ſame time towards me, "I am not at all ſorry that you have given yourſelf this uſeleſs trouble, for I am as much pleaſed at returning to my capital attended by theſe gentlemen (pointing at the ſame time to the eſcort) as in accompanying you any farther.— However, it would be improper that I ſhould leave you without any recompence; what are you deſirous of? Speak—I will grant you any favour which you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me!"</p>
            <p>It will be eaſy to conceive how much I was alarmed, for I was ſtill doubtful of the king's intentions. I endeavoured to diſcover the true meaning of his equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſcourſe, which muſt be either full of a bitter irony, or magnanimous addreſs. M. de P— left me for ſome time in this cruel uncertainty: "I behold you great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embarraſſed," continues he at length, with a gracious air; "you know not what to chooſe! Come then, my friend, embrace me: there is indeed more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or than profit in embracing a king (adds he with a ſmile;) however, it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that in my place, many monarchs
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:037849_0051_100F850A9752B7E8"/>
would not be at this moment ſo generous as myſelf!" On uttering theſe words, he inſtantly departs, leaving me penetrated with gratitude, and confounded with ſo much true greatneſs.</p>
            <p>However, the danger which the king had ſo generouſly relieved me from, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan every moment to aſſail me again. It was more than probable a great number of couriers expedited from Warſaw, had ſpread about on all ſides the aſtoniſhing news of the king's having been carried off. Already, without doubt, the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were warmly purſued. My remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dreſs might betray me in my flight, and if I once more fell into the hands of any of the Ruſſians, better informed of the circumſtance, all the efforts of the king would not be able to ſave me. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Pulaſki had obtained all the ſucceſs which he expected, he muſt ſtill be at a great diſtance: a journey of ten more leagues at leaſt remained for me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and my horſe was entirely ſpent with fatigue: I endeavoured however to ſpur him on, but he had not got five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces before he fell under me.</p>
            <p>A cavalier, well mounted, happened to paſs along the road by the ſide of me, at this very moment; he perceiving the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037849_0051_100F850A9752B7E8"/>
poor animal tumble down, and thinking to amuſe himſelf at the expence of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate peaſant, he began to banter me about my ſituation. Piqued at his buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonery, I reſolved to puniſh him for his raillery, and ſecure my own flight at one and the ſame time: I, therefore, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent one of my piſtols to his breaſt, and oblige him to ſurrender his own horſe to me: nay, I acknowledge to you, that forced by the peculiarity of my ſituation, I deſpoiled him even of his cloak, which being very large, hid all my rags beneath it, which otherwiſe might have diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. I then caſt my purſe full of gold at the feet of the aſtoniſhed traveller, and ſprang forward as faſt as my new horſe would carry me.</p>
            <p>Luckily for me, he was freſh and vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous. I dart forward twelve leagues, with all the ſwiftneſs of an arrow: at length I think I hear the firing of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and I inſtantly conjecture that my father-in-law was at hand, and was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in fighting the Ruſſians.</p>
            <p>I was not deceived—I arrive on the field of battle at the very moment when one of our regiments had given way. I inſtantly diſcover myſelf to the fugitives, and having rallied them beneath a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hill, I attack the enemies in flank, while Pulaski charged them in front with the remainder of his troops. Our manoeuvres were ſo well concerted, and ſo admirably executed, that the Ruſſians were entirely routed, after experiencing a terrible carnage.</p>
            <p>Pulaski deigned to attribute to me the honour of their defeat: "Ah!" cries he, embracing me, after hearing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of my expedition—"ah! if your forty followers had but equalled you in courage, the king would have been at this very moment in my camp! But the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does not will it. I am grateful, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that you have been preſerved to us; and I return you thanks for the important ſervice which you have rendered me: but for you, Kaluvski would have aſſinated the monarch, and my name would have been covered with an eternal oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium!</p>
            <p>"I might have been able," added he, "to have advanced two miles farther: but I rather choſe to take poſſeſſion of this reſpectable poſt, on account of the ſecurity of my camp. Yeſterday, in the courſe of my march, I ſurpriſed and cut to pieces a party of Ruſſians; this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I beat two more of their detachments
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:037849_0052_100F850D2E704E40"/>
—but another conſiderable corps having collected the remainder of the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, took advantage of the night, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to attack me. My ſoldiers, fatigued with the toil of a long march, and three ſucceeding engagements, began to fly; but victory returned to my camp at your approach. Let us entrench ourſelves here; we will wait for the Ruſſian army, and fight while we yet have a drop of blood remaining!"</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the camp reſounded with the cries of gladneſs, and our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoldiers mingled my praiſes with thoſe of Pulaski. At the noiſe of my name, repeated by a thouſand tongues, Lodoiska ran to her father's tent. She convinced me of the exceſs of her tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the exceſs of her joy at our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I was obliged once more to commence the recital of the dangers from which I had eſcaped. She could not hear of the ſingular generoſity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, when I was in the power of the Ruſſians, without ſhedding tears: "How magnanimous he is!" exclaims ſhe, amidſt a tranſport of joy: "how worthy of being a king, he who ſo generouſly pardoned you! How many ſighs has he ſpared a wife whom you forſake! how many tears
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:037849_0053_100F850F03532688"/>
the loving wife whom you are not afraid of ſacrificing! Cruel Lovzinski, are not the dangers to which you daily expoſe yourſelf ſufficient—"</p>
            <p>Pulaski here interrupts his daughter with a certain degree of harſhneſs: "In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet and weak woman!" exclaims he, "is it before me that you dare hold ſuch a diſcourſe as this?"</p>
            <p>"Alas!" replies ſhe in a mild accent; "alas! muſt I forever tremble for the life of a father and a huſband?" Lodoiska alſo made the moſt affecting complaints to me, and ſighed after a more happy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, while fortune was preparing for us the moſt cruel reverſe.</p>
            <p>Our Coſſacks, placed at the out-poſts, now came in from all parts, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us that the Ruſſian army was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. Pulaski reckoned on being attacked at the break of day: but he was not: however, about the middle of the following night I was informed that the enemy were preparing to force our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments.</p>
            <p>Pulaski always ready, always active, was actually defending them: during the courſe of this fatal night, he achieved ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing that might have been expected from his valour and experience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:037849_0053_100F850F03532688"/>We repel the aſſailants no leſs than five different times, but they return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſingly to the charge, pour in freſh troops at every new attack, and, during the laſt one, penetrate into the very heart of our camp by three different avenues, at one and the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Zaremba was killed by my ſide; a croud of nobles fell in this bloody action; the enemy refuſed to give any quarter.— Furious at ſeeing all my friends periſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my eyes, I reſolved to precipitate myſelf into the midſt of the Ruſſian bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions.</p>
            <p>"Heedleſs man!" exclaims Pulaski, "what blind fury urges you towards your deſtruction! My army is completely rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—deſtroyed—but my courage ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains! Why ſhould we periſh uſeleſsly here? Let us be gone! I will conduct you into climes where we may raiſe up new enemies againſt the Ruſſian name. Let us live, ſince we can ſtill ſerve our country! Let us ſave ourſelves, let us ſave Lodoiska."</p>
            <p>"Lodoiſka! am I capable of abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her?"</p>
            <p>We inſtantly run to her tent—we are ſcarce in time: we carry her off, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ourſelves into the neighbouring
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:037849_0054_100F8511DF0106E8"/>
woods, and on the next morning we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſally forth, and preſent ourſelves before the gate of a caſtle that was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unknown to us.</p>
            <p>It indeed belonged to a noble Pole, who had ſerved during ſome time in our army. Miciſlas inſtantly comes forth, and offers an aſylum, which he adviſes us, however, to make uſe of for a few hours only. He informs us, that a very aſtoniſhing piece of news had ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad on the former evening, and began to be confirmed, according to which the king himſelf had been carried away out of Warſaw, that the Ruſſians had purſued the conſpirators, and brought back the monarch to his capital; and that, in fine, it was talked of putting a price upon the head of Pulaſki, who was ſuſpected of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the author of this treaſon.</p>
            <p>"Believe me," ſays he, "when I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, whether you have been engaged or not in this bold plot, that you ought to fly; leave your uniforms here, which will aſſuredly betray you: I will inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupply you with clothes which are leſs remarkable: and as to Lodoiſka, I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will conduct her to the place which you have choſen or your retreat."</p>
            <p>Lodoiſka now interrupts Miciſlas:—
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:037849_0054_100F8511DF0106E8"/>
"The place of my retreat ſhall be that of their flight, for I will accompany them every where."</p>
            <p>Pulaſki repreſents to his daughter, that ſhe is not able to ſuſtain the fatigue inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſuch a long journey, and beſides we ſhould be liable to continual dangers.</p>
            <p>"The greater the peril is," replies ſhe, "the more I ought to partake it with you. You have repeated to me a hundred times, that the daughter of Pulaſki ought not to be an ordinary woman. For the laſt eight years I have conſtantly lived in the midſt of alarms; I have ſeen nothing but ſcenes of carnage and horror. Death has environed me on all ſides, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced me at every moment: will you not permit me to brave it now by your ſide? Is not the life of Lodoiſka connected with that of her father? Lovzinſki, will not the ſtroke that fells you to the ground ſend you wife to the grave: and am I no longer worthy —"</p>
            <p>I now interrupt Lodoiſka, and join with her father, in ſtating reaſons which determined us to leave her in Poland. She hears me with impatience: "Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful man," exclaims ſhe at length, "will you fly without me?" "You ſhall

remain," replies Pulaſki, with Lovzin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſki's ſiſters, and I prohibit you —"</p>
            <p>His daughter, now frantic with grief, would not permit him to finiſh the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>"I know your rights, my father! I reſpect them; they ſhall always appear ſacred to me: but you do not poſſeſs that of ſeparating a wife from her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>"Ah, pardon me! I ſee that I offend you—my reaſon no longer maintains its empire—</p>
            <p>"But pity my grief—</p>
            <p>"Excuſe my deſpair—</p>

            <p>"Yes, I will follow you every where, cruel men! I will follow you in ſpite of yourſelves!</p>
            <p>Lovzinſki, if your wife has loſt all the rights ſhe had over your heart, recollect at leaſt her who was once miſtreſs of your affections.</p>
            <p>"Recal to your remembrance that frightful night, when I was about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in the flames; that terrible moment when you aſcended the burning tower, crying out, let me live or die with Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſka!</p>

            <p>Her tears now intercepted her ſpeech. Miciſlas wept; my heart was torn with anguiſh. "You are reſolved to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us, my daughter—be it ſo; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent," ſays Pulaſki, "but I wiſh that heaven may not puniſh me for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:037849_0056_100F851722F599A8"/>Lodoiſka now embraces us both with as much joy as if all our ills had been at an end. I leave two letters with Miciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, which he undertook to tranſmit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction: the one was addreſſed to my ſiſters, and the other to Boleſlas. I bade them adieu, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them, to neglect no means to endeavour to recover my dear Dorliſka!</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary that I ſhould diſguiſe my wife—ſhe aſſumes a maſculine dreſs; we change our own, and we employ all the means in our power to disfigure our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a manner as to elude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch, and prevent diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Thus altered in our appearance, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our ſabres and our piſtols, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a conſiderable ſum in gold, with ſome trinkets, and all the jewels of Lodoiſka, we take leave of Miciſlas, and make haſte to regain the woods.</p>
            <p>Pulaſki now communicates to us the deſign which he had formed of taking refuge in Turkey. He hoped to be employed in a ſituation equal to his rank and his abilities, in the armies of the grand ſignior, who had for the two laſt years with ſome difficulty ſuſtained a diſaſtrous war againſt the Ruſſians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:037849_0056_100F851722F599A8"/>Lodoiſka did not appear in the leaſt affrighted at the long journey which we had to make; and as ſhe could neither be known nor ſought after, ſhe inſiſted upon going out to reconnoitre the adjacent country, and at the ſame time charged herſelf with the fatiguing but important taſk of bringing us the proviſions which we ſtood in need of.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the day appeared, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the wood: hid either in the trunks of trees, or in thick groves of pines, we waited impatiently for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of night, on purpoſe to continue our march. It was thus that, during ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al weeks, we were enabled to eſcape from the ſearch of a multitude of different bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Ruſſian troops, who were ſent out on purpoſe to diſcover us, and who purſued us like ſo many blood hounds, animated with the paſſions of hatred and revenge.</p>
            <p>One day as Lodoiſka, ſtill diſguiſed as a peaſant, returned from a neighbouring hamlet, where ſhe had gone on purpoſe to purchaſe the proviſions which ſhe was now conveying to us, two Ruſſian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauders attacked her at the entry of the foreſt in which we were concealed.</p>
            <p>After having robbed, they prepared to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037849_0057_100F851AF07B02C0"/>
ſtrip her. At the ſhrieks which ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered we haſten from our retreat, and the two ruffians immediately betake themſelves to flight upon our appearance —but we were greatly alarmed leſt they ſhould recount this adventure to their companions, whoſe ſuſpicions arouſed by this ſingular rencounter, might induce them to come and drag us from our aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</p>
            <p>After a moſt fatiguing journey, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Poleſia.<note n="*" place="bottom">Poleſia is a name given to the palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Breſte in Lithuania; Breſte, Brieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, or Breſſici, is ſituated upon the river Bog.

            <p>"At leaſt," exclaims he with a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful accent—"at leaſt I have faithfully ſerved you, and I now only go into exile that I may be enabled to ſerve you again."</p>
            <p>So many fatigues had exhauſted the ſtrength of Lodoiſka. Arrived at No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogorod,<note n="†" place="bottom">There are ſeveral towns af this name in Ruſſia.

ſtrength. It was our deſign to remain ſome days, but ſome of the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom we queſtioned, frankly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, that a number of troops were in motion in that neighbourhood, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to arreſt a certain perſon of the name of Pulaſki, who had occaſioned the king of Poland to be taken priſoner, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off from the midſt of his own capital.</p>
            <p>Juſtly alarmed at this intelligence, we remain but a few hours in this town, where we, however found means to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſome horſes without being diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered.</p>
            <p>We then paſs the Deſna above Czer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicove;<note n="*" place="bottom">Czernicove, or Czernikou, is a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable town and is the capital of the duchy of the ſame name. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

T.</note> and following the banks of the Sula, we croſs that river at Perevoloczna, where we learn that Pulaſki, who had been traced to Novogorod, had eſcaped as it were by miracle, and that the Ruſſian ſoldiers, indefatigable in their purſuit, were ſtill ſearching after him, and were in hopes of making him priſoner.</p>
            <p>It was now again become neceſſary to
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:037849_0058_100F851CB2173630"/>
fly once more, and once more to change our route; we therefore inſtantly made for the immenſe foreſts which cover the face of the country between the Sula and the Zem, in the dark retreats of which we hoped to find ſhelter from our foes.</p>
            <p>We at length diſcover a cavern, in which we were reduced to the neceſſity of taking up our abode. A ſhe-bear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with us the entrance into this aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum equally ſolitary and frightful; we aſſail, we kill her, and devour her young.</p>
            <p>Pulaſki was wounded in this encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Lodoiska, worn out with fatigue and diſtreſs, was ſcarcely able to ſupport her exiſtence: the winter was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the cold was already exceſſive.</p>
            <p>Purſued by the Ruſſians in the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts; menaced by wild and ferocious animals in this vaſt deſart; deſtitute of any arms but our ſwords; reduced in a ſhort time to eat our very horſes; what was to become of us?</p>
            <p>The danger of the ſituation to which my father-in-law and my wife were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, had become ſo preſſing, that no other fear any longer alarmed me. My perſonal ſafety, hitherto ſo dear to me, did not now ſuggeſt itſelf once to my mind: I felt only for theirs. I reſolved,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:037849_0058_100F851CB2173630"/>
therefore, to procure to them at any rate thoſe ſuccours which their ſituation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which was ſtill more deplorable than my own; and leaving them both with the promiſe of rejoining them in a ſhort time, I take a few of the diamonds belonging to Lodoiska, and follow the ſtream of the Warsklo.</p>
            <p>It is well known that a traveller, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered amidſt thoſe vaſt countries, and reduced to the neceſſity of wandering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout without a compaſs, and without a guide, is obliged to follow the courſe of a river, becauſe it is upon its banks that the habitations of mankind are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be met with.</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary that I ſhould gain, as ſoon as poſſible, ſome conſiderable town in which a few merchants reſided: I therefore journeyed along the bank, of the Warſklo, and travelling day and night, found myſelf at Pultava<note n="†" place="bottom">Pultoway, Pultowa, or Pultava, is a fortified town in the Ukraine, famous for a battle fought in its neighbourhood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Charles XII. of Sweden and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the great of Ruſſia. It is 100 miles ſouth-weſt of Bielgorod from which Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinſki pretended to have come on purpoſe to purchaſe merchandize, &amp;c.</note> at the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:037849_0059_100F85204F627DE8"/>
end of four days. During my reſidence in this place, I paſs for a trader belonging to Bielgorod. I there learn that the Ruſſian troops were ſtill roaming about in purſuit of Pulaſki, and that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs had ſent and exact diſcription of his perſon every where, with orders to ſeize him either dead or alive, wherever he might be found.</p>
            <p>I make haſte to ſell my diamonds, to purchaſe powder, arms, and proviſions of all kinds, different utenſils, and ſome coarſe and neceſſary furniture; every thing, in fine, which I judged moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to relieve our miſery, and ſoften our misfortunes.—With theſe I load a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, drawn by four good horſes, of which I was the only conductor.</p>
            <p>My return was equally tedious and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; no leſs than eight whole days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired before I arrived at the entrance of the foreſt.</p>
            <p>It was there that, terminating my diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and dangerous journey, I was about to ſuccour my father-in-law and my wife; that I was about to reviſit all that was moſt dear to me in the world; and yet I felt none of thoſe tranſports of joy which ſuch an event ſeemed likely to inſpire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="unknown:037849_0059_100F85204F627DE8"/>Philoſophers have no belief in forbode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, however, that I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced an involuntary uneaſineſs: my mind became diſpirited, diſmayed, and ſomething, I know not what, ſeemed to whiſper to me, that the moſt unhappy moment of my whole life was faſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</p>
            <p>On my departure, I had placed ſeveral flintſtones at certain diſtances, on purpoſe to enable me to retrace my road; but I could not now diſcover them. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo cut off with my ſabre large pieces of the bark of ſeveral trees, which I could not now perceive. I enter the foreſt, however: I hollow with all my ſtrength: I diſcharge my gun from time to time, but nobody anſwers me. I dared not truſt myſelf among the trees and ſhrubs for fear of loſing my way back again; neither could I wander too far from my waggon, which was ſtored with proviſions ſo neceſſary to Pulaſki, his daughter, and myſelf.</p>
            <p>The night, which now approached, obliged me to give over my ſearch, and I paſs it in the ſame manner as the former. Rolled up in my cloak, I lay down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath my waggon, which I had carefully
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:037849_0060_100F8522E8B2F9D0"/>
ſurrounded with my larger moveables, and which thus ſerved me as a rampart againſt the wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>I could not ſleep; the cold was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely intenſe; the ſnow fell in great abundance; at break of day I looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, and found all the ground covered with it. From that moment I formed the moſt horrible and the moſt ſiniſter preſages: the ſtones which might have pointed out the path I was to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, were all buried, and it appeared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible I ſhould ever be able to diſcover my father-in-law and my wife.</p>
            <p>Had the horſe, which I had left with them at my departure, afforded them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſuſtenance ever ſince? Had not hunger, cruel hunger, obliged them to fly from their retreat? Were they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in thoſe frightful deſerts? If they were not there, where ſhould I be able to find them? Where, without them, ſhould I drag out my miſerable exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>But could I believe that Pulaſki had abandoned his ſon-in-law? that Lodoiska had conſented to ſeparate herſelf from
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:037849_0060_100F8522E8B2F9D0"/>
her huſband? No—undoubtedly not.— They were ſtill confined within the circle of this frightful ſolitude; and if I aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them, they muſt die with famine and cold! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>Theſe deſperate reflections at length determined my conduct, and I no longer examined whether or not, in removing at a diſtance from my waggon, I was in danger of never finding it again. To car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſome proviſions to my father-in-law and wife, to ſuccour Pulaſki and Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſka—theſe were now the only ſentiments that occupied my mind.</p>
            <p>I accordingly ſeize my fowling piece, take ſome powder and ſhot, and load one of my horſes with neceſſaries: I pierce into the woods much farther than during the former evening; I again hollow with all my ſtrength; I again make frequent diſcharges with my gun. The moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſilence reigned around me.</p>
            <p>I now find myſelf in a part of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt where the trees were ſo extremely thick, that there was no longer any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for my horſe: I, therefore, tie him to a tree, and my deſpair getting the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of every other conſideration, I ſtill
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:037849_0061_100F852499AAC918"/>
continue to advance with my gun, and part of my provisions. I had now wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered about for two hours more, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude forcing me every moment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double my pace, when at length I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive human footſteps imprinted on the ſnow.</p>
            <p>Hope gives me new ſtrength, and I therefore inſtantly follow the traces which are ſtill freſh. Soon after I diſcover Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſki almoſt naked, emaciated with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſo changed as ſcarce to be known even by me!</p>
            <p>He makes all the efforts in his power to drag his limbs towards me, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to my enquiries. The moment that I had rejoined him, he ſeizes, with avidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, on the victuals that I preſent to him, and devours them in an inſtant. I then demand of him where Lodoiſka is.</p>
            <p>"Alas!" ſays he, "you will ſee her there!" The tone of voice in which he pronounced theſe words made me trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I run to, I arrive at the cavern, but too well prepared for the melancholy ſpectacle that awaited me. Lodoiſka, wrapped up in her own cloaths, and cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with thoſe of her father, was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a bed of half rotten leaves!</p>

            <p>By the aid of our horſes, for which we procure a paſſage, by making a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitous journey, inſtead of attempting to bring them ſtrait to the place of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, we were at length able to tranſport thoſe proviſions and moveables to our cavern, which it was ſo neceſſary for us to procure, and to huſband, if we reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to remain much longer in this ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude. We ſoon after killed our horſes, which we were unable to ſupply with food. We lived upon their fleſh, which the rigour of the ſeaſon preſerved for a

conſiderable time; it corrupted, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, at length; and our fire-arms being unable to procure us any other than a ſcanty ſupply of game, we were obliged to have recourſe to our proviſions; which at the end of three months, were entirely conſumed.</p>
            <p>Some gold, and the greater part of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſka's diamonds ſtill remained. Should I make a ſecond voyage to Pultava? Or ſhould we both run the hazard of ſuch an undertaking and quit our retreat in company? We had already ſuffered ſo much and ſo cruelly in this foreſt that we reſolved to embrace the latter reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>We accordingly ſally forth; we paſs the Sem near Rylks; we purchaſe a boat there, and diſguiſing ourſelves in the dreſs of fiſhermen, we deſcend that river, and enter the Deſna.</p>
            <p>Our boat was viſited at Czernicove, but miſery had ſo disfigured Pulaſki, that it was impoſſible any longer to recognize him. We then enter the Dnieper; we croſs from Kiof<note n="*" place="bottom">Kiof, or Kiow, is a palatinate, in which is ſituated a town of the ſame name, which is reckoned the capital of the Ukraine.

            <p>At Zaporiſkaia we heard of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bender and Oczakow, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Crimed, and the defeat and ſubſequent death of the Vizir Oglou.</p>
            <p>Pulaſki, reduced to a ſtate of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was anxious to traverſe the vaſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts that ſeparated him from Pugatchew, on purpoſe to join himſelf to that enemy of the Ruſſians; but the exceſs of our fatigues obliged us to remain at Zapori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkaia.</p>
            <p>The peace, which was ſoon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between Ruſſia and the Porte, at length afforded us the means of entering Turkey.</p>

            <head>THE STORY OF Alcander and Septimius. Taken from a Byzantine Hiſtorian.</head>
            <p>ATHENS, long after the decline of the Roman empire, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſeat of learning, politeneſs, and wiſdom. Theodoric, the Oſtrogoth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> repaired the ſchools which barbarity was ſuffering to fall into decay, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thoſe penſions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olized.</p>
            <p>In this city, and about this period, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander and Septimius were fellow ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents together; the one, the moſt ſubtle reaſoner of all the Lyceum; the other the moſt eloquent ſpeaker in the academ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic grove.

<pb n="134" facs="unknown:037849_0068_100F8538E9EB9140"/>
equal, and they were natives of the two moſt celebrated cities in the world; for Alcander was of Athens, Septimius came from Rome.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of harmony they lived for ſome time together, when Alcander, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſing the firſt part of his youth in the indolence of philoſophy, thought at length of entering into the buſy world; and, as a ſtep previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were performed; and nothing now remained but her being conducted in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</p>
            <p>Alcander's exultation in his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or being unable to enjoy any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction without making his friend Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius a partner, prevailed upon him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Hypatia to his fellow-ſtudent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himſelf equally happy in friendſhip and love. But this was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview fatal to the future peace of both; for Septimius no ſooner ſaw her, but he was ſmitten with an involuntary paſſion; and though he uſed every effort to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs deſires at once ſo imprudent and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:037849_0068_100F8538E9EB9140"/>
unjuſt, the emotions of his mind in a ſhort time became ſo ſtrong, that they brought on a fever, which the phyſicians judged incurable.</p>
            <p>During this illneſs, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondneſs, and brought his miſtreſs to join in thoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iable offices of friendſhip. The ſagacity of the phyſicians, by theſe means, ſoon diſcovered that the cauſe of their patient's diſorder was love; and Alcander being appriſed of their diſcovery, at length ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted a confeſſion from the reluctant dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lover.</p>
            <p>It would but delay the narrative to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the conflict between love and friendſhip in the breaſt of Alcander on this occaſion; it is enough to ſay, that the Athenians were at this time arrived at ſuch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exceſs. In ſhort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the conſtitution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and ſet out with his fair partner for Rome. Here,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:037849_0069_100F853B9DCC18F8"/>
by an exertion of thoſe talents which he was ſo eminently poſſeſſed of, Septimius, in a few years, arrived at the higheſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the ſtate, and was conſtituted the city judge or praetor.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Alcander not only felt the pain of being ſeparated from his friend and his miſtreſs, but a proſecution was alſo commenced againſt him, by the relations of Hypatia, for having baſely given up his bride, as was ſuggeſted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to withſtand the influence of a powerful party. He was caſt and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to raiſe ſo large a ſum at the time appointed, his poſſeſſions were confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he himſelf was ſtripped of the habit of freedom, expoſed as a ſlave in the market-place, and ſold to the higheſt bidder.</p>
            <p>A merchant of Thrace becoming his purchaſer, Alcander, with ſome other companions of diſtreſs, was carried into that region of deſolation and ſterility.— His ſtated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious maſter, and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in hunting was all that was allowed
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:037849_0069_100F853B9DCC18F8"/>
him to ſupply his precarious ſubſiſtence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of ſeaſon ſerved but to aggravate his unſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered diſtreſs. After ſome years of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, however, an opportunity of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered; he embraced it with ardour; ſo that, travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to ſhorten a long ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he at laſt arrived in Rome. The ſame day on which Alcander arrived, Septimius ſat adminiſtering juſtice in the forum, whither our wanderer came, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be inſtantly known, and public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he ſtood the whole day amongſt the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of; but he was ſo much altered by a long ſucceſſion of hardſhips, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unnoticed among the reſt; and, in the evening, when he was going up to the praetors chair, he was brutally repulſed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another: for night coming on, he now found himſelf under the neceſſity of ſeeking a place to lie in and yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated and in rags, as he was, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the citizens would harbour ſo much wretchedneſs; and ſleeping in the ſtreets might be attended with interruption or danger: in ſhort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the city, the uſual retreat of guilt, poverty, and deſpair. In this manſion of horror, laying his head upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted urn, he forgot his miſeries for a while in ſleep; and found, on his flinty couch, more eaſe than beds of down can ſupply to the guilty.</p>
            <p>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; but, happening to diſagree about the diviſion of their plunder, one of them ſtabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In theſe circumſtances he was found next morning, dead, at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, an alarm was ſpread; the cave was examined, and Alcander being found, was immediately apprehended, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of robbery and murder. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances againſt him were ſtrong, and the wretchedneſs of his appearance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſuſpicion. Misfortune and he were now ſo long acquainted, that he at laſt became regardleſs of life. He deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:037849_0070_100F853E60C37F38"/>
a world where he had found only ingratitude, falſehood, and cruelty; he was determined to make no defence; and thus, lowering with reſolution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of Septimius. As the proofs were poſitive againſt him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a moſt cruel and ignominious death, when the attention of the multitude was ſoon divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſelling his plunder, and, ſtruck with a panic, had confeſſed his crime. He was bro't bound to the ſame tribunal, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted every other perſon of any partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his guilt. Alcander's innocence therefore appeared, but the ſullen raſhneſs of his conduct remained a wonder to the ſurrounding multitude; but their aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment was ſtill further increaſed, when they ſaw their judge ſtart from his tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to embrace the ſuppoſed criminal. Septimius recollected his friend and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the ſequel be related? Alcander was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſhared the friendſhip and honours of the principal citizens of Rome; lived
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:037849_0071_100F8541060D02E0"/>
afterwards in happineſs and eaſe; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circumſtances are ſo deſperate, which Providence may not relieve.</p>

            <p>As, notwithſtanding this innocent phrenzy, ſhe was of a truly beautiful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a delicate and amiable diſpoſition, and heireſs to a large fortune, ſhe had nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous admirers and ſuitors; but none of theſe were ſo much as permitted to tell their tender tales of love; the heart and the imagination of the lady were entirely engroſſed by another object: ſhe turned a deaf ear to all their amorous complaints, and ſought the woods and ſhady groves.</p>
            <p>At length, a young gentleman in the neighbourhood, who had long admired her beauty and amiable qualities, while he pitied the peculiar derangement of her mind, determined to try the effect of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring her in her paſtoral phrenzy.
