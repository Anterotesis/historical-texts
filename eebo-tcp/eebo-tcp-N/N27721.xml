            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION UPON ORATORY, AND Philological Inquiry, &amp;c. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the infancy of Society, before the darkneſs of barbariſm has been diſſipated, every ſtudy, the final end of which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual improvement, is either unknown or contemned: But when refinement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to dawn, then by degrees men form a reliſh for the more exalted ſtudies, and, as their opportunities permit them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change corporeal occupation and ſenſual pleaſure, for more enlightened labours and refined delights.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="unknown:036948_0004_100B5432191B9CC0"/>
            <p>BUT of all the intellectual ſtudies, there are none which receive a later or ſlighter attention than thoſe of Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Philology; yet perhaps none which require more early and judicious care. If the ſignification of words be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate, our knowledge of the things ſignified by them muſt neceſſarily be confuſed. If our language be defective, our metaphyſics may be incompatible, our logic incongruous, and our very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality unintelligible, if not even abſurd. And theſe are Sciences of themſelves ſufficiently involved in darkneſs, not to need any additional perplexity from the ambiguity or contradiction of language. But the attainment of perſpicuity is not the ſole advantage accruing from a critical ſtudy of language; but the beauty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and the cogency of argument are derived in a conſiderable degree from the ſame ſource. It not only ſerves to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036948_0005_100B5434D0B924A8"/>elucidate our Ideas, it directs, it improves, it inforces them. In fine, <hi>Liberty</hi> receives no leſs ſupport, than Literature does energy and ornament from forcible and elegant language. If men therefore wiſh to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe intelligibly, much more, if they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to impreſs conviction, or impart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, they ſhould not remain unacquainted with the inſtruments by which theſe effects are produced. Hence Oratory and Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ever engaged the attention of thoſe who have been ſolicitous and able to pleaſe and to perſuade; and to minds ſuſceptible of every elegant impreſſion and open to every refinement of taſte, any attempt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this knowledge can (I ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) neither be unacceptable nor unuſeful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036948_0006_100B5436F6B15F90"/>
THE Engliſh language labours under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar defects and enjoys peculiar excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. To have theſe defects and excellencies (at leaſt ſome of the moſt remarkable of them) placed before our Eyes muſt be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, inaſmuch as it will ſuggeſt the means of avoiding thoſe blemiſhes which diſgrace a ſtyle, of adopting thoſe beauties which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance it, of tranferring from foreign lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages thoſe graces wherein our own may ſeem to be deficient, and of neglecting ſuch innovations as have been created thro' ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or caprice, and are unallied to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech or the genius of our tongue.</p>
            <p>We ſhall conſider it under the heads of Simplicity, Energy, Copiouſneſs and grace, and endcavor to call forth into view, ſome of the principal beauties and defects, by impartially comparing it with thoſe of Greece and Rome. Should I fail in this attempt, I muſt hope for indulgence; ſhould I err, for correction.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="unknown:036948_0007_100B543920A0CC68"/>
            <p>THE ſubject is important, delicate and extenſive. It would be vain therefore to hope that I ſhall eſcape inperfection: It is ſufficient for me that I ſhall offer hints upon which ſuperior abilities may improve.</p>
            <p>THE cultivation of Oratory is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly incumbent upon the riſing youth of America. The influence of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will give efficacy to their exertions, ſince where Liberty is eſtabliſhed Oratory will flouriſh. And not only honor, but the well being of the country demand thoſe exertions, ſince when Oratory moſt generally flouriſhes, Liberty is moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. There are circumſtances that now combine in their favour, with which the ſtudents of Oratory in ancient days, &amp; even your predeceſſors in this country, were unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. I ſincerely wiſh, and confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that their abilities, improving theſe circumſtances, will give to this country, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036948_0008_100B543B43B088C8"/>rendered illuſtrious, additional bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy.</p>
            <p>IN the ſchool of Oratory which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted under the reign of Theſeus, the youth of abilities was taught to diſpute juridically and to deceive <note n="*" place="bottom">Eti de, tanantia dei dunasthai peithein, ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoper kai en tois ſullogiſmois. <bibl>Ariſt Rhetor.</bibl>
               </note> as in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form of ſyllogiſm. In the Lyceum, the Portico and the Academy, where gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous precepts flowed from eloquent lips, the young philoſopher had the opportunity of liſtening. But now, in this riſing country, he may not only learn the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated wiſdom of every age, but he may learn to apply that wiſdom to the great purpoſes of life. Neither a forenſic
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036948_0009_100B543D5F94D2D8"/>Sophiſt as in the one caſe, nor an indolent auditor as in the other, he is taught to emulate with active diligence thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that once preſerved Greece in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her liberties, and that aſſiſted to reſcue this country.</p>
            <p>IN former times the works of great maſters (which are the true models for improvement) were ſcarce and difficult of acceſs; but now by the happy art of Gottenburg, <note n="*" place="bottom">The inventor of Printing.</note> the glowing pages not only of the Hiſtorian <note n="†" place="bottom">Thucydides and Iſaeus—See Plutarch in vita Demoſthen.</note> and the orator from whom the great Athenian copied, but of the great Athenian himſelf and of his Roma competitor, are endowed (if I may ſo ſpeak) with a benevolent ubiquity, by which while preſent with all, they invite all to rival them. And by the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036948_0010_100B543F8A464F60"/>here given to compoſition, of which ſo many ſpecimens have lately been exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; <note n="†" place="bottom">Upon the Death of General Waſhington.</note> they who are animated with the laudable ambition of excelling in that art which governs the ſoul, inſlead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged like the orators of old to have recourſe for improvement to the unfaithful mirror of the cave, or to the unconſcious waves of the ocean, enjoy the ineſtimable advantage of a rational and indulgent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to inſpin admire and reward their Eſſays.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory ſhould be carefully ſtudied and we ſhould always bear in mind its uſes, and direct our inveſtigations in ſuch a manner, as to render our knowledge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to purpoſes of practicable utility.

            <p>But we ought not to be ſatisfied with being mere Hiſtorians. If Hiſtory, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cicero.</note> who is the meſſenger of Antiquity, were not to be alſo the miſtreſs of life, her documents would be of little uſe, except to divert the anxieties of the recluſe Hypochondriac; her volumes would be of little value, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036948_0012_100B54444BEA7DC8"/>to ſwell the Library of the lettered ſpeculiſt. But Hiſtory was not meant to be the ſolace of the indolent, <note n="†" place="bottom">Tacitus.</note> it is her province and her praiſe to be the guide of the active. Since few can by mere pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence diſtinguiſh the juſt from the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, the uſeful from the dangerous: Many are taught by the events of others. Mark, however, that the inſtructions of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory are not fitted for the regulation of private intercourſe, but for the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous adminiſtration of public affairs. To the ſtateſman and to the patriotic Orator, ſhe manifeſts herſelf the light of truth and the ſoul of memory: To all, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced, ſhe liberally diſpenſes wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and points out, with an unerring hand how they may aſſert and defend the deareſt privileges of mankind. Thus it is that Hiſtory is ſubſervient to Oratory,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036948_0013_100B5446697A4558"/>as Oratory is to the nobleſt purpoſes of exiſtence.</p>
            <p>WITH ſimilar recommendations, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition courts attention. Nothing (ſays Tully, is ſo conducive to Oratory as wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And we find that the greateſt <note n="*" place="bottom">See Plutarch in vita Demoſthenes.</note> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the world ever produced, did not deem it unworthy his genius to ſpend ſeveral months in a cave, in poliſhing a ſpeech; to tranſcribe Thucydides eight times, and to labour for the ſpace of an Olympiad in imitating the orations of Iſaeus—we muſt allow ample authority to the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THUS wiſely did theſe founders provide Hiſtory and compoſition as ſupporters for Oratory, which may itſelf be ſtyled the eſcutcheon of freedom. To demonſtrate this, the annals of the world evince, that it has been by the influence of this divine
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036948_0014_100B54488B1FA030"/>art, which arouſes, perſuades and inſpirs, that ever the oppreſſed have been awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their ignominious acquieſcence, have been taught to know the dignity of their nature, and animated with courage to aſſert their rights. It may be uſeful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how this has happened.</p>
            <p>FEW ſtates have been originally free, and, what is remarkable, ſtill fewer have become free. The cauſe of this ſeems to be, that Oratory, which is the inſtrument of freedom, cannot flouriſh under arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry government; ſometimes however it may happen that <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. S. Adams, General Waſhington &amp;c</note> one or two great and good men, endowed with abilities which fear does not repieſs, and animated with a love for the public good which ambition or intereſt cannot warp, may become ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; theſe men may command the ſouls of their countrymen, and arouſe them to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036948_0015_100B544AAFA6BEE8"/>vindicate their native rights. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hazarded what appeared at firſt raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to many; but the beneficial conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are now very viſible to all the induſtrious throughout the United States. I think the Hiſtories of every age and of every nation concur in demonſtrating the truth of theſe principles. As they are of ſuch moment, they ought to be illuſtrated and confirmed by applying to Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The Teſtimonies of Hiſtory, it muſt be acknowledged, are often tedious, but they are always impartial and concluſive: And I hope that truth will be received with pleaſure. The firſt conſtitution which human ſociety knew was by no means propitious to the birth of cio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The families of the Patriarchs were ruled with abſolute <note n="*" place="bottom">Plato de legib. l. iii. and he adduces in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration of his opinion the Cyclopean polite, ſee Hom.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036948_0016_100B544CD36BC570"/>there was little other occaſion for ſpeech than to ſignify the will of the aged father. Men were thus from their infancy habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to implicit ſubmiſſion; and when in time they found it neceſſary to ſupport public hoſtilities, they crowded, without reluctance or compunction, around the deſpotic banners of ſome illuſtrious chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the early government of the Jews. Such was the conſtitution which obtained among the Celtae, reputed the moſt ancient of nations, <note n="†" place="bottom">Being deſcended from Gomer the eldeſt ſon of Japhet.</note> and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with them unaltered even down to the time of Julius Caeſar, from whom we receive the ſame <note n="‡" place="bottom">Com. de bell.

Examming the records of Hiſtory we become convinced that eloquence not only abhorred deſpotiſm, but diſcerned and abandoned ſuppoſititious freedom. The ſtudy of oratory (ſaid Tully) was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Greece, but peculiar to Athens. For who hath known an Argive, a Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian or a Theban orator: unleſs we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Epaminondas, a man of ſingular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. Or hath a Spartan orator been heard of even to this day? Lace-daemon was called a free ſtate, but the people had no right to propoſe laws, nor to alter or debate upon ſuch as the Senate would propoſe, and hence their conſtant Laconic ſtyle. Carthage too was called a free State; but its government (as Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle proves) was in fact an oligarchy. At Carthage nothing was accounted baſe if it ſupplied lucre: <note n="*" place="bottom">Polybius.</note> The votes of the electors were avowedly purchaſed: And the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036948_0020_100B545572A272B8"/>who were the agents and factors of all other nations, intent as they were upon traffic, and accuſtomed to naval diſcipline, were not leſs regardleſs of the bleſſings of liberty, than they were ignorant of the charms and energies of ſpeech. In ſhort, do we wiſh for a criterion of genuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional Freedom? enquire <note n="*" place="bottom">Dionyſius Halicar.</note> if oratory flouriſhes in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>By comparing the number and ſtyle of the Athenian orators, with the political tranſactions of the different periods in which they lived, it not only appears that when Athens was moſt free, then were her citizens moſt generally eloquent; but it is alſo diſcernable that among her great orators the excellence of each was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately paralleled by the ſpirit of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with which he was inſpired. How far did Lyſias, Iſocrates, Iſaeus, Demoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036948_0021_100B54579A812BE8"/>outvie Timaeus, Soſigenes, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius and Molo? Among the former how inferior to the reſt was the mild Iſocrates, whoſe very cenſures were couched in panegyric, and who, if he afforded any aſſiſtance to liberty, did it rather by depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Oration to Philip</note> than by patronage!</p>
            <p>From the death of Phocion, 'till the time of Dyoniſius the Halicarnaſſian (which was about the Auguſtan age of Rome) the original and Philoſophic ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of eloquence <note n="†" place="bottom">Dyonyſ. Halic</note> was gradualy decaying, and in the time of Dyoniſius was almoſt extinct. The chaſte and native Attic muſe (ſays he) was deſpoiled of her property and her reſpect, by the meretricious in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trigues of the Phrygian, who ſupplanted her, and ſeduced all the cities of Greece. And eaſily indeed muſt they have been
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036948_0022_100B5459242D1008"/>liable to ſuch a ſeduction, when they were previouſly reduced into ſubjection by the Macedonian arms.</p>
            <p>The ſubject would take up too much time to trace, with accuracy, the progreſs of eloquence through Greece and Rome, although new proof;s would ſtill ariſe in corroboration of what is here advanced. We might notice what influence every po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical eſtabliſhment at Athens had upon the art of ſpeaking; and obſerve how the authority of Pericles <note n="*" place="bottom">Plu.

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036948_0023_100B545BE8DE6ED0"/>of deſpotiſm. It might be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that ſuch perverſions are unuſual, never occurring, except where this power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful faculty is permitted to become appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to one; that the light of eloquence ſhould be, if poſſible, as univerſally diffuſed as the light of heaven; for that, concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a ſingle point, however it may dazzle, it always becomes dangerous.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations might ſuggeſt new ideas of the uſefulneſs of thoſe ſtudies, and infer new motives for the invigoration of your efforts to accompliſh them.</p>

Thus it appears that eloquence is the ſatellite of liberty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving its ſplendor from the ſame common ſource, riſing and ſetting with it invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036948_0025_100B54603AFCB928"/>and giving it new radiance by the emanations of its luſtre; but we muſt ſtop leſt our patience ſhould be exhauſted, for the ſubject is inexhauſtible—Let us hope that the important principles are fully eſtabliſhed which were deſired to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon the mind.

            <p>UNTIL the ever memorable and happy revolution, America was nominally, but not really free. In the pride of the heart, and the ignorance or deluſion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the people were accuſtomed to boaſt of ſuch a conſtitution as the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic annaliſt of Rome deſcribes <note n="*" place="bottom">Tacit.

The conſequence of emancipation will be the diffuſion of that faculty which obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: and the effect of this diffuſion will be the preſervation of thoſe bleſſings that have been acquired.</p>
            <p>IT is liberty (ſays Longinus) that che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes the thoughts of generous ſpirits, <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe bold and energetic words, Longinus puts into the mouth of a philoſopher with whom we are to ſuppoſe him converſing.

The powers of their ſouls are ſtruck out, as it were by colliſion, and the freedom of their ſpeech is not leſs illuſtrious than the freedom of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus, ſince the eſtabliſhment of liberty, has oratory raiſed her head in the United States; and, fraught with every grace and every bleſſing heaven can beſtow, ſhall be the tutelary genius of the Land. In every ſtate where the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has been upheld by force, and not by reaſon, ſhe has been unknown: In every ſtate where the abilities of men have been neither ſhackled by ſubmiſſion to a deſpot, nor compoſed by ſovereignty over ſlaves, ſhe has been venerated and found beneſicent of the moſt happy effects. It appears, then, that while to preſerve your freedom, and to tranſmit it to your
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036948_0028_100B54670D6F9340"/>poſterity pure and ſtabilitated, is a duty which every one of you owes to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Ye can only fulfil that duty by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging and improving, as far as ye are able, that art which is the true Palladium of a free conſtitution. But ye muſt not confine yourſelves to ſuch oratory alone, as obtains within the walls of a Senate. He who at the bar aſſerts property and perſonal liberty, he who in the pulpit vindicates toleration and mental liberty, and he who ſupports independence and the liberty of fair elections, is a friend to his country, and contributes to preſerve in Equipoiſe the great balance of political power.</p>
            <p>YE may perceive that every extrinſic circumſtance combines to aſſiſt you in the performance of an important duty. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains but that ye ſhould ſupply your exertions, which ye ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036948_0029_100B5469319659E8"/>when ye recollect the conſiderations by which ye are called upon to employ them in their utmoſt enegy.</p>
            <p>As men of abilities, as the riſing hope of America, ye are called upon to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate oratory, to cultivate that field, where while ye reap the produce which is the true ſuſtenance of liberty, ye may gather immortal amaranths and laurels for your own brows. And now let it be aſked—Enjoying the peculiar and ſupereminent advantages juſt now enumerated, men of abilities! What ſhould prevent you from equalling, from excelling the orators of Greece? Nothing except your own ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Surmount that; employ, as your profeſſions may lead you, thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and thoſe abilities in ſupporting your happy conſtitution, where perſonal, civil and religious liberty are amply ſecure; and in merit and honor, ye will not yield
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036948_0030_100B546ABA17C7C8"/>to the greateſt, or moſt enlightened nations of mankind.</p>
            <p>THOUGH it were to be wiſhed, that every individual in ſociety would exert whatever abilities of elocution he may poſſeſs with decency and propriety, it would be wrong to accuſe the ſilent man of a careleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence or of a ſullen pride. Silence not unfrequently proceeds from modeſty; and the modeſt, though often culpable, are always ſo amiable they ought not to be cenſured; the delicate ſenſibility of their nature recedes from the touch of reproof, tender as the ſenſitive plant, and as tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be cheriſhed. There is no occaſion to be ſo cautious with the more bold and manly ſpirits who ſometimes nobly err; but let them remember, that error, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be its denomination, is ſtill error, and ought to be reclaimed: Genius will never charm if it be not attempered by
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036948_0031_100B546D84E5FF70"/>taſte, that &amp; even the ſublime fails to impart pleaſure when it is unaccompanied by the beautiful. It is to be lamented to obſerve men of good abilities abandoning, thro' an unhappy falſe taſte, argument and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and proſtituting their faculties to the indiſcriminate embrace of every vagrant metaphor, and alluſion, that their pandaring imaginations could collect.—Rhetorical beauties are not hard to be acquired; to the imagination that explores for them, thouſands of ſplendid figures readily preſent themſelves. The mind that is influenced by a juſt ſenſe of beauty ſelects thoſe only that are uſeful as well as ornamental; it will act like the Magnet, which attracts from innumerable particles ſuch alone as have a ſympathetic quality with itſelf. It is not to be recommended to ſubſtitute phelgmatic diſcuſſion and cold analyſis in the place of warm language, and animated argument. But remember
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036948_0032_100B546FA5C3FFD0"/>never to let the intrigues of a reſtleſs fancy ſupplant, from the adminiſtration of your ſpeech, ſober reaſoning and deliberate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
            <p>GOOD financiers ought to preſide over the intellectual as well as the political treaſury; and the orator ſhould always conſider that his end is to perſuade; but, that by mere fancy he never can perſuade. However, in warning againſt that error, which the vivacity of youth renders moſt common, let it not be forgotten that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be ſupported by language, <note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtotle.</note> that it muſt not only be ſaid <hi>what</hi> ſhould be ſpoken, but <hi>as</hi> it ſhould be ſpoken—And the beſt rule is, that perſpicuity ſhould ever be the leading conſideration, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but the ſubſervient; for every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pleaſe muſt be vain, unleſs it is underſtood.</p>

According to Longinus, a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious criticiſm of writings is the very lateſt acquiſition of long experience.— Proſe compoſition, ſeems too much neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, although particularly entitled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. Independent of the conſideration, that poetry is the gift of nature, proſe writing the production of ſtudy and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and therefore that it behoves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to attend to what may be attained by all, than to what can be only the lot of a few; and as time is ſo very precious in this country and climate, let no waſte of it be made in madly pretending to make

            <p>IT has been often enquired why the Greeks or Romans never compoſed verſes in Rhyme. By ſome it has been attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to chance, and by others to a precellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of taſte: Some have conjectured that Rhyme was not ſufficiently obvious or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to procure its adoption; while others more ingeniouſly, have aſſigned the facility of its compoſition, evident in the ſimilar terminations of verbs, nouns &amp;c. as the cauſe of rejection. The true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon however, ſeems moſt ſurprizingly to have eluded all the crities: they never once reflected that from the ſtructure of theſe languages it was utterly <hi>impoſſible</hi> to compoſe in Rhyme. The accent never fell upon the laſt ſyllable, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were for ever precluded from Rhyming, except in the Hudibraſtic ſtrain, to which the gravity of theſe nations little
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036948_0038_100B547BDD113150"/>encouraged them. What a ſine figure would Amantem, hiantem, merui, dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rui munditiis, conviciis, and ſuch pretty coincidences, have cut in an heroic poem; I believe however, all will agree that they would be far from enhancing its dignity.</p>
            <p>Conſider, that as oratory is the chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to preſer that ſpecies of compoſition, which conduces moſt to that deſirable end; namely that which gives an habit of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſquiſiton, deep thought, accurate diſcrimination, correct reaſoning and ſound inference; rather than that which teaches to conclude before examination, to be perſuaded without conviction, to be led by paſſion and not by reaſon, to be loquaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous without knowledge, and poſitive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof. It was not by quaint alluſions, unexpected tropes of Rhetoric, or a bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtic pomp of words, that Demoſthenes
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036948_0039_100B547E04208C90"/>governed at will the accompliſhed citizens of Athens. No, he ſpoke irrefutable truth in the natural language of the heart, and the people cried out "to arms! To arms! Let us march againſt Philip! We will preſerve our liberties or die!"</p>
            <p>Then, entertain the muſes, rather as the daughters of memory, than the Goddeſſes of fiction, and while you offer every indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the proſe writer, you will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Poet only ſo far as he gives ſpirit to ſentiment, beauty to truth, and makes his art ſubſervient to the intereſts of ſcience and virtue.</p>

            <p>There ſeems to be a gradation among the cultivators of intellectual knowledge, which may be traced by the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of obſcurity in their inſtructions or writings. The loweſt and moſt inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant claſs appear to be obſcure from their ideas being confuſed; another, though devoid of ſpirit, may be capable of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging their thoughts: Theſe are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from each other, as the former are intricately nonſenſical, the later me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically ſlupid. There are, to whom ſome ſmall portion of ſpirit has been dealt out, beſide theſe pettifoggers of literature, (puiſne heads) which like the fooliſh moth, captivated by every thing glittering and uncommon, hover about the blaze of wit, 'till they ſinge thoſe wings, on which they
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036948_0041_100B5482E4683C78"/>flattered themſelves, they could raiſe their reputation. Thus their writings or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions become generally a heap of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure inconſiſtencies,
<q>
                  <l>Serpentes avibus geminantur tigribus agui,</l>
               </q>
which eternally dazzle with their ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or weary with their jingling; the worthieſt or the commoneſt thoughts are equally trick'd out in theatrical tinſel.— The laſt claſs are they, who inſpired with the generous ſlame of true etherial ſpirit, ſpurn the glittering toys that amuſe their puiſne inferiors, and aim at what is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adequate to the ſupremity of human conception.</p>
            <p>As truth, though naked, is more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than falſhood in her proſtitute garb of parti-coloured hues, ſo is the ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous plainneſs of a generous ſoul, more energetic than the flimſy ſinery of affected eloquence; but when the ſentiments of a
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036948_0042_100B54846C7856A0"/>noble ſpirit ſhall deign to be clad, you will ſee them ſhining through the radiant veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an angel, not hidden, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, but diſplaying their rational form more conſpicuouſly by being covered.</p>
            <p>BUT to return—The Engliſh Language, it muſt be obſerved, unlike thoſe of the Ancients, has little or no inflexion. The various relations of a word in a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, are denoted either by juxta poſition, or by the annexion of an auxiliary particle: Whereas among the Ancients they were always known by a reſemblance in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This great diſſimilarity in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtructure of the Language neceſſarily occaſions a great diverſity in the expreſſion. The direct and immediate conſequences of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036948_0043_100B5486A4F73608"/>it, we find are, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Doctor Louth's Engliſh Grummer.</note> that in the Engliſh Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſubſtantives have but one variation of caſe, whereas in the Latin they have five: Adjectives admit of no variation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which expreſſes the degrees of compariſon; and verbs do not undergo above five or ſix mutations from their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal form, though in ſome Languages they undergo as many hundreds. Theſe peculiarities in the formation of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Language ſufficiently diverſify it from almoſt every other: For though there are many modern Languages, whoſe inflexions do not much exceed ours in point of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet there is none wherein theſe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies are ſo adequately ſupplied, nor is there, perhaps, any language, the ſtructure of which is altogether ſo ſimple as ours. But though ſimplicity and commodiouſneſs of conſtruction are juſtly to be regarded, and cannot but be owned commendable
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036948_0044_100B548973B61150"/>qualities in a Language, yet if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude other advantages of a more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and requiſite nature, our endeavors ſhould rather be directed to add to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, than to continue the excluſion of more favorable acceſſions. Of theſe the moſt important that ſeems to be incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ſuch plain ſimplicity, is Melody of Language; an acquiſition of too happy utility not to be ſtrongly deſirable, and whoſe loſs, ſimplicity of ſtructure alone can never compenſate.</p>
            <p>IT may be uſeful to enquire how this ſimplicity of ſtructure becomes inimical to harmony, ſince a knowledge of the diſeaſe is the firſt ſtep of ſanation, and though it may not entirely remove the malady, yet it will certainly tend to its mitigation.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems then that to this cauſe has been owing in a great meaſure that vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of monoſyllables wherewith our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036948_0045_100B548B9A28FDB0"/>abounds: a circumſtance which will be found hereafter very prejudicial to melody. As the final ſyllables of our words remain unvaried, the advantages which in other languages reſult from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, are procured with us by auxiliary monoſyllables. Many of theſe are of an uncouth and awkward pronunciation: and particularly incommodious, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that their quantity is indiſtinctly, if at all marked, whereby their pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unſettled and wavering; and above all, ungraceful in verſification, where yet their aſſiſtance is very often indiſpenſibly required. But the zeal of our anceſtors to preſerve their language in its original Teutonic form, conſpiring with its own proneneſs, has added ſtill more to this defect, by their etymological deductions. They imagined the introduction of poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllables would have been an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble innovation; but yet perceiving the neceſſity of ſupplying themſelves with
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036948_0046_100B548D225ACCC0"/>terms to denote thoſe combinations of ideas which the Romans had taught them to form, they contracted the Roman words into as conciſe a pronunciation as poſſible; and thus though they naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed them, yet they entirely diveſted them of their primitive harmony, and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the rugged harſhneſs of their own taſte. Many examples which illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the juſtice of this obſervation may be ſeen in Doctor Wallis; I ſhall juſt mention a few; <hi>ſcape</hi> from <hi>excipio, ſtretch'd</hi> from <hi>extractum, ſcour</hi> from <hi>exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, mend</hi> from <hi>emendo.</hi> I think, that, though the puerency of Doctor Wallis's imagination occaſioned him ſometimes to ſtretch his derivations too far, yet his final deductions are generally founded in reaſon and reaſson truth.</p>
            <p>ALL theſe cauſes combining with acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and perhaps reſulting from the phlegmatic ſimplicity of the original form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036948_0047_100B548F5DFA35A8"/>have beſtowed on our language that ſuperabundance of monoſyllables, of which we complain as ſo injurious to melody. That this effect muſt enſue is evident; in ſome caſes no doubt monoſyllables may be arranged to advantage; but it is no leſs indubitable that their general tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is to obſtruct the run of a period, to render it rough and uneven, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the melodious flow of the cadence. And this I take to be one principal cauſe why our periods are frequently deſtitute of that ſmoothneſs and harmony, which ſo eminently characterize, and ſo engagingly adorn thoſe of the ancients. Another no leſs remarkable cauſe, however, contributed to this; which I ſhall mention here as it may enable us to aſcertain how far the former operates. I mean the ſuperior op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities the ancients had of modulating their ſtyle by inverſion. For as the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and dependencies of words in a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence were expreſſed among them by ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036948_0048_100B54926BDFF6D0"/>of termination (a mode equally free from obſcurity and miſapprehenſion) they were at liberty to tranſpoſe their words in ſuch an order as was moſt aptly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to their varieties of length and tone; but we, having no adequate equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to this, are obliged to depend upon juxta poſition alone, which, though perhaps the moſt natural, is <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Kaims.</note> confeſſedly the moſt inconvenient method, ſince it deprives us, in a great meaſure, of the benefit of tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which beſides improving the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, adds much to the dignity, force and elevation of a period.—Still as we ſtrutinize the Engliſh language, new cauſes preſent themſelves of its eſſential defect in melody: and ſtill ariſing in the chief part from the peculiar form of its ſtructure.</p>
            <p>THE next that appears is a ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Conſonants</hi>: A due proportion of vowels and conſonants ſeems as neceſſary,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036948_0049_100B5494922C1D68"/>as of high and low notes in muſic, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the production of melody.</p>
            <p>The antient Languages are excellent in this reſpect; the coalitions of ſoft and rough form a melodious equanimity of ſound, which renders the pronouciation eaſy and muſical; whereas in our language an aſperity of ſound and a roughneſs of tone predominate, which indicate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing repugnant to delicacy, and very often render the expreſſion inadequate to the idea; ſo, that ſhould the one endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to excite the refined and delicate feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the other may counteract its deſign, and repulſe them by its ſeverity. This latter defect appears to owe its origin to the multiplicity of monoſyllables, before remarked.</p>
            <p>FOR we may perceive that in a mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllable one vowel is generally ſufficient to give utterance to four or five, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036948_0050_100B54961AC71270"/>ſometimes even to ſix or ſeven conſonants, ſo that the ſound of each may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as for inſtance, <hi>grunt, drudg'd ſnatch'd, ſtretch'ts.</hi> But in words of a greater length, as ſufficient leiſure cannot be afforded to dwell ſo long on each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſyllable as would be requiſite to articulate many conſonants, therefore the mixture of vowels and conſonants muſt neceſſarily be more equal, and of courſe, more uniform and harmonious: Thus, for inſtance, compare theſe words with the foregoing, <hi>Magnanimity, Reiterate, Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</hi> But as words of the former ſpecies are infinitely more numerous in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage than of the latter, it is plain how hard and rough muſt be our pronunciation, and evident from whence it proceeds. It has been obſerved, however, by a learned Critic, <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Ward in his Treatiſe on Oratory.</note> that what we have deemed a defects, is in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036948_0051_100B5498E80B8E70"/>an acceſſion of value; for the obſerves (and judiciouſly) that where a language like the Italian abounds in vowels, the ſound of it muſt be ſoft, effeminate and languid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a predominancy of conſonants beſtows ſublimity, energy and animation. But this can only relate to their equal and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional interſperſion through every part of language; and I fear that when they come in the queſtionable ſhape in which they viſit our tongue, theſe effects may be doubted or denied: Their mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance ſeems better adapted to impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than to animation; to laconic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonance than to energetic majeſty: and to the production of almoſt any other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter than that of ſublime and ſonorous. But of all the conſonants which abound in the Engliſh language there is none more abhorrant of harmony than the letter <hi>s</hi>; yet at the ſame time none which ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently predominates.</p>

            <p>To ſay that this Letter is eſſential to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is abſurd; nor is the aſſertion either unſupported or novel. This letter has ſcarcely once been expreſſed throughout the whole inimitable compoſitions of Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar; ſo far is it from being eſſential to excellence, and ſo far was the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſublime of poets from eſteeming it advantageous to harmony, or condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the production of exalted emotions.</p>
            <p>THUS we have endeavoured to trace by its ſeveral channels that inharmoniouſneſs with which our language labours, and we find that the ſimplicity of its formation is the ultimate ſource. And indeed when
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036948_0054_100B549F5687D668"/>we compare our language with thoſe of Greece and Rome, in reſpect of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, we find the greateſt reaſon to deplore our inferiority. The aſcendancy ſeems not only to have been meaſured out to them from the beginning, along with the genius of their tongue, but alſo to have been ſucceſſively and regularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed through their diligence in acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adventitious acceſſions. As we are in a great meaſure deprived of one of theſe ſources of advantage, it more immediately behoves us to apply with attention to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract improvement from the other: I mean from our own diligence, nor will it be ſo unworthily employed: To harmonize the diction, to attune the diſcordance of ſtyle, and above all to accommodate the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the feelings of the heart, cannot certainly be unworthy motives to atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note n="*" place="bottom">Longinus aſcribes Aill greater advantages to it—Section 39.</note> Nor can they be eſteemed ſo by the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036948_0055_100B54A1B1EB4818"/>man of learning and refined taſte, ſince it is the exiſtence of theſe circumſtances which introduces his qualities and renders them acceptable. Diſcoveries no doubt may be made in Philoſophy by a ſtranger to the elegancies of language, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tranſactions may be negociated by the illiberal. But he to whom the treaſures of the underſtanding are dear, who wiſhes to expand his intellectual powers, and to comprehend the cogency of his ſpeech; who ſeeks to convey information in the vehicle of delight, and who deſires to partake thoſe pleaſures which imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuggeſts; he, I ſay, muſt not neglect the harmony of language, nor eſteem ſuch philological inquiries unworthy.— The beauties of native harmony which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſubſiſt are comparatively but ſew, and of trifling importance, there yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains an extenſive field for the ingenuity and ſagacity of the reformer; and the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036948_0056_100B54A3E0EC9AA8"/>Engliſh language, from the imperfection of not only this, but of moſt other branches, ſeems (ſo far from being on the decline) not yet to have attaine the previous ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of perfection—It ſeems however to be ſpeedily verging towards it. As to the pre excellencies in reſpect of harmony which the Engliſh enjoys over the ancient languages, their paucity renders them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant; yet there are ſome that ſhould be obſerved. We frequently accent the laſt ſyllable, which beſides inducing the advantages and beauties that reſult from rhyme (of which the ancient languages are <hi>for this reaſon</hi> incapable) renders the pronunciation even in proſe, more lively and muſical, and tends to produce that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and equable proportion of accents which ſmooths the period, promotes the delivery, and adorns the cadence. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage of our language above the Roman is, that a great part of their words
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036948_0057_100B54A60DE94F50"/>end in <hi>m,</hi> a broad and hollow ſound; but the generality of Engliſh words find their termination either in <hi>n</hi> or <hi>y,</hi> ſounds which are evidently more efficient of melody.</p>
            <p>The next important contingency of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and which conduces in a principal degree to conſtitute its character, is <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy</hi>; a quality which though perhaps more abſolutely eſſential to language than the preceding, yet has been thus far poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, as not ſeeming to be ſo intimately connected with its peculiarity of ſtructure, And under this head our language aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a more reſpectable and flouriſhing appearance: Its peculiar energy and force of expreſſion have juſtly been the ſubject of admiration and praiſe: to ſay it equals the Greek is no exaggerated commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but its ſuperiority over every other language (except perhaps the Hebrew) admits not of a doubt. The recency of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036948_0058_100B54A7995A8250"/>its exiſtence has perhaps contributed to this in no ſmall degree. There remain but few traces of the old Saxon, upon which it was grafied: the Greek, the Roman, the Norman, nay even the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian and the Dutch, have poured in ſuch plentiful ſupplies, as to render it rather the heir of many families, than the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary deſcendant of a ſingle lineage.— The Tutonic and Roman languages were its original parents, but it has culled the moſt expreſſive and energetic ſounds not only from them, but almoſt from every other with whoſe people the Engliſh had any intercourſe. In ſhort it is like the ſtatue of Zeuxis, in which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined the excellencies of the principal beauties of Greece. But beſide this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which we owe to the ſingular judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our predeceſſors, and which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally pervades our language and may be exemplified in almoſt every word we
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036948_0059_100B54AA63EC6170"/>utter, there are ſome other inſtances of ſignificancy which may admit a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular illuſtration. Of theſe the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal is that obſerved by doctor Lowth, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by its poſſeſſing two articles, whereby the extent of the ſignification is determined with the greateſt preciſion.</p>
            <p>THERE is another extrinſical inſtance of the energy and ſignificancy of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (which I ſhall juſt mention, as it has been deſcanted upon by other writers;) that is its capacity, in common with the Greek, of forming a compound adjective, by uniting an adjective and a ſubſtantive or adverb, as <hi>fair-haired youth, roſy-fin-gered Aurora, dark-minded doemon, lack-luſtre eye, quaint-eyed viſage, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe combinations, of which the Roman lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is by no means ſo <note n="*" place="bottom">Latin examples—Verbi potens ſacerdos—Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comum rus—&amp;c.</note> generally ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, have a beautiful effect when formed
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036948_0060_100B54AC8C75F8D0"/>with judgment, eſpecially in poetry: They introduce ideas into the mind ſearce ever raken notice of before; and they pleaſe the ear as well by the melody, as by the novelty of the expreſſion.</p>
            <q>Dixais egregie notum ſi callida verbum. Reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derit junctura novum. <bibl>Hor.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, however, that the general tenor of our language far exceeds the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin in reſpect of ſignificancy, yet it ſeems to be inferior in ſome few particulars; as for inſtance in diminutives, ſuch as homun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus, animula, vagula, &amp;c. which abound very much in that language, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways extremely beautiful: in ours, diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are very infrequent, I can reckon only a few, but they are ſuch as confirm, in the livelieſt manner, the opinion of a deficiency; ſtreamlet, eaglet, flowrer, hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, lambkin, hamlet, droplet, nymphlin.</p>
            <p>THERE is likewiſe a great delicacy in
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:036948_0061_100B54AEB88F2040"/>ſeveral verbs and nouns compounded of the prepoſition ſub, which ſerves to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the force of the words with which it is connected; as ſubruſticus, ſubraucus, ſubiraſci, &amp;c.—we have ſomething analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to this in our termination in <hi>iſh,</hi> as blackiſh, ſaltiſh, &amp;c. which, as Doctor Johnſon obſerves, when applied to adjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, diminiſhes the compariſon ſomewhat below the poſitive; but this diminution is far inferior, both in point of ſervice and beauty to the Latin; for, as the ſame writer continues, it is ſeldom added but to words expreſſing ſenſible qualities, and moſtly of one ſyllable; and is ſcarcely uſed in a ſtyle that is ſolemn or ſublime.</p>
            <p>THE Latin verbs frequentatives; as ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tito, declamito, have alſo a peculiar grace: to theſe, Engliſh verbs exhibit nothing analogous. Such beauties as theſe, not depending upon any original texture of language, but merely upon accidental and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036948_0062_100B54B0468309B8"/>ſupervenient cauſes, are eaſily imitable. To transfer them directly from one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to another may be too harſh a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: but when the principles of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are once eſtabliſhed, particular illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions continually preſent themſelves. The mind, amongſt the perpetual viciſſitude of objects which paſs in ſucceſſion before it, will naturally attract and combine thoſe that tend to excite the feelings once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked. And though the attainment of excellence may ſometimes be previous to the knowledge of what conſtitutes that quality, yet ſuch an abſtract, or general knowledge, neceſſarily prediſpoſes the mind to ſelect and dwell upon particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>THERE is another light in which lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are capable of being compared, I mean in reſpect of their <hi>copiouſneſs.</hi> And this is a ſubject which demands our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equally for its Philoſophical as its Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lological
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036948_0063_100B54B26A244CB0"/>importance. Here it is that the deepeſt marks of the genius and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of a people are impreſſed; their manners are delineated by this expreſſive peneil, which only pourtrays the truth; for never does impartial language expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate or amplify upon ſubjects uncongenial to the diſpoſition of its nation. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate luxuries of the Perſian were inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible in the language of the hardy Scythian: The political or forenſic dialect of an Athenian was jargon to the heedleſs and peaceful inhabitant of Arcadia: while the meandering rills, the verdant lawns and the ſhady bowers of a ſhepherd were juſt as ineffable by the ſtorm-borne citizen of Carthage</p>
            <p>THE ſpeculiſt who improves theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, has before him materials for the moſt refined and pleaſing, as well as, the moſt incontrovertable knowledge. He may trace the courſe of arts and
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036948_0064_100B54B49AE7D528"/>ſciences through the world. He may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue every nation through its ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of intellectual capacity, from the darkneſs of ignorance, through the dawn of reſſnement, and the meridian blaze of perfection, to the declenſion of excellence and the re-eſtabliſhment of night: He may obſerve the characteriſtics of every people: He may ſee their ruling paſſion, and their ruling ſtudy: He may contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate religious ceremonies in Judea, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy in Chaldaea, the polite arts in Greece, war in Rome, trade in Holland, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Italy, Philoſophy in France, and all theſe in Great-Britain, Ireland and here. In ſhort, the arguments which probability and moral certainty furniſh for hiſtorical deductions, are no where more exuberant than in the copiouſneſs of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And though a regular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion profeſſedly for this deſign would be laborious, tedious, and perhaps in the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036948_0065_100B54B76F095608"/>end nugatory, or at leaſt inſufficient, yet the incidental remarks of any perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the extent of language, muſt be highly eſtimable, as ſtrongly conducive, and always coinciding with truth.</p>
            <p>IN copiouſneſs of words and univerſality of expreſſion, the Engliſh far exceeds not only the ancient, but even the modern languages. It has indeed been generally equalled by the Greek in the richneſs of ſynonimous terms: but in that tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental extent of words, whereby we are enabled to give utterance to almoſt every idea, it ſtands, perhaps, without a rival.</p>

            <p>THESE inſtances, with numberleſs others that might eaſily be adduced, ſuggeſt the nature of ſynonimes; they have the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar character of reſemblance, and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance makes us indifferent in the uſe of them; but, on a nearer view, we ſhall find, that each has peculiar and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036948_0067_100B54BB2BA35B30"/>ideas; and that in the choice and uſe of theſe, delicacy, preciſion, and taſte is diſplayed.

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036948_0068_100B54BE4847D7B0"/>are daily found requiſite. <note n="*" place="bottom">It is pleaſant enough to ſee how this copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has been exemplified by authors.

THAT the language of <hi>Greece</hi> ſhould be found inadequate to the fulneſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern knowledge is not to be wondered at, conſidering the early period of its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: It ſhould rather excite our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find a people perpetually involved in domeſtic feuds and external wars, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo rapid a proficiency in literary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; and by their application and happy genius, attaining a knowledge of which their immediate ſucceſſors were too indolent even to receive information.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations, however, though they redound to the honor of Greece, yet infer ſuch a deficiency in her acquirements, as plainiy declare her language incomplete in point of copiouſneſs. The Greek is a very polite or affectionate language; the mode of addreſs is always in the ſuperlative degree; as <hi>Philtate, Beltiſte,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IT is to modern times alone that we are
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036948_0072_100B54C7542B3158"/>to look for a language fraught with all the inſtruments of knowledge: And where ſhould we more naturally expect to meet with ſuch a one, than in that country which has produced the moſt illuſtrious adepts in every intellectual ſcience?</p>
            <p>AFTER allowing theſe encomiums to the Engliſh language which it ſo juſtly merits, it is ſomewhat irkſome to deſcend to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion. But there is one inſtance, which however trivial, yet appears ſo ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deviation from its general character, that it would be partiality not to mention it. Amid the unbounded richneſs and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riancy of our tongue, one word, <hi>Love,</hi> ſeems to ſtand without any ſynonimous or appropinquating expreſſion. The ardour of lovers generally ſurmounts this obſtacle by the reſource of Tropes and Figures: But ſtrictly ſpeaking, though there are a thouſand different modifications of this paſſion, and a thouſand different degrees
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:036948_0073_100B54C981142F20"/>of its energy and delicacy; yet, the moſt refined ſenſibility can ſay no more, than the moſt depraved luſt, <hi>I love.</hi> The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had two words to expreſs their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by, <hi>Diligo</hi> and <hi>Amo</hi>; but the Greeks had (if I may uſe the expreſſion) a correct and regular ſcale of paſſion, as, <hi>Phileō, agapaō, eraō &amp; potheō, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>IT has often been ſaid that our attention ſhould not be arreſted by words, but ſhould be fixed on things; that grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſquiſitions are puerile contentions; and ſuch like common-place contumelies againſt philological inveſtigations. But can any one reſlect for a moment, without acknowledging, that our thoughts can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſatisfactorily adjuſted, nor correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imparted, unleſs we poſſeſs words aptly accommodated to them; and conſequently that the improvement of language muſt ever keep pace with the progreſs of the underſtanding.

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:036948_0074_100B54CB0A62A160"/>which knowledge muſt be cloathed: and, like our bodily veſture, may either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber, diſguiſe, and obſcure it, or may diſtinguiſh its rank, diſplay its ſtrength, and enhance its native beauty.</p>
            <p>IT is the duty of philology to interpoſe for the welfare of mankind. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of language upon thought has, in all ages and countries, been conſiderable. Poverty of language circumſcribes the flight of ideas: inaccuracy of expreſſion precludes preciſion of thought, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal words generate erroneous opinions.</p>
            <p>THE ancients, eſpecially the Greeks and Romans, took conſiderable pains to poliſh and improve their languages; and in modern times ſome of the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed men in England and France have not diſdained to employ their talents in the ſame way. And if propriety of ſpeech be worthy of ſuch attention when we
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036948_0075_100B54CD271A6040"/>conſider it as miniſtering to the ordinary intercourſe of mankind; with how much more ſtrictneſs ſhould we regard it when we conſider it as the agent of philoſophic preciſion.</p>
            <p>AFTER having firſt attended to our language, which is naturally entitled to pur chief regard, our next attention ſhould be turned to that, by means of which the intercourſe of the learned in different parts of the world is moſt generally upheld.—</p>

<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036948_0079_100B54D639A6F4F8"/>general and higher importance; although, to preſerve the reputation of a ſcholar and a man of ſenſe and judgement, a logical connection muſt be preſerved from the beginning to the end: Such compoſitions do much better in a cloſet, or for a ſelect company; than in a mixt congregation, where it acts only as an opiate, and where its ſoperiferous effects are viſible in the half-cloſed eye lids of the auditors. The heavy and unintereſting ſtyle of many preachers, both as to compoſition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery is to be lamented. The various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonations of the voice, and lively correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding action (which Tully happily calls eloquentia corporis, the eloquence of the body) <note n="*" place="bottom">Magna eloquentia ſicut flamma, materia alitur, &amp; motibus excitatur &amp; utendo clereſcit.— <bibl>Tac. 487.</bibl>

In like manner, we never perceive the full force and impreſſion of the ſublime truths of the revelation, but when accompanied with animated deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which keeps the attention upon the ſtretch without tiring, and ſtrikes the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; hence, the animal ſpirits take a new direction, the moving fibres are ſhaken, the ſoul is moved, and reaſon appears triumphant; <hi>then</hi> it is that we feel ourſelves <hi>changed, converted, regenerated.</hi>

            <p>I abhor the wild rants of fanatics, who if they ſubdue one vice, plant in its ſtead ſome wretched unmeaning dogma. The wild ravings of Cromwell's ſaints, kept up a high degree of fanaticiſm, the only Palladium of that artful and bloody impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The famous Tycho Brache, writing to a friend, and praiſing an excellent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher who happened to be a good Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician, ſaid—I wiſh there were many ſuch preachers who underſtood Geometry
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:036948_0081_100B54DA7A57B310"/>well; for, then, perhaps, we ſhould have more inſtances of cautious and ſolid judgment, and fewer of idle diſputes and logomachies.</p>
            <p>THE propoſed end of preaching is the inſtruction of the people in the practice of virtue, which ſhould be impreſſed upon the hearers, avoiding all queſtions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, as only productive of diſſention; however, the clergy ſhould be maſters of controverſial divinity, and prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the attack of the infidel or caviller. When controverſial divinity is inculcated, there ſhould be full opportunity for reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go hand in hand with argument, which cannot eaſily be done in a limited diſcourſe from the pulpit.</p>
            <p>WHERE preachers are more ſolicitous to eſtabliſh favorite opinions of their own, than to inculcate that divine ſyſtem of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, which the goſpel diſpenſes for the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:036948_0082_100B54DC996AD9E8"/>regulation of our conduct; where congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations have been continually wearied with abſtract reaſoning, which ſeldom ſatisfies the moſt learned, and rather ſilences, than convinces the enquiring mind; where men have endeavored to explain myſteries, ſome of which are inexplicable, and others not to be underſtood, but by perſevering ſtudy; the conſequence has been, that many have been driven into diſguſt from liſtening to preachers, from whom they could reap no advantage, and others have been induced to view chriſtianity rather as a ſyſtem of ſpeculative opinions, than as a religion, the beſt calculated to promote the happineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>THERE is not a book on earth, ſo favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all the kind, and all the ſublime affections; or ſo unfriendly to hatred and perſecutions; to tyranny, injuſtice and every ſort of malevolence, as the goſpel. It breathes nothing throughout, but mercy,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:036948_0083_100B54DE244B4280"/>benevolence and peace. All the genius and learning of the heathen world; all the penetration of Pythagoras, Socrates and Ariſtotle, had never been able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a ſyſtem of moral duty, and ſo rational an account of providence and of man, as are to be found in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Chriſtian charity, which ought to regulate mens diſpoſitions, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated from the pulpit, as the baſis of order and happineſs among mankind; for the poſitive and contentious, the rude and quarrelſome (whether preachers or hearers) are the peſt of ſociety. How ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appears a good diſpoſition, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted with a malicious or envious one, which wraps itſelf up in its own narrow intereſt, looks with an evil eye on the ſucceſs of another, and, with an unnatural ſatisfaction, feeds on his diſappointments or miſeries: If mankind would be happy, let them guard againſt this malignant ſpirit:
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:036948_0084_100B54E0DA24FA58"/>Let them ſtudy that charity which thinketh no evil.</p>
            <p>THE general decay of piety, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing depravity of morals, with which the preſent age ſeems too juſtly changeable, deſerve the ſerious attention of every friend to religion and ſociety.</p>
            <p>THE natural weakneſs of the human mind, has rendered it at all times ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of thoſe impreſſions, which free-thinkers and atheiſts have arfully attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And the ignorant and unſuſpiciou: have too often been deluded by the moſt abominable doctrines, conveyed under a ſubtile diſguiſe. To prevent conſequences ſo deſtructive to the preſent and future happineſs of mankind, nothing ſeems more neceſſary or effectual, than the cultivation of knowledge, through every rank of life: <hi>That</hi> kind of knowledge particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which may convey to the mind ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:036948_0085_100B54E2F77FB3E0"/>evidence of its own imperfection, and the infinite wiſdom of its creator.</p>
            <p>To be convinced that there is a God, to us invinſible, whoſe exalted nature is far beyond the finite comprehenſion of man; it is requiſite that we acquire ſome humiliating ideas of ourſelves, and avoid the wretched error of thoſe who, attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much to human reaſon, deny the exiſtence of every thing they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
            <p>THE narrow limits of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the boundleſs perfection of the deity, are no uncommon ſubjects of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit eloquence: The facts are often preſſed upon our minds, and frequently (it muſt be hoped) have the proper effect. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, however, there ſeems yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary toward the conviction of mankind, which might reach more generally the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent claſſes of ſociety—guard them
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:036948_0086_100B45928E1DB948"/>againſt the attacks of irreligion—and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in their minds a firm perſuaſion of God's abſolute exiſtence and power.</p>
            <p>THE church is the only ſchool where the public mind can be ſaid to be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and its morals formed; and where we are to learn the neceſſary duties towards our creator and each other. Even here, ſome divines ſeem too inattentive to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the firſt importance—they apply themſelves principally to the conſideration of moral truth, and ethical ſyſtems, that teach men thoſe common duties in ſociety, which even conſcience itſelf will dictate: but the belief of a Deity on which the whole ſuperſtructure of religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue muſt be founded, is taken for granted, or ſcarcely ever inforced.</p>
            <p>IT may be anſwered, that ſubjects which require a mode of diſcuſſion above the comprehenſion of common capacities, are
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:036948_0087_100B54E7CBB17C08"/>not the moſt eligible for the pulpit; and that the exiſtence of a Deity, being the firſt principle of a Chriſtian's creed, needs no enquiry before a Chriſtian congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how often is the mind found to give its aſſent to propoſitions without proof? and though youth follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and perſuaſion of their parents, how little acquainted muſt they really be, with the true principles of their faith, until they arrive at a maturity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, capable of diſcriminating between truth and deluſion? Nay we may ſafely aſſert, that this imperfect degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a misfortune attendant on far the greateſt part of mankind; and if ſo, how liable muſt they be to impoſitions? How eaſily ſhaken in their belief? How readily led from a ſtate of ignorance to that of ſcepticiſin, and from thence to infidelity? But as it is the <hi>fool</hi> who ſays in his heart there is no God, ſo the more our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:036948_0088_100B54E95358E950"/>is encreaſed, our minds improved, and our faculties extended, the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent will be our belief of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truth: that the Deity, though inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the mortal eye, is yet perceivable to the rational mind, in <hi>theſe his lower works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us remark that the moſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory evidence, the ſtrongeſt proofs of a divine being, are deducible from our ſenſes; every object affords this proof; all nature demonſtrates the God of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and it is only neceſſary to lead the mind to a proper coutemplation of theſe objects, by diſcovering to it ſome of thoſe peculiar properties that before lay unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and it muſt yield to the propoſition unequivocal aſſent.</p>
            <p>RIGHTLY therefore has the Apoſtle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that the inviſible things of God (whereby he means his eternal power and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:036948_0089_100B54EB6E3963A8"/>Godhead) are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the things which are made.— Unfortunately indeed all mankind are not equally capable of diſcovering the nature of Gods works; and therefore they do not alike perceive his infinite power and wiſdom. Hence the neceſſity of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as the moſt uſeful, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the ſupport of piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>NOTHING can enlarge the mind more, than an extenſive view of the works of God. He who beſt knows the deſign and effect of things, will moſt clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their cauſe; and he who is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wiſdom, order, harmony, and uſe of the ſeveral parts of this ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſyſtem will ſoon cry out, "Theſe are thy glorious works, Parent of good?" THOUGH the pulpit perhaps is not ſo well calculated for arguments of this kind, yet the miniſters ſhould make ſuch
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:036948_0090_100B54ED8E2BEE00"/>attempts amongſt their hearers, and it would redound to the praiſe of this country, that whilſt other people are inſulting, and even dethroning, the majeſty of God, they were anxious to preſerve the knowledge of him, without which we deſerve not the name of men.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible much more might be ſaid on thoſe ſubjects, but I would not intrude upon your time and patience: An abler pen may perhaps improve theſe hints.</p>
            <p>IT is to be ſincerely hoped and wiſhed, that the faſcinating arts of oratory may attain perfection among the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe wide extended ſtates, and I truſt that yet I may be a witneſs of that improvement, which from every auſpice there is reaſon to foreſee. I expect that in whatever country I may be, your fame will reach me, when it ſhall be my greateſt boaſt to have been once in ſome ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Author's Syſtem of Logic, publiſhed at New-York in 1796.</note>
