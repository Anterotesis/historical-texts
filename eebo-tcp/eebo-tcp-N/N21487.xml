            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Reaſon of this work.</head>
            <p>IN that ſhort acquaintance I had with that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend learned ſervant of Chriſt, Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> he has often, from firſt to laſt, been importuning me to write a Directory for the ſeveral ranks of profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtians, which might diſtinctly give each one their portion; beginning with the Unconverted, and then proceeding to the babes in Chriſt and then to the Strong, and mixing ſome ſpecial helps againſt the ſeveral ſins that they are addicted to. By the ſuddenneſs of his motion at our firſt congreſs, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was on his mind before: and I told him, both that it was abundantly done by many already, and that his unacquaintedneſs with my weakneſs, might make him think me fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter for it than I was. But this did not ſatisfy him but ſtill he made it his requeſt. I confeſs I was not moved by his reaſons, nor did I apprehend any great need of doing more than is done in that way: nor that I was likely to do more: And therefore I parted from him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt purpoſe to anſwer his deſire. But ſince his death his words often came into my mind, and the great reverence I bore him, did the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline me to think with ſome complacency of his motion. And having of late intended to write a
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028243_0003_0FD74636D0329758"/>Family Directory, I began to apprehend how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly the forementioned work ſhould lead the way; and the ſeveral conditions of men's ſouls be ſpoken of, before we come to the ſeveral relations. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I reſolved, by God's aſſiſtance, to proceed in in order following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſpeak to the Impenitent Unconverted ſinners, who are not yet ſo much as purpoſing to turn, or at leaſt are not ſetting about the work. And with theſe I thought a wakening perſuaſive was a more neceſſary means than mere directions. For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections ſuppoſe men willing to obey them: but the perſons we have firſt to deal with, are wilful and faft aſleep in ſin, and as men that are paſt feeling, having given themſelves over to ſin with greedineſs, Eph. iv. 19. My next work muſt be for thoſe that have ſome purpoſes to turn, and are about the work, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o direct for a thorough and true converſion that they miſcarry not in the birth. The third part muſt be directions, for the younger and weaker ſort of Chriſtians, that they may be eſtabliſhed, built up and perſevere. The forth part, Directions for lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and backſliding Chriſtians, for their ſafe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Beſides theſe, there is intended ſome Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Directions againſt ſome ſpecial errors of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he times, and againſt ſome common killing ſins; as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or directions to doubting troubled conſciences, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s done already. And the ſtrong I ſhall not write directions for, becauſe they are ſo much taught in God already. And then the laſt part is intended more eſpecially for Families; as ſuch, directing the ſeveral Relations in their Duty; ſome of theſe are already written; whether I ſhall have life and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the reſt, God only knoweth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I publiſh the ſeveral parts by themſelves as I write them: and the rather becauſe they are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for men of different ſtates, and becauſe I would
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:028243_0003_0FD74636D0329758"/>not deter them by the bulk or price, from reading what is written for their benefit.</p>
            <p>The uſe that this part is publiſhed for is, 1. For Maſters and Parents to read often in their Families, if they have ſervants or children that are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted. 2. For all ſuch unconverted perſons to read and conſider of themſelves. 3. For the richer ſort that have any pity for ſuch miſerable ſouls, to give to the unſanctified that need them, (if they have not ſitter at hand to uſe or give.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord awaken us to work, while it is day, for the ſaving of our own and others ſouls, in ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to the Bleſſed God, the Maker, the Redeemer, and the Sanctifier of Souls.</hi>

If we ſaw a man killed and cut in pieces by the way, we would preſently aſk, <hi>Oh! who did this cruel deed?</hi> If the town was willfully ſet on fire, you would aſk, <hi>What wicked wretch did this?</hi> So when we read that the moſt will be firebrands of Hell forever, we muſt needs think with ourſelves, How comes this to paſs? and who is it long of? Who is it ſo cruel as to be the cauſe of ſuch a thing as this? and we can meet with few that will own the guilt. It is, indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by <hi>all, that Satan</hi> is the cauſe; but that doth not reſolve the doubt, becauſe he is not the principal cauſe. He doth not force men to ſin, but tempts them to it, and leaves it to their own wills whether they will do it or not. He doth not <hi>carry</hi> men to an alehouſe and force open their mouths, and pour in the drink; nor doth he hold them that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go to God's ſervice; nor doth he force their hearts from holy thoughts. It lieth therefore between God himſelf and the ſinner; one of them muſt needs be the principal cauſe of all this miſery, which ever it is, for there is no other to call it upon, and God diſclaimeth it, <hi>he</hi> will not take it upon him; and the <hi>wicked</hi> diſclaim it uſually, and they will not take it upon them, and this is the controverſy that is here managing in my text.</p>

Why will they die? The direct end of this exhortation is, that they may turn and live The ſecondary or reſerved ends upon ſuppoſition that this is not attained are theſe two: Firſt to convince them by the means which he uſed, that it is not long of God if they be miſerable.

               <p>As I need not ſtay to open theſe texts, which are ſo plain, ſo I think I need not add any more of that multitude which ſpeak the like. If thou be a man that doſt believe the word of God, here is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enough to ſatisfy thee, that the wicked muſt be Converted or Condemned. You are already brought ſo far, that you muſt either confeſs that this is true, or ſay plainly, you will not believe the word of God. And if once you be come to that paſs, there is but ſmall hopes of you, look to yourſelves as well as you can, for it is like you will not be long out of hell. You would be ready to fly in the face of him that ſhould give you the lie; and yet dare you give the lie to God? But if you tell God plainly you will not believe him, blame him not if he never warn you more, or if he forſake you, and give you up as hopeleſs; for to what purpoſe ſhould he warn you, if you will not believe him? Should he ſend an angel from heaven to you, it ſeems you would not believe.

If he be not to be believed, then all the angels in heaven are not to be believed. And if you ſtand on theſe terms with God, I ſhall leave you till he deal with you in a more convincing way. God hath a voice that will make you hear. Though he entreat you to hear the voice of his goſpel, he will make you hear the voice of his condemning ſentence,

Converſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation are both of them awakening things, and one of them will make you feel ere long, I can foretell it as truly as if I ſaw it with my eyes, that either grace or hell will ſhortly bring theſe matters to the quick, and make you ſay, <hi>What have I done? what a fooliſh wicked courſe have I taken?</hi> The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028243_0009_0FD74647EE1D3CA0"/>ſcornful and the ſtupid ſtate of ſinners will laſt but a little while; as ſoon as they either <hi>turn or die,</hi> the preſumptuous dream will be at an end, and then their wits and feeling will return.</p>
                  <p>BUT I ſoreſee there are two things that are like to harden the unconverted, and make me loſe all my labour, except they can be taken out of the way; and that is the miſunderſtanding of thoſe two words, (The wicked) and (Turn.) Some will think to themſelves, it is true the wicked muſt turn or die; but what is that to me, I am not wicked, though I am a ſinner, as all men be: Others will think, 'it is true that we muſt turn from our evil ways, but I am turned long ago, I hope this is not now to do.' And thus while wicked men think they are not wicked, but are already converted, we loſe all our labour in perſuading them to turn. I ſhall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before I go any farther, tell you here who are meant by the wicked; and who they be that muſt turn or die; and alſo what is meant by turning, and who they be that are truly converted: And this I have purpoſely reſerved for this place, preferring the method that fits my end.</p>
                  <p>And here you may obſerve, that in the ſenſe of the text, a wicked man and a converted man are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. No man is a wicked man that is converted; and no man is a converted man that is wicked; ſo that to be a wicked man and to be an unconverted man, is all one; and, therefore, in opening one, we ſhall open both.</p>
                  <p>Before I can tell you what either wickedneſs or converſion is, I muſt go to the bottom and fetch up the matter from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>It pleaſed the great Creator of the world to make three ſort of living creatures: <hi>Angels</hi> he made pore ſpirits without fleſh, and therefore he made them only for heaven, and not for to dwell on earth.—
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028243_0010_0FD74649599EB740"/>
                     <hi>Brittes</hi> were made fleſh without immortal ſouls, and therefore they were made only for earth, and not for heaven.—<hi>Man</hi> is of a middle nature, between both, as partaking of both fleſh and ſpirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was made both for heaven and earth. But as his fleſh is made to be but a ſervant to his ſpirit, ſo is he made for earth, but as his paſſage or way to heaven, and not that this ſhould be his home or happineſs. The bleſſed ſtate that man was made for, was to behold the glorious majeſty of the Lord, and to praiſe him among his holy angels, and to love him, and be filled with his love forever. And as this was the end that man was made for, ſo God did give him means that were fitted to the attaining of it. Theſe means were principally two: For the right inclination and diſpoſition of the mind of man. Secondly, the right ordering of his life and practice. For the firſt, God ſuited the diſpoſition of man unto his end, giving him ſuch knowledge of God as was fit for his preſent ſtate, and a heart diſpoſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to God in holy love. But yet he did not ſin, or confirm him in this condition, but, having made him a free agent, he left him in the hands of his own free will. For the ſecond, God did that which belonged to him; that is, he gave him a perfect law, required him to continue in the love of God, and perfectly to obey him. By the wilful breach of this law, man did not only forfeit his hopes of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, but alſo turned his heart from God, and fixed it on theſe lower fleſhy things, and hereby did blot out the ſpiritual image of God from his ſoul; ſo that man did both fall ſhort of the glory of God, which was his end, and put himſelf our of the way by which he ſhould have attained it, and this both as to the frame of his heart, and of his life. The holy inclination and love of his ſoul to God he loſt, and, inſtead of it, he contracted an inclination and love to the pleaſing of his fleſh, or carnal ſelf, by
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028243_0010_0FD74649599EB740"/>earthly things; growing ſtrange to God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the creature: And the courſe of this life was ſuited to the bent and inclination of his heart; he lived to his carnal ſelf, and not to God; he ſought the creature for the pleaſing of his fleſh, inſtead of ſeeking to pleaſe the Lord. With this nature or corrupt inclination we are all now born into the world; <hi>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> Job xiv. 4. As a lion hath a fierce and cruel nature before he doth devour: and an adder hath a venomous nature before ſhe ſtings, ſo in our infancy we have thoſe ſinful natures or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, before we think or ſpeak, or do amiſs; and hence ſpringeth all the ſin of our lives; and not only ſo, but when God hath, of his mercy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided us a remedy, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be the Saviour of our ſouls, and bring us back to God again, we naturally love our preſent ſtate, and are loth to be brought out of it, and therefore are ſet againſt the means of our recovery, and though cuſtom hath taught us to thank Chriſt for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, yet carnal ſelf perſuadeth us to refuſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and to deſire to be excuſed when we are commanded to take the medicines which he offereth, and are called to forſake all and follow him to God and glory.</p>
                  <p>I pray you read over this leaf again, and mark it, for in theſe few words you have a true deſcription of our natural ſtate, and conſequently of a wicked man; for every man that is in this ſtate of corrupted nature is a wicked man, and in a ſtate of death.</p>
                  <p>By this alſo you are prepared to underſtand what it is to be converted; to which end you muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know, that the mercy of God, not willing that man ſhould periſh in his ſin, provided a remedy, by cauſing his ſon to take our nature, and being, in one perſon, God and man, to become a mediator between God and man, and by dying for our ſins on
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028243_0011_0FD7464C39F92408"/>the croſs, to ranſom us from the curſe of God, and the power of the devil; and having thus redeemed us, the Father hath delivered us into his hands as his own. Hereupon the Father and the mediator do make a new law and covenant for man, not like the firſt, which gave life to none but the perfectly obedient, and condemned man for every ſin; but Chriſt hath made a law of grace, or a promiſe of pardon and everlaſting life to all that, by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and by faith in Chriſt, are converted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; like an act of oblivion, which is made by a prince to a company of rebels, on condition they will lay down arms and come in, and be loyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>But, becauſe the Lord knoweth that the heart of man is grown ſo wicked, that, for all this, men will not accept of the remedy if they be left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, therefore the Holy Ghoſt hath undertaken it as his office, to aſpire the apoſtles, and ſeal up the ſcriptures by miracles and wonders, and to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and convert the ſouls of the elect.</p>
                  <p>So that by this much you ſee, that as there are three perſons in the trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, ſo each of theſe perſons have their ſeveral works, which are eminently aſcribed to them.</p>
                  <p>The Father's works were, to create us, to rule us, as his rational creatures, by the law of nature, and judge us thereby, and, in mercy, to provide us a redeemer when we are loſt, and to ſend his ſon, and accept his ranſom.</p>
                  <p>The works of the Son, for us, were theſe: To ranſom and redeem us by his ſuffering and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to give out the promiſe or law of grace, and rule and judge the world as their redeemer on terms of grace, and to make interceſſion for us, that the benefits of his death may be communicated, and to ſend the Holy Ghoſt, (which the Father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth by the Son.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028243_0011_0FD7464C39F92408"/>
The works of the Holy Ghoſt, for us, are theſe, To indite the holy ſcriptures, by inſpiring and guiding the apoſtles and ſealing the word, by his miraculous gifts and works, and the illuminating and exciting the ordinary miniſters of the goſpel, and ſo enabling them and helping them to publiſh that word; and by the ſame word illuminating and converting the ſouls of men. So that, as you could not have been <hi>reaſonable creatures</hi> if the Father had not created you, nor have had any <hi>acceſs to God</hi> if the <hi>Son</hi> had not <hi>redeemed</hi> you, ſo neither can you have a part of Chriſt, or be ſaved, except the Holy Ghoſt do ſanctify yon.</p>
                  <p>So that, by this time, you may ſee the ſeveral cauſes of this work: The Father ſendeth the Son, the Son redeemeth us, and maketh the promiſe of grace; the Holy Ghoſt inditeth and ſealeth this goſpel; the apoſtles are the ſecretaries of the ſpirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t, and perſuade them to open it: and the Holy Ghoſt doth make their preaching effectual, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hearts of men to entertain it. And all this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>By this, which I have ſaid, you may ſee what it is to be wicked, and what it is to be converted; which, I think, will be yet plainer unto you, if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them as conſiſting of their ſeveral parts; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Firſt, He is one that placeth his chief content on earth, and loveth the creature more than God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>his fleſhy proſperity above the heavenly felicity;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028243_0012_0FD7465C58C90438"/>he favoureth the things of the fleſh, but neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth nor favoureth the things of the ſpirit; though he will ſay, that heaven is better than earth, yet doth he not really ſo eſteem it to himſelf. It he might be ſure of earth, he would let go heaven, and had rather ſtay here than be removed thither.— A life of perfect holineſs in the ſight of God, and in his love and praiſes forever in heaven, doth not find ſuch liking with his heart as a life of health, and wealth, and honour here upon earth: And though he falſely profeſſes that he loveth God above all, yet, indeed, he never felt the power of divine love within him, but his mind is more ſet on the world, or fleſhy pleaſures, than on God. In a word whoever loveth earth above heaven, and fleſhy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity more than God, is a wicked unconverted man.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, a converted man is illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to diſcern the lovelineſs of God, and ſo fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though he may read, and hear, and do much in the outward duties of religion, and forbear diſgraceful ſins, yet this is all but upon the by, and he never makes it the trade and principal buſineſs of his life to pleaſe God, and attain everlaſting glory, and puts off God with the leavings of the world, and gives him no more ſervice than the fleſh can ſpare, for he will not part with all for heaven.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, a converted man is one that makes it the <hi>principal care and buſineſs of his life to pleaſe God,</hi> and to be ſaved, and takes all the bleſſings of this life but as accommodations in his journey towards another life, and uſeth the creature in ſubordination unto God; he loveth an holy life, and longeth to be more holy; he hath no ſin but what he hateth, and longeth and prayeth, and ſtriveth to be rid of it. The drift and bent of his life is for God, and if he ſin, it is contrary to the very bent of his heart and life, and therefore he riſes again and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>amenteth it, and dare not wilfully live in any known ſin. There is nothing in this world ſo dear to him but he can give it up to God, and forſake it for him and the hopes of glory. All this you may ſee in Col. iii. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Matt. vi. 20, 33. Luke xviii. 22, 23, 29. Luke xiv. 18, 24, 26, 27. Rom. viii. 13. Gal. v. 24. Luke xii. 21, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſoul of a wicked man did never truly diſcern and reliſh the myſtery of redemption, nor thankfully entertain an offered Saviour, nor is he taken up with the love of the Redeemer, nor willing to be ruled by him as phyſician of his ſoul, that he may be ſaved from the guilt and power of his ſins, and recovered unto God; but his heart is inſenſible of this unſpeakable benefit, and is quite againſt the healing means by which he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028243_0013_0FD74660A7BA0370"/>Though he may be willing to be carnally religious, yet he never reſigneth up his ſoul to Chriſt, and to the motions and conduct of his word and ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the converted ſoul having felt himſelf undone by ſin and perceiving that he hath loſt his peace with God, and hopes of heaven, and is in danger of everlaſting miſery, doth thankfully entertain the tidings of redemption, and believing in the Lord Jeſus as his only Saviour, reſigning up himſelf to him for wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and redemption. He taketh Chriſt as the life of his ſoul, and liveth by him, and uſeth him as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſalve for every ſore, admitting the wiſdom and love of God in this wonderful work of man's redemption. In a word, Chriſt doth even dwell in their heart by faith, and the life that he now liveth is by the faith of the Son of God, that hath loved him, and gave himſelf for him, yea, it is not ſo much he that liveth, as Chriſt in him. For theſe, ſee Job. i. 11, 12. and iii. 19, 20. Rom. viii. 9. Phil. iii. 7, 8, 9, 10. Gal. ii. 20. Job xv. 2, 3, 4.1 Cor. i. 20. and ii. 2.</p>
                  <p>YOU ſee now in plain terms, from the word of God, who are the wicked, and who are the converted. Ignorant people think, that if a man be no ſwearer, nor curſer, nor railer, nor drunkard, nor fornicator, nor extortioner, nor wrong any body in their dealings, and if they come to church, and ſay their prayers, theſe cannot be wicked men. Or, if a man that hath been guilty of drunkenneſs, ſwearing, or gaming, or the like vices, do but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear them for the time to come, they think that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> been an enemy and ſcorner at godlineſs, do but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, and be hated for it by the wicked, as the godly are, that this muſt needs be a converted man. And ſome are ſo fooliſh as to think that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028243_0013_0FD74660A7BA0370"/>by taking up ſome new and falſe opinion; and falling into ſome dividing party, as anabaptiſts, quakers, papiſts, and ſuch like. And ſome think, if they have but been affrighted by the fears of hell, and had convictions, and gripes of conſcience, and thereupon have purpoſed and promiſed amendment, and take up a life of civil behaviour, and outward religion, that this muſt needs be true converſion. And theſe are the poor deluded ſouls that are like to loſe the benefit of all our perſuaſions: and when they hear that the wicked muſt turn or die, they think that this is not ſpoken to them; for they are not wicked, but are turned already. And, therefore, it is that Chriſt told ſome of the rulers of the Jews, who were greater and civiler than the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that <hi>publicans and haerlots do go into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt before them,</hi> Matt. xxi. 31. Not that an harlot, or groſs ſinner, can be ſaved without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but becauſe it was eaſier to make theſe groſs ſinners perceive their ſin and miſery, and the neceſſity of a change, when the civiler ſort do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude themſelves by thinking that they are converted already, when they be not.</p>
                  <p>O, ſirs, converſion is another kind of work than moſt are aware of: It's not a ſmall matter to bring an earthly mind to heaven, and to ſhew man the amiable excellencies of God, till he be taken up in ſuch love to him that can never be quenched; to break the heart for ſin and make him fly for refuge unto Chriſt, and thankfully embrace him as the life of his ſoul; to have the very drift and bent of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He hath a new underſtanding, a new will and reſolution, new ſorrows, and deſires and love, and delight; new thoughts, new ſpeeches, new company (if poſſible) and a new converſation. Sin, that before was a jeſting matter with him, is now ſo odious and terrible to him, that he flies from it as from death. The world, that was ſo lovely in his eyes, doth now appear but as vanity and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; God, that was before neglected, is now the only happineſs of his ſoul; before he was forgotten, and every laſt preferred before him; but now he is ſet next the heart, and all things muſt give place to him; and the heart is taken up in the attendance and obſervance of him; and is grieved when he hides his face; and never thinks itſelf well without him. Chriſt himſelf that was wont to be ſlightly thought of, is now his only hope and refuge, and he lives upon him as on his daily bread; he cannot pray without him, nor rejoice without him, nor think, nor ſpeak, nor live without him. Heaven itſelf, that before was looked upon but as a tolerable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The works of holineſs, which before he was weary of, and ſeemed to be more ado than needs, are now both his recreation, and his buſineſs, and the trade that he lives upon. The Bible, which was before to him but almoſt as a common book, is now as the law of God; as a letter written to him from heaven, and ſubſcribed with the name of the <hi>Eternal Majeſty,</hi> it is the rule of his thoughts, and words, and deeds; the commands are binding, the threats are dreadful,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028243_0014_0FD74661DE9E5160"/>and the promiſes of it ſpeak life to his ſoul. The godly, that ſeemed to him but like other men, are now the excellenteſt and happieſt on earth. And the wicked, that were his play-fellows, are now his grief; and he that could laugh at their ſin, is readier now to weep for their ſin and miſery, Pſal. xvi. 3. and xv. 4. Phil, iii. 18. In ſhort, he hath a new end in his thoughts, and a new way in his endeavours, and, therefore, his heart and life is new. Before, his carnal ſelf was his end; and his pleaſure and worldly profits and credit were his way: And now God and everlaſting glory is his end; and Chriſt and the ſpirit, and word, and ordinances. Holineſs to God, and righteouſneſs and mercy to men; theſe are his way. Before, ſelf was the chiefeſt ruler, to which the matters of God and conſcience muſt ſtoop and give place; and now God, in Chriſt, by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, word and miniſtry, is the chief ruler, to whom both ſelf, and all the matters of ſelf, muſt give place. So that, this is not a change in one or two, or twenty points, but in the whole ſoul, and the very end and bent of the converſation. A man may ſtep out of one path into another, and yet have his face the ſame way, and be ſtill going towards the ſame place, but it is another matter to turn quite back again, and take his journey the clean contrary way, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary place. So it is here, a man may turn from drunkenneſs to thriftineſs, and forſake his good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and other groſs diſgraceful ſins, and ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome duties of religion, and yet be ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028243_0015_0FD7466363652840"/>with his time, his parts, and his eſtate, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he uſed them; but now he aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Before, he would pleaſe God ſo far as might ſtand with the pleaſure of his fleſh, and carnal ſelf; but not to any great diſpleaſure of them.

Alas, this is fooliſh cheating of yourſelves. This is too much contempt of an endleſs glory; and too groſs neglect of your immortal ſouls. Can you make ſo ſlight of heaven and hell?

O what a place will you ſhortly be in of joy or torment! O what a ſight will you ſhortly ſee in heaven or hell! O what thoughts will ſhortly fill your hearts with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able delight or horror! What work will you be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in! to praiſe the Lord with ſaints and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or to cry out in fire unquenchable with devils; and ſhould all this be forgotten? And all this will be endleſs, and ſealed up by an unchangeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. Eternity, eternity will be the meaſure of your joys or ſorrows, and can this be forgotten? And all this is true, ſirs, moſt <hi>certainly true:</hi> When you have gone up and down a little longer, and ſlept and awakened a few times more, you will be dead and gone, and find all true that now I tell you, and yet can you now ſo much forget it! You ſhall then remember that you heard this ſermon, and that this day, or in this place, you were remembered of theſe
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028243_0016_0FD74664DE962B70"/>things; and perceive them matters a thouſand times greater than either you or I could here conceive; and yet ſhall they be now ſo much forgotten?</p>
                  <p>Beloved friends, if the Lord had not awakened me to believe, and lay to heart theſe things myſelf, I ſhould have remained in the dark and ſelfiſh ſtate, and have periſhed for ever; but if he have truly made me ſenſible of them, it will conſtrain me to compaſſionate you as well as myſelf. If your eyes were ſo far opened as to ſee hell, and you ſaw your neighbours, that were unconverted, dragged thither with hideous cries; though they were ſuch as you accounted honeſt people on earth, and feared no ſuch matter by themſelves, ſuch a ſight would make you go home and think of it, and think again, and make you warn all about you, as that damned worldling in Luke xvi. 28. would have had his brethren warned, leſt they come to that place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Why, faith is a kind of ſight; it is the eye of the ſoul, the evidence of things not ſeen: If I believe God, it is next to ſeeing: And, therefore, I beſeech you to excuſe me, if I be half as earneſt with you about theſe matters, as if I had ſeen them. If I muſt die to-morrow, and it were in my power to come again from another world, and tell you what I had ſeen, would you not be willing to hear me? And would you not believe and regard what I ſhould tell you? If I might preach one <hi>ſermon</hi> to you after I am dead, and have ſeen what is done in the world to come, would you not have me plainly ſpeak the truth, and would you not croud to hear me, and would you not lay it to heart? But this muſt not be; God hath his appointed way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you by ſcripture and <hi>miniſters,</hi> and he will not humour unbelievers ſo far as to ſend men from the dead to them, and to alter his eſtabliſhed way; if any man quarrel with the ſun, God will not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour him ſo far as to ſet him up a cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028243_0016_0FD74664DE962B70"/>Friends, I beſeech you regard me now, as you would do if I ſhould come from the dead to you; for I can give you as full aſſurance of the truth of what I ſay to you, as if I had been there and ſeen it with my eyes; for it is poſſible for one from the dead to deceive you; but Jeſus Chriſt can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you; the word of God, delivered in ſcripture, and ſealed up by miracles, and holy workings of the ſpirit, can never deceive you.

Now, as ever you believe the word of God, and as ever you care for the ſalvation of your ſoul, let me beg of you this reaſonable requeſt, and I beſeech you deny me not: That you would, without any more delay, when you are gone from hence, remember what you heard, and enter into an earneſt ſearch of your hearts, and ſay unto your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, It is ſo, indeed! Muſt I turn or die! Muſt I be converted or condemned! It is time for me, then, to look about me, before it be too late. O why did not I look after this till now? Why did I venturouſly poſt off or ſlubber over ſo great a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Was I awake, or in my wits! O bleſſed God, what a mercy is it that thou didſt not cut off my life all this while, before I had any certain hope of eternal life! Well, God forbid that I ſhould neglect this work any longer. What ſtate is my ſoul in? Am I converted, or am I not? Was ever ſuch a change or work done upon my ſoul? Have I been illuminated by the word and ſpirit of the Lord, to ſee the odiouſneſs of ſin, the need of a Saviour, the love of Chriſt, and the excellencies of God and glory? Is my heart broken, or humbled within me, for my former life? Have I thankfully entertained my Saviour and Lord, that offered himſelf with pardon and life for my ſoul? Do I hate my former ſinful life, and the remnant of every ſin that is in me? Do I fly from them as my deadly enemies?
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028243_0017_0FD7466B5D852CB8"/>Do I give up myſelf to a life of holineſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God? Do I love it, and delight in it? Can I truly ſay, that I am dead to the world and carnal ſelf, and that I live for God, and the glory which he hath promiſed? Hath heaven more of my eſtimation and reſolution than earth? And is God the deareſt and higheſt in my ſoul? Once, I am ſure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Is my heart now turned another way? Have I a new deſign and a new end, and a new train of holy affections? Have I ſet my hopes and heart in heaven? And is it not the ſcope, and deſign, and bent of my heart, to get well to heaven, and ſee the glorious face of God, and live in his love and praiſe? And when I ſin is it againſt the habitual bent and deſign of my heart? And do I conquer all groſs ſins, and am I weary and willing to be rid of my infirmities? This is the ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſouls. And this muſt be with me, or I muſt periſh. Is it thus with me, indeed, or is it not? It is time to get the doubt reſolved, before the judge reſolves it. I am not ſuch a ſtranger to my own heart and life, but I may ſomewhat perceive, whether I am thus converted or not: If I be not, it will do me no good to flatter my ſoul with falſe conceits and hopes. I am reſolved no more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive myſelf; but endeavour to know truly, off or on, whether I be converted, ye or no; that if I be, I may rejoice in it, and glorify my gracious Lord, and comfortably go on till I reach the crown; and if I am not, I may ſet myſelf on, beg and ſeek after the grace that ſhould convert me, and may turn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more delay: For, if I find it in time that I am out of the way, by the help of Chriſt I may turn and be recovered, but if I ſtay till either my heart be forſaken of God in blindneſs or hardneſs,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028243_0017_0FD7466B5D852CB8"/>or till I be catched away by death, it is then too late. There is no place for repentance and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then; I know it muſt be now or never.</p>
                  <p>Sirs, this is my requeſt to you, that you will but take your hearts to taſk, and thus examine them, till you ſee, if it may be, whether you are converted or not? And if you cannot find it out by your own endeavours, go to your <hi>miniſters,</hi> if they be faithful and experienced men, and deſire their aſſiſtance.—The matter is great, let not baſhfulneſs, nor care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs hinder you. They are ſet over you, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, for the ſaving of your ſoul, as phyſicians adviſe you for the curing of your bodies. It undoes many thouſands that they think they are in the way to ſalvation, when they are not; and think that they are converted, when it is no ſuch thing. And then, when we call to them daily to turn, they go away as they came; and think that this concerns not them; for they are turned already, and hope they ſhall do well enough in the way that they are in, at leaſt if they do pick the faireſt path, and avoid ſome of the fouleſt ſteps; when, alas, all this while they live but to the world, and fleſh, and are ſtrangers to God and eternal life; and are quite out of the way to heaven. And all this is much, becauſe we cannot perſuade them to a few ſerious thoughts of their condition, and ſpend a few hours in the examining of their ſtates: Is there not many a ſelf deceiving wretch that hears me this day, that never beſtowed one hour, or quarter of an hour, in all their lives, to examine their ſouls, and try whether they are truly converted or not? O merciful God, that will care for ſuch wretches that care no more for themſelves, and that will do ſo much to ſave them from hell, and help them to heaven, who will do ſo little for it themſelves! If all that are in the way to hell, and in the ſtate of damnation, did but know it, they durſt not continue in it. The greateſt hope that the

I do here in the name of the Lord of life, proclaim to you all that hear me this day, to the worſt of you, to the greateſt, to the oldeſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that you may have mercy and ſalvation, if you will but turn. There is mercy in God, there is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, the promiſe is free, and full, and univerſal; you may have life, if you will but turn. But then as you love your ſouls, remember what turning it is that Scripture ſpeaks of. It is not to mend the old houſe, but to pull down all, and build anew, on Chriſt the Rock and ſure Foundation. It is not to mend ſomewhat in a carnal courſe of life, but to mortify the fleſh, and live after the Spirit. It is not to ſerve the fleſh and the world, in a more reformed way, without any ſcandalous diſgraceful ſins, and with a certain kind of religiouſneſs; but it is to change your maſter, and your works, and end; and to ſet your face the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, and do all for the life that you never ſaw; and dedicate yourſelves, and all you have, to God. This is the change that muſt be made if you will live.</p>
               <p>Yourſelves are witneſſes now, that it is ſalvation, and not damnation, that is the great doctrine I preach to you; and the firſt part of my meſſage to you. Accept of this, and we ſhall go no further with you; for we would not ſo much as affright, or trouble you with the name of damnation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity.</p>
               <p>But if you will not be ſaved, there is no remedy but damnation muſt take place. For there is no middle palce between the two: You muſt have either life or death.</p>
               <p>And we are not only to offer you life, but to ſhew you the grounds on which we do it, and call you to believe that God doth mean, indeed, as he ſpeaks; that the promiſe is true, and extended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028243_0020_0FD74676DE7EF9F0"/>to you, as well as others; and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is no fancy, but a true felicity.</p>
               <p>If you aſk, where is your commiſſion for this offer, Among an hundred texts of ſcripture, I will ſhew it unto you in theſe few.</p>
               <p>Firſt, You ſee it here in my text, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes; and in the 18th of Ezek. as plain as can be ſpoken: and in 1 Cor. v. 17. xviii. 16. xx. 21. you have the very ſum of our commiſſion, "If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature: old things are paſt away, behold all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the miniſtry of reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf; not imputing their treſpaſſes to them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation: Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as tho' God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead be ye reconciled unto God; for he hath made him to be ſin for us, who know no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him." So Mark xvi. 15, 16. "Go ye into the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature; he that believeth, (that is, with ſuch a converting faith as is expreſſed) and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not, ſhall be damned." And Luke xxiv. 3640. Thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day, and that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (which is converſion) and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all nations." And Acts v. 30, 31. "The God of our fathers raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins." And Acts xiii. 38, 39. "Be it known unto you, therefore men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, That through this man is preached unto you
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028243_0020_0FD74676DE7EF9F0"/>the forgiveneſs of ſins; and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes." And leſt you think this offer is reſtrained to the Jews, ſee Gal. vi. 13. "For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature." And Luke xiv. 17. "Come, for all things are now ready." And verſe 22, 24.</p>
               <p>You ſee by this time that we are commanded to offer life to you all, and to tell you from God, that if you will turn, you may live.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſafely truſt your ſouls; for the love of God is the fountain of this offer. Job iii. 16. and the blood of the Son of God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it; the faithfulneſs and truth of God is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to make the promiſe good; miracles oft ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the truth of it; preachers are ſent through the world to proclaim it; the ſacraments are inſtituted and uſed for the ſolemn delivery of the mercy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them that will accept it; and the ſpirit doth open the heart to entertain it, and is itſelf the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the full poſſeſſion. So that the truth of it is paſt controverſy, that the worſt of you all, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you, if you will but be converted, may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if thou will needs believe that you ſhall be ſaved without converſion, then you believe a falſehood; and if I ſhould preach that to you, I ſhould preach a lie: This were not to believe God, but the devil and your own deceitful hearts. God hath his promiſe of life, and the devil hath his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life. God's promiſe is. <hi>Return and live.</hi> The devil's promiſe is, <hi>You ſhall live, whether you turn or not.</hi> The words of God are as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you. <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Matth. xviii. 3. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> John iii. 3, 5. <hi>Without holineſs none ſhall ſee
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028243_0021_0FD7467B3ABD1048"/>God,</hi> Heb. xii. 14. The devil's word, <hi>You may be ſaved without being born again and converted; you may do well enough without being holy; God doth but frighten you; he is more merciful than to do as he ſaith; he will be better to you than his word.</hi> And alas, the greateſt part of the world believe this word of the devil, before the word of God; juſt as our firſt ſin and miſery came into the world. God ſaith to our firſt parents, <hi>If ye eat ye ſhall die:</hi> And the devil contradicted him, and ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall not die;</hi> and the woman believed the devil before God. So now the Lord ſaith, <hi>Turn or die:</hi> And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſaith, <hi>You ſhall not die, if you do but cry God's mercy at laſt, and give over the acts of ſin when you can practice it no longer.</hi> And this is the word that the world believes. O heinous wickedneſs, to believe the devil before God!</p>
               <p>And yet that is not the worſt, but blaſphemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly they call this <hi>a believing and truſting in God,</hi> when they put him in the ſhape of <hi>Satan,</hi> who was a liar from the beginning; and when they believe that the word of God is a lie, they call this a <hi>truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God,</hi> and ſay they believe in him, and truſt on him for ſalvation: Where did ever God ſay, That the unregenerate, unconverted, unſanctified, ſhall be ſaved? Shew ſuch a word in ſcripture. I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge you if you can. Why this is the devil's word, and to believe it is to believe the devil, and the ſin that is commonly called preſumption; and do you you call this a <hi>believing and truſting in God?</hi> There is enough in the word of God to comfort and ſtrengthen the hearts of the ſanctified; but not a word to ſtrengthen the hands of wickedneſs, nor to give men the leaſt hope of being ſaved, though they be never ſanctified.</p>
               <p>But if you will turn, and come into the way of mercy, the mercy of the Lord is ready to entertain you. Then truſt God for ſalvation, boldly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently; for he is engaged by his word to ſave you.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028243_0021_0FD7467B3ABD1048"/>He will be a father to none but his children, and he will ſave none but thoſe that forſake the world, the devil, and the fleſh, and come into his family to be members of his Son, and have communion with his ſaints. But if they will not come in, it is long of themſelves: His doors are open; he keeps none back; he never ſent ſuch a meſſenger as this to any of you; <hi>It is now too late: I will not receive thee though thou be converted.</hi> He might have done ſo, and done you no wrong; but he did not: he doth not to this day: He is ſtill ready to receive you, if you were but ready unfeignedly, and with all your heart to turn. And the fulneſs of this truth will yet more appear in the two following doctrines, which I ſhall therefore next proceed to, before I make any further application of this.</p>

               <p>Having given you thoſe neceſſary diſtinctions, I ſhall next apply them to the caſe in hand, in theſe following propoſitions:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It is the <hi>gloſs of the word and creatures,</hi> that in this life we muſt know God, and ſo according to the nature of man we aſcribe to him <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and will,</hi> removing all the imperfections that we can, becauſe we are capable of no higher poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conceptions of him.</item>
                  <item>2. And on the ſame grounds we do, with the ſcripture, diſtinguiſh between the acts of God's will, as diverſiſfied from the reſpects or the objects, though as to God's eſſence they are all one.</item>
                  <item>3. And the boldlier, becauſe that when we ſpeak of Chriſt, we have the more ground for it from his human nature.</item>
                  <item>4. And thus we ſay, that the <hi>ſimple complacency, will</hi> or <hi>love of God is</hi> to all that is <hi>naturally</hi> or <hi>morally good,</hi> according to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of its goodneſs, and ſo he hath pleaſure in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſalvation of all, which yet will never come to paſs.</item>
                  <item>5. And God, as ruler and law-giver of the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028243_0022_0FD7467C31B89788"/>world, had ſo far a practical will for their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to make them a free deed of gift of Chriſt and life, and an act of oblivion for all their ſins, ſo be it they will not unthankfully reject it, and to command his meſſengers to offer this gift to all the world, and perſuade them to accept. And ſo he doth all that, as <hi>law-giver or promiſer,</hi> belongs to him to do for their ſalvation.</item>
                  <item>6. But yet he reſolveth, as law-giver, that they that will not turn ſhall die; and as judge, when their day of grace is paſt, he will execute that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</item>
                  <item>7. So that he thus unfeignedly willeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of thoſe that never will be converted, but not as abſolute Lord with the fulleſt efficacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, nor as a thing which he reſolveth ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly come to paſs, or would engage all in his power to accompliſh. It is in the power of a prince to ſet a guard upon a murderer, to ſee that he ſhall not murder and be hanged; but if, upon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he forbear this, and do but ſend to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and warn and intreat them not to be murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I hope he may well ſay that he would not have them murder and be hanged; he takes no pleaſure in it, but rather that they forbear and live; and if he do no more for ſome, upon ſome ſpecial reaſon, he is not bound to do ſo by all. The king may well ſay to all murderers and felons in the land, "I have no pleaſure in your death, but rather that you would obey my laws and live, but if you will not, I am reſolved, for all this, that thou ſhalt die." The judge may truly ſay to the thief, or a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, "Alas, man, I have no delight in thy death; I had rather thou hadſt kept the law and ſaved thy life; but ſeeing thou haſt not, I muſt condemn thee, or elſe I ſhould be unjuſt." So, though God have no pleaſure in your damnation, and therefore call? upon you to return and live, yet he hath pleaſure
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028243_0023_0FD7467DC71E0968"/>of the demonſtration of his own juſtice, and the executing his laws, and therefore he is, for all this, fully reſolved, that if you will not be converted, you ſhall be condemned. If God were ſo much againſt the death of the wicked, as that he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do all that he can to hinder it, then no man ſhould be condemned, whereas Chriſt telleth you, that few will be ſaved. But ſo far God is againſt your damnation, as that he will teach you, and warn you, and ſet before you life and death, and offer you your choice, and command his miniſters to entreat you not to damn yourſelves, but accept his mercy, and ſo to leave you without excuſe; but if this will not do, and if ſtill you be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, he profeſſeth to you, he is reſolved of your damnation, and hath commanded us to ſay unto you in his name, verſe 8. <hi>O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſurely die!</hi> And Chriſt hath little leſs than ſworn it, over and over, with a <hi>verily, verily, except ye be converted, and born again, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Matth. xviii. 3. John iii. 3. Mark that he ſaith [<hi>you cannot.</hi>] It is in vain to hope for it, and in vain to dream that God is willing of it; for it is a thing that cannot be.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In a word, you ſee then the meaning of the text, that God, the great <hi>Lawgiver</hi> of the world, doth take no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn and live; though yet he be reſolved that none ſhall live but thoſe that turn; and as a <hi>Judge</hi> even delighteth in juſtice, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting his hatred of ſin, though not in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which they had brought upon themſelves, in itſelf conſidered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the proofs of the point, I ſhall be very brief in them, becauſe I ſuppoſe you eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it already.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The very <hi>gracious nature of God</hi> proclaimed; Exod. xxiv. 6. and xxvi. 6. and frequently elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> pleaſure in your death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God had more pleaſure in thy death, than in thy converſion and life, he would not have ſo frequently commanded thee in his word, to turn; he would not have made thee ſuch promiſes of life if thou wilt but turn; he would not have perſuaded thee to it by ſo many reaſons. The tenor of this goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel proveth the point.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And his commiſſion that he hath given to the miniſters of the goſpel, doth fully prove it. If God had taken more pleaſure in thy damnation, than in thy converſion and ſalvation, he would never have charged us to offer you mercy, and to teach you the way of life, both publicly, and privately; and to entreat and beſeech you to turn and live; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with your ſins, and tell you of your danger; and to do all that poſſibly we can for your converſion, and to continue patiently ſo doing, tho' you ſhould hate or abuſe us for our pains. Would God have done this, and appointed his ordinances for your good, if he had taken pleaſure in your death?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is proved alſo by the courſe of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. If God had rather you were damned than converted and ſaved, he would not ſecond his word with his works, and entice you by his daily kindneſs to himſelf, and give you all the mercies of this life, which are his means <hi>to lead you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Rom. ii. 4. and bring you ſo often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his rod to force you into your wits, he would not ſet ſo many examples before your eyes, no, nor wait on you ſo patiently as he doth from day to day, and year to year. Theſe be not ſigns of one that taketh pleaſure in your death. If this had been his delight, how eaſily could he have had thee long ago in hell? How oft, before this, could he have catcht thee away in the midſt of thy ſins, with a
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028243_0024_0FD746802E9EC0E0"/>curſe, or oath, or lie in thy mouth, in thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and pride, and ſenſuality? When thou wert laſt in thy drunkenneſs, or laſt deriding the ways of God, how eaſily could he have ſtopt thy breath, and tamed thee with his plagues, and made thee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in another world! Alas, how ſmall a matter is it for the Almighty to rule the tongue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſt rather, and tie the hands of the moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſecutor, or call the fury of the bittereſt of his enemies, and make them know that they are but worms? If he would but frown upon thee thou wouldſt drop into thy grave. If he gave commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to one of his guardian angels to go and deſtroy ten thouſand ſinners, how quickly would it be done! How eaſily can he lay thee upon the bed of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, and make thee lie roaring there in pain, and make thee eat the words of reproach which thou haſt ſpoken againſt his ſervants, his word, his workſhip, and his holy ways, and make thee ſend to beg their prayers, whom thou didſt deſpiſe in thy preſumption? How eaſily can he lay that fleſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gripes and groans, and make it too weak to hold thy ſoul, and make it more loathſome than the dung of the earth? That fleſh which now muſt have what it loves, and muſt not be diſpleaſed, though God be diſpleaſed, and muſt be humoured in meat and drink and clothes, whatever God ſay to the contrary, how quickly would the frowns of God conſume it? When thou waſt paſſionately defending thy ſin, and quarrelling with them that would have drawn thee from it, and ſhewing thy ſpleen againſt the reprover, and pleading for the works of darkneſs; how eaſily could God have ſnatched thee away in a moment, and ſet thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his dreadful majeſty, where thou ſhouldſt ſee ten thouſand times ten thouſand glorious angels waiting on his throne, and have called thee there to plead thy cauſe, and aſked thee, 'What haft thou
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028243_0024_0FD746802E9EC0E0"/>now to ſay againſt thy Creator, his truth, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or his holy ways? Now plead thy cauſe, and make the beſt of it thou canſt? Now, what canſt thou ſay, in excuſe of thy ſins? Now, give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thy worldlineſs and fleſhly life, of thy time, of all the mercies thou haſt had.' O how thy ſtubborn heart would have melted, and thy proud looks be taken down, and thy countenance be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palied, and thy ſtout words be turned into ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſilence, or dreadful cries, if God had but ſet thee at his bar, and pleaded his own cauſe with thee, which thou haſt here ſo maliciouſly pleaded againſt! How eaſily can he at any time ſay to the guilty ſoul, 'come away, and live in that fleſh no more till the reſurrection,' and it cannot reſiſt. A word of his mouth would take off the poiſe of thy preſen, life, and then all thy parts and powers would ſtand ſtill, and if he ſay unto thee, <hi>live no longer, or live in kell,</hi> thou couldſt not diſobey.</p>
               <p>But God hath yet done none of this, but hath patiently forborn thee, and mercifully upheld <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, and give thee that breath which thou didſt breathe out againſt him, and give thoſe mercies which thou didſt ſacrifice to thy fleſh; and afforded thee that proviſion which thou ſpenteſt to ſatisfy thy greedy throat: he gave thee every minute of that time which thou didſt waſte in idleneſs or drunkenneſs, or worldlineſs; and doth not all his patience and mercy ſhew that he deſired not thy damnation? Can the candle burn without the oil? Can your houſes ſtand without the earth to bear them? As well as you can live and hour without the ſupport of God. And why did he ſo long ſupport thy life, but to ſee when thou wouldſt bethink thee of the folly of thy ways, and return and live? Will any man purpoſely put arms into his enemies hands to reſiſt him, or hold a candle to a murderer that is killing his children, or to an idle ſervant that plays or
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028243_0025_0FD74682DF382830"/>ſleeps the while? Surely it is to ſee whether thou wilt at laſt return and live, that God hath ſo long waited on thee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is further proved by the ſufferings of his Son, that God taketh no pleaſure in the death of the wicked; Would he have ranſomed them from death at ſo dear a rate? Would he have aſtoniſhed angels and men by his condeſcenſion? Would God have dwelt in fleſh, and have come in the form of a ſervant, and have aſſumed humility into one perſon with the Godhead? And would Chriſt have lived a life of ſuffering, and died a curſed death for ſinners, if he had rather taken pleaſure in their death? Suppoſe you ſaw him but ſo buſy in preaching or healing of them, as you find him in Mark iii. 21. or ſo long in falling, as in Matth. iv. or all night in prayer, as in Luke vi. 12. or praying, with the drops of blood trickling from him inſtead of ſweat, as Luke xxii. 44. on ſuffering a curſed death upon the croſs, and pouring out his ſoul as a ſacrifice for our ſins. Would you have thought theſe the ſigns of one that delighteth in the death of the wicked!</p>
               <p>And think not to extenuate it by ſaying, that it was only f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If you had ſeen and heard him weeping, and bemoaning the ſtate of diſobedience in impenitent people, Luke xix. 41, 42. or complaining of their ſtubbornneſs, as Matth. xxiii, 37. "O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how oft would I have gathered thy children toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?" Or if you had ſeen
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028243_0025_0FD74682DF382830"/>and heard him on the croſs, praying for his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, <hi>(Father forgive them, for they know not what they do,)</hi> would you have ſuſpected that he had delighted in the death of the wicked; even of thoſe that periſh by their wilful unbelief? When God hath ſo loved (not only loved, but ſo loved) as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, (by an effectual faith) ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life: I think he hath hereby proved againſt the malice of men and devils, that he takes no pleaſure in the death of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but had rather they would turn and live.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly. If all this will not yet ſatisfy you, take his own word, that knoweth beſt his own mind, or at leaſt, believe his oath; but this leadeth me up to the fourth doctrine.</p>

Alas, to foreſee your everlaſting torments, and know not how to prevent them! To ſee how near you are to hell, and we cannot make you believe it and conſider it.

If we do not obey them, and honour them in baptizing the children of the moſt obſtinately wicked, and giving them the Lord's Supper, and doing all that they would have us, though never ſo much againſt the word of God, they will hate us, and rail at us; but if we beſeech them to confeſs, and forſake their ſin, and ſave their ſouls, they will not do it. We tell them if they will but turn, we will deny them none of the ordinances of God, neither baptiſm to their children, nor the Lord's ſupper to themſelves, but they will not hear us; they would have us to diſobey God, and damn our own ſouls to pleaſe them: and yet they will not turn and ſave their own ſouls to pleaſe God. They are wiſer in their own eyes than all their teachers; they rage and are confident in their own way, and if we would never ſo fain we cannot change them.

1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Should your fleſh be pleaſed before your Maker? Will you diſpleaſe the Lord, and diſpleaſe your teacher, and your godly friends, and all to pleaſe your brutiſh appetites, or ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires? Is not God worthy to be the ruler of your fleſh? If he ſhall not rule it, he will not ſave it; you cannot in reaſon expect that he ſhould.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Your fleſh is pleaſed with your ſin; but is your conſcience pleaſed? Doth not it grudge within you, and tell you ſometimes that all is not well, and that your caſe is not ſo ſafe as you make it to be; and ſhould not your ſouls and conſciences be pleaſed before that corruptible fleſh?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Queſt.</hi> But is not your fleſh preparing for its own diſpleaſure alſo? It loves the bait, but doth it love the hook? It loves the ſtrong drink and ſweet morſels; it loves its eaſe, and ſports, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; it loves to be rich and well ſpoken of by men, and to be ſomebody in the world; but doth it love the curſe of God? doth it love to ſtand trembling before his bar, and to be judged to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire? Doth it love to be tormented with the devils forever? Take all together, for there is no ſeperating ſin and hell, but only by faith and true converſion; if you will keep one, you muſt have the other. If death and hell be pleaſant to thee, no wonder then if you go on in ſin: But if they be not (as I am ſure they be not) then what if ſin be never ſo pleaſant, is is worth the loſs of life eternal? Is a little drink, or meat, or eaſe; is the good word of ſinners; is the riches of this world to be valued above the joys of heaven? Or are they worth the ſufferings of eternal ſire? Sirs, theſe queſtions ſhould be conſidered before you go any further, by every man that hath reaſon to conſider, and that believes he hath a ſoul to ſave or loſe.</p>
                  <p>Well, the Lord here ſwearing that he hath no pleaſure in your death, but rather that you would
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028243_0029_0FD746964F790770"/>turn and live; if yet you will go on and die rather than turn, remember it was not to pleaſe God that you did it; it was to pleaſe the world, and to pleaſe yourſelves. And if men will damn themſelves, to pleaſe themſelves, and run into endleſs torments for delight, and have not the wit, the hearts, the grace, to hearken to God, or man, that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, what remedy but they muſt take what they get by it, and repent it in another manner, when it is too late! Before I proceed any further in the application, I ſhall come to the next doctrine; which giveth me a fuller ground for it.</p>

(It is an happy aſſembly if it be not ſo with the moſt) hearken then to the voice of your Maker, and turn to him by Chriſt without delay. Would you know the will of God? Why this is his will, that you preſently turn. Shall the living God ſend ſo earneſt a meſſage to his creatures, and ſhould they not obey? 2. Hearken, then, all you that live after the fleſh; the Lord that gave thee thy breath and being, hath ſent a meſſage to thee from heaven; and this is his meſſage, <hi>turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?</hi> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Shall the voice of the Eternal Majeſty be neglected? If he do but terribly thunder, thou art afraid. O but this voice doth more nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

O but this word concerneth thy life or death everlaſting. It is both a command and an exhortation. As if he ſaid to thee, ["I charge thee upon the allegiance that thou oweſt to me thy Creator and Redeemer, that thou renounce the fleſh, the world and the devil, and turn to me that thou mayeſt live. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to entreat thee, as thou either loveſt or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him that made thee; as thou loveſt thine own life, even thine everlaſting life, turn and live; as ever thou would eſcape eternal miſery, turn, turn, for why wilt thou die?"] And is there a heart in man, in a reaſonable creature, that can once refuſe ſuch a meſſage, ſuch a command, ſuch an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this!

               <p>Hearken, then, all that love yourſelves, and all that regard your own ſalvation; here is the joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt meſſage that ever was ſent to the ears of man, <hi>"Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?"</hi> You are not yet ſhut up under deſperation.

But Chriſt hath removed this impediment, by the reaſon of his blood.

Well, Sirs, look inwards now, and tell me, how are your hearts affected with thoſe offers of the Lord? You hear what is his mind; he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in your death; he calls to you turn, turn; it is a fearful ſign if all this move thee not; or if it do but half move thee, and much more, if it make thee more careleſs in thy miſery, becauſe thou heareſt of the mercifulneſs of God. The working of the medicine will partly tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any bope of the cure. O what glad tidings would it be to thoſe who are now in hell, if they had but ſuch a meſſage from God! What a joyful word would it be to hear this, <hi>turn and live:</hi> Yea, what a welcome word would it be to thyſelf, when thou haſt felt that wrath of God but an hour! Or, if, after a thouſand, or ten thouſand years torment, thou couldſt but hear ſuch a word from God, <hi>turn and live,</hi> and yet wilt thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, and ſuffer us to return without our errand?</p>
               <p>Behold, ſinners, we are ſent here, as the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Lord, to ſet before you life and death: What ſay you? Which of them will you chooſe? Chriſt ſtandeth as it were, by thee, with heaven in the one hand, and hell in the other, and offereth thee thy choice, which wilt thou chooſe? <hi>The voice of the Lord maketh the rocks to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Pſal. xxvi. And is it nothing to hear him threaten thee, if thou wilt not turn? Doſt thou not underſtand and feel this voice, <hi>turn ye, turn ye, wky-will you die?</hi> Why? It is the voice of love, of infinite love, of thy beſt and kindeſt friend, as thou mighteſt eaſily perceive by the motion, and yet canſt thou neglect it? It is the voice of pity and compaſſion. The Lord ſeeth whither thou art going, better than thou doſt, which makes him call after thee, <hi>turn. turn.</hi>—He feeth what will become of thee, if thou turn not: He thinketh with himſelf; <hi>Ah! this poor ſinner will caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028243_0035_0FD746AE17C6A3B0"/>into endleſs torments if he do not turn: I muſt in juſtice deal with him according to my righteous law.</hi> And, therefore, he calleth after thee, <hi>turn, turn.</hi> O ſinner! If you did but know the thouſandth part as well as God doth, the danger that is near you, and the miſery that you are running into, we ſhall have no more need to call after you to turn.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this voice that calleth to thee, is the ſame that hath prevailed with thouſands already, and called all to heaven than are now there; and they would not now, for a thouſand worlds, that they had made light of it, and not turned to God. Now what are they poſſeſſing that turned at God's call? Now perceive that it was indeed the voice of love that meant them no more harm than their ſalvation, and if thou wilt obey the ſame call, thou ſhalt come to the ſame happineſs. There are mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions that muſt for ever lament that they turned not; but there is never a ſoul in heaven that is ſorry that they were converted.</p>
               <p>Well, ſirs, are you yet reſolved, or are you not? Do I need to ſay any more to you, what will you do? Will you turn or not? Speak man in thy heart to God, though thou ſpeak not out to me: Speak, leſt he take thy ſilence for denial. Speak quickly, leſt he never make thee the like offer more. Speak reſolvedly, and not waveringly; for he will have no indifferents to be his followers. Say in thy heart now, without any more delay, even before thou ſtir hence, "By the grace of God, I am reſolved preſently to turn. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know my own inſufficiency, I am reſolved to wait on God for his grace, and to follow him
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028243_0036_0FD746AF6B720648"/>in his ways, and forſake my former courſes and companions, and give up myſelf to the guidance of the Lord."</p>
               <p>Sirs, you are not ſhut up in the darkneſs of heatheniſm, nor in the deſperation of the damned; life is before you; and you may have it on reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms, if you will, yea on free coſt if you will accept it. The way of God lieth plain before you; the church open to you, you may have Chriſt and pardon, and holineſs, if you will. What ſay you? Will you, or will you not? If you ſay nay, or ſay nothing, and ſtill go on, God is witneſs, and this congregation is witneſs, and your own conſciences are witneſſes how fair an offer you had this day. Remember you might have had Chriſt, and would not; remember when you have loſt it, that you might have had eternal life, as well as others, and would not; and all becauſe you would not turn!</p>

               <p>A Strange diſputation it is, both as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and as to the diſputants.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The controverſy, or queſtion propounded to diſpute of, is, <hi>Why wicked men will damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> or, <hi>why they will rather die than turn;</hi> whether they have any ſufficient reaſon for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>The diſputants are God and man, the moſt holy God, and wicked unconverted ſinners.</p>

Is it not a ſtrange thing which God doth ſeem here to ſuppoſe, that any man ſhould be willing to die, and be damned, yea, that this ſhould be the caſe of the wicked; that is, of the greateſt part of the world? but you will ſay, this cannot be; 'for nature deſireth the preſervation and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of itſelf; and the wicked are more ſelfiſh than others, and not leſs, and therefore how can any man be willing to be damned?'</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, 1. It is a certain truth that no man can be willing of any evil as evil, but only as it hath ſome appearance of good; much leſs can any man be willing to be eternally tormented. Miſery, as ſuch, is deſired by none. 2. But yet for all that, it is moſt true which God here teacheth us, that the cauſe why the wicked die and are damned, is becauſe they will die and be damned. And this is true in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they will go the way that leads to hell; though they are told by God and man, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goes, and whither it ends, and though God hath ſo often profeſſed in his word, that if they hold on in that way, they ſhall be condemned; and that they ſhall not be ſaved, unleſs they turn. Iſa. xlviii. 22. and lvii. 21. <hi>There is no peace</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>unto the wicked,</hi> Iſa. lix. 8. <hi>The way of peace they know not; there is no judgment in their goings; they have made them crocked paths: Whoſoever goeth therein ſhall not keep peace.</hi> They have the word, and the oath of the living God for it, that if they will not turn, they ſhall not enter into his reſt. And yet wicked they are, and wicked they will be, let God and man ſay what they will; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028243_0037_0FD746B0AFA54400"/>they are, and worldlings they will be, though God hath told them that <hi>the love of the world is enmity to God, and that if any man love the world,</hi> (in that meaſure) <hi>the love of the father is not in him,</hi> Jam. iv. 4.1 John ii. 15. ſo that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe men are willing to be damned, though not directly; they are willing of the way to hell, and love the certain cauſe of their torment; though they be not willing of hell itſelf, and do not love the pain which they muſt endure.</p>
               <p>Is not this the truth of your caſe, ſirs? You would not burn in hell, but you will kindle the fire by your ſins, and caſt yourſelves into it; you would not be tormented with devils forever, but you will do that which will certainly procure it is deſpight of all that can be ſaid againſt it. It is juſt as if you would ſay, "I will drink this ratſbane, or other poiſon, but yet I will not die: I will ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> men, they will be wicked, and they will live after the fleſh, and the world, and yet they would not be damned. But do you not know that the means do lead unto the end? and that God hath, by his righteous law, concluded that ye muſt repent or periſh? He that will take poiſon, may as well ſay plainly, I will kill myſelf, for it will prove no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the end; though perhaps he loved it for the ſweetneſs of the ſugar that was mixt with it; and would not be perſuaded that it was poiſon, but that he might take it and do well enough; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028243_0037_0FD746B0AFA54400"/>his conceits and confidence that will ſave his life. So if you will be drunkards, or fornicators, or wordlings, or live after the fleſh, you may as well ſay plainly, we will be damned, for ſo you ſhall be unleſs you turn. Would you not rebuke the folly of a thief or murderer, that would ſay, I will ſteal, or kill, but I will not be hanged, when he knows that if he does the one, the judge in juſtice ſees that the other be done? If he ſay I will ſteal and murder, he may as well ſay plainly, I will be hanged; and if you will go on in a carnal life, you may as well ſay plainly, we will go to hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, the wicked will not uſe theſe means, without which there is no hope of their ſalvation: He that will not eat, may as well ſay plainly, he will not live, unleſs he can tell how to live without meat: He that will not go his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, may as well ſay plainly, he will not come to the end: He that falls into the water, and will not come out, nor ſuffer another to help him out, may as well ſay plainly, he will be drowned. So if you be carnal and ungodly, and will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, nor uſe the means by which you ſhould be converted, but think it more ado than needs, you may as well ſay plainly, you will be damned; for if you have found out a way to be ſaved without converſion, you have done that which was never done before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, this is not all, but the wicked are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, even of ſalvation itſelf, tho' they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſomewhat which they call by the name of Heaven, yet heaven itſelf, conſidered in the true nature of the felicity, they deſire not; yea, their hearts are quite againſt it. Heaven is a ſtate of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028243_0038_0FD746B2B9F956D0"/>perfect holineſs, and of continual love and praiſe to God, and the wicked have no heart to this. The imperfect love and praiſe, and holineſs which is here to be attained, they have no mind of; much leſs of that which is ſo much greater; the joys of heaven are of ſo pure and ſpiritual a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the heart of the wicked cannot truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them.</p>
               <p>So that by this time you may ſee, upon what ground it is that God ſuppoſeth, that the wicked are willing of their own deſtruction: They will not turn, tho' they muſt turn or die; they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venture on certain miſery, than be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then, to quit themſelves in their ſins, they will make themſelves believe that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs eſcape.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as this controverſy is matter of wonder that ever men ſhould be ſuch enemies to themſelves, and wilfully to caſt away their ſouls, ſo are the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants too. That God ſhould ſtoop ſo low, as thus to plead the caſe with man, and that man ſhould be ſo ſtrangely blind and obſtinate, as to need all this, in ſo plain a caſe; yea, and to reſiſt all this, when their own ſalvation lieth upon the iſſue.</p>
               <p>No wonder if they will not hear us, that are men, when they will not hear the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: As God ſaith, Ezek. iii. 7. when he ſent the prophet to the Iſraelites. ["The houſe of Iſrael will not hearken unto thee: For they will not kearken unto me: For all the houſe of Iſrael are impudent and heard hearted."] No wonder if they can plead againſt a miniſter, or a godly neighbour, when they will plead againſt the

The prieſt that deſpiſed his name, durſt aſk, "wherein have we deſpiſed thy name? and when they polluted his altar, and made the tables of the Lord contemptible, they durſt ſay, wherein have we polluted thee." Mal. i. 6, 7. But, "Wo unto him (ſaith the Lord) that ſtriveth with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker!

What ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou, unconverted ſenſual wretch? Dareſt thou venture upon a diſpute with God? Art thou able to confute him? Art thou ready to enter the liſts? God aſketh thee why wilt thou die? Art thou fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a ſufficient anſwer? Wilt thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove that God is miſtaken, and that thou art in the right! O what an undertaking is that? Why, either he or you is miſtaken, when he is for your converſion, and you are againſt it; he calls upon you to turn, and you will not; he bids you do it preſently, even to day, while it is called to day, and think it time enough hereafter. He ſaith it muſt be a total change, and you muſt be holy and new creatures, and born again: and you think that leſs may ſerve the turn, and that's enough to parch up the old man, without becoming new. Who is in the right now? God, or you? God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you to turn, and to live an holy life, and you will not: by your diſobedient lives it appears you will not. If you will, why do you not? Why have you not done it all this while? And why do you not fall upon it yet? Your wills have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our lives.

                  <p>I am ſure it can be no good reaſon, which is againſt the God of truth and reaſon. It cannot be light that is contrary to the ſun. There is no knowledge in any creature, but what it had from God; and therefore none can be wiſer than God. It were damnable preſumption for the higheſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to compare with his Creator; What is it then for a lump of dirt, an ignorant ſot, that knoweth not himſelf nor his own ſoul, that knoweth but little of the things that he ſeeth, yea, that is more ignorant than his neighbours, to ſet himſelf againſt the wiſdom of the Lord? It is one of the fulleſt diſcoveries of the horrible wickedneſs of carnal men, and the ſtark madneſs of ſuch as ſin, that ſo ſilly a mole dare contradict his maker, and call in queſtion the word of God; yea, that thoſe people in our pariſhes, that are ſo beaſtly ignorant that they cannot give us a reaſonable anſwer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very principles of religion, are yet ſo wiſe in their own conceit, that they dare queſtion the plaineſt truth of God, yea, contradict them and cavil againſt them, when they can ſcarce ſpeak ſenſe, and will believe them no further than agreeth with their fooliſh wiſdom.</p>

2. And as I know that God muſt needs be in the right, ſo I know the caſe is ſo palpable and groſs, which he pleadeth againſt, that no man can have reaſon for it. Is it poſſible that a man can have any reaſon to break his maker's laws, and reaſon to diſhonor the Lord of glory, and reaſon to abuſe the Lord that bought him? Is it poſſible, that a man can have any good reaſon to damn his own immortal ſoul? Mark the Lord's queſtion, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?</hi> Is eternal death a thing to be deſired?

Could you by every ſin obtain the higheſt thing upon earth that fleſh deſireth, it were of no conſiderable value to perſuade you in reaſon to commit it. If it were to pleaſe your greateſt or deareſt friends, or to obey the greateſt prince on earth, or to ſave your lives, or to eſcape the greateſt earthly miſery, all theſe are of no conſideration to draw a man, in reaſon to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of one ſin. If it were a right hand, or a right eye, that would hinder your ſalvation, it is
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028243_0040_0FD746B82B6C3600"/>the gainfulleſt way to caſt it away, rather than to go to hell to ſave it. For there is no ſaving a part when you loſe the whole. So exceeding great are the matters of eternity, that nothing in this world deſerveth once to be named in compariſon with them; nor can any earthly thing, though it were life, or crowns, or kingdoms, be a reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for the neglect of matters of ſuch high and everlaſting conſequence. A man can have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to croſs his ultimate end; Heaven is ſuch a thing, that if you loſe it, nothing can ſupply the want, or make up the loſs; and hell is ſuch a thing, that if you ſuffer it, nothing can remove your miſery, or give you eaſe and comfort, and therefore nothing can be a valuable conſideration to excuſe you for neglecting your own ſalvation: For, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to win all the world, and loſe his own ſoul? Mark</hi> viii. 36.</p>
                  <p>O Sirs, that you did but know what matters they are, that we are now ſpeaking to you of, the ſaints in heaven, you would have other kind of thoughts of theſe things, if the devil would come to them that live in the ſight and love of God, and ſhould offer them a cup of ale, or a whore, or merry company, or ſports to entice them away from God and glory, I pray you tell me, how do you think they would entertain the motion? Nay, or if he ſhould offer them to be Kings on the earth, do you think this would entice them down from heaven? O, with what hatred and holy ſcorn would they reject the motion! And why ſhould not you do ſo, that have heaven opened to your faith, if you had but faith to
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028243_0041_0FD746B9ABB70658"/>ſee it? There is never a ſoul in hell but knows, by this, that it was a mad exchange to let go heaven for fleſhy pleaſure, and that it is not a little mirth or pleaſure, or wordly riches, or the good will or word of men, that will quench hell fire, or make him a ſaver that loſeth his ſoul; O, if you had heard what I believe, if you had ſeen what I believe, and that on the credit of the word of God, you would ſay there can be no reaſon to warrant a man to damn his ſoul; you durſt not ſleep quietly another night, before you had reſolved to turn and live.</p>
                  <p>If you ſee a man put his hand in the fire till it burn off, you will marvel at it; but this is a thing that a man may have reaſon for, as <hi>Biſhop Gramaner</hi> had, when he burnt off his hand for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to popery. If you ſee a man cut off a leg, or an arm, it is a ſad ſight; but this is a thing that a man may have a good reaſon for, as many a man doth to ſave his life. If you ſee a man give his body to be burnt to aſhes, and to be tormented with ſtrappado's and racks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe deliverance when it is offered, this is a hard caſe to fleſh and blood; but this a man may have good reaſon for, as you may ſee in Heb. xi. 33, 34, 35, 36. and as many an hundred martyrs have done. But for a man to forſake the Lord that made him, and for a man to run into the fire of hell, when he is told of it, and intreated to turn, that he may be ſaved; this is a thing that can have no reaſon in the world, that is reaſon indeed, to juſtify or excuſe it. For heaven will pay for the loſs of any thing that we can loſe to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028243_0041_0FD746B9ABB70658"/>get it, or for any labour which we beſtow for it, but nothing can pay for the loſs of heaven.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you now, let this word come nearer to your heart, as you are convinced that you have no reaſon to deſtroy yourſelves, ſo tell me, what reaſon have you to refuſe to turn and live to God? What reaſon had the verieſt worldling, or drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, or ignorant careleſs ſinner of you all, why you ſhould not be as holy as any you know, and be as careful for your ſouls as any other? Will not hell be as hot to you as to others? Should not your own ſouls be as dear to you as theirs to them. Hath not God as much authority over you? Why then will you not become a ſanctified peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as well as they?</p>
                  <p>O ſirs, when God bringeth the matter down to the very principles of nature, and ſhows you, that you have no more reaſon to be ungodly than you have to damn your own ſouls, if yet you will not underſtand and turn, it ſeems a deſperate caſe that you are in.</p>
                  <p>And now, either you have reaſon for what you do, or you have not; If not, will you go on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon itſelf? Will you do that which you have no reaſon for? But if you think you have, produce them, and make the beſt of your matter. Reaſon the caſe a little with me your fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is far eaſier than to reaſon the caſe with God; tell me, man, here before the Lord, as if thou wert to die this hour, why ſhouldeſt thou not reſolve to turn this day, before thou ſtir from the place thou ſtandeſt in, what reaſon haſt thou to deny, or to delay? Haſt thou any reaſon that ſatisfieth thine own conſcience for it,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028243_0042_0FD746BEEAA5EC48"/>or any that thou dareſt own and plead at the bar, of God? If thou haſt, let us hear them, bring them forth, and make them good. But alas, what poor ſtuff, what nonſenſe, inſtead of reaſons, do we daily hear from ungodly men. But for their neceſſity, I ſhould be aſhamed to name them.</p>

Will you make, or buy a clock or watch, and daily look to it, and not care whether it go true or falſe? Surely, if you believe not a particular eye of Providence obſerving your hearts and lives, you cannot believe, or expect any particular Providence to obſerve your wants and tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or to relieve you; and if God had ſo little care for you as you imagine, you would never have lived till now, an hundred diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes would have ſtriven which ſhould firſt deſtroy you; yea, the devils would have haunted you, and fetched you away alive, as the great fiſhes devour the leſs, and as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous beaſts and birds devour others. You cannot think that God made man for no end or uſe, and if he made him for any, it was ſure for himſelf; and can you think he cares not whether his end be accompliſhed, and whether we do the worſt that we are made for.</p>
                  <p>Yea, by this atheiſtical objection, you make God to have made, and upheld all the world in vain: For what are all other lower crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

And hath God made ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an habitation, and ſet man to dwell in it, and made all his ſervants; and now doth he look for nothing at his hands, nor care how he thinks, or ſpeaks, or lives?

And were ye not told, that godlineſs was profitable to all things, having the promiſe of this life, and of that which is to come? 1 Tim. iv. 8. Did the ſins of profeſſors hinder you? You ſhould rather have been the more heedful, and learned by their falls, to beware, and have been the more careful, and not to be more careleſs; it was the ſcripture, and not their lives, that was your rule. Did the many opinions of the world hinder you? Why, the ſcripture, that was your rule, did teach you but one way, and that was the right way. If you had followed that, even in ſo much as was plain and eaſy, you ſhould never have miſcarried. Will not ſuch anſwers as theſe confound and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence you?

The clearneſs of the caſe, and the majeſty of God, will then eaſily ſtop the mouths of the moſt confident of you, though you will not be put down by any thing we can ſay to you now, but will make good your cauſe, be it never ſo bad.

                  <p>What ſay you, unconverted ſinners? Have you any good reaſons to give, why you ſhould not turn, and preſently turn with all your hearts? Or will you go to hell in deſpite of reaſon itſelf? Bethink you what you do in time, for it will ſhortly be too late to bethink you. Can you find any fault with God, or his work, or his wages? Is he a bad maſter? Is the devil, whom you ſerve, or is the fleſh a better? Is there any harm in an holy life? Is a life of worldlineſs and ungodlineſs better? Do you think in your conſciences that it would do you any harm to be converted and live an holy life? What harm can it do to you? Is it harm to you to have the Spirit of Chriſt within you, and to have a cleanſed purified heart? If it be bad to be holy, why doth God ſay, 'be ye holy, for I am holy! 1 Pet. i. 15, 16. Lev. xx. 7. Is it evil to be like God? Is it not ſaid, that God made man in his image? Why this holineſs is his image: this Adam loſt, and this Chriſt, by his word and ſpirit, would reſtore to you, as he doth to all that he will ſave. Why were you baptiſed into the Holy Ghoſt, and why do you baptiſe your children into the Holy Ghoſt, as your Sanctifier, if you will not be ſanctified by him, but think it an hurt to you to be ſanctified?
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028243_0047_0FD746D2D4C77158"/>Tell me truly, as before the Lord, though you are loth to live an holy life, had you not rather die in the caſe of thoſe that do ſo, than of others? If you were to die this day, had you not rather die in the caſe of a converted man, than of the unconverted? of an holy and heavenly man, than of a carnal earthly man? And would you not ſay as Baalam, Num. xxiii. 10. 'Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his!' And why will you not now be of the mind that you will be of then? firſt or laſt you muſt come to this, either to be converted, or to wiſh you had been when it is too late.</p>
                  <p>But what is it that you are afraid of loſing if you turn? Is it your friends: you will but change them: God will be your friend, and Chriſt and the Spirit will be your friend, and every chriſtian will be your friend. You will get one friend that will ſtand you in more ſtead than all the friends in the world could have done. The friends you loſe would have but enticed you to hell, but could not have delivered you; but the friend you get, will ſave you from hell, and bring you to his own eternal reſt.</p>
                  <p>Is it your pleaſures that you are afraid of loſing? You think you ſhall never have a merry day again, if once you be converted. Alas, that you ſhould think it a greater pleaſure to live in fooliſh ſports and merriments, and pleaſe your fleſh, than live in the believing thoughts of glory, and in the love of God, and in righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, in which the ſtate of grace conſiſleth, Rom. xiv. 17. If it be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſure for you to think of your lands and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028243_0047_0FD746D2D4C77158"/>inheritance (if you were Lord of all the country) than it is to a child to play for pins; why ſhould it not be a greater joy to you to think of the kingdom of Heaven being yours, than of all the riches or pleaſures of the world? As it is but fooliſh childiſhneſs that makes children ſo delight in gauds, that they would not leave them for all your lands; ſo it is but fooliſh worldlineſs and fleſhlineſs, and wickedneſs, that makes you ſo much delight in your houſes and lands, and meat and drink, and eaſe, and honour, as that you would not part with them for the heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. But what will you do for pleaſure, when theſe are gone? Do you not think of that? When your pleaſures end in horror, and go out with a ſtinking ſnuff, the pleaſures of the Saints are then at the beſt. I have had myſelf but a little taſte of the heavenly pleaſures in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of the bleſſed approaching day, and in the preſent perſuaſions of the love of God in Chriſt; but I have taken too deep a draught of earthly pleaſures, ſo that you may ſee, if I be partial, it is on your ſide; and yet I muſt profeſs from that little experience, that there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; there is more joy to be had in a day (if the ſun of life ſhine clear upon us) in the ſtate of holineſs, than in a whole life of ſinful pleaſures. 'I had rather be a door keeper in the houſe of God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedneſs. Pſal. lxxxiv. 10.' 'A day in his courts is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a thouſand any where elſe.' lxxxiv. 10. The mirth of the wicked is like the laughter of a madman, that knows not his own miſery; and therefore, Solomon faith of ſuch labour, it is mad,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028243_0048_0FD746D41610BA38"/>and of mirth, what doth it? Eccleſ. ii. 2. and Eccleſ. vii. 2, 3.4, 5, 6. "It is better to go to the houſe of mourning, than to go to the houſe of feaſting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. Sorrow is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than laughter: for by the ſadneſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the heart is made better. The heart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the houſe of mirth: It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bear the rebuke of the wiſe, than to hear the ſong of fools; for as the crackling of thorns under a pot, ſo is the laughter of a fool." All the pleaſure of fleſhly things, is but like the ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man that hath the itch; it is his diſeaſe that make him deſire it, and a wiſe man had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be without his pleaſure, than be troubled with his itch. Your loudeſt laughter is but like that of a man that is tickled; he laughs when he hath no cauſe of joy, and it is? wiſer thing for a man to give all his eſtate, and his life to be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make him laugh, than for you to part with the love of God, and the comforts of holineſs, and the hopes of heaven, and to caſt yourſelves into damuation, that you may have your fleſh tickled with the pleaſure of ſin for a little while. Judge, as you are men, whether this be a wiſe man's part. It is but your carnal unſanctified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that makes an holy life ſeem grievous to you, and a courſe of ſenſuality ſeem more delightful: if you will but turn, the Holy Ghoſt will give you another nature and inclination, and then it will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> more pleaſant to you to be rid of your ſin, than now it is to keep it: and you will then ſay, that you knew not what a comfortable life
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028243_0048_0FD746D41610BA38"/>was till now, and that it was never well with you till God and holineſs were your delight.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. "But how cometh it to paſs, that men ſhould be ſo unreaſonable in the matters of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? They have wit enough in other matters, what makes them ſo loth to be converted, that there ſhould need ſo many words in ſo plain a caſe, and all will not do, but the moſt will live and die unconverted?"</p>
                  <p>Anſw. To name them only in a few words, the cauſes are theſe:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Men are naturally in love with earth and fleſh, they are born ſinners, and their nature hath an enmity to God and goodneſs, as the nature of a ſerpent hath to a man; and when all that we can ſay goes againſt an habitual inclination of their natures, no marvel if it little prevail.</item>
                     <item>2. They are in darkneſs, and know not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things they hear. Like a man that was born blind, and hears a high commendation of the light; but what will hearing do, unleſs he ſees it. They know not what God is, nor what is the power of the croſs of Chriſt, nor what the ſpirit of holineſs is, nor what it is to live in love by faith: They know not the certainty, and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and excellency of the heavenly inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. They know not what converſion, and a holy mind and converſation is, even when they hear of it. They are in a miſt of ignorance. They are loſt and bewildered in ſin; like a man that has loſt himſelf in the night, and knows not where he is, nor how to come to himſelf again, till the day light do recover him.</item>
                     <item>3. They are wilfully confident, that they need
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028243_0049_0FD746D6A9CF8590"/>no converſion, but ſome partial amendment; and that they are in the way to heaven already; and are converted, when they are not. And if you meet a man that is quite out of his way, you may long enough call upon him to turn back again, if he will not believe you, that he is out of the way.</item>
                     <item>4. They are become ſlaves to their fleſh, and drowned in the world, to make proviſion for it. Their luſts, and paſſions, and appetites have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted them, and got ſuch an hand over them, that they cannot tell how to deny them, or how to mind any thing elſe, ſo that the drunkard ſaith, 'I love a cup of good drink, and I cannot forbear it." The glutton ſaith, 'I love good chear, and I cannot forbear.' The fornicator ſaith, 'I love to have my luſt fulfilled, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear.' And the gameſter loves to have his ſports, and he cannot forbear. So that they are become even captivated ſlaves to their fleſh, and their very wilfulneſs is become an impotency, and what they would not do, they ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. And the worldling is ſo taken up with earthly things, that he hath neither heart nor mind, nor time for heavenly; but as in Pharaoh's dream, Gen. xli. 4. the lean kine did eat up the fat ones; ſo this lean and barren earth doth eat up all the thoughts of heaven.</item>
                     <item>5. Some are ſo carried away by the ſtream of evil company, that they are poſſeſſed with hard thoughts of a godly life, by hearing them ſpeak againſt it! or at leaſt, they think they may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do as they ſee moſt do, and ſo they hold on in their ſinful ways: and when one is cut off,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028243_0049_0FD746D6A9CF8590"/>and caſt into hell, and another ſnatched away from among them, to the ſame condemnation, it doth not much daunt them, becauſe they ſee not whither they are gone; poor wretches, they hold on in their ungodlineſs, for all this; for they little know that their companions are now lamenting it in torments. In Luke xvi. the rich man in hell would ſain have had one to warn his five brethren, leſt they ſhould come to that place of torment. Its like he knew their minds and lives, and knew that they were haſting thither, and little dreamt that he was there, yea, and would little have believed one that ſhould have told them ſo. I remember a paſſage that a gentleman, yet living, told me he ſaw upon a bridge over Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. <note n="†" place="bottom">M. R. R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

Even ſo it is with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted carnal men. One dieth by them, and drops into hell, and another follows the ſame way: and yet they will go after them, becauſe they think not whither they are gone. Oh, but when death hath once opened their eyes, and they ſee what
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028243_0050_0FD746D7B22A77E0"/>is on the other ſide of the wall; even in another world, then what would they give to be where they were!</item>
                     <item>6. Moreover, they have a ſubtle malicious enemy, that is unſeen of them, and plays his game in the dark; and it is his principal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hinder their converſion; and therefore to keep them where they are, by perſuading them not to believe the ſcriptures, or not to trouble their minds with theſe matters; or, by perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, to think ill of a godly life, or to think that its more ado than needs, and that they may be ſaved without converſion, and without all this ſtir: and, that God is ſo merciful, that he will not damn any ſuch as they; or, at leaſt, that they may ſtay a little longer, and take their pleaſure, and follow the world a little longer yet, and then let it go, and repent hereafter. And by ſuch jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling deluding cheats as theſe, the devil keeps the your in his captivity, and leadeth them to his miſery.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe, and ſuch like impediments as theſe, do keep ſo many thouſands unconverted, when God hath done ſo much, and Chriſt hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much, and miniſters have ſaid ſo much, for their converſion; when their reaſons are ſilenced, and they are not able to anſwer the Lord that calls after them, 'Turn ye, turn ye; why will you die?' Yet all comes to nothing with the greateſt part of them; and they leave us no more to do after all, but to ſit down, and lament their wilful miſery.</p>
                  <p>I have now ſhewed you the reaſonableneſs of God's commands, and the unreaſonableneſs of
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028243_0050_0FD746D7B22A77E0"/>wicked men's diſobedience. If nothing will ſerve turn, but men will yet refuſe to turn, we are next to conſider, who it is long of, if they be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this brings me the laſt doctrine, which is,</p>

And now, let reaſon itſelf be the judge, whether it belong of God or you, if after all this, you will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted and be damned?

Had you not the ſame teaching, and time, and liberty to be godly, as your godly neighbours had? Why then could not you have been godly, as well as they? Were the church doors ſhut againſt you, or did not you keep away yourſelves, or ſit and ſleep, or hear as if you did not hear? Did God put in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt you in his word, when he invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners to return; and he promiſed mercy to thoſe that do return? Did he ſay, I will pardon all that repent except thee? Did he ſhut thee out from the liberty of his holy worſhip? Did he forbid you to pray to him any more than others? You know he did not. God did not drive you away from him, but you forſook him, and run away yourſelves, and when he called you to him, you would not come. If God had excepted you out of the general promiſe and offer of mercy, or had ſaid to you, "ſtand off, I will have nothing to do with ſuch as you; pray not to me, for I will not hear you; if you repent never ſo much, and cry for mercy ſo much, I will not regard you." If God had left you nothing to truſt to but deſperation, then you had had a fair excuſe, you might have ſaid, "to what end do I repent and turn, when I will do no good?" But this was not your caſe, you might have had Chriſt to be your Lord and Saviour; your head and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as well as others, and you "would not," becauſe you felt yourſelves not ſick enough for the phyſician, and becauſe you could not ſpare your diſeaſe, in your hearts you ſaid as thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, Luke xx. 14.

Pſalm xviii. 13. lxxvi. 13. O that there were ſuch a heart in this people, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments alway, that it might be well with them, and their children forever!

Many a time hath Chriſt proclaimed that free invitation to you. Rev. xxii. 17. "Let him that is a thirſt come, and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely."

               <p>The whole caſe is laid open by Chriſt, Prov. i. from the 20. to the end. "Wiſdom crieth without, ſhe uttereth her voice in the ſtreets, ſhe crieth in the chief place of the concourſe, How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcorners delight, in ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn ye at my reproof; behold I will pour out my ſpirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Becauſe I have called, and ye have refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hands, and no man regarded, but you have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproofs; I alſo will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you, then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early but they ſhall not find me. For that they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord. They would hear none of my counſels: They deſpiſe all my reproof: Therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them. But whoſo hearkeneth to me ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet from the fear of evil.' I thought beſt to recite the whole text at large to you, becauſe it doth ſo fully ſhew the cauſe of the deſtruction of the wicked. It is not becauſe God would not teach them, but becauſe they would not learn. It is not becauſe
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028243_0054_0FD746DA163B19E0"/>God would not call them, but beauſe they would not turn at his reproof. Their wilfulneſs is their undoing.</p>

We intreat them to caſt away their ſin, and come to Chriſt without delay, and to have ſome mercy on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they will have none; and yet they think that God muſt be cruel, if he condemn them. O wilful wretched ſinners! It is not God that is cruel to you, it is you that are cruel to yourſelves; you are told, you muſt turn or burn, and yet you turn not. You are told, that if you will needs keep your ſins, you ſhall keep the curſe of God with them; and yet you will keep them. You are told, that there is no way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs but holineſs, and yet you will not be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. What would you have God to ſay more to you? What would you have him do with his mercy? He offereth it to you, and you will not have it. You are in the ditch-of ſin and miſery, and he would give you his hand to help you out, and you refuſe his help; he would cleanſe you of your ſins, and you had rather keep them! you love your luſt, and love your gluttony and ſports, and drunkenneſs, and will not let them go; would you have him bring you to heaven, whether you would or no; or would you have him bring you and your ſins to heaven together? Why, that is an impoſſibility, you may as well expect he ſhould turn the ſun into darkneſs.

What ſhould one ſay to ſuch men as theſe? We tell the ungodly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs worldling, "It is not ſuch a life will ſerve the turn, or ever bring you to heaven." If a bear were at your back, you would mend your pace; and when the curſe of God is at your back, and ſatan and hell are at your back, will you not ſtir, but aſk, What needs all this ado? Is an immortal ſoul of no more worth? O, have mercy upon yourſelves! But they will have no mercy upon themſelves, nor once regard us. We tell them the end will be bitter, who can dwell with the everlaſting fire? And yet they will have no mercy upon themſelves. And yet, will theſe ſhameleſs wretches ſay, that God is more merciful than to condemn them, when it is themſelves that cruelly and unmercifully run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condemnation, and if we ſhould go to them with our hats in our hands, and intreat them, we cannot ſtop them, but to hell they will go, and yet will not believe that they are going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we beg of them for the ſake of God that made them and preſerved them, for the ſake of Chriſt who died for them, for the ſake of their

You ſee here, that ſin is the brat of your own concupiſcence, and not to be fathered on God, and that death is the offspring of your own ſin, and the fruit which it will yield you as ſoon as it is ripe. You

If he would hinder you from good reſolutions, it is ſoon done. If he would cool any good deſires or affections, it is ſoon done. If he would kindle any luſt, or vile affections and deſires in you, it is ſoon done. If he will put you on to evil thoughts, or deeds, you are ſo free, that he needs no rod nor ſpur.

                     <item>5. You do even forbid all others to pity you, when you will have no pity on yourſelves; if you cry to God in the day of your calamity for mercy, mercy; what can you expect but that he ſhould thruſt you away, and ſay, "nay, thou wouldſt not have mercy on thyſelf; who brought this upon thee but thy own wilfulneſs?" And if your brethren ſee you everlaſtingly in miſery, how ſhall they pity you that were your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers, and would not be diſſuaded?</item>
                     <item>6. It will everlaſtingly make you your own tormentors in hell to think on it, that you brought yourſelves wilfully to that miſery. O what a griping thought it will be for ever to think with yourſelves, that this was your own doing! that you were warned of this day, and warned again, but it would not do: that you wilfully ſinned, and wilfully turned away from God! that you had time as well as others but you abuſed it; you had teachers as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but you refuſed their inſtruction; you had holy examples, but you did not imitate them;
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028243_0063_0FD746FB85F17C00"/>you were offered Chriſt, and grace, and glory, as well as others, but you had more mind of your fleſhly pleaſure; you had a price in your hands, but you had not a heart to lay it out. Prov. xvii. 16. Can it chooſe but torment you to think of this your preſent folly? O that your eyes were opened to ſee what you have done in the wilful wronging of your own ſouls! and that you better underſtood theſe words of God, "Prov. viii. 33, 34, 35, 36. Hear inſtruction and be wiſe, and refuſe it not; bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors; for whoſo findeth me findeth life, and ſhall obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Lord.

                  <p>And now I am come to the concluſion of this work; my heart is troubled to think how I ſhall leave you, leſt, after this, the fleſh ſhould ſtill deceive you, and the world and the devil ſhould keep you aſleep, and I ſhould leave you as I found you, till you awake in hell. Though in care of your poor ſouls, I am afraid of this, as knowing the obſtinacy of a carnal heart; yet I can ſay with the prophet Jeremy, xvii. 16. <hi>I have not deſired the woeful day, the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> I have not with James and John deſireth that <hi>fire might come from heaven</hi> to conſume them that refuſed Jeſus Chriſt, Luke xi. 54. But it is the preventing of the eternal fire that I have been all this while endeavouring: And O that it had been a needleſs work? that God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience might have been as willing to ſpare me this
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028243_0064_0FD746FC61618C28"/>labour, as ſome of you could have been. Dear friends, I am ſo loth that you ſhould lie in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, and be ſhut out of heaven, if it be poſſible to prevent it, that I ſhall once more aſk you, what do you now reſolve? Will you turn or die? I look upon you as a phyſician on his patient, in a dangerous diſeaſe, that ſaith to him, <hi>though you are far gone, take but this medicine, and forbear but thoſe few thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that are hurtful, to you, and I dare warrant your life; but if you will not do this, you are but a dead man.</hi> What would you think of ſuch a man, if the phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and all the friends he hath, cannot perſuade him to take one medicine to ſave his life, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear one or two poiſonous things that would kill him? This is your caſe. As far as you are gone in ſin, do but now turn and come to Chriſt, and take his remedies, and your ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſhall live. Caſt up your deadly ſins by repentance, and return not to the poiſonous vomit any more, and you ſhall do well. But yet if it were your bodies that we had to deal with, we might partly know what to do for you. Though you would not conſent, yet you might be held or bound, while the medicine were poured down your throats, and hurtful things might be kept from you. But about your ſouls it cannot be ſo, we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert you againſt your wills. There is no carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing madmen to heaven in fetters. You may be condemned againſt your wills, becauſe you ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with your wills; but you cannot be ſaved againſt your wills. The wiſdom of God hath thought meet to lay mens ſalvation or deſtruction exceeding much upon the choice of their own
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028243_0064_0FD746FC61618C28"/>wills; that no man ſhall come to heaven that choſe not the way to heaven; and no man ſhall come to hell but ſhall be forced to ſay, I have the thing I choſe, my own will did bring me hither. Now, if I could but get you to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to be thoroughly and reſolvedly, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually willing, the work were more than half done. And alas, muſt we loſe our friends, and muſt they loſe their God, their happineſs, their ſouls, for want of this? God forbid? It is a ſtrange thing to me that men are ſo inhuman and ſtupid in the greateſt matters, that in leſſer things are civil and courteous, and good neighbours. For ought I know, I have the love of all, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all my neighbours, ſo far, that if I ſhould ſend to every man in the town, or pariſh, or country, and requeſt a reaſonable courteſy of them, they would grant it me; and yet when I come to requeſt of them the greateſt matter in the world for themſelves, and not for me, I can have nothing of many of them but a patient hearing. I know not whether people think a man in the pulpit is in good ſadneſs or not, and means as he ſpeaks; for I think I have few neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but if I were ſitting familiarly with them, and telling them of what I have ſeen or done, or known in the world, they would believe me, and regard what I ſay; but when I tell them, from the infallible word of God, what they themſelves ſhall ſee and know in the world to come, they ſhew by their lives they do either not believe it, or not much regard it. If I met ever any one of them on the way, and told them yonder is a coal pit, or there is a quickſand, or
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028243_0065_0FD746FDDFAE6D88"/>there are thieves lie in wait for you; I could perſuade them to turn by. But when I tell them that ſatan lieth in wait for them, and that ſin is poiſon to them, and that hell is not a matter to be jeſted with, they go on as if they did not hear me. Truly neighbours, I am in as good earneſt with you in the pulpit, as I am in my familiar diſcourſe: and if ever you will regard me, I beſeech you let it be here. I think there is never a man of you all, but if my own ſoul lay at your wills, you would be willing to ſave it (though I cannot promiſe that you would leave your ſins for it.) Tell me, thou drunkard, art thou ſo cruel to me that ſpeak to thee, that thou wouldeſt not forbear a few cups of drink, if thou kneweſt it would ſave my ſoul from hell! Hadſt thou rather that I did burn there for ever, than thou ſhouldſt live ſoberly as other men do? If ſo, may I not ſay, thou art an unmerciful monſter, and not a man? If I came hungry or naked to one of your doors, would you not part with more than a cup of drink to relieve me? I a in confident you would; If it were to ſave my life, I know you would (ſome of you) hazard your own. And yet will you not be intreated to part with your ſenſual pleaſures for your own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Wouldeſt thou forbear an hundred cups of drink man, to ſave my life, if it were in thy power, and wilt thon not do it to ſave thy own ſoul? I profeſs to you, firs, I am as hearty a beggar with you this day for the ſaving of your own ſouls, as I would be for my own ſupply if I were forced to come a begging to your doors. And therefore if you would hear me then, heat
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028243_0065_0FD746FDDFAE6D88"/>me now. If you would pity me then, be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now to pity yourſelves. I do again beſeech you, as if it were on my bended knees, that you would hearken to your redeemer, and, turn that you may live. All you that have lived in ignorance, and careleſsneſs, and preſumption, to this day; all you that have been drowned in the care of the world, and have no mind of God, and eternal glory; all you that are enſlaved to your fleſhly deſires, of meat and drink, ſports and luſts; and all you that know not the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of holineſs, and never were acquainted with the ſanctifying work of the Holy Ghoſt upon your ſouls, that never embraced your bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer by a lively faith, and with admiring and thankful apprehenſions of his love, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt an higher eſtimation of God &amp; heaven, and an heartier love to them than to your fleſhly proſperity, and the things below; I earneſtly beſeech you, not only for my ſake, but for the Lord's ſake, that you go not one day longer in your former condition, but look about you, and cry to God for converting grace, that you be made new creatures, and may eſcape the plagues that are a little before you. And if ever you will do any thing for me, grant me this requeſt, to turn from your evil ways and live. Deny me any thing that ever I ſhall aſk you for myſelf, if you will but grant me this. And if you deny me this, I care not for any thing elſe that you would grant me. Nay, as ever you will do any thing at the requeſt of the Lord that made you, and redeemed you, deny him not this; for if you deny him this, he cares for nothing that you
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028243_0066_0FD746FF7AF15B00"/>ſhall grant him. As ever you would have him hear you prayers, and grant your requeſts, and do for you at the hour of death and day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in any of your extremities, deny not his requeſt in the day of your proſperity. O ſits, believe it, death and judgment, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell, are other matters when you come hear them, than they ſeem to carnal eyes afar off; then you would hear ſuch a meſſage as I bring you with more a wakoned regardful hearts.</p>
                  <p>Well, though I cannot hope ſo well of all, I will hope that ſome of you are by this time pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to turn and live; and that you are ready to aſk me, as the Jews did Peter, Acts ii. 37. When they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid, "men and brethren, what ſhall we do? How might we come to be truly converted? We are willing, if we did but know our duty. God forbid that we ſhould chooſe deſtruction, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing converſion, as hitherto we have done.</p>
                  <p>If theſe be the thoughts and purpoſes of your hearts, I ſay of you as God did of a promiſing people, Deut. v. 28, 29. They have well ſaid all that they have ſpoken; "O that there were ſuch a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always!" Your purpoſes are good: O that there were but an heart in you to perform theſe purpoſes! And in hope hereof, I ſhall gladly give you direction what to do, and that but briefly, that you may the eaſier remember it for your practice.</p>

               <p>Conſider what a lamentable condition you are in till the hour of your converſion, that you may ſee it is not a ſtate to be reſted in. You are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of all the ſins that ever you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and under the wrath of God, and the curſe of his law, you are bound ſlaves to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and daily employed in his work againſt the Lord, yourſelves, and others; you are ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead and deformed, as being devoid of the holy life, and nature, and image of the Lord. You are unfit for any holy work, and do nothing that is truly pleaſing unto God. You are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any promiſe or aſſurance of his protection, and live in continual danger of his juſtice, not knowing what hour you may be ſwatched away to hell, and moſt certain to be damned if you die in that condition, and nothing ſhort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion can prevent it. Whatever civilities, or amendments, or ventures, are ſhort of true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, will never procure the ſaving of your ſouls. Keep the true ſenſe of this natural miſery, and ſo of the neceſſity of converſion on your hearts.</p>
               <p>And then you muſt underſtand what it is to be converted. It is to have a new heart or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a new converſation.</p>

You ſhall immediately be made living members of Chriſt, and have intereſt in him, and be renewed after the image of God, and be adorned with all his graces and quickened with a new and heavenly life, and ſaved from the tyranny of ſatan, and the dominion of ſin, and be juſtified from the curſe of the law, and have the pardon of all the ſins of your whole lives, and be accepted of God, and made his ſons, and have liberty with boldneſs to call him father, and go to him by prayer in all your needs, with a promiſe of acceptance; you ſhall have the Holy Ghoſt to dwell in you, to ſanctify and guide you! You ſhall have part in the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, communion and prayers of the ſaints? You ſhall be fitted for God's ſervice, and be freed from the dominion of ſin, and be uſeful and a bleſſing to the place you live in; and ſhall have the promiſe of this life and that which is to come. You ſhall want nothing that is truly good for you, and your neceſſary afflictions you will be enabled to bear; you may have ſome taſte of communion with God in the ſpirit; eſpecially in all holy ordinances, where God prepareth a feaſt for your ſouls; you ſhall be heirs of heaven while you live on earth, and may foreſee by faith the everlaſting glory, and ſo may live and die in peace; and you ſhall never be ſo low, but your happineſs will be incomparably greater than your miſery.</p>

               <p>IF you mean indeed to turn and live, do it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily without delay. If you be not willing to turn to day, you be not willing to do it at all. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you are all this while in your blood, under the guilt of many thouſand ſins and under God's wrath, and you ſtand at the very brink of hell; there is but a ſtep between you and death. And this is not a caſe for a man that is well in his wits to be quiet in. Up therefore preſently, and fly as for your lives, as you would be gone out of your houſe if it were all on fire over your head. O, if you did but know what continual danger you live in, and what daily unſpeakable loſs you do ſuſtain, and what ſafer and ſweeter life you might live, you would not ſtand trifling, but preſently turn. Multitudes miſcarry that wilfully delay when they are convinced that it muſt be done. Your lives are ſhort and uncertain; and what a caſe are you in, if you die before you thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn! You have ſtaid too long already, and wronged God too long. Sin getteth ſtrength and rooting while you delay. Your converſion will grow more hard and doubtful. You have much to do, and therefore put not off to the laſt, leſt
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028243_0070_0FD7471322CF0E78"/>God forſake you, and give you up to yourſelves, and then you are undone for ever.</p>

               <p>IF you will turn and live, do it unreſervedly, abſolutely, and univerſally. Think not to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with Chriſt, and divide your heart betwixt him and the world; and to part with ſome ſins, and keep the reſt; and to let go that which your fleſh can ſpare. This is but ſelf deluding; you muſt in heart and reſolution forſake all that you have, or elſe you cannot be his diſciples. Luke xiv. 26.33. If you will not take God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for your portion, and lay all below at the feet of Chriſt, but you muſt needs alſo have your good things here, and have an earthly portion, and God and glory is not enough for you; it is vain to dream of ſalvation on theſe terms: For it will not be. If you ſeem never ſo religious, if yet it be but a carnal righteouſneſs, and the fleſh's proſperity, or pleaſure, or ſafety, be ſtill except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your devoutedneſs to God; this is as certain a way to death as open profaneneſs, though it be more plauſible.</p>

               <p>IF you will turn and live, do it reſolvedly, and ſtand not ſtill deliberating, as if it were a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſe. Stand not wavering, as if you were yet uncertain whether God or the fleſh be the better maſter, or whether heaven and hell be the better end, or whether ſin or holineſs be the better way.
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028243_0070_0FD7471322CF0E78"/>But away with your former luſts, and preſently, habitually, fixedly reſolve: Be not one day of one mind, and the next of another, but be at a point with all the world, and reſolvedly give up yourſelves and all that you have to God. Now while you are reading or hearing this, reſolve; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſleep another night, reſolve; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſtir from the place, reſolve; before Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath time to take you off, reſolve. You ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver turn indeed till you do reſolve, and that with a firm and unchangeable reſolution.</p>
               <p>So much for the directions.</p>
               <p>AND now I have done my part in this work, that you may turn to the call of God and live. What will become of it, I cannot tell. I have caſt the ſeed at God's command; but it is not in my power to give the increaſe. I cannot go any further with my meſſage; I cannot bring it to your heart, nor make it work; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do your parts for you, to entertain it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it; nor I cannot do God's part by opening your hearts to cauſe you to entertain it; nor can I ſhew you heaven or hell to your eye ſight, nor give you new and tender hearts. If I knew what more to do for your converſion, I hope I ſhould do it.</p>
               <p>But O thou that art the gracious Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, thou haſt ſworn thou delighteſt not in the death of the wicked, but rather that they would turn and live; deny not thy bleſſings to theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions and directions, and ſuffer not thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to triumph in thy ſight, and the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciever of ſouls to prevail againſt thy Son, thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and thy Word. O pity poor unconverted
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028243_0071_0FD74714EC7122E0"/>ſinners, that have no hearts to pity or help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Command the blind to ſee, and the deaf to hear, and the dead to live, and let not ſin and death be able to reſiſt thee. Awaken the ſecure, reſolve the unreſolved, confirm the wavering, and let the eyes of ſinners that read theſe lines, be next employed in weeping over their ſins, and bring them to themſelves, and to thy Son, before their ſins have brought them to perdition. If thou ſay but the word, theſe poor endeavours ſhall proſper to the winning of many a ſoul to their everlaſting joy, and thine everlaſting glory. Amen.</p>

                  <q>It may be a Tale of Truth, for it is not unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and it is a tale of real diſtreſs Charlotte by the artifice of a teacher, recommended to a ſchool, from humanity rather than a conviction of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, or the regularity of her former conduct, is enticed from her governeſs, and accompanies a young officer to America. The marriage ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if not forgotten, is poſtponed, and Charlotte dies a martyr to the inconſtancy of her lover, and the treachery of his friend. The ſituations are artleſs and affecting, the deſcriptions natural and pathetic; we ſhould feel for Charlotte, if ſuch a perſon ever exiſted, who for one error, ſcarcely perhaps deſerved ſo ſevere a puniſhment. If it is a ſiction, poetic juſtice is not, we think, properly diſtributed.</q> Price 75 cents.</p>

                           <p>"A volume under the preſent title was lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in England and Ireland, and had a moſt rapid ſale, having been purchaſed by almoſt every lady of taſte in thoſe kingdoms. To this volume, the American editor has added Miſs More's eſſays; Mrs. Chapone's letter on the government of the temper; and Swift's letter to a lady newly married. Theſe have conſiderably enhanced its value; and he doubts not, the ladies on this ſide the Atlantic, will be as generous in their encouragement of a work intended for their advantage, as thoſe in England and Ireland have been."</p>

               <p>"Mrs Rowſon looked up to Stern as the object of her imitation, but ſhe has really rivalled one of her own ſex, the author of the Rambles of Frankly. The work is wholly of that kind, and in no reſpect inferior to it, except in having adopted a ring, by which the Inquiſitor is rendered inviſible. The ſlave in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſecond volume, is written in the beſt manner of Stern. There are many pathetic traits, which ſpeak to the heart, and are drawn from nature. They are extremely affecting, when we forget the ring. Though the Inquiſitor, like the Rambles of Fankly, conſiſts of independent chapters; yet ſome connection is kept up through the whole; and, in that reſpect, as well as in pathos, this work may be ſaid to exceed its competitor."</p>

               <p>"On the various and intereſting ſubjects with which moral ſcience and belles lettres abound, Dr. Beattie has treated in a ſummary, but pleaſing and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive manner. The ſtudent will ſeldom find any thing of importance left untouched; and whatever be the ſubject, it is illuſtrated and enforced with Dr. Beattie's uſual eloquence and good ſenſe. No writer is better calculated to reſiſt the ſophiſtry of modern philoſophy; and the deductions which he forms on ſubjects of morals, criticiſm and taſte, are generally ſuch as the underſtanding acquieſces in without ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, and almoſt without an effort. The chief beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his ſtyle are freedom and perſpicuity: and the prominent features of his matter are, ſound morals, rational religion, and good ſenſe.</p>
               <p>"Our author diſcuſſes with his uſual ability, the more important duties we owe the Deity, our fellow creatures, and ourſelves.</p>
               <p>"In part the ſecond will be found ſome admirable remarks againſt ſlavery; a ſubject on which Dr. Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie expatiates with a warmth of benevolence that does him great honour.</p>
               <p>"Part IV compriſes rhetoric alſo, as forming a conſiderable part of logic, or the ſcience of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. On the various, but trite ſubjects that fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Dr. Beattie's diſcuſſion, in this general diviſion of his work, we find the ſame juſt taſte, accurate diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſolid judgment, that characteriſe him as a writer. Our extracts have already ſwelled this article beyond the uſual limits; we muſt be content therefore with recommending the Elements of Moral Science to young ſtudents in particular, and the public in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as a very uſeful, elegant, and judicious compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the various ſubjects which it contains."</p>
