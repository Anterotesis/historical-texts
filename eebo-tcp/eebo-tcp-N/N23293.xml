            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE THREE BROTHERS.</head>
            <p>EUGENE, RICHARD, and CASSANDER, were the ſons of Mr. Smithſon, a reputable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in the North of Old England, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other children beſides them, and being in pretty affluent circumſtances, reſolved to have them educated immediately under his own eye. For this purpoſe he invited into his houſe a Mr. Markham, a gentleman of learning and approved morals, to be their tutor, whoſe care and attention to their improvement afterwards fully anſwered all his expectations.</p>
            <p>Theſe Three Brothers, from their earlieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, were play-mates and companions. They had never been ſent out of their father's houſe, either to nurſe or even to a ſchool: as Mrs. Smithſon, their mother, whoſe education ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her perfectly equal to the taſk, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to put them through the firſt rudiments of learning, and to prepare them for whatever ſtudies a tutor might afterwards direct them to. Whether it was their conſtant ſociety from their earlieſt childhood; in the courſe of which, notwithſtanding the difference of two years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030803_0005_0FE9654F2404B400"/>
the age of Caſſander and that of Eugene, each ſhared invariably in the ſtudies as well as the amuſements of the other two; or whether it was the natural bent of their diſpoſitions, I know not, but they were remarkable for bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards each other a degree of affection that is rarely to be found amongſt brothers in general. In their ſports they were inſeparable; the inequality of their number was never an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to their all partaking of the ſame paſtime, though it might originally have been intended but for two; and notwithſtanding there would now and then ariſe a trifling diſpute amongſt them concerning their play, all differences were uſually ſettled and reconciled before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the game, ſo that they never parted from each other in a pet; but, on the contrary, after they were tired of play, it was no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common thing to ſee them linked all three arm in arm, ſauntering up and down the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den walks, which were commonly the ſcene of their amuſements; and in that friendly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude communicating to each other their little fancies, diſcuſſing the remarkale ſtories that occurred in the courſe of their leſſons, or elſe laying their heads together to plan and ſtrike out ſome new mode of diverſion.</p>
            <p>Thus agreeing, and unanimous in all things, they entered with pleaſure upon the courſe of ſtudy laid down to them by Mr. Markham, their tutor. Mrs. Smithſon had never, while her ſons were under her care, made their leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a painful or diſagreeable taſk; the novelty therefore of Mr. Markham's firſt examination, under whom they found that they were to learn
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030803_0006_0FE9655577097270"/>
both Latin and Greek, ſo charmed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted them, that they all three jumped for joy when their Papa ſhowed them three Latin Grammars, which they were to begin the next day.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Beſides, their ſatisfaction at not being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to leave their dear parents, nor to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from each other, might not a little <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the alacrity they ſhowed on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. In effect the quickneſs of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſurprized and delighted Mr. Markham,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030803_0007_0FE96558B3D35D50"/>
their preſent tutor, as well as their former one, that is their Mama, to whom they would run every day in raptures of joy to communicate the contents of their ſeveral leſſons.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have ſeen Eugene, Richard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Caſſander, perfectly alike and equal in all things; it is neceſſary now to ſhow in what reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects they were unlike, and how the particular character and diſpoſition of each, though lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to actions extremely different from what the others would purſue, yet always uniformly concurred in the exertion of that amiable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, brotherly love.</p>
            <p>Eugene, therefore, with much generoſity and ſomething of fire in his compoſition, was at the ſame time a little arch, or what is called waggiſh. His pranks in general were the moſt innocent in the world, it is true, and he could ſay at leaſt, that he never meant to hurt: if, however, it would ſometimes happen, which after all was ſeldom the caſe, that any of his little jokes coſt either of his brothers a tear; that tear, it was eaſy to be ſeen, gave Eugene infinitely more pain than any he himſelf ſhed: but the open frankneſs and ardent good nature, with which he would conſole his weeping bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeldom failed to dry it up in a moment. He would never juſtify his own miſtakes or his awkwardneſs; and thus he ſeldom felt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of his companions, becauſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found him ready to ſubmit to them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, and, whenever it ſo happened, to own himſelf in the fault.</p>
            <p>Richard, on the other hand, was all ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: he had not the leaſt ſhadow of deſign in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030803_0008_0FE96560CE1E22C0"/>
him; and were it not for the extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that he ſhowed in his learning, in which he outſtripped both his brothers, he might be ſaid not to have a thought of his own. Thus Richard, though as cheerful as the day, ſeldom laughed unleſs Eugene or Caſſander led the joke. He never propoſed a new ſort of play, or invented a freſh plaything, but always was ready, with the greateſt good humour, to join in the one and admire the other, if offered to his attention by either of his brothers. He might even be ſaid to have no wants or likings of his own, but as they put him in mind of them. If Eugene ſaid to the maid, "Molly, I want to go to bed;" Richard would add, "ſo do I too." If Caſſander ſaid, "Mama, pray give me a piece of bread and butter," Richard, if preſent, would commonly join, "Aye, and me too." And this diſpoſition of Richard was the happieſt in the world; for preſerving the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Three Brothers; ſince, whatever advantage or ſuperiority he might have in his learning, all his amuſements, all the pleaſure that he enjoyed from ſociety, depended wholly on Eugene and Caſſander.</p>
            <p>This laſt was neither ſo volatile as his elder brother, nor ſo ſimple as Richard: he had ſomething grave even in his countenance, and though youngeſt of the three, was allowed to be much the moſt prudent; by which means he balanced, as it were, the oppoſite defects of his brothers, and frequently would act as their adviſer and cenſor, by reproving Eugene for his too great vivacity, which led him ſo often into ſcrapes, and Richard for his thoughtleſs abſence and extreme credulity. But though
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030803_0009_0FE965625509F4B0"/>
he ſometimes took this freedom, it was always with the greateſt tenderneſs, being accuſtomed from his infancy to treat his elders with reſpect, particularly his brothers. Indeed a reſpect for their elders and ſuperiors Mrs. Smithſon took early care to inculcate on the minds of all her children. Richard was commanded to yield in every thing to Eugene, and Caſſander to Richard; and all three to behave with proper deference to thoſe who were more advanced in life than themſelves. This injunction had a good effect more ways than one: it prevented any childiſh conteſts for the preference, as each knew and was contented with his own rank, and always waited his proper turn. Beſides, it made them behave with good manners to ſtrangers, let their condition in life be what it will; nor was any one of them ever known to ſpeak or act with petulance even to a beggar.</p>
            <p>After remaining a competent time under the inſtruction of Mr. Markham, it was their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pleaſure that they ſhould all three enter the Univerſity together, and purſue their ſtudies there, in order to qualify themſelves for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of the learned profeſſions they might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards chooſe. This circumſtance gave them infinite pleaſure. The love that they bore to each other while children, was now ripening into a ſteady, ardent friendſhip, which no time could alter or diminiſh; and they ſaw before them a proſpect of being happy in each other's ſociety during the whole courſe of their lives. But human events are uncertain, and the ſhades of misfortune often intervene unexpectedly to chequer the moſt equal and placid ſunſhine of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030803_0010_0FE9656A51CAB000"/>
proſperity. Mr. Smithſon was ſtill in trade, and therefore liable to accidents and croſſes which merchants frequently experience. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, in the beginning of the war, that two ſhips, containing property of his to a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable amount, uninſured, were taken by the enemy. The deficiency produced in his capital by this misfortune, joined to ſeveral other ſmaller loſſes, obliged Mr. Smithſon to become a bankrupt; after which, conceiving a diſtaſte to his native place, he determined to take a voyage to the Weſt Indies, in order to look after an eſtate in land which had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed him as a legacy by ſome diſtant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince the time of his failure. At his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, not judging it expedient to take his wife along with him, he left her a ſmall ſum of ready money, but promiſed to ſend over remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances whenever the property, of which he went to take poſſeſſion, could be turned to any account.</p>
            <p>Our Three Brothers were inconſolable at parting with their father: this was the firſt time in their lives that they might be ſaid to feel the grief of abſence from their beloved parents; for while at College they could hardly be called abſent from home, as they converſed weekly, nay almoſt daily, by letters, either with Mr. or Mrs. Smithſon. But their ſorrow was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably increaſed, when, after two years had elapſed without any tidings from their father, they received a melancholy epiſtle from Mrs. Smithſon, informing them of her utter inability to maintain them any longer at College, and requeſting their immediate return, in order to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030803_0011_0FE9656BD6E1AA80"/>
conſult how they ſhould diſpoſe of themſelves for their future ſettlement in life.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>During the laſt two years that they had ſpent at the Univerſity, nothing but the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt economy, on the part of the Brothers, as well as that of their indulgent parent, could have enabled them to ſubſiſt; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general diſſipation of the place, their temperance and frugality did not hinder them from ſupporting an amiable character, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly eſteemed by all who knew them. They were remarked for an obliging, affable demeanour, an unexceptionable attention to their College duties, but particularly for the ſtrict intimacy and happy degree of unanimity which they always appeared to maintain. They were indeed diſtinguiſhed by the title of the <hi>Three Brothers;</hi> and the wits of the place ſpoke of them as an exception to that remark of the poet,
<q>
                  <l>Friendſhip, like love, is but a name,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs to one you ſtint the flame.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030803_0012_0FE96573DF4F4240"/>
However, there was a conſiderable difference in their diſpoſitions, which, without the leaſt impairing their affection, grew every day more and more conſpicuous. Eugene was now am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, enterpriſing, and changeable: his parts were rather brilliant than ſolid. Caſſander, on the contrary, was ſteady in his opinions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, which he built on the ſoundeſt and moſt mature reflexion: he appeared more ſlow in apprehending the difficulties of ſcience than his elder brother; but, in return, his memory was more faithful and retentive, and whatever knowledge he once made his own was ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his command; for, as Mr. Pope elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves,
<q>
                  <l>Where beams of warm imagination play,</l>
                  <l>The memory's ſoft figures melt away.</l>

Richard was a ſort of <hi>medium</hi> between theſe oppoſites: with ſomething of Eugene's viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and the ſteadineſs of Caſſander, he had an ardent and inſatiable thirſt of knowledge; in effect, he had recommended himſelf ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to his ſuperiors, by the extent and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his attainments, that he was at this very time of Mrs. Smithſon's writing for him and his brothers, pointed out to a nobleman, equally reſpectable for his rank and principles, as a proper perſon to be private tutor to his Lordſhip's two ſons, who were lately entered at the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>At their return, therefore, upon the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of their mother, when ſhe laid before them the melancholy ſtate of their affairs, the diſappointment of their expectations, and, to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030803_0013_0FE9657564D33348"/>
crown all, the dreadful apprehenſions that ſhe entertained of the loſs of her huſband, either at ſea or by the caſualties of war; concluding with the tendereſt advice to them, to unite their efforts towards the re-eſtabliſhing of their circumſtances by a ſteady courſe of induſtry in whatever profeſſions they might adopt: upon this occaſion it was that the advantages of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior application and a more rapid progreſs in learning appeared conſpicuous. While Eugene and Caſſander endeavour to comfort Mrs. Smithſon by the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of their future diligence and the exertion of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in ſome line or other that might afford themſelves and her a decent maintenance, Richard had the happineſs of being able to make his mother and brothers the immediate tender of a ſmall competency from the ſalary which his noble patron was to allow him, who only waited for his anſwer to inveſt him with the care of his children's education. This proſpect was a ſeaſonable relief to Mrs. Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the deſpondency into which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gloom of her affairs had thrown her. It is true, the iron hand of want had not as yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to pinch her and her children, but the near approach of that unwelcome viſitor (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a reſource as Richard now ſuggeſted), was ſufficient to fill her mind with the moſt melancholy ideas and diſmal preſages of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Now therefore at length, by the irreſiſtible decree of neceſſity, were our Three Brothers obliged to part, and take different walks on the vaſt theatre of life. Richard, returning to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030803_0014_0FE9657D6EBE7228"/>
Univerſity, attached himſelf with ſo much ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the education of his noble pupils, and to his own improvement, that, beſides being able for the preſent to contribute to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his mother, and thoſe whom he held moſt dear next to her, he had the proſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him of obtaining an ample ſettlement in the church, through the intereſt of his munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent patron, whoſe favour he enjoyed in as full a meaſure as his numerous good qualities enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled him to it. Eugene, having procured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations to a merchant in London, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired thither, and, applying himſelf ſteadily to buſineſs, in the courſe of four years gave ſuch proofs of his integrity and other good qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he was taken by the merchant into partnerſhip. Caſſander, in the mean time, fearing to become a burthen on the moderate penſion that Richard allowed his mother, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the offer of a Newcaſtle trader, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly been an intimate friend of Mr. Smithſon's agreed to take Caſſander a voyage to the Eaſt country upon trial. Caſſander was ſtill but young, being no more than ſixteen at the time of his entering upon a ſea life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his voyage of trial he prudently made it his choice, in preference to waiting for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain chance of ſome more brilliant eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In effect, what with the advantage of an excellent education, a patient and humane diſpoſition, and the uncommon character (for a ſeaman) of being remarkably ſober and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, he in a very few years ſo improved himſelf in the knowledge of trade and navigation, that he was appointed mate of a veſſel trading to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030803_0015_0FE9657EF507F168"/>
Ruſſia, the owners of which were ſo well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his activity and good conduct, that they were determined, notwithſtanding his youth, to ſend him out maſter of one of their ſhips, the firſt opportunity that offered.</p>
            <p>Thus, for ſome years after the ſeparation of the Three Brothers, fortune ſeemed to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ſevere loſs that they had felt in the perſon of their father, concerning whom, all this time, notwithſtanding every poſſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, not the ſmalleſt intelligence had been received. But now, alas! once more, ſorrow and adverſity came hand in hand to diſquiet the feeling hearts of our three youths, by an hour of trial ſuch as they had never yet experienced. The news of their mother's death was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere prelude to their misfortunes. Richard had ſcarcely recovered the ſhock of this, when the death of his patron totally diſſipated all the flattering hopes that he had formed of fortune and preferment in the church, in which he had already taken orders. Eugene, and his partner had for ſome time felt their affairs in a critical condition; but this did not hinder him from exerting his native generoſity in the ſervice of an ancient friend. Indeed, the voice of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and gratitude always met with a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearing from Eugene, let their ſummons be ever ſo preſſing and importunate. His old tutor, Mr. Markham, under whom he and his brothers had ſpent ſome of the happieſt years of their life, was at this time in London. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by ſickneſs and infirmity, advancing faſt towards helpleſs old age, and ſorely galled by poverty and the neglect of the world, he was
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030803_0016_0FE96583EE26D1C0"/>
almoſt without a friend. In this criſis, chance threw his generous pupil in his way, who am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſupplied the place of one to him. Beſides
<figure/>
furniſhing him with the means of ſupplying his preſent neceſſities; Eugene, and by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion his partner, became ſecurity for the payment of a very conſiderable debt, which was on the point of conſigning Mr. Markham to a gaol, where he might probably have paſſed the remainder of his life. But how ill did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune requite Eugene for this friendly action! Mr. Markham died in leſs than three months after, when of courſe the debt devolved upon thoſe who had given ſecurity for him. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the heels of this misfortune follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another. The affairs of Eugene's partnerſhip growing deſperate, they were obliged to declare themſelves bankrupt, and this very kindneſs which he ſhowed Mr. Markham, was reckoned
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030803_0017_0FE965872E7A9EE0"/>
among the misfortunes that contributed to his ruin. The ſhock that Eugene's ſpirits ſuffered upon this occaſion, as he found himſelf now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to fulfil engagements which he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſacred, drove him from one act of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſpair to another; till in the end, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremity of want, in an obſcure coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try place; he madly and precipitately threw himſelf among a company of travelling players, and, to crown all, in this unpromiſing ſtate of life, being barely able to ſubſiſt himſelf, he had the deſperate imprudence to marry. It ſeems he had formed a ſlight acquaintance with a young lady (the daughter of a clergyman), who was ſo ſtruck with his figure and accompliſhments, that ſhe yielded to his ſolicitations to be united with him in the ties of clandeſtine wedlock; thereby utterly forfeiting all her expectations of fortune, together with the friendſhip of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of her relations. The conſequence of this unadviſed ſtep, which brought poverty and her train into Eugene's habitation in ſhapes unknown before, he bore with as much forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and philoſophy as uſually falls to the ſhare of five and twenty, that is, with very little if any at all. Some time before this, Caſſander, who had made two or three voyages for his north-country owners, was invited to London by his brother and his partner, to take the command of one of the large ſhips in which they were principal proprietors. Overjoyed at this invitation, which would give him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, or rather indeed lay him under the neceſſity, of being frequently with his brother while on ſhore, he came to town with all ſpeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030803_0018_0FE9658F8F503E08"/>
and was juſt time enough to be witneſs to the unfortunate failure of Eugene and his aſſociate in trade.</p>
            <p>Thus were the Three Brothers plunged into circumſtances of the moſt helpleſs diſtreſs, juſt at a time when they entertained hopes (appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently well founded) of fixing themſelves to their ſatisfaction for life in their reſpective pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. Had any one of them been exempt from the preſſure of misfortune, the other two would have been ſure of partaking with him in the comforts that depend on a competency of wealth. But all three were equally reduced; and the only remnant of happineſs, that they could call their own, was the ſenſe of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affection, which ſtill continued unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, amidſt the moſt pinching trials of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and calamity. In this ſituation were the Smithſons, when an incident happened which put that affection to the proof, and brought forth inſtances of ſelf-denial and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity that well deſerve to be recorded. In the courſe of Eugene's wanderings as a country player, fortune conducted him to Graveſend where, as he was exhibiting before an audience, chiefly compoſed of ſeafaring people, the ſame fortune unaccountably led his father to become a ſpectator of his performance. In order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſudden appearance of Mr. Smithſon, it will be neceſſary to relate what befel him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure from England. The reader will remember that this gentleman had ſet ſail for the Weſt-Indies, in order to take poſſeſſion of an eſtate in one of the iſlands there; but, having pretty early intelligence that the enemy
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030803_0019_0FE96592CBEB6058"/>
were maſters of the iſland, and therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending numberleſs obſtacles to his obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear and quiet poſſeſſion of the eſtate; he formed the immediate reſolution of getting out, if poſſible, to the Eaſt Indies, where he truſted that, by his general knowledge of trade, he ſhould in a ſhort time be able to retrieve his ſhattered circumſtances, and to return to his native country with a fortune ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the remaining years of his life eaſy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. At the ſame time he took another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution (the ſource of infinite grief and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to his family), which was, never to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of the place of his retirement until he had gained wealth ſufficient to releaſe them from the ſtate of indigence and obſcurity into which, he was purſuaded, his abſence muſt have plunged them. This object he amply accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in ten years, during all which time his family conſidered him as dead; and at the end of that period he was now returning to ſhare his riches with thoſe whom he held moſt dear; when the firſt ſight that ſaluted his eyes after he went on ſhore was his unfortunate ſon figuring in the humble profeſſion of a ſtroller. It is impoſſible to expreſs the rage, ſorrow, and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which at once took poſſeſſion of Mr. Smithſon's breaſt, when he was at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that his eyes and ears did not deceive him. He ſuddenly left the theatre, or rather barn, before the play was half over, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no farther notice of his ſon than to leave a note directed for him, and filled with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt reproaches, he hurried on board the ſhip. Upon his arrival in London, finding his anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030803_0020_0FE96597F4BBF830"/>
wiſhes and all the projects of his affection diſconcerted by his eldeſt ſon's imprudence; his next care was to make inquiry about Richard and Caſſander; for his wife's death he had been informed of by mere accident a ſhort time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left India. Richard he ſoon found out, who, upon the firſt ſummons, flew to embrace his long loſt parent. Mr. Smithſon, after brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relating to him the circumſtances of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to and ſucceſs in the Eaſt Indies, began, bitterly to lament his misfortune in having a ſon ſo abandoned to modefy and diſcretion, as he ſtyled the unfortunate Eugene. He added, that the bulk of the fortune which he had realized abroad, he intended now to divide between his two younger ſons, the elder having proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo unworthy of his favour: that he did not mean to keep them in expectation until his death, but would put each of them in imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate poſſeſſion of an ample fortune; reſerving for himſelf what he was determined ſhould be ſufficient for his neceſſities during the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his life. He concluded with inſiſting, that whatever he meant thus to diſpoſe in favour of his younger ſons, he would take care to ſee ſettled in ſuch a manner, that neither Eugene nor his poſterity ſhould ever inherit a penny of it.</p>
            <p>Richard modeſtly thanked his father for the affectionate care that he teſtified for his intereſt, but tenderly intreated him not to form too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate a reſolution to the prejudice of his eldeſt born. He uſed many arguments to excuſe, or at leaſt to palliate Eugene's indiſcretion; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the ſorrowful effects that a continuance
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030803_0021_0FE9659B3A6DB7C8"/>
of his father's reſentment might have upon a mind ſo exquiſitely feeling as his; and ended with theſe words: "As to what regards my own perſonal advantage, I aſſure you Sir, I feel myſelf naturally very indifferent; and were I not ſo by nature, the profeſſion that I have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, the precepts of which I have with my whole heart conſented to obey, that profeſſion commands me to fix my thoughts and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations upon matters of a far different nature. Beſides, had I the moſt worldly regard for my own intereſt, the affection that I have ever borne, and ſtill bear to my brother Eugene, would ſtand as a bar to my accepting any fortune to which he had the moſt diſtant claim, I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes, my dear father, that when your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent anger ſubſides, you will once more look upon him with the tenderneſs of a parent, in which caſe you will, I truſt, applaud the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that induces me to decline your liberal offer." Mr. Smithſon, with aſtoniſhment in his countenance, aſked his ſon if he was ſerious in refuſing ſo handſome a fortune; and finding him fixed in the determination that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed, he roſe up with evident marks of vexation and diſappointment; and caſting ſome uncharitable reflexions on the deſtiny which, he ſaid, purſued him through life, baffling and fruſtrating the moſt favourite and even lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſhes of his heart, he added in a tone of voice, ſomewhat ſoftened, "Little did I expect, when I ſent for you, to find you an abettor of that profligacy which has alienated my heart from your elder brother. I fondly thought that my children would pay ſuch deference to my
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030803_0022_0FE965A3F4A416E8"/>
authority as even to adopt my prejudices; but ſince you have determined to think for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, be your own maſter. Thank Heaven, I have yet one ſon left." Richard endeavoured in the moſt reſpectful manner, to repreſent the motives of his conduct, but perceiving that whatever he ſaid only tended to irritate his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that it was impoſſible, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to obtain a calm hearing, he reluctantly withdrew, leaving his father in a ſituation not to be envied by a parent.</p>
            <p>Nothing could arrive more opportunely to relieve the depreſſion of Mr. Smithſon's ſpirits, than the news that he heard next morning; which was, that a ſhip, in which Caſſander had gone out in the capacity of a mate, after the failure of Eugene, was returned from her voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the river. His reſentment was now not only pointed at Eugene for his indiſcretion, but at Richard for his too ſcrupulous, uncomply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles. He was therefore determined to beſtow his whole fortune upon Caſſander. But what language can expreſs the amazement of Mr. Smithſon, when, upon his propoſing to do ſo, the generous ſeaman, without the leaſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation or preamble, flatly refuſed to accept a penny of it! He thought, however, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his father required him to give the reaſons on which he grounded his refuſal. He did ſo, and with arguments nearly the ſame as thoſe uſed by his brother Richard, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to convince his father that paſſion had a much greater ſhare than mature deliberation in the ſentence which he was going to paſs upon his eldeſt ſon: "We are all liable to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray,"
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030803_0023_0FE965A733711910"/>
ſaid Caſſander: "happy is he who has the feweſt faults. If we do not forgive thoſe of a ſon, or a brother, Heaven help us when our own come to be judged! As for me, I have lived contented with a little, and am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with hardſhip and diſtreſs. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, therefore, that I ſhould graſp at my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's birth right.—But I declare, were Eugene no brother of mine, knowing as I do his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nature and the warmth of his honeſt heart, I would go before the maſt all my life long, ſooner than accept, to his prejudice, a property which nature and reaſon ſo clearly adjudge to him."</p>
            <p>There was ſomething ſo ingenuous in this addreſs of Caſſander's, ſomething that ſpoke ſo feelingly to his father's breaſt, that, in ſpite of a ſhort conflict which reſentment endeavoured to excite there, he found himſelf conſtrained to yield the point, and while he wiped away a tear, the offspring of returning tenderneſs and affection, he took his ſon by the hand: "Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander," ſaid he, ſmiling, "thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. Surely there muſt be ſomething of extraordinary merit in Eugene, ſince he has found two ſo reſolute advocates in his favour as you and your brother Richard.—Well, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all the paſt—it ſhall be buried in oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—Convince me, as I doubt not you will, that my eldeſt ſon poſſeſſes qualities worthy to excite ſuch ſentimnets as you have both expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his favour, and I ſhall be happy indeed."</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to add, that the joy produced by this favourable change in Mr. Smithſon's feelings was ſoon diffuſed in the breaſts of his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030803_0024_0FE965AC0959FB60"/>
two diſconſolate ſons. Eugene, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of his father's note, had hurried up to town from Graveſend, like one diſtracted, and was now at Richard's lodgings, indulging the moſt paſſionate effuſions of grief and deſpair; while Richard, depreſſed with a load of ſorrows, ſat moping in ſilence, without a word of comfort to offer to his brother. They hardly perceived Caſſander enter the room; but when he met their eyes, they ſtarted as at the ſight of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. Something prophetic whiſpered comfort to their minds even before he ſpoke. But how
<figure/>
full was the meaſure of their joy when he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to them his father's invitation to repair immediately to his preſence! The ſequel is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to be imagined: all was reconciled: the paſt was forgotten, and the future opened a proſpect of happineſs before them more ſmiling than they had ever enjoyed before.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:030803_0025_0FE965AFB3E80278"/>Thus the Brothers, by the efforts of their mutual affection, increaſed the happineſs that proſperity afforded them, ſuſtained each other under the preſſure of misfortune, and, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in unalterable friendſhip to each other, at length enſured both their own happineſs and that of their deareſt and firſt friend on earth—their Father.</p>

            <head>THE THREE SISTERS.</head>
            <p>NOT many years ago there returned from Bengal a man whom we will call John Sterling: he had been well educated, was ſprung from a decent family, and brought home the ſame good heart which he carried out with him from Britain. As his fortune was now very large, and he had formed no matrimonial connexions, his firſt care, on his arriving in his native land, was to diſcover what relations he had ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and to inquire into their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in order to beſtow on the moſt deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, part of his great acquiſitions. It chanced that the perſon to whom he applied, was able to aſſiſt in his ſearch. "Some at leaſt," ſaid he, "of your family, I can give you a pretty good account of: you have two cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030803_0026_0FE965B992E791B0"/>
ſettled in London; they are ſiſters, and are by no means in diſtreſſed circumſtances, but are perfect contraſts to each other in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living. The eldeſt of them is avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to an extreme, lives in a paltry lodging, keeps but one maid ſervant, and in ſhort ſeems to have no pleaſure on earth, except that of heaping up money. Not ſo her younger ſiſter; ſhe takes care to ſpend to the very extremity of her income. She takes great delight in dreſs, equipage, and every ſpecie of luxury, but her expences of the ſhowy kind never prevent the exertions of her humanity: there paſſes no week in which ſhe does not diſtribute, on an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed day, money, cloaths, and victuals to a number of beggars, who crowd around her door to be relieved." "This laſt couſin of mine," ſaid our Indian, "I like well enough, by your account; but as to the other, not a penny of mine ſhall ſhe have, to add to her heaps, an old avaricious ſkin-flint!"</p>
            <p>With theſe ſentiments, John Sterling ſet out to viſit his youngeſt relation. From her he met with a polite and hoſpitable reception, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from her houſe in a perfect good humour with her and her manner of living.</p>
            <p>It happened that the only maid ſervant who lived with the eldeſt ſiſter, was acquainted in the family of the perſon from whom Sterling had received his intelligence concerning the characters of the two ſiſters. Some of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics had overheard the converſation, and took the firſt opportunity to reproach the girl for the parſimony of her miſtreſs, which they told her had loſt her the ſharing of a fine ſum of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030803_0027_0FE965BB193DC6D8"/>
money. This ſoon reached the ears of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male miſer, whoſe vexation, at hearing what ſhe had miſſed, was almoſt inſupportable. The large fortune, which by dint of the moſt penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious economy ſhe had ſcraped together, now appeared to her leſs than nothing, when ſhe conſidered the immenſe treaſures of her couſin, all of which ſhe thought might have been her own, had ſhe but managed ſo as to gain the good graces of the owner. "Perhaps," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "it may not, even now, be too late to retrieve my error. Some of my money I muſt ſacrifice, it is true, but then if I ſucceed, I ſhall be nobly reimburſed. It will go to my heart, indeed, to part with what has been the whole joy of my life to procure, but I ſee no other chance in my favour, and this ſcheme muſt be tried." Having taken her reſolution, ſhe determined, as the firſt ſtep, to contrive to fall into company with her opulent relation. This ſhe ſoon brought about, by meeting him at her ſiſter's, where he was almoſt always to be found. She now endeavoured, by every win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace in her power to captivate his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when ſhe thought ſhe had in ſome meaſure ſucceeded, ſhe took an opportunity to reproach him for appearing to have forgotten that he had ſuch a relation as herſelf. "No, Madam," ſaid the blunt Sterling, "I had by no means forgotten you, but the plain truth is, that finding on inquiry, that your turn and mine were as widely different as light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I thought that no good could ariſe from any connexion between us." "I comprehend you, Sir," (replied the lady,) you have heard
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030803_0028_0FE965C1923DD490"/>
me repreſented in the moſt odious colours, as a pattern of meanneſs and avarice. How cruel is the tongue of defamation! I have laid up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is true, but Heaven knows with what intent! The ſervice of my indigent fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures has been my real motive, and it was only to amaſs a ſum ſufficient to lay the foundation of a new Hoſpital, that I have deprived myſelf of not only the <hi>ſuperfluities,</hi> but almoſt of the <hi>neceſſaries</hi> of life. At length I have attained to my wiſh, and to-morrow I intend to depoſit, in the hands of proper truſtees, five hundred guineas, which I mean to be laid out in the purchaſe of land for the edifice to ſtand upon." The honeſt Indian was completely taken in by this manoeuvre. "How unjuſtly," ſaid he to himſelf, "have I thought of this poor woman! Here has ſhe denied herſelf every gratification for the ſake of the poor, and I have looked on her as a ſelf-intereſted miſer! Well, well, I muſt contrive to make her amends." Then turning to the lady, "Madam," ſaid he, "hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I have miſtaken your character, but I now honour you as much as a few hours paſt I deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed you. But you muſt not prevent me from ſharing with you the merit of the noble work which you have taken in hand; to-morrow I will attend upon you, and will add my part to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which you are about to make." He kept his word, and accompanied her the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: he then ſaw her make a depoſit of the ſum which ſhe had mentioned, to which he joined a much more conſiderable preſent for the ſame charitable purpoſe.</p>

of the day to his friend, and was tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him how very unjuſtly he had thought of the elder of his couſins, when he was told that an old domeſtic of the family earneſtly entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak with him. "Perhaps," ſaid the good Eaſt Indian, "he may need my aſſiſtance; let him come in." The poor fellow entered. "Can I, my good friend, be of any ſervice to you?" ſaid Sterling. "I am very unfortunate," ſaid the ſuppliant, "and it is only the report which I have heard of your goodneſs, which has tempted me to this application. I lived twenty years in the ſervice of your worthy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: I married, and when I loſt my good maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſet up a little ſhop: when I was going on with tolerable ſucceſs, I was utterly ruined by an unfortunate fire, which conſumed my whole ſtock. Since that cruel event I have been unable to provide for my young and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous family, and I now preſume to hope that your goodneſs will enable me to put my poor children into ſome way of buſineſs."</p>
            <p>"But why, in the name of wonder, did you not apply to my two couſins!" "Alas, good Sir, I addreſſed myſelf to them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my misfortunes; but from the eldeſt I met with a poſitive refuſal; and the other lady, though ſhe offered me ſome relief, yet ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied that offer with the condition of my coming publicly along with other poor, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive charity at her door; and indeed, Sir, it appeared hard to one who had been a reputable, tradeſman, to be reduced to beg his bread at a door in a public ſtreet. No Sir, I rather choſe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030803_0030_0FE965C9C93BD0B8"/>
to get into a ſervice, which I fortunately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to do."</p>
            <p>"And what my good friend became then of your children?"</p>
            <p>"My eldeſt daughter, Sir, has had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of being protected by your Honour's couſin, Madam Sophia, who is goodneſs itſelf, and who, although in very narrow circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet finds opportunities of doing a thouſand good actions."</p>
            <p>"How?" ſaid the good Sterling, "and have I another couſin? And is ſhe poor, and yet is ſhe charitable? And have I, like a blockhead as I am, been ignorant of her very exiſtence?"</p>
            <p>"There is ſuch a one, I aſſure you, Sir; ſhe is the daughter of your uncle, and young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the three ſiſters."</p>
            <p>"Is this poſſible?" ſaid the Eaſt Indian, "and if ſo, how comes it about that neither of her ſiſters have mentioned her name to me? Where has ſhe lived? How came ſhe ſo poor?"</p>
            <p>"The good lady, Sir, truſted her fortune in the hands of a merchant who became a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and loſt nearly the whole of it. She then retired, with what little ſhe had remaining, to a village in the country, where ſhe boarded at the houſe of a friend of her's who married a clergyman. There, from her ſmall income, ſhe found means to be of infinite ſervice to her poor neighbours; ſhe viſited the ſick, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the young, and by her example and advice, ſhe reclaimed the idle, and encouraged the worthy members of ſociety. As to her name not being mentioned to you by her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I fear their motive for keeping you in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030803_0031_0FE965CED67C35D8"/>
concerning her, was their conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſuperior claim to your favour and protection."</p>
            <p>"This," cried Sterling, "is the exact per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I am looking for. Come, my lad, get your boots ready, to-morrow you ſhall be my guide to the village where this precious couſin of mine reſides; trouble yourſelf no more about your children; they ſhall hence forward be <hi>my</hi> care: and as to yourſelf, quit your ſervice as ſoon as you can with decency; you are too old to wear a livery, I will provide for you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably for the reſt of your life."</p>
            <p>"Oh, Sir," ſaid the old ſervant, "be aſſured that what is left of that life ſhall be employed in praying for bleſſings on you, and on my kind benefactreſs Madam Sophia."</p>
            <p>Sterling ſoon reached the village. He alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the parſonage, and inquired of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning his amiable couſin. "She is an angel," ſaid the prieſt; "notwithſtanding the loſs of her fortune, her countenance expreſſes the happy tranquillity of her mind. Nothing, in ſhort, can deprive her of her benevolence, and that benevolence muſt always inſure her tranquillity." "Tell her, I entreat you, Sir," ſaid Sterling, "that a relation, whom ſhe has never ſeen, begs to be introduced to her." So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia received her couſin with unaffected regard and natural politeneſs. "I am enchanted with you, my ſweet couſin!" ſaid the Eaſt Indian. "In your modeſt, neat, linen gown, you look more like a woman of faſhion than your ſhowy ſiſter in her gayeſt dreſſes; and poor as you are, your features are illuminated by an air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030803_0032_0FE965D539EBE950"/>
which never appears on the viſage of that other ſiſter of yours; that rich lady that founds hoſpitals! But tell me now, honeſtly, couſin Sophy, how has it happened that neither of my couſins ever made mention of your name to me ſince my arrival? Have you fallen out with them? Or do they not know where you reſide?"</p>
            <p>"Believe me, Sir," replied Sophia, "I love them both too well to keep them in ignorance of my place of abode, and within theſe laſt three days I have written to each of them" "Hard-hearted wretches!" exclaimed the good Sterling; "can I ever forget their indifference to ſo amiable a relation?" "Excuſe them this one time," ſaid the gentle Sophia; "I doubt not but that they meant to have made me amends for this omiſſion, by the future kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their behaviour." "No, no," ſaid her couſin, "I know the vileneſs of their hearts. They were conſcious of your ſuperior merit, and dreaded, leſt I ſhould reward it by beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on you that fortune which each of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready graſped as her own: but their odious cunning and greedineſs ſhall be diſappointed. To your oſtentatious ſiſter I will not give one farthing; ſhe does good, indeed, but it is merely for the ſake of being talked of abroad as a woman of unbounded charity. Your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious ſiſter I am ſtill leſs diſpoſed to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The donation which ſhe has made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the poor, has her own intereſt ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in view, that it gives me infinitely more <hi>diſguſt</hi> than <hi>pleaſure. You,</hi> my worthy couſin, who do good actions merely becauſe it is right and fitting to do them, <hi>you</hi> I declare
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030803_0033_0FE965D8801B3CA8"/>
to be my ſole inheritrix; and from this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I inſiſt on your making uſe of my fortune as if it were your own. I know that fortune is by no means neceſſary to your happineſs; but I know, at the ſame time, that <hi>your</hi> being rich will be the means of communicating happineſs to numbers of ſufferers, whom, until now, you could only pity and not relieve."</p>

            <head>THE CONTRAST.</head>
            <p>FREDERIC was the ſon of a lady of fortune, who, having retired to her eſtate in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, beſtowed moſt of her time on his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In return for her attachment to him, Frederic was modeſt, ſtudious, and humane; he felt the obligations which he was under to his parent, and did his beſt to requite them by purſuing her inſtructions with care, and by preferring her company to that of any other perſon. Jacob, a lad of the ſame age with Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric, and whoſe mother's cottage ſtood near the park-pale of the lady we have juſt ſpoken of, was in every reſpect of a character directly oppoſite to that of his amiable neighbour. He
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030803_0034_0FE965DED1D3B880"/>
was loved by no one, not even by his poor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all whoſe endeavours could never prevail on him even to take the pains of learning to read. The moſt innocent way in which he ſpent his time was in loitering from place to place, and lounging about; at other ſeaſons he was the plague of his comrades, and, in conſequence, the deteſtation of the village. Frederic was too well bred up to chooſe ſo vile a boy for a play-fellow; Jacob, however, taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the opportunities which the ſituation of his mother's tenement gave him, ſtole, one day, into the room where Frederic's playthings were kept, broke to pieces his violin and his chariot, completely ſpoilt his bird organ, and carried off in triumph his hobby-horſe.</p>
            <p>The author of this miſchief was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and Frederic, in the firſt emotions of reſentment, was running, by the advice of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to acquaint the mother of Jacob with the exploits of her ſon. "But, no," ſaid he checking his ſpeed, "ſhe is a ſevere woman, and ſhe will horſewhip him without mercy, and, may be, ſhut him up in an out-houſe for a week together. How ſhould I like that for myſelf? No, no, I had better forgive him, for this once."</p>
            <p>Not long after this, Frederic was walking out with his beloved mother, when unluckily they ſtrolled near a place where the thoughtleſs, wicked Jacob was amuſing himſelf by throwing ſtones with all his little force at every object within his reach, totally regardleſs of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which he might occaſion. One of theſe unluckily hit the little Frederic on the head,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030803_0035_0FE965E20EFFAD08"/>
and fetched the blood; but Frederic was too much of a man to cry at a little pain.—"Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma," ſaid the ſpirited lad, "this ſtone has hurt me a little, but I dare ſay the pain will ſoon be over." As his forehead, however, was all covered with blood, his mother went directly home with him and had every proper care taken of his wound. It was an ugly one, and brought on a fever, and it was the end of ſeven or eight days before he was permitted to walk out, and his mother being engaged with company, ordered a ſervant to accompany him. As they were walking, the diſcourſe turned on the wickedneſs of Jacob; and juſt as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic was hopeing that they might ſee nothing of him during their walk, they heard a ruſtling noiſe in a tree behind them, and down, at once, came Jacob, ſcreaming and crying, from the top of an elm, which his uſual ſpirit of miſchief had tempted him to climb in purſuit of a crow's neſt. "I fear," ſaid Frederic, exerting his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to raiſe the poor wretch, "that you have hurt yourſelf ſadly." Jacob ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his groans and cries; and well he might, for, upon examination, his leg appeared to be, broken in two places. "Poor fellow," ſaid the benevolent Frederic, "how he muſt ſuffer! let us contrive ſome how or other, to convey him home to his mother.—Unhappy woman! what diſtreſs muſt ſhe not feel when ſhe ſees the condition of her unlucky ſon!" Her diſtreſs was great indeed. "Poor as I am," ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "I can juſt ſupport myſelf and this ungracious lad; but how ſhall I ever be able to pay the long demand which the ſurgeon will
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030803_0036_0FE965E86A59C430"/>
have upon me, by the time that Jacob reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers." Little Frederic, who was a witneſs to her complaints, afforded to them thoſe tears which his own ſuffering could never extort from him.—"Make yourſelf eaſy, my good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour," ſaid the amiable boy, "and oblige me ſo far as to accept this new crown-piece, which my good Mama has juſt given me, that I might buy me a fairing, but I can do without it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>you</hi> can." The afflicted mother looked at him with ſilent admiration. Frederic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to aſſure her, that he was conſcious of the ſmallneſs of the ſum, (though it was his all) he would uſe his intereſt with his parent for a larger ſupply, and did not doubt to obtain it. The unfortunate woman now found her tongue, and expreſſed in the moſt affecting terms, her aſtoniſhment at ſeeing his earneſtneſs in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that worthleſs lad, by whoſe miſchievous hand his forehead was <hi>ſtill</hi> ſmarting. "This," ſaid ſhe, "is <hi>truly</hi> to return good for evil!" Frederic now returned to his mother, and after giving her the hiſtory of the whole occurrence, "How comes it, Mama," ſaid he, "that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I was truly ſorry for poor Jacob's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; and though I feel both for him and his mother, yet, on the whole, I am more <hi>pleaſed</hi> than <hi>grieved?</hi>" "Child," ſaid the lady, "you have had an opportunity of doing well, and you have made uſe of it; and, believe me, throughout life you will find, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having done a benevolent action will be the moſt effectual cordial for every painful ſenſation."</p>

               <l>The morning came, the chaiſe was brought,</l>

               <l>The ſtones did rattle underneath,</l>

               <l>His horſe, who never in that ſort</l>
               <l>Had handled been before,</l>
               <l>What thing upon his back had got</l>
               <l>Did wonder more and more.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>He little dreamt when he ſet out,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,</l>

            <head>FATAL EFFECTS OF DELAY.</head>
            <p>CHARLES STANLEY was the ſecond ſon of a gentleman, who poſſeſſed a ſmall eſtate in Yorkſhire, (Old England) which at his death was deſigned for his eldeſt ſon, and the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt was to be brought up to ſome genteel buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by which he might improve the little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which his father intended for him. Charles gave early marks of a ſweet and engaging tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; he was dutiful to his parents, he tenderly loved his brother, and was ſo obliging to the ſervants, that he became the favourite with them all. Every little boy in the village talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the good nature of little Charles, and of his willingneſs to part with his ſweetmeats and playthings.</p>
            <p>When Charles was about four years old, his father ſent him to a neighbouring ſchool, where he was very ſoon as much remarked for the progreſs he made in learning as he had been for his ſweet temper. He read better than any boy in the ſchool, and whenever he went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030803_0049_0FE96626255501C0"/>
his maſter to ſpell, he was certain to get the firſt place. This great quickneſs gave much delight to his fond parents and his tutor, though they obſerved that with all his good qualities, Charles had one capital fault; inſtead of going directly to ſchool he would often loiter in the fields till long after the other boys had gone in, and his books were always to be ſought for at the very time when he ſhould have taken them to his maſter.</p>
            <p>At a proper age, Charles was placed by his father at a great ſchool, where he no longer found the indulgence to his faults, which he had met with from the village tutor. He was not allowed to defer the morning's taſk till the afternoon, and it was remarked to him that he was inferior in learning to many who were his juniors in age. Charles was ſtung with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; he knew that he was able to excel, and be reſolved that he would at ſome time take great pains, and obtain the ſame rank he had held in the village ſchool; but he thought he might defer this till ſome future time. His work, while he was under the eye of his maſter, was performed as well, and in leſs time than that of moſt of his ſchool-fellows; but the taſks which he had to perform out of ſchool hours were always deferred, and every thing furniſhed Charles with an excuſe for delay; not that he paſſed his vacant time in play; inſtead of that he was often employed in writing exerciſes for his ſchool-fellows while they were amuſing themſelves, and his own taſk was deferred till the morning, when there was little time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it well, and he was puniſhed for the faults.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030803_0050_0FE96706E81A24D0"/>
Thus poor Charles ſeldom enjoyed the proper ſeaſon for play. He was compelled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete his taſk, when his companions were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying themſelves in innocent ſports, and he was ſeldom ſet free from work till they were retiring to reſt.</p>
            <p>Charles continued in this ſituation till the age of fourteen, and was every day remarked for his abilities to excel, and for thoſe habits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay which often deſtroyed all the advantages he naturally poſſeſſed. Mr. Stanley then took him to London, and placed him with a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, a friend of his, in the city, to whom he hoped Charles would become ſo agreeable, as in time to be admitted into partnerſhip with him. In this ſituation Charles gave the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proofs of integrity, ſweet temper, and great abilities, but delay attended whatever he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took; he was not dreſſed till ſome hours after he ſhould be at the deſk; he did not get to the Cuſtom-Houſe till the books were ſhut, nor appear upon Change, till every man of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs had deſerted it. With more virtues, and greater ability, than almoſt any man of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, he became a general object of ridicule and deriſion, and when the term of his apprenticeſhip expired, he found that, with a character which was ſhaded with only one foible, all intimate connexions with him were ſhunned by the ſober part of the trading world.</p>
            <p>About this time Charles had the misfortune to loſe his father, who bequeathed him ſuch a fortune as entitled him to expect a partnerſhip in ſome reſpectable houſe. But his known ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of delay prevented his friends from making
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030803_0051_0FE9662E61B87628"/>
the offer; and though he fully intended to ſeek ſuch a connexion, yet he continued to defer it till he had greatly leſſened his little patrimony. His father had introduced him to ſeveral friends who might have aſſiſted him greatly, but he had diſguſted them by his conduct, by deferring his viſits to unſeaſonable hours, and by protracting them till the repeated yawns of the family informed him that it was time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Charles, who ſaw himſelf in a ſituation where he was very likely to be without either friends or fortune, now reſolved to exert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to follow the plan which his father had traced out for his conduct in life. He could not, indeed, meet with an agreeable partnerſhip, but he determined to enter into a mercantile line by himſelf; and his friends, who were delighted with his exertions, formed ſuch extenſive connexions for him, that he had the greateſt chance of being in a few years one of the richeſt men in the city. But alas! his habit of delay had acquired more ſtrength than he was aware of, and his efforts to conquer it were but tranſient. Charles ſoon relapſed into his former indolence. He deferred buſineſs till he had not time to tranſact it. He neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to comply with the orders of his correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents till the goods they ſent for were no longer wanted; and he omitted inſuring his veſſels, not becauſe he intended to riſk the loſs, but becauſe, as he did not ſee them ſinking he thought he might defer the buſineſs to ſome future time. In a ſhort time his buſineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, ſeveral of his veſſels had either been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or loſt, his creditors poured in from every
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030803_0052_0FE9662FEB2BE910"/>
quarter, his property could not anſwer their demands; and Charles Stanley, whoſe integrity was reſpected by all, was hurried to priſon, with the conviction that his misfortunes were the conſequence of his folly.</p>
            <p>In this wretched ſituation Charles was a prey to ſorrow. His heart was melted at the miſery which many poor and innocent families muſt have ſuffered from his failure; and he thought of the uneaſineſs he muſt have given to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with agony. Firmly did he reſolve, that if he could ever again be eſtabliſhed, he would atone by his future diligence for his paſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct; but where could he look for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? His mother had no more than was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for her ſupport; and his brother had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given him whatever he could afford. Charles was ſitting alone, reflecting upon the ſad ſituation of his affairs, when he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a gentleman inquired for him below, and in a few moments he beheld a brother of his mother's, whom the family had believed to be dead, but who was juſt returned from India with a large fortune. Mr. Hilton was much grieved at the miſconduct and misfortunes of his nephew; but was ſo much affected by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous account of his paſt faults, and his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of amendment, that he generouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all his debts, and enabled him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again amongſt his old acquaintance with credit.</p>
            <p>Charles, fully ſenſible of the miſeries from which he had been delivered, was very earneſt to ſettle himſelf in ſome buſineſs which would afford him ſupport; and his kind uncle, who
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030803_0053_0FE966349043CD98"/>
hoped that a new ſcene would be favourable to his new-formed plans, earneſtly adviſed him to embark for India, promiſing to return with him that he might ſee him well ſettled. This good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs filled the heart of Charles with the warmeſt gratitude; he fell at his feet, and declared with tears, that he would exert himſelf to the utmoſt to fulfil the commands of his generous bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. Every thing was ordered for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and when the time arrived for the ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſhip, Mr. Hilton went on board with ſome goods which were in readineſs, leaving his nephew to follow him to the Downs with thoſe which were not quite finiſhed. But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay again appeared in the conduct of Charles; he omitted inquiring after them till an expreſs arrived from Mr. Hilton, with the account that the veſſel was to ſail the next day, and that he muſt haſten down immediately. Charles then began to execute the orders which his uncle had left, but was detained ſo long before he could get the goods, that when he reached the Downs he found the ſhip had ſailed ſome hours. Almoſt diſtracted with this account, and with the thoughts of what his kind uncle muſt think of his miſconduct, he wandered about for ſome time in the greateſt diſtreſs, and at length having become almoſt deſperate, he hired a quick-ſailing boat, in hopes of being able to overtake the ſhip. For ſome time they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced rapidly, and gained ſight of the India ſhip, and the heart of Charles was alternately agitated by hope and fear. But ſuddenly the ſky was overcaſt, the ſea ſwelled, the wind roared, and the boatmen declared that there
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030803_0054_0FE96637D2C65DB0"/>
was every appearance of an approaching ſtorm, which ſoon raged round them with the utmoſt fury. The veſſel, which was too light to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt its force, was toſſed about at the mercy of the wind and waves, and the only hope the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Charles had of ſaving his own life, and thoſe of his companions, was by reaching the ſhip which they ſaw at a ſmall diſtance before them. But they exerted every effort in vain; a great ſea broke over the bark, and Mr. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had the miſery of ſeeing it ſink for ever into the boſom of the ocean, and to lament the loſs of the unfortunate Charles, who, though poſſeſſed of ſuch talents as made him loved and admired by all, yet by one unhappy foible was rendered miſerable and ridiculous through life, and ſubjected to a dreadful and premature death.</p>

            <head>THE NOSEGAY.</head>
            <p>CAPTAIN DORMER, and his amiable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, had lived during ſeveral years at their ſeat in Dorſetſhire, happy in themſelves, and beloved by all around them, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the unwelcome account that the Captain was commanded to join his regiment, which
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030803_0055_0FE966420F8C0E88"/>
was ordered to embark for America. The news of this event filled all the country with ſorrow. The rich grieved for the loſs of ſo excellent a neighbour; the poor mourned for the departure of their kind and conſtant bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; and the tenants and ſervants wept aloud at the thoughts of being ſeparated from a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who had always treated them more like children than dependants. But in vain were their intreaties that he would remain; honour called upon him to depart, and Mrs. Dormer ſaw, with the utmoſt ſorrow, that to honour he would ſacrifice the ſtrongeſt feelings of his breaſt. She reſolved, however, not to be left behind, and in a ſhort time they exchanged the tranquil pleaſures of Belmount, for the horrors of carnage and war.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Dormer had not been long in America before ſhe lay-in of twins, both daughters, and very beautiful. In the care of theſe ſweet children ſhe found ſome relief during the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent abſences of her huſband, and would oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en indulge the hope of returning peace, when the Captain, inſtead of engaging in the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his fellow-creatures, might enjoy the delight of improving his little Fanny and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. The children daily became more fond of their parents, often clinging to their father when they ſaw him preparing to go out, and always clapping their little hands with joy when they ſaw him return. As ſoon as they were able to ſpeak, Mrs. Dormer taught them to ſay Papa, and in a ſhort time, when they ſaw him at a diſtance, they would directly leave their play, and running up to Mama, would
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030803_0056_0FE96643942CFE48"/>
cry out,
<q>Papa is come, dear papa is come to ſee his little girls.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The improvement of the children became more viſible every day, and they were daily more dear to their parents, when Captain Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, returning from a foraging party, was fiercely and ſuddenly attacked by the Indians, and a deſperate engagement enſued. The time when Mrs. Dormer had expected his return had long paſſed, and ſhe ſat in ſilent agony look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her dear children, whom at one moment ſhe feared were deprived of their parent, and the next, ſtepping to the room door, ſhe anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly liſtened to every noiſe, and was fearful, leſt even the ſound of her own breath ſhould prevent her from hearing the well-known ſtep of her beloved huſband. At length a ſound reached her ears—it came nearer; it increaſed, and ſhe flew down ſtairs in the fond hope of welcoming the return of what was moſt dear to her. The door was opened, but it no longer opened to admit the tender huſband and fond father joyfully returning from the labours of the day; Captain Dormer was brought in a mangled lifeleſs corpſe.</p>
            <p>Thus cruelly deprived of her huſband, Mrs. Dormer reſolved to return to England, and to employ her time in the education of her little girls. She took them down into Dorſetſhire, and inſtructed them herſelf; and little Fanny and Sophia Dormer were ſoon remarked as the neateſt work-women in the country. But their good Mama did not direct their attention merely to the little arts of making trifling or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments: ſhe taught them that virtue was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030803_0057_0FE96649DD607648"/>
to accompliſhments, and that what was uſeful was more excellent than what was merely elegant. Little Fanny ſoon underſtood, that though muſic gave her great delight, it was ſtill more delightful by her own ſweetneſs to charm all around her; and Sophia learned that no pleaſure was equal to the pleaſure of doing good to her fellow-creatures.</p>
            <p>In this happy retirement Mrs. Dormer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome years improving her ſweet girls in real virtue and uſeful knowledge. At this time Lady Aubrey, a relation of Mrs. Dormer's paid her a viſit, and upon her re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turn would gladly have prevailed with the good mother to ſuffer both her daughters to ſpend ſome time with her in London. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Mrs. Dormer could not agree to; but as Fanny had ſhown a ſtrong affection for her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip, and earneſtly wiſhed to ſee London, ſhe conſented to her going; and Sophia, who preferred the company of her Mama to any other enjoyment, was left at home. At firſt indeed, ſhe felt uneaſy without her ſiſter; ſhe found a ſolo on the harpſichord was not half ſo agreeable as a duet, and the beautiful alcove in the garden was not near ſo pleaſant, as when Fanny ſat with her there, at her drawing or needle-work. By degrees, however, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came reconciled to her loſs, but frequently thought that Fanny could not enjoy half the pleaſure in London that ſhe did at Belmount, in aſſiſting her Mama to work for the poor people of the village, or in going with her to viſit thoſe who were ſick. But her greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was in the office which Mrs. Dormer had
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030803_0058_0FE9664D786996E0"/>
given her of diſtributing the broken victuals, which were given away to the poor every day at her gate. This was the higheſt pleaſure Sophia could receive. She flew with rapture to the houſe-keeper to obtain her welcome burden, under which ſhe tottered to the door. She exulted in ſeeing ſo many poor creatures made happy by her bounty, and delighted to hear them ſay,
<q>Here comes the good little girl; ſhe will, one day, be as good a lady as her Mama;</q>
and ſhe often thought with great pleaſure of the joy which her ſiſter Fanny would have, when ſhe returned, in this new employment.</p>
            <p>But Fanny's viſit to Lady Aubrey unfitted her for the innocent pleaſures of Belmount. She never heard of ſuch a thing as working for the poor from her Ladyſhip; and cards, dreſs, and elegant equipages, engaged the attention of all the circles to which Fanny was admitted. She almoſt learned to forget the poor; and when ſhe returned to Belmount, ſhe ſpoke haughtily to the ſervants, and ſcarcely noticed her inferiors; and when the poor came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their daily allowance, inſtead of ſerving them, ſhe either turned away, or ſuffered her little favourite dog, Surly, to bark at them, and ſhake their tattered cloaths. All the village talked of her pride, and lamented that the good Mrs. Dormer ſhould have ſuch a naughty little girl; but the good and gentle Sophia was loved by them all. They preſented her with the choiceſt flowers in their gardens, and the moſt beautiful bantams and pea-fowls were ſent to the poultry-yard of the good little girl that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030803_0059_0FE96655C6ECB868"/>
ſo well to every one. When Mrs. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer came from church, all the farmers and their wives made their beſt bows and curtſies to the good lady, who ſpoke kindly to them all. She was followed by Fanny, who never turned her head aſide; but when Sophia came near, the children plucked one another, and ſaid,
<q>Here comes the good young lady, ſee how good humoured ſhe looks: ſhe will aſk us all how we do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fanny could not avoid ſeeing how diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able her pride made her to every body, and ſhe found herſelf much leſs happy than ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe went to London; but ſhe had learned there to think that ſuch behaviour was right, and, if it was an error, ſhe fooliſhly reſolved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to adhere to it than to own ſhe had been wrong. She was one day invited with her ſiſter to a ball at the houſe of a lady in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, where ſhe was to meet all the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that country. Her heart exulted in the thoughts of this gay party, and ſhe reſolved to behave in the ſame manner ſhe had ſeen ſome faſhionable ladies do in London. Upon enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the room ſhe advanced to a ſmall knot of young ladies of her acquaintance; and, without ſpeaking to the reſt of the company, began to make remarks upon their dreſs and manners in a whiſpering voice, but in a tone loud enough to be heard. After ſome time a young lady, whom ſhe had never ſeen before, entered the room, in a dreſs made up in a manner very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any that Fanny had ever obſerved; ſhe directly began to ſneer at her, and declared, that for her part ſhe was ſurpriſed ſuch ſtrange
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030803_0060_0FE966574D8D21A8"/>
figures ſhould think of mixing with people of faſhion, and wondered where they came from. The young lady, confounded at ſo rude a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, retired to a corner, where ſhe was joined by the good humoured Sophia, who chatted with her till the lady of the houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the room, and introduced her into the company as the eldeſt daughter of the Duke of Dorſet, who was juſt returned from a tour to France. Nothing could exceed the chagrin of Fanny, when ſhe found that the young lady whom ſhe had been ridiculing was the principal perſon in the company, and that the dreſs ſhe had deſpiſed, was the admiration of all who ſaw it. She had not the aſſurance to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to repair her fault by apologies, or to preſs her acquaintance upon the lady whom ſhe had ſo groſsly affronted. Indeed ſhe ſaw that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her excuſes nor intimacy would be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe had the mortification of hearing her ſiſter Sophia receive a very preſſing invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Dorſet Houſe, in which ſhe was not included.</p>
            <p>Fanny was greatly mortified at this incident, and ſhe reſolved never to behave in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner again. She ought, indeed, directly to have endeavoured to conquer every feeling of pride, and to return to that behaviour which made her beloved by every body; but ſhe only reſolved that ſhe would not again laugh aloud at a ſtranger in a genteel company, and run the riſk of offending her ſuperiors. As to the poor and miſerable, ſhe thought them beneath her regard.</p>
            <p>Some time after this, Fanny and Sophia were
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030803_0061_0FE9665DB941CA88"/>
again invited to the houſe of a lady, whom, as Fanny regarded her as a perſon of great taſte, ſhe was deſirous to pleaſe her by appearance. She put on all her little finery, but found that one thing was neceſſary to complete her dreſs, which was a Noſegay, and this ſhe was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to buy when they reached the town. They ſet off in the carriage, attended only by ſervants, and by Fanny's little dog, which ran at the ſide of the chariot. Fanny could talk of nothing but of calling at the floriſt's, and of the elegant Noſegay with which ſhe ſhould be adorned. At length they ſaw a little tattered girl laying aſleep upon the ſide of the road, whom Surley directly attacked, and began to ſhake her ragged cloaths. Sophia called him haſtily away, and would have ſucceeded before he had awakened the poor little girl, but Fanny encouraged him to proceed; upon this the child ſtarting up, aimed a blow at the dog, which he avoided, and made a ſnap at her leg. The poor terrified girl then endeavoured to run away, but in running miſſed her ſtep, and fell down the bank into the ditch. She had hurt her foot, and lay crying in the ditch till Sophia ordered the ſervant to take her up, and, contrary to the advice of Fanny, deſired him to place her in the chariot that they might convey her home. She then began to comfort the poor child, and inquired about her hurt; but ſhe continued to cry out, "O my poor mammy, my poor mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, what will ſhe do, now I cannot run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and beg for her and my daddy!" "Who is your mammy," ſaid Sophia, "and what ſhall we do for your foot?" "Oh! don't mind my
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030803_0062_0FE96660F67C0B38"/>
foot," ſaid the child, "give me only ſome bread for my poor mammy and daddy, and my little brother, and I don't care what becomes of my foot."</p>
            <p>The child had ſcarcely finiſhed her ſpeech when the carriage ſtopped at the door of a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which the little girl ſaid was her home. When ſhe attempted to get out, ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable to walk, and was obliged to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the footman, who, accompanied by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, entered the houſe, while Fanny remained in the carriage ſullenly pouting at her ſiſter's condeſcenſion, and very angry to be ſo delayed. She was indeed ſorry to ſee the poor child ſo hurt, and when ſhe was taken out of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage gave her what money ſhe could ſpare; but ſhe took care to keep enough to buy her elegant Noſegay. When Sophia entered the houſe, ſhe found a ſcene of miſery which ſhe could not have conceived. The father of the little girl had long laboured under an ague and fever, her mother was worn down with poverty and fatigue, and her little brother crying for hunger in a corner of a poor cottage, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of almoſt of all its furniture, which had been ſold to buy neceſſaries. Sophia found that little Sally had gone out in the morning to beg ſomething for this afflicted family, and that, quite exhauſted with hunger and fatigue, ſhe ſet down upon the bank and cried herſelf to ſleep. The tender heart of Sophia was greatly affected by this diſtreſs; ſhe empitied her pocket of every farthing which it contained, and gave it to the good woman of the houſe, and would not keep enough to buy the collar which ſhe
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030803_0063_0FE96665A68F3B28"/>
had once intended for her little favourite ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. She then prepared to leave the cottage, but before ſhe went, deſired the poor people to get what was neceſſary, and told them ſhe would ſoon return with her good Mama, who would give them cloaths and victuals enough.</p>
            <p>The ſiſters then proceeded to their viſit. Fanny bought her Noſegay, which was very beautiful: but the ſweetneſs of Sophia, and the cheerfulneſs which the thoughts of the good action ſhe had been performing inſpired her with, made her ſo agreeable, that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were charmed with her, but paid little attention to Fanny. At night, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, Mrs. Dormer noticed Fanny's Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay, which, though it had begun to fade, was ſtill very beautiful. This pleaſed Fanny, and ſhe cried out, "Ah! Mama, I was ſure you would like it, it is ſo very pretty, and my ſiſter liked it very much indeed." "Then why did ſhe not buy one?" ſaid Mrs. Dormer; Fanny hung down her head, and in a faultering tone anſwered, "Becauſe ſhe had no money." Mrs. Dormer, ſurpriſed at this, for ſhe had given ſome to each of them that very morning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from Sophia what was become of it; Sophia then recounted to her mother the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which ſhe had ſeen the poor people at the cottage, but took care not to mention a word of Fanny's ill behaviour: ſhe then told her the way in which ſhe had diſpoſed of her money, and the promiſe ſhe had made of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Mama to the cottage; and ended by begging that ſhe would go with her in the morning. Tranſported with her conduct, Mrs.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030803_0064_0FE966690E336810"/>
Dormer preſſed her virtuous child to her boſom, and promiſed to take care of the wretched fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, for whom Sophia was ſo much intereſted. Then looking with anger at Fanny, ſhe ſaid, "Did you then give nothing to theſe poor unhappy creatures?" Fanny hung down her head in ſilence, for ſhe was aſhamed to ſpeak; but Sophia ſaid, "Oh yes, Mama, indeed ſhe gave them all the money ſhe had; except juſt enough to buy her Noſegay and a trinket for her little watch; and I am ſure if ſhe had gone into the cottage and ſeen their miſery, ſhe would have given them that too." "She ſat at the door then," ſaid Mrs. Dormer, "while you went in." Then turning to Fanny, "Proud and unfeeling girl," ſaid ſhe, "who could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vain and trifling ornaments to the delight of relieving the ſick and miſerable! Retire from my preſence; take with you your trinket and Noſegay, and receive from them all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which they are able to beſtow."</p>
            <p>Sophia would gladly have retired with her ſiſter; ſhe was grieved at the diſpleaſure ſhe had incurred from her Mama, and ſhe wiſhed earneſtly to ſooth and comfort the dejected Fanny. Mrs. Dormer, however, choſe that ſhe ſhould be left alone, and Fanny was obliged to paſs the night by herſelf. She then began to reflect upon the happineſs which ſhe had known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe went to viſit Lady Aubrey: ſhe was then beloved by every one, every body met her with a ſmile; all the ſervants were ready to oblige her, and all the neighbours loved her: now all was changed, and no one except Sophia, no, not even her Mama, ſeemed to love her.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030803_0065_0FE96671582C08B8"/>
At this thought ſhe wept bitterly. "And why am I not beloved?" ſaid ſhe. "And why does every one ſhun me, at the very time that they are ſo fond of my ſiſter? Alas! it is becauſe I am not ſo good as ſhe." Fanny then thought of the vexatious ſituations into which ſhe had been brought by her vanity and pride. They had cauſed her to be ſhunned not only by her inferiors, but by thoſe above her, and had made her generally hated or deſpiſed. Heartily aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her conduct, and grieved at its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, ſhe paſſed the greateſt part of the night in weeping, and reſolved that ſhe would again be good, and again behave in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſhould make her beloved by all, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in herſelf.</p>
            <p>Towards morning Fanny fell aſleep, and, as ſhe was much tired with lying awake ſo long, ſhe ſlept till it was pretty late; the next day when ſhe awoke, ſhe inquired for her Mama, and was reſolved to aſk her forgiveneſs, and to inform her of her ſorrow for her paſt faults, and her reſolutions to amend. She was informed that Mrs. Dormer and Sophia were gone to the cottage, and had taken cloaths, and other neceſſaries for the family, and had ſent for a phyſician to attend the ſick man. "Ah!" ſaid ſhe, "Sophia is happy, and ſhe deſerves to be ſo, for ſhe is good; I was not worthy to have the pleaſure of going to the cottage, but I will be good and happy too." She then roſe, and the firſt thing ſhe ſaw was her Noſegay, which the maid had carefully put into a pot of water the night before. "This Noſegay," ſaid Fanny, "ſhall be the conſtant memorial of my faults, and of my repentance." She then reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030803_0066_0FE9667493F71580"/>
her pallet, and making a beautiful ſketch of the almoſt dying flowers, ſhe wrote under them in a large hand, <hi>Virtue never fades,</hi> and placed the drawing in the moſt conſpicuous part of the room. When Mrs. Dormer returned, ſhe was ſtruck with this elegant performance, and calling for Fanny, had the delight of hearing from herſelf what had paſſed in her mind during the paſt night, and her reſolutions of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After ſome time, during which Fanny had entirely laid aſide her haughty behaviour, the indulgent Mrs. Dormer would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the drawing that it might no longer mortify her child; but Fanny begged it might remain, and whenever ſhe found herſelf inclined to return to her former folly, ſhe placed herſelf before the picture, which ſoon became, not merely the ſhameful memorial of paſt faults, but the elegant monument of her return to virtue.</p>

            <head>COURAGE INSPIRED BY FRIENDSHIP.</head>
            <p>TWO ſailors, a Frenchman named Robert, and a native of Spain, called Antonio, were ſlaves to the ſame maſter at Algiers Friendſhip is the only conſolation of perſons in diſtreſs.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030803_0067_0FE9667AEB72A288"/>
Antonio and Robert happily enjoyed this conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation—they communicated to each other their mutual griefs; they converſed perpetually about their families, their countries, and of the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite delight which the recovery of their liberty, ſhould it ever be granted to their wiſhes, would afford them. Their conferences always ended in a flood of affectionate tears, and this expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their hearts enabled them both to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the hard labour, which was their daily lot, with uncommon fortitude.</p>
            <p>The taſk appointed them was the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a road on the top of a cliff which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung the ſea. One morning the Spaniard reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a moment from his toil, and caſting an anxious look on the ſea, "My friend," ſaid he, "all my vows, all my hopes, are directed towards the oppoſite bounds of that vaſt liquid plain; why can I not, in company with the partner of my woes, attain thoſe happy ſhores? My wife, my children, are ever before my eyes, eagerly longing for my arrival, or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lamenting my ſuppoſed death." Antonio perpetually indulged himſelf in theſe gloomy reflexions, and every day that he was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his work on the cliff, he turned his eyes to the ocean, and regretted the fatal expanſe which ſeparated him from his friends and his country.</p>
            <p>It chanced that one day a Chriſtian ſhip appeared at anchor not very diſtant from the ſhore. "There friend," cried the Spaniard, "do you ſee that veſſel? She brings us life and liberty. Though ſhe will not touch here, (for every one avoids theſe barbarous coaſts) yet to-morrow
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030803_0068_0FE9667E28945DE0"/>
if you chooſe it, Robert, our woes ſhall end, and we will be free! Yes, to-morrow that ſhip will paſs within a league of the ſhore, and we will plunge into the ſea from this rock, or periſh in the attempt; for even death is preferable to this cruel ſlavery." "If you can ſave yourſelf," replied Robert, "I ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my unhappy lot with greater reſignation. You know, Antonio, how dear you are to me; my friendſhip for you will only terminate with my life. I have only one favour to aſk of you; endeavour to find out my father—If grief for my loſs, and old age, have not already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him, tell him"—"What do you mean?" anſwered Antonio; "I ſeek your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!—And do you think I could live happily a ſingle moment with the idea of having left you in chains?" "But I cannot ſwim," cried Robert; "and you know"—"I know that I have the ſtrongeſt friendſhip for you," replied the Spaniard, embracing him, and ſhedding tears of affection:
<q>friendſhip will give me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled ſtrength: you ſhall hold upon my belt, and we will both ſave ourſelves.</q>
In vain did Robert repreſent the danger there would be of his periſhing himſelf, and dragging his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver down with him to deſtruction; nothing could overcome the reſolution of Antonio.
<q>We will both eſcape, or both periſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</q>
he cried. "But we draw the attention of our ſavage keepers; even ſome of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions would be baſe enough to betray us— Farewel—I hear the bell that calls us from our work; we muſt ſeparate; farewel till to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:030803_0069_0FE96684A75CFB08"/>They now returned to their dungeon.— Antonio was wrapped up in the idea of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: he fancied he had already paſſed the Mediterranean, and was in the arms of his friends, his wife, and his children. But Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert formed to himſelf a very different picture: he ſaw his friend falling a victim to his own generoſity, and dragged by him to the bottom of the ſea, and periſhing by that means, when, if he had only conſulted his own ſafety, he might have preſerved himſelf, and been reſtored to the boſom of his family, who moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly were continually lamenting his loſs. "No," ſaid the unfortunate Frenchman to himſelf,
<q>I will not give way to the ſolicitations of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio; I will not repay ſo generous a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by being the cauſe of his death. He will be free. My unhappy father will at leaſt learn that I am alive, and that my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him is unabated. Alas! I could wiſh to be the ſupport and conſolation of his age. He wanted my aſſiſtance—perhaps he is now periſhing in poverty, and wiſhing to ſee and embrace his ſon. However, if Antonio is happy, I ſhall die with leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſlaves were not taken from their priſon the next morning at the uſual hour. The Spaniard was all impatience, while Robert was in doubt whether he ſhould rejoice or grieve at the diſappointment. At length they were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their labour, but they could not ſpeak to each other, for their maſter went with them. Antonio could only look at Robert and ſigh. Sometimes he caſt his eyes towards the ſea, and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030803_0070_0FE96687E84B9CE0"/>
could hardly ſuppreſs his emotions. At length night arrives, and they find themſelves alone. "Let us ſeize this opportunity," cries the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, "Come!" "No," replies the other: my friend I never will conſent to endanger your life: farewel, Antonio! I embrace you for the laſt time. Save yourſelf, I conjure you; you have no time to loſe. Remember our friendſhip. I only requeſt you to remember your promiſe in regard to my father. He muſt be very old, and much in diſtreſs; go and conſole him. If he ſhould want aſſiſtance, I am ſure my friend"—At theſe words the voice of Robert failed—he ſhed a torrent of tears—his boſom was torn with anguiſh. "You weep, Robert," ſays Antonio; "it is not tears, but courage, that we now want: reſiſt no longer; a moment's delay may ruin us; we may never have the opportunity again; either deliver yourſelf to my direction, or I will daſh my head againſt thoſe rocks."</p>
            <p>The Frenchman threw himſelf at the feet of the generous Spaniard: he ſtill repreſented the hazard of the attempt, and pointed out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable danger that muſt attend his reſolution of endeavouring to preſerve him. Antonio made no reply, but catching him in his arms, he ran to the edge of the precipice, and plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him into the ſea. At firſt they both ſunk; but, riſing to the ſurface, Antonio ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted all his force, and ſwimming himſelf, kept Robert alſo above the water, who ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his aſſiſtance, and to fear leſt he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve him in his own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The people in the ſhip were ſtruck with an
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030803_0071_0FE9668CF1DAEC98"/>
               <figure/>
object which they could not well diſtinguiſh. They thought it was ſome ſea-monſter that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the veſſel. Their curioſity was now called another way; they ſaw a boat leave the ſhore and haſtily purſue what ſeemed to them a monſtrous ſea-animal. Theſe were the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who guarded the ſlaves, and who were anxious to overtake Antonio and Robert. The laſt ſaw them approach, and, caſting his eyes on his friend, and perceiving that he grew weak, he made an effort and got looſe from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030803_0072_0FE9669043799A48"/>
ſaying to him at the ſame time. "We "are purſued. Save yourſelf, and let me pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; I only retard your courſe." He had hardly finiſhed theſe words when he ſunk. A new tranſport of friendſhip animates the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; he darts towards the Frenchman, and ſeizing him as he is juſt ready to expire, they both diſappeared.</p>
            <p>The boat, uncertain which way to purſue, ſtopped; while another was ſent from the veſſel to diſcover what the object was which they had ſeen. The waves began to grow rough; at laſt they diſcovered two men, the one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the other, and trying to reach the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. They rowed to them as faſt as poſſible, and came up with them juſt as Antonio's ſtrength began to fail. They took them both on board. Antonio cried out feebly,
<q>Aſſiſt my friend—I die;</q>
—and his countenance ſeemed convulſed with the agonies of death. Robert, who was in a ſwoon, recovering at the inſtant, and ſeeing Antonio without any ſign of life extended by his ſide, was almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; he threw himſelf on the body of his friend. "Antonio!" he cried, "my dear Antonio, my friend, my deliverer, have I been your murderer? Alas! you cannot hear me. Is this your recompenſe for having ſaved my life? But what is life? Who can ſupport it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the loſs of ſuch a friend?"</p>
            <p>Saying this, he ſtarted up in the boat, and, ſeizing a ſword, would have plunged it into his boſom, if he had not been diſarmed; but in the midſt of his lamentations and diſtraction, Providence, apparently to reward an affection
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030803_0073_0FE9669A9CEBD6D0"/>
ſo ſincere, interpoſed in his favour—Antonio breathed a ſigh. Robert flew to the aſſiſtance of his friend, who, lifting up his languid eyes, tried to find the Frenchman, and, as ſoon as he perceived him, cried out with a tranſport be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his ſtrength, "I have ſaved my friend!"</p>
            <p>They were both conveyed on board the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Their exemplary friendſhip diffuſed a reſpect for them among the whole crew. And, ſuch is the effect of virtue even on the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt minds, every one contended with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in ſhowing them attention. Robert ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving in France flew to his father, who was ready to die with exceſs of joy at ſeeing him, and was appointed to a genteel office under the Government. But the Spaniard, who was likewiſe offered a very advantageous poſt, for one in his ſituation of life, choſe rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his wife and family. But abſence did not diminiſh his friendſhip; he continued ſtill to correſpond with Robert, and their letters, which are maſter-pieces of ſimplicity and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do honour to the ſentiment which was capable of producing ſo heroic an action.</p>

            <head>THE DUEL; OR THE MAN OF TRUE COURAGE.</head>
            <p>MELCOUR loſt his parents at an age when he could not be ſenſible of the greatneſs of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. One of his uncles took him home, brought him up with his own ſon, and paid the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030803_0074_0FE9669C247A41C0"/>
utmoſt attention to his education. Florival and Melcour, already united by the ties of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, were ſoon more ſo by thoſe of friendſhip, which, from their living conſtantly together, grew ſtronger every day. They were both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the army. When they were of a proper age, they got commiſſions in the ſame regiment. Florival always hated application, and the diſſipation that naturally attends a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life ſtill inclined him leſs to it. As for Melcour, he had not only a very good natural genius, but a ſtrong inclination to cultivate it. His ſtudies had been properly directed; and a generous and humane diſpoſition, joined with a habit of thinking ſeriouſly, led him to condemn the criminal practice of fighting duels on tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial occaſions, a cuſtom too prevalent in the army.</p>
            <p>Different purſuits leſſened, by degrees, the friendſhip of the two young men. Florival was blinded by the love of pleaſure, he ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all ſorts of extravagance, and became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in debt. Melcour lamented his folly, aſſiſted him with his purſe, and endeavoured to ſave him from the ruin into which he was going to plunge. He repreſented to him how much his conduct degraded him in the eyes of ſenſible people. "Even thoſe," ſaid he to him, "who now applaud your extravagance, will be the firſt to upbraid you when they ſee you in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. They call themſelves your beſt friends, and you believe them; they have eſtranged you from me. They have painted me to you in the moſt unfavourable colours, and if they have not entirely extinguiſhed the friendſhip
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030803_0075_0FE966A2724BB3B0"/>
that ſubſiſted between us, at leaſt they have greatly weakened it. The wretches well knew my ſincere affection for you; they are informed of the pains I have taken to diſcover to you their perfidious deſigns, and they wiſh to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me for them. O, my friend, if they ſhould ſucceed in robbing me of your eſteem, their triumph will be too complete! But, my dear Florival! I do not ſpeak on my own account only. I conjure you, by every ſentiment of virtue that united our infancy, not to plunge a dagger in the heart of the beſt of fathers. If he were to know the exceſſes you run into he would die with ſorrow."</p>
            <p>Theſe remonſtrances touched the heart of Florival. He promiſed to amend; but his perfidious friends repreſented vice to him in ſo amiable a form, that he was unable to reſiſt. Melcour being informed, that, after having loſt a great ſum of money at play, he was gone to diſſipate his ſorrow by infamous debauchery, immediately went to him, and urged to him, with ſome vehemence, the duties of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the promiſes he had made to fulfil them.</p>
            <p>Florival was no longer maſter of himſelf; he fell into a moſt violent rage againſt his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin; he even drew his ſword on him; and on Melcour's refuſing to fight him, he abuſed him in the groſſeſt terms, and was almoſt tempted to ſtrike him. His couſin ſtill kept his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: unworthy as Florival appeared of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he yet only regarded him as a friend and relation.</p>
            <p>Overcome by this ſteadineſs, he at length
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030803_0076_0FE966A60C2C7868"/>
recovered his temper. He was aſhamed of his behaviour, and begged pardon of Melcour for his violence, which was immediately granted by the generous youth, and an immediate and perfect reconciliation took place.</p>
            <p>An officer belonging to another regiment happened to be preſent during the affair; he had been witneſs to the provocation given by Florival, and he imputed the coolneſs of his couſin to want of courage. He did not fail to make many ſarcaſtic remarks on it, and they came at length to the ears of ſome of Melcour's friends. The leaſt ſuſpicion is deemed injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the honour of a ſoldier. After many inquiries, it was diſcovered whoſe conduct had given riſe to the ſcandal. They were told the honour of the corps was wounded through them, and it was their duty to vindicate it. The means were evident. If the report was true, they muſt fight each other; if falſe, they muſt puniſh the author of it. Melcour was truly miſerable. His principles diſapproved of duelling in any inſtance; and in this, if he obeyed the injunctions of his corps, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the terrible neceſſity of plunging his ſword into the boſom of his relation and friend. But, in vain did he repreſent his feelings to his brother officers, they would hear of nothing but the choice of weapons, time, and place. His ſorrow was unutterable: he retired to his apartment. Florival, who went to look for him, found him leaning on a table, hiding his face with his hands, his eyes ſtreaming with tears, and his continual ſighs only interrupted by the frequent repetition of the name of Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030803_0077_0FE966AE2997B868"/>
At ſuch a ſight he was not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf; he threw himſelf at the feet of his friend. His appearance recalled to Melcour all the horror of his ſituation—"What! in a moment I am called upon to pierce your heart, and do you come to ſeek me?—O Florival!" ſaid he, his voice almoſt choaked with tears, "ſhould my arm deprive you of life, I would not ſurvive you. What ſhould I ſay to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? did he take ſo much care of my infancy, to ſee me ſtained with the blood of his ſon? O, wretched old man, whatever may be the event of this horrid duel, it will be an eternal ſource of anguiſh for you!"</p>
            <p>At this inſtant ſome of the officers forced open the door; they came to tell Melcour he could not delay the combat any longer without giving room to call his courage in queſtion. What a terrible ſituation! At this inſtant the two friends were embracing each other—they were unable to return any anſwer.</p>
            <p>Florival was the firſt who broke this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſilence. In him the miſtaken principles of honour at preſent prevailed over thoſe of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. He got up, and extended his arm to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Melcour, without daring to look at him. He aroſe and walked about the room in the greateſt agitation; he fancied he ſaw his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and friend murdered by his hands, and his diſtracted uncle demanding vengeance for the blood of his ſon. At length, recovering himſelf, he turned to the officers, and ſaid to to them in a firm and reſolute tone of voice: I will no longer heſitate to act that part which is pointed out to me by the voice of religion, of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030803_0078_0FE966AFB6606130"/>
reaſon, and of humanity, be the conſequence what it may. My determination is fixed. Go, and inform thoſe who ſent you, that Melcour prefers an <hi>imaginary</hi> diſhonour to a <hi>real</hi> crime, and that no conſideration upon earth ſhall tempt him to point his ſword againſt the boſom of his friend. This anſwer determined his fate. His brother officers informed him with the ſincereſt regret, that, as he had refuſed to fight, it was impoſſible for them to roll with him, and that he muſt quit the regiment. Who can deſcribe the feelings of Florival, when he heard this ſentence? it was <hi>he</hi> who had brought Melcour into this terrible ſituation. The diſgrace of his couſin was owing to <hi>his</hi> follies. Theſe thoughts almoſt drove him to diſtraction. His friends were alarmed for the conſequences, and removed him by force from the mournful ſcene.</p>
            <p>Melcour, left to himſelf, ſoon determined what ſteps to take. He was determined not to return home, to be there expoſed to a diſgrace he was conſcious of not deſerving. He reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to endeavour to improve the talents which Nature had endowed him with by travelling, till time ſhould either obliterate the memory of this unfortunate adventure, or ſhow it in its true light. That very evening he made the proper preparations for his journey, and wrote a letter to his couſin, acquainting him with his intended expedition. "Inform my uncle," he added, "of all that has happened; let him know that they wanted to compel me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your murderer. He will ſhudder at the thought. Though theſe barbarians, guided
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030803_0079_0FE966B6193C76E8"/>
only by a falſe ſenſe of honour, think me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to ſerve my king and country, he at leaſt will applaud the courageous efforts I have made to preſerve us both from a crime. This leſſon, my dear Florival, will be of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to you; your eyes are now opened to the conduct of your companions. Still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue your regard for me; and never eſteem me unhappy while I preſerve a place in your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip."</p>
            <p>He ſet out at day-break the next morning, accompanied by a ſingle ſervant. He had not gone many miles from the garriſon when he ſaw a large detachment of the enemy on the point of defeating an inferior number of French troops. He could not behold his countrymen in danger of being vanquiſhed without burning with ardour to aſſiſt them. Regardleſs of the danger of the attempt, he only liſtened to the call of glory; and this Melcour, whoſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his brother officers had preſumed to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, flew to the field of battle, performed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of valour, took one of the enemy's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and animating his countrymen by his example, they obtained the victory.</p>
            <p>The general officer who commanded the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment was charmed with the bravery of the young warrior, and earneſtly deſired to know his name. "Sir," he replied, "I will tell you who I am directly; but, will you give me leave firſt to aſk, what is the immediate deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your detachment?" "It is going," ſaid he, "to reinforce the neighbouring garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon," (naming that which Melcour had left,) "of which I am to take the command." "Then,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030803_0080_0FE966B958774288"/>
Sir," ſaid Melcour, "if you will permit me, I will attend you thither, and receive there thoſe marks of your approbation that you ſhall be pleaſed to honour me with."</p>
            <p>They arrived. "Sir," ſaid Melcour, "the only favour I aſk of you, is to call together the officers of the regiment of ***" (that which he had quitted); they aſſembled, and Melcour appeared. "Behold, gentlemen," ſaid he, "the unfortunate victim of a falſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to which you ſacrifice every thing, though it often renders you cruel and unjuſt. Becauſe I refuſed to ſtain my hands with the blood of a relation younger than myſelf, and who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated a very ſlight offence by the moſt unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal marks of ſorrow and repentance; becauſe I liſtened to the voice of religion and humanity; becauſe I reſpected the laws, you have judged me unworthy to carry arms in the ſervice of my country. Blinded by prejudice, you have dared to accuſe me of cowardice. For that accuſation I have taken ample revenge. Theſe colours, taken from the enemy, are a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent teſtimony of my courage." His brother officers ſurrounded him, and embracing him, by the praiſes they laviſhed on him, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes they made, they atoned for the raſh ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions they had entertained of him.</p>
            <p>The general, aſtoniſhed and charmed with the behaviour of Melcour, preſſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his rank for the preſent, till he could have an opportunity of reporting ſo gallant an action to the miniſter. Melcour yielded to his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſeconded by thoſe of the officers of the regiment. "Accept," ſaid the general, "that
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030803_0081_0FE966BDF2D1E728"/>
commiſſion you was deprived of yeſterday, as a tacit avowal of the injuſtice of that prejudice which condemned you, and may your example entirely root it out!" Then turning to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers who ſurrounded him, he added: "Let the behaviour of this virtuous young man teach you, for the future, not to accuſe that perſon of cowardice, who, obedient to the laws of true honour, and of his country, refuſes to become a murderer. Renounce, gentlemen, that fatal error, which ſhows you the man of true courage in him who is not afraid to waſh out an injury in the blood of his fellow citizen: behold him rather in the perſon who has greatneſs of ſoul to be above the deſire of revenge. For the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, defer your quarrels till the day of battle, and let the conteſts for ſuperior reſolution be decided in the face of the enemies of your king and country. Or, if the inſult offered you is amenable to the laws, let the laws fix that ignominy on your adverſary that his conduct may deſerve. But, let your warmeſt praiſes be beſtowed on Melcour, and on thoſe who have the magnanimity to follow the example he has this day given us."</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe the tranſports of Florival during this affecting ſcene. From that moment he renounced his fatal errors, and, ſtrictly keeping the ſolemn promiſes he had made to his friend, and profiting by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they both were raiſed to the higheſt ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the army, which they filled with the greateſt honour to themſelves, their family, and their country.</p>

            <p>EMMELINE was the daughter of a gentleman of large fortune; ſhe was always dreſſed in the moſt elegant manner; her nurſery was filled with the moſt expenſive toys, and ſhe had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſervants to wait upon her. If ſhe wiſhed for any thing, however abſurd in itſelf, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of pleaſing her when obtained, yet Emmeline muſt be indulged. Not a ſervant in the houſe was ſuffered to contradict her, and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030803_0083_0FE966CB850D7CD0"/>
ſometimes, if they happened to diſpleaſe her, ſhe would ſcratch and beat them in the moſt violent manner. Notwithſtanding her finery, and her ſuperfluity of toys, notwithſtanding ſhe had every thing at her command which riches could procure, and every one was ſtriving to make her happy, ſhe was a moſt miſerable lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girl. Her tyrannical temper made her univerſally diſliked, even by thoſe who were obliged to be ſubſervient to her, and her fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and ill humour was a conſtant thorn in her own boſom.</p>
            <p>At the entrance of her father's park ſtood a lodge, which was inhabited by a poor man who had alſo one daughter. Little Jenny was one of the beſt tempered girls in the world; ſhe was never ſeen crying and out of humour like Emmeline, but on the contrary, was civil and obliging to every body. There was not a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at the hall but loved her as if ſhe had been their own child; and never did they go down to the lodge, but they were ſure to carry her an apple, or a piece of plum-cake, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nice in their pockets. It frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that Jenny was ſent for to play with Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meline, which ſhe did not like at all, for the young lady was ſo whimſical it was impoſſible to pleaſe her, and frequently would deſire Jenny to do what was very improper. On ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſhe would never comply; for though ſhe paid the haughty little girl every reſpect which was due to her rank, ſhe never forgot what was due to herſelf: well knowing that a wrong ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is equally culpable, whether the perſon who tempts us to commit it, be poor or rich.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030803_0084_0FE966CD0C49C080"/>
If in their play they happened to break any thing, Emmeline would deſire Jenny to ſay it was one of the ſervants who did it; and when ſhe refuſed to be guilty of ſo wicked an action, Emmeline would put herſelf in a violent paſſion, and frequently beat her. In ſhort it is not to be conceived how diſagreeable ſhe made her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. She was alſo very ignorant; ſhe could neither read, nor write; for though ſhe had ſeveral maſters, not one of them attended her more than three or four leſſons. Mrs. Gordon would not permit her to be reprimanded, and no one could long endure her unreſtrained inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. She was therefore unacquainted with the moſt common branches of learning, and when Jenny, who was nearly the ſame age, could read very well, Emmeline ſcarcely knew her letters. Jenny was one day as uſual ſent for to the hall, and when ſhe arrived ſhe found the young lady in the parlour with her Papa and Mama, who were endeavouring to divert her by a great variety of very pretty prints, which they had ſent for from London. She looked at them a little time, and then being tired, toſſed them away. Jenny took one to look at, when Emmeline ſnatching it from her, aſked her how ſhe dared touch it?
<q>I beg your pardon, Miſs Emmeline,</q>
ſaid ſhe
<q>but I was only going to look at it.</q>

               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>They went into the garden, accompanied by a ſervant, for Emmeline was never ſuffered to move without one. As they were running about, Emmeline happened to fall, and ſcratch her arm againſt a gooſeberry buſh. She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately began to cry and ſhriek ſo loud, that in a few minutes her Papa, Mama, and half the ſervants came running to ſee what was the matter. Mrs. Gordon chided the ſervant very much for the accident, though ſhe well knew it was in no ſervant's power to prevent her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's doing what ſhe liked. Mr. Gordon took her in his arms, and carried her into the houſe; but it was ſome hours before ſhe could be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Such was the child, whom unbounded indulgence had totally ſpoiled, for Emmeline had not naturally bad diſpoſitions. With in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing years, her faults increaſed alſo, and her parents then began to ſee, and lament the folly of their conduct. Every pleaſure, every comfort of their lives were totally deſtroyed. They could not enjoy their own home from the wretched temper of their daughter, nor were they happier when abroad, as their fears for her ſafety were ever awake. They knew no one
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030803_0086_0FE966D6A3C5F198"/>
could controul her, and that however dangerous what ſhe had a fancy for, that, ſhe would do. They were invited to ſpend a month at a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's ſeat at ſome miles diſtance. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reluctance did they accept the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but at length it was determined Jenny ſhould ſtay with Emmeline during their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Poor Jenny dreaded the perſecution ſhe knew ſhe muſt endure, and when ſhe put on her bonnet to go to the hall, ſhe could not help crying. The firſt day of her viſit was ſpent much as uſual; but the ſecond, Emmeline was if poſſible, more ill-tempered than ever; and Jenny, tired beyond all endurance, thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed her:
<q>Miſs Emmeline, I am come here, not becauſe I wiſh it, but becauſe your Mama, has deſired it; do not therefore think that I will be treated in this manner. I know that I am poor, and you are rich; but yet, Miſs Emmeline I would not change ſituations with you. Of what uſe to you is your rank, but to enable you to torment others, and to make every one as unhappy as yourſelf? I do not believe the pooreſt beggar ſuffers more than you do. You have riches, but you do not know how to enjoy them, and though you call yourſelf great, nobody loves you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was language Emmeline had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard; ſhe would have uttered the effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her paſſion, but ſhame kept her ſilent. She felt a ſenſation ſhe had never experienced; and inferiority wholly new. How much did this little peaſant appear ſuperior to herſelf? how was all her boaſted conſequence dwindled to nothing?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:030803_0087_0FE966DED95D8F90"/>Such is the power of Virtue, that even the wicked are awed by it. From that time Emme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line felt a veneration for Jenny ſhe knew not how to account for. She ſaw how happy ſhe always appeared, how much ſhe was beloved, and in ſhort, how different ſhe was in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to herſelf. Theſe reflexions firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her of her folly, in imagining ſhe could ever be happy if ſhe was not good. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to imitate the conduct ſhe could not but admire, and, if poſſible, to become amiable. But ſhe found this a very hard taſk; ſhe had not only virtues to acquire, but faults to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer which
<q>had grown with her growth, and ſtrengthened with her ſtrength.</q>
But yet, though it was difficult, it was not impoſſible; ſhe told her reſolution to Jenny, who could ſcarcely contain the raptures ſhe felt at hearing this declaration; and ſhe thought Emmeline had never appeared ſo lovely as in that moment. Her countenance was no longer clouded by frowns and tears; ſhe began to feel what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs virtue can beſtow, and that it is ſhe alone who makes us truly great.</p>
            <p>Very often did ſhe relapſe into her former habits, but reflexion, by pointing out their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and experience, by ſhowing their miſery, fortified her mind to reſiſt their attacks; Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny too was near, and aſſiſted her to conquer them. Hitherto the profuſion of money, which the too great indulgence of her parents had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, had been ſpent in cakes, ſugar-plums, and toys; but now, a new ſource of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was opened to her; ſhe taſted the charms of benevolence, and her boſom was warmed by
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030803_0088_0FE8AD21E43B9AB0"/>
the emanations of charity. The poor of the village ſaw in her a riſing benefactreſs, and the widow and the orphan prayed for her happineſs. The ſervants too, whom ſhe now treated in a very different manner, reſpected her as much as they had before deſpiſed her; and every one was eager to wait upon, and oblige her. As for Jenny, by whoſe example and advice the little tyrant had been reclaimed (for it was ſhe who had taught her to pray Heaven to aſſiſt her good intentions) it is impoſſible to ſay with what warmth of affection ſhe loved her. Her ſtay at the hall was no longer diſagreeable to her, no longer occaſioned dread and uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon had been perſuaded by their friends to extend their viſit a month longer. So uncomfortable was their own home, that they agreed to it with much leſs reluctance than they would otherwiſe have done. Two months, therefore, they had been abſent, when they began to prepare for their return. The pleaſure they would have felt in ſeeing Emme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line after this long abſence, was much damped by the conſciouſneſs how ill ſhe deſerved their affection: yet themſelves only had they to blame; for her heart was good, and naturally inclined to virtue; but ſo deſtructive are the conſequences of unreſtrained indulgence, that human nature is vitiated by it.</p>
            <p>The firſt glance Emmeline caught of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage among the trees, her heart began to beat with unuſual ſenſations. She felt the painful emotions of conſcious ſhame; ſhe knew how ill ſhe had requited the tenderneſs of her parents, and after a ſtruggle with ſome few remaining
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030803_0089_0FE966E861C779E8"/>
ſparks of pride, ſhe determined to confeſs her faults, and entreat her parents' forgiveneſs. As ſoon as they entered the houſe, ſhe expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a manner very different from her former habits, the joy ſhe felt at ſeeing them. They claſped her to their boſoms, and looked at each other in ſilent aſtoniſhment. They now began to diſplay the profuſion of toys, which they had brought her home, and aſked her how ſhe liked them? She made no anſwer, but burſting into an agony of tears, threw herſelf on her knees before them, and declared her conduct had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made her unworthy their goodneſs, but ſhe would in future endeavour to deſerve it more.</p>
            <p>Inexpreſſible were the raptures of Mr. and Mrs. Gordon, they could not find words to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their feelings, but each endeavoured to exceed the other in the moſt affectionate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes. She now conſtituted their happineſs as truly as ſhe had before been the cauſe of their forrow. Her bad habits had been too long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to yield to any thing but time and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; yet her relapſes were ſhort, and the contrition ſhe felt, was her beſt ſecurity againſt their return. When her parents were informed it was to Jenny they were in a great meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for their daughter's reformation, they determined their gratitude ſhould equal her virtue.</p>
            <p>Emmeline had very ſoon a worthy woman provided as a governeſs for her, to whom ſhe was docile, obedient, and attentive; and made ſo rapid a progreſs in her ſtudies, that ſhe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed all who had known her former ignorance.
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030803_0090_0FE966E9E9BDA758"/>
Jenny was kept at the hall, and ſhared in the pleaſure and inſtructions of her friend, to whom ſhe every day became dearer.</p>
            <p>From this ſtory, my little readers may learn the benign influence of Virtue. Vain are rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, vain the boaſt of power without it! They can never raiſe any one ſo high as Virtue.</p>
            <p>Let them conſider Emmeline and Jenny. How much was the latter, though cloathed in the ſimpleſt manner, ſuperior to her haughty friend, even when decked in the moſt coſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire! Let none then deſpiſe Poverty, it is often found the reſidence of Virtue. Let them pay to merit what is always its due, though found in the humbleſt walks of life. And let every one remember there is no real ſuperiority but that of Goodneſs; and that it is equally the part of Wiſdom and Virtue, to efface the wild ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, the diſtinctions paid alone to rank and riches, which pride and folly have introduced into the world.</p>

            <p>LUCRETIA was one fine morning walking in the fields with her Mama, when ſhe took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſeveral ſmall maſſes of earth which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been purpoſely thrown up;
<q>Pray, Mama,</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q>why do the people make theſe lumps? I think they are very ugly.</q>

true. The ants dig ſome depth into the earth, and by throwing out the mould, as you here ſee, they leave a hollow ſpace within.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>It certainly would do ſo, if theſe ingenious little creatures did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a method to prevent it. They collect ſuch pieces of ſtick as they judge neceſſary, which ſeveral of them carry to the ſpot where they intend to build their city; they then lay them acroſs the top of their ſtreets, forming by this means a roof. They alſo conſolidate the earth with a kind of glue, and then cover the pieces of wood with moſs, graſs, or dry ruſhes.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Yes, indeed it is, and even a great deal more; for they form theſe roofs in a ſhelving poſture, by which means the current of water is turned from them. They divide their city into different depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; lay up proviſions of all kinds in their magazines, and conduct all their buſineſs with the greateſt care and regularity. They are likewiſe the tendereſt parents to their young, nurſe them with the greateſt affection, and amply ſupply all their wants.</q>

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030803_0093_0FE966FBA56A1060"/>
ſome time to obſerve them, and I do aſſure you I ſaw one of them carry a part of a dead fly in its mouth.</q>

                  <q>I have often heard you ſay Mama, how much pleaſure the ſtudy of natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory afforded you. Will you teach me it? I am ſure I ſhould like it very much.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Moſt readily: for there is no ſcience which more ſtrongly diſplays the wiſdom and power of the creator. It is a ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which ought to teach us humility, as it ſhows us the wonderful powers which ſome of the animal tribes poſſeſs; and as many of theſe are employed for our advantage, they ought to ſecure to their poſſeſſors the kindeſt treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>The next morning Lucretia begged ſome grains of corn of one of the ſervants, with which ſhe immediately haſtened to the ſpot where ſhe had before ſeen the ants. She laid her treaſure on the ground, and in about a quarter of an hour ſeveral of theſe induſtrious inſects came to it. Their numbers ſoon increaſed; ſhe called her Mama to obſerve them, who told her, ſhe had no doubt but this was nearly the whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, as it is well known the ants kept ſpies, whoſe buſineſs it was to diſcover any thing worth amaſſing, which was no ſooner done than they gave information of it, and the whole party immediately ſallied out.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Mountain and her daughter ſtood ſome time to obſerve the little labourers, and ſaw
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030803_0094_0FE966FD2BCE7270"/>
them take all the corn to depoſit it in their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries. The pleaſure of Lucretia was very great in beholding their induſtry, and ſhe frequently placed corn or fruit that ſhe might obſerve them carrying it away. Nor was her curioſity gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, nor did her reſearches end here. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hiſtory by degrees was familiar to her; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, that repoſitory of wonder and pleaſure, ſoon became the favorite ſtudy of her hours of recreation. Her mind being thus enriched with uſeful knowledge, no vacuum was left for thoſe trifling amuſements, which are equally a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the head and heart.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who obſerve the beauties of Nature, who accuſtom themſelves not merely to look at, but to ſee all around them, can never be at a loſs for employment. Every bird that ſkims the air, every beaſt that ranges the field, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with ſufficient amuſement, and lead them to the contemplation of that Being whoſe wiſdom and goodneſs are equally conſpicuous in all that He has made.</p>
