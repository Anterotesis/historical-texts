            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST VOLUME.</p>
            <p>ON this collection of my theatrical productions, I have little to ſay. As they had the good fortune of meeting with the public's approbation, they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly diſpleaſe the reviewers. I am ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the aſperity of thoſe cenſors againſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic approbation; to their illiberal hints against the morality of my pieces; to their evident endeavours to attack the weaker parts, and ſtill more to diſcolour the good, that I ſhall not loſe a ſingle word on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>I know better than any reviewer that I do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce maſter pieces, and that, as a dramatic writer, I deſerve but a ſubordinate rank. My productions are chiefly calculated for ſtage effect; they obtain that end, and in this point of view they ought to be judged. The public, which, for years back, has done me juſtice, will, I truſt, furniſh me in future with oil againſt the bitings of theſe muſquetoes.</p>
            <p>Some have objected to the <hi>Count of Burgundy,</hi> as appearing in the third act ſuddenly too accompliſhed. But has not that rather been the fault of the actor, who was unable to penetrate deep enough into the author's meaning?—If the young Count brings it forth as declamation what he has to ſay in the third act, to the people, to his mother, &amp;c. &amp;c.; if he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his ſentiments into ſentences by oſtentation in his
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037746_0003_100ED4826FC93B08"/>
expreſſion; if he does not ſpeak it careleſsly, juſt ſo as his feeling lays it upon his tongue; if he permits himſelf but one moment, in accent and manners, to play the hero; then indeed the audience muſt find a ſtriking difference between him and the child of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the two firſt acts. I am ſorry to learn, that moſt of the young actors perform the Count's part in that manner, but that is not my fault. It was my duty not to inſert any thing in the third act that might be contradictory to the words of the firſt and ſecond, and this duty, I truſt, I have fulfilled. If they are ſpoken, as I thought them to myſelf; the audience will recognize the hermit's ſon in the reigning Count.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Falſe Shame</hi> is a ſubject, which, I believe, has for the firſt time been brought upon the ſtage; and this fault being the ſource of ſo many evils in this world, I hope to have acquired ſome merit by inſpiring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a good heart with <hi>confidence</hi> to <hi>confidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The idea of <hi>La Peyrouſe,</hi> ſuddenly roſe within me, when, ſome time ago, I read in the public prints that the wiſe of this unfortunate man, had embarked, in ſearch of him on uninhabited coaſts. My imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followed her to ſea, created intereſting ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and loſt itſelf in the empire of poſſibilities. But that in the plan of this piece—in <hi>ſ</hi>pite of the moſt careful evaſion of every thing improper—an error againſt morality ſhould have been found, is a delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to which I was not prepared.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Wild Youth</hi>—it is but a Chriſtmas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, and is not to repreſent any thing elſe.</p>

            <head>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>To lay before the public a faithful tranſlation of all the dramatic productions of the celebrated Kotze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bue, who is juſtly ſtyled the GERMAN SHAKESPEAR, is the deſign of the preſent undertaking.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of tranſlating from the German into the Engliſh language is very conſiderable, as has been ſufficiently verified by the many unſucceſsful attempts which have been made for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But if there is, in general, a difficulty in tranſlating from ſo copious a language as the German, it muſt obviouſly be conſiderably encreaſed when we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt dramatic writings, in which in order to do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the original it is eſſentially neceſſary, that we ſhould be well acquainted with the very genius and ſpirit of that language.</p>
            <p>To repreſent the meaning of KOTZEBUE preciſely as he intended it, ſhall be the main aim throughout this publication; and if in accompliſhing ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an object the language ſhould in ſome inſtances be found rather deficient in point of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, I doubt not of obtaining a ready excuſe from a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did public.</p>
            <p>To the intelligent reader, whether he be in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of ſeeing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is of no moment what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

As often as the guard on the Castle's steeple sounds the horn, I run for a sword and lay hold of an ax. Each great action makes the blood flow to my heart and brings water in my eyes.

                  <p>You are not in earnest.

Above all, I love Miss Elsbeth, who was shooting at my side like a young <hi>cedar,</hi> and whose cheeks glow like the castle windows when the evening sun gilds them. Also do I <hi>love</hi> old <hi>Cuno,</hi> because Elsbeth calls him father. Not to forget mother Gertraud! often have I plagued her in return for her nice cakes. Yes, I love all, all.—The road into the world is the road to honor; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mountains the small path to tranquility. Suffer only one twig of laurels to bloom round my head. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I am with you and lay myself to Elsbeths feet.</p>

                  <p>Water your plants, and if you grow too warm, cool yourself in the wood stream, till the time-piece, calls you to higher actions—who knows how soon?—a short while yet—perhaps fortune favors you before the leaves fall off these trees. My basket is finished. You forgot by your prattling your days work. There in the garden is work enough. Split your wood and then come to assist me.</p>

                  <p>No evil? the unfortunate child! She can scarcely repeat a psalm or scribble her name, and yet will know to distinguish good from evil.

I see myself again in the circle of my family, see brothers and sisters about me, hold my dear wife in my arms.</p>

                     <p>I am not born for a pilgrim, and he found that out. I love better to speak of battles than to read a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend. He is better acquainted with the history of his country than that of the holy <hi>Antonius</hi> in the wilderness.</p>

                     <p>Listening? Good Bruno, you come from a princely court. Here in this wilderness we listen to nightingales only. Henry is far enough. I have sent him to the lake to catch a mess of fish—I was fearful lest his questions would disturb the sensation which, at this work, I wish to nourish—Enough! Do you see the trunk? Let us go and lift it up, it is not heavy. <stage>(They descend into the hole and lift up the box)</stage> hah! how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and frugality add to the strength, which is absorbed by age. Indeed, Bruno, eighteen years ago I lifted this trunk with less ease than to day.—There it is—I see it again, and think of the last look I gave it on covering it with earth—my wife was then at my side—at this tree she was leaning—the tree is green yet—Oh!— <stage>(<hi>he endeavors to collect himself</hi>)</stage> here is the key—cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with rust—we shall open the lock easier with the hatchet. <stage>(<hi>After some efforts the lid opens. Peter drops his utensils, turns himself, puts both his hands before his face, weeps aloud.)</hi>

                     <p>Twenty years have elapsed since, and you recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it still with grateful tears. But I, to whom she was every thing: I, whose hut she converted into a palace—Oh, what a precious jewel is a good housewife. Enough, Bruno, our country calls—be silent, my heart!—See here the swathing clothes in which Henry lay, when he in Agnez's arms escaped the bloody scene.—This here is the ring with the seal of the old Count—This the cup with the arms of Burgundy, which many a foreign prince took from my hands to take a welcome draught—Here underneath my armour, with helmet and sword—Let us see whether I can handle it yet— <stage>(he draws the sword, swing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over his head)</stage>—For God and my country! There is strength yet.</p>

                     <p>What is the boy about, he is not of noble birth. Not long since I wished to take him as a page, for I liked his bold and fine appearance. I thought his father to be a disguised knight, driven by ill fate into this wilderness. A christian action it would have been, to give the boy, for God's sake, a noble education. But when I sounded the father about his birth and rank, I soon discovered him to be of low descent, with not a single helmet in his coat of arms.</p>

                     <p>No harm? no harm? pious brother! you have grown so old and know not yet what a kiss means? If you have been chaste and modest all the days of your life, the better for you! but do'nt take it amiss, methinks the boy is not following your steps.</p>

                     <p>Why not? There are more good fathers in the world. For instance my father—if he would take you for my brother—how funny it would be.</p>

                     <p>On his bed he died, it's true, but quiet? <stage>(<hi>he shakes his head.</hi>)</stage> He could not even dose quietly. A prince who goes to bed without a good action, goes without consolation to his grave. At the first knock of my hammer in the morning, suddenly there came a guard from the palace: Mr. Benedict, the Count orders you to leave off hammering! it disturbs his morning slumber. H'm! I murmured to myself: can he also defend the hammering of his conscience?—</p>

                     <p>This almost happened once—"Your hut," he said, disfigures the place before the palace;"—My lord, I answered: <hi>Integrity and industry are the occupants of this hut; would to God! we could say that of many a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace"—" I will buy your hut,"</hi>
continued he—"<hi>I will not sell it. My great, great, grandfather has built it, my father repaired it, I was born and educated in it.

                     <p>In short, my house would have been gone, if Block the cabinet-maker had not been on friendly terms with the court jester—he brought things in order.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Benedict.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed he was! always friendly and good. Here he often would stop to look at my work, and when the sun was burning, he would never suffer me to take off my hat. Many a time he drank out of my silver cup.—I still see him passing by here, his little sons hopping round him. Oh! the dear little ones! they would take off their caps before every mechanic—nod to every fruit woman—and if they met a beggar, how quick they would put their little hands in their pockets, and filled, with silver pieces, hold them to the poor.—Oh! It goes to my very heart, when I think, how unmercifully they all were sent to the grave!</p>

                     <p>No, not one. I myself heard in that woful night the groans of the dying—the lamentations of the Count's attendants—the piercing cries of the mother proceeding from the palace windows.</p>

                     <p>It would be better for her, if she was dead. To spare her was worse than murder. The good Lady buried herself in a Convent. She may have forgot hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and children, but the splendor of high life, and the

                     <p>I was some days journey in the country about business. On my return, in a village a league from here night overtook me, and after having sent on my cattle, I laid down with other strangers upon the straw. It was dark. But when day light appeared, I awoke, and cast a glance upon the sleeping Strangers. An old man in Pilgrim's habit lay at my side. His cloth had been disordered. I saw an armour under his habit, which excited my curiosity. I looked at him attentively, and perceived on his finger a ring with a seal, exactly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the ring of our murdered Count, which I often heard described, when it was missing.</p>

                     <p>I was on the point of drawing my knife to send the villain to hell, when he opened his eyes. Beside him lay a fine youth, and another man in Pilgrim's habit. He roused them and they took their way towards the city. I kept them company, not to loose sight of them. On the way the old man asked me many questions; whether the people still loved the memory of their good old Count Albrecht? whether they hated his murderers? and some such things. He also spoke of you, Governor, and seemed to rejoice when he learnt that you were still living and in good health. At our arrival at the gates, I called the guards. We found in their travelling bag among other suspicious things, Swathing clothes, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Burgundian arms, and the letter <hi>H,</hi> under a Lordly Crown. They certainly have once belonged to the poor little Count Henry, whose innocent blood the villain has spilt.</p>

In that dreadful night, when the clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the swords of hired murderers, and the groans of the dying surrounded me; when my good master al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lay bleeding at my feet, and his elder sons were drawing their last breath; I called my wife, to whose care the youngest child was entrusted: Agnez, I cried, save your precious nursling! the Count's ring I took from the finger of the corpse, the silver cup I snatched from the table. By a secret door we escaped and reached the open air. In the darkness of the night, through swamps and bushes, through thorns and thistles, we walked on unused roads. The sun rose but to perplex us, for he gave light to our pursuers. During day we hid ourselves in cornfields, and silenced our hunger with unripe corn, God guarded your prince! we reached the frontiers of Burgundy. Thence I sent my old companion, my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful servant Bruno, back. He was to wait in silence, till he could bring me news of better times. At the foot of the Alps, in a poor hermit's hut, I took care of the dear pledge, confided to me by God. The boy has ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to youthful beauty. Citizens of Arles! to day I brought him back to you! take him, and your future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness from my hands!</p>

                     <p>A prince, who is husband and father—was not this your own remark of yesterday?—has a tender feeling for the welfare of his subjects; he will not tear from a wife her husband, nor deprive a mother of her son, to carry him into war, which is perhaps excited by whim or ambition.

Behold this beautiful nosegay, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated like a wood-pecker, odorifarous like Indian spice. Whom do you think I got it of.</p>

                     <p>I don't know what to think of you. I am afraid the old witch down in the village has played her tricks with you. That wicked hag does great mischief among men and cattle. The magistrates should be more vigilant. Is it not a pity, how the poor child pines away. Her clothes become too wide. She used to hop along upon one leg, but now she can scarcely crawl upon two. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly she laughed at every thing; now she weeps for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But patience, she will laugh enough, when she sees this fine knight. He is grown thick and sat; a dark complexion, black wiskers, a fine dress, and feathers in his hat. All is alive below in the castle yard; there are pages and chamber maids, horses and mules, chests and trunks without number. Ah! what fine things and bridal ornaments must they contain. My mouth water at the

If an arm is too weak to throw it around a neck, they care but little whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it has been lamed by the cut of a Saracene—Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! Walter! be on your guard! you have escaped the fetters of the infidels; if you fall into the snares of love, the absolution will avail you nothing, which you have so dearly purchased.</p>
