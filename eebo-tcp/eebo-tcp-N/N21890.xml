            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Editor flatters himſelf that this abſtract of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> will not be unworthy the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and patronage of his fellow-citizens. The importance of having our children taught ſo uſeful a branch of knowledge, is too obvious to need his feeble recommendation: for 'twill be univerſally acknowledged, that the mind takes a turn in future life, ſuitable to the tincture it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in youth; I will naturally conclude, that there is not a neceſſity to regard, or at leaſt to lay any ſtreſs

upon what was never inculcated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a matter of importance then: and ſo will grow up in a total ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect or diſeſteem of thoſe ſtudies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to form the wiſe and truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding man.</p>
            <p>Conceiving it therefore a matter of great importance to each individual as an inhabitant of any country, that he or ſhe hath a knowledge of the hiſtory thereof; and being well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the following is well adapted to the youthful mind, hath excited the preſent attempt.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF AMERICA.</head>
            <p>AMERICA, the weſtern conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, is ſituated between 35 and 145 degrees of weſtern longitude, and between 80 north, and 58 ſouth lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: bounded by the lands and ſeas about the Artic pole on the north; by the Atlantic ocean on the eaſt; by the vaſt Southern ocean on the ſouth; and by the Pacific ocean which divides it
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028831_0004_0FDE28B6B5262F98"/>
from Aſia, on the weſt. Its comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed length, from north to ſouth, is nine thouſand miles, and three thouſand miles in breadth.</p>
            <p>It is not an improbable conjecture to ſuppoſe this country was firſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by the Carthtganians, who were ſituate on the north-weſt coaſt of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and poſſeſſed ſeveral iſlands in the Atlantic ocean, where they frequently ſent thouſands of men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. It is certainly natural to expect that ſome of their ſhips, which were very large, might miſs thoſe iſlands, and be driven to the weſt, beyond their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed port; and if this ever happened, they muſt have been carried to America, which is but three weeks ſail from the Canary or Cape de Verd iſlands, from whence it was impoſſible they ſhould return to the Eaſtern continent, as the trade winds always ſet againſt them, and the uſe of the compaſs was not known in thoſe early ages. Thus this exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028831_0005_0FDE28BBD3EF0700"/>
country, and its valuable produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions remained unknown to the more enlightened parts of the world, until Chriſtopher Columbus, a native of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, ſuggeſted the idea that there was another continent beyond the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ocean. But however ſanguine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus might be in his expectations, it appears that his propoſals for carrying his bold ſchemes into execution was treated with cool indifference by the different courts he applied to: and it was not until the expiration of ſeveral years cloſe application, that he was to proceed on his voyage. At length the court of Spain began to liſten more favourably to the propoſed undertaking, and Columbus was commiſſioned to equip three ſhips with the title of admiral of the weſtern ſeas: with theſe ſhips he ſet ſail from Palos in Andaluſia the 3d of Auguſt A. D. 1492, and arrived at the Canary iſlands on the 12th; from thence he ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, September 1ſt, to the weſtward, but
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028831_0005_0FDE28BBD3EF0700"/>
his men began to mutiny, before they had been out fourteen days, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was leading them to certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; he notwithſtanding perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to continue the voyage until the 16th, at which time they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting to throw their admiral overboard and return to their own country, but he had the good fortune at ten o'clock the ſame night to ſee a light on ſhore, and the next day made land which proved to be one of the Bahama iſlands: from thence he ſailed to Cuba and Hiſpaniola, and from thence back to Europe, having performed his voyage to the new world and back again in ſeven months and eleven days, and was received by the court of Spain with all the honours due to a man that had found out another continent; yet how unſtable is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of princes: this deſerving man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bringing ſuch a large acquiſition to the crown of Spain as aſtoniſhed Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, was ſuperceded in his government
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028831_0006_0FDE28C124102998"/>
in the new world, and ſent home in chains, after he had made his third voyage in quality of viceroy, of the country he had diſcovered, and died poor. They however were ſo grateful to his memory that the court of Spain ordered his remains a magnificent burial in the cathedral of Seville, and over his tomb was this inſcription:</p>

AMERICUS VESPUTIUS, a Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, was ſent by the court of Spain to make further diſcoveries, A. D. 1497; and having made the Canaries, ſailed from thence ſouth-weſt 1000 leagues, and arrived at the Carribe iſlands in 16 degrees north latitude, and continuing his courſe 900 leagues further, weſt, arrived at a country under the tropic of cancer, ſuppoſed to be ſome part of Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico. In the next year, 1498, he made another voyage, and ſailing from Spain ſouth-weſt, paſſed the equator and came to Brazil, 5 degrees ſouth latitude. In the year 1501, we find him engaged in the ſervice of Emanuel, king of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, who fitted out three ſhips for an expedition to the new world, and after touching at Brazil, and ſailing 52 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſouth latitude along the coaſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. From him the vaſt and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive continent of America took its name. Thus Columbus was robbed of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to his extenſive genius and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028831_0007_0FDE28C4AC5931F8"/>
juſtly acquired fame. After him there were ſeveral other adventuriſts employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the different courts of Europe; as Sebaſtian Cabbot, of Italian extraction, who was employed by Henry the ſeventh of England, to find out a north-weſt paſſage to China, he departed from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, 1498, and ſailed along the north-eaſt coaſt of America to 67 degrees north latitude, but failed in his attempt. The Engliſh, nevertheleſs, were benefitted by the voyage as they claimed a large tract of country in conſequence of the diſcoveries made by Cabbot, and was called Britiſh America, which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into colonies: of theſe we ſhall treat ſeparately, under the title of the United Independent States of North America.</p>

NEW-ENGLAND.</head>
               <p>NEW-ENGLAND is bounded by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada on the north, by the Atlantic ocean and Nova-Scotia on the eaſt and ſouth, and by New York on the weſt. It is divided into four governments or ſtates, viz. New Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut.</p>
               <p>The land next the ſea in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is generally low, but farther up the country it riſes into hills, and on the north-eaſt it is rocky and mountaneous. The north-weſt wind blowing over a long tract of frozen country makes the winters exceſſive cold; the climate in general healthful and agreeable to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean conſtitutions. Fruit comes to great perfection, particularly peaches, it is not very uncommon to find ſeven or eight hundred peaches on one tree, and ſeven barrels of cyder has been made from one apple tree.</p>
               <p>Engliſh wheat, it is ſaid, does not

thrive here; but Indian corn will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produce from one grain two thouſand. Ship building is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble employment in this country. The ſpermaceti whale, and other whales are found on the coaſt, of which the New-England people take great numbers. This country was firſt ſettled from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. In the year 1619, ſome zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſſenters of the independent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, uneaſy at being required to conform to the church of England, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes what was called the Plymouth patent, and obtained another from king James; a number of adventurers, to the amount of 150, embarked in a ſhip, at Plymouth, which ſailed the 6th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, A. D. 1620, and arrived at Cape Cod in New-England, the ninth of November following, where they built a town and called it New Plymouth; and Mr. John Carver was elected their firſt governor. The Indians at this time were ſo engaged in wars amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028831_0009_0FDE28CEEE18B860"/>
that theſe ſtrangers were ſuffered to remain pretty quiet, and they having learned from one Quanto, an Indian, who had been to England, what a powerful people the Engliſh were. This induced many of the ſachems the following ſpring to ſeek an alliance with them, profeſſing themſelves ſubjects to the crown of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. More ſhips arriving with plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and proviſions, a colony ſoon became eſtabliſhed, but differences ariſing on account of religion had like to have been of fatal conſequence.

Several of the adventurers removed to other parts of the country and others returned home; thus the colony became ſo weakened that had it not been for the civil war that kept the Indians employed, they would in all probability have been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the country.</p>

Dr. Benjamin Franklin, a native of New England, univerſally admired for his philoſophical and political talents had a large ſhare of the public confidence in the beginning of the diſpute, and on him in a great meaſure depended the ſucceſs of an oppoſition which in the beginning promiſed little to the oppoſers, and till

This infant colony was made unhappy by diſagreements on the ſcore of religion, which was carried to ſo great a length that thoſe in power actually put ſeveral to death for not conforming to their way of worſhip, until king Charles the ſecond put a ſtop to the ſanguinary meaſures of the court of Boſton, in the year 1650, and during the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of John Endicot, <abbr>eſq</abbr> a furious independent.</p>

About the year 1627, another ſet of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers purchaſed a grant of the Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth company, and fitted out ſix ſhips with 300 planters; they alſo procured a grant of king Charles, and nominated Mr. Craddock their firſt governor: this company arriving on the coaſt with live cattle and other ſtores proper for a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, built the town of Salem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the promontaries of Marblehead and cape Anne.

STATE OF NEW-YORK.</head>
               <p>HENRY HUDSON, an Engliſhman, in the year 1608, under a commiſſion from the king, diſcovered Long Iſland, New-York, and the river which ſtill bears his name, and afterwards ſold his right to the Dutch. The Dutch writers contend that he was ſent out by their Eaſt India company in 1609 to diſcover a north-weſt paſſage to China, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt diſcovered Delaware bay, he came hither, and ſailed up Hudſon river as far north as the latitude 43 degrees. It however appears that the Engliſh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the ſale, though they for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time neglected to oppoſe the Dutch ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the country. In 1610, Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſailed again from the coaſt of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to this country, called by the Dutch, New Netherlands; and four years afterwards the ſtates general granted a patent to ſundry merchants for an excluſive trade on the north river,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028831_0017_0FDE28F7C617C0E0"/>
who in 1614, built a fort on the weſt ſide. Captain Argal, returning from an expedition againſt the French, on the bay of Funday; commiſſioned by ſir Thomas Dale, governor of Virginia, paid a viſit to the Dutch on Hudſon ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who, unable to reſiſt him, prudently ſubmitted for the preſent to the king of England, and under him to the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Virginia; but the next year they built a fort on the ſouth-weſt ſide of the iſland then called Manhattans, now York Iſland. In 1621, the ſtates ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral determined upon the ſettlement of the country, made a grant of it to their Weſt India company. Wouter Van Twiller arrived at fort Amſterdam, now New-York, and took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the government, in June, 1621, his ſtyle in the patents granted by him was thus, "We director and council reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in New Netherlands, under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their high mightineſſes, the lords ſtates general of the Uunited Ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therlands,

The Dutch, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unſucceſsful ſtruggles to keep poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the country, at laſt, gave up their claims at the peace concluded in 1674.

The city of New-York is built on an iſland, called by the Indians Manhattans: the iſland is very narrow, not a mile wide at a medium, and about fourteen miles in length; the South-weſt point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects into a fine ſpacious bay and opens the ocean to full view. The paſſage up to New-York from Sandy-Hook is ſafe, and not above twenty-five miles in length. The city has in reality no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural baſon or harbour. The ſhips lie off in the road, on the eaſt end of the town; the ſtreets are irregular and pav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

It remains to be a place of conſiderable trade, and was long the rival of Philadelphia, the capital of Pennſylvania; but the laſt has the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency of all the ſea port towns on the continent, both as to commerce and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulence. There is perhaps the beſt fiſh market at New-York, but the ſtreets and buildings when contraſted with Philadelphia ſuffers much in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.

STATE OF NEW-JERSEY.</head>
               <p>NEW-JERSY, eaſt and weſt, were formerly proprietary governments, but the proprietors as the country became more populous grew weary of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſputes often ariſing between their governors and the people, agreed to ſurrender their power, unto queen Anne, A. D. 1702. Lord Cornbury, ſon to the great earl of Clarendon, was immediately appointed governor, whoſe behaviour was ſo arbitrary, mean and trifling, as drew upon him the hatred of the people: It was not uncommon for him to dreſs himſelf in a woman's habit and then patrole the fort in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided. Such freaks of low humour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to the univerſal contempt of the people, and their indignation was kindled by his diſpotic rules, ſavage bigotry, inſatiable avarice, and injuſtice, not only to the public but even his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate creditors; for he left ſome of his
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028831_0021_0FDE290D96D5A078"/>
loweſt tradeſmen unſatisfied in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, when he ſucceeded his father to the earldom of Clarendom. When the conduct of ſuch a man is contraſted with the mild adminiſtration of the preſent governor, who unites the great qualities of the ſtateſman with the more amiable and endearing virtues of humanity, how it degrades the former, and enhances the virtues of the latter, and dignifies that pre-eminence he hath obtained by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the united approbation of his fellow citizens. It appears, from good authority, that the firſt Engliſh ſettlers of New-Jerſey arrived at Salem, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by John Fenwick, who brought with him two daughters and ſeveral ſervants; there were alſo paſſangers in the ſame ſhip, and ſeveral other families.</p>
               <p>No other ſhips arrived for two years afterwards: the before-mentioned ſhip arrived, A. D. 1677. In 1765, another ſhip arrived with two hundred and thirty paſſangers on board; theſe landed near

Rancocas, and finally ſettled at Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Indian corn and veniſon, ſupplied by the Indians, was their chief food. The ſame year another ſhip arrived with a large number of paſſengers, who ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at Burlington, aforeſaid. It would be in vain, to pretend, to gve a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſcription of all the different tribes of Indians that inhabited this country, before the Europeans came amongſt them; their nations were commonly diſtinguiſhed by the names of Creeks, or noted places, where they reſided; as the Aſſunpink, the Rankokas, the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, the Andaſtaka, the Neſhamine, and the Shackamaxon Indians, &amp;c. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nations were frequently at war with each other, of which, farmers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find remaining marks in their fields.</p>

STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.</head>
               <p>THE ſtate of Pennſylvania was granted by king Charles, in 1681, to William Penn, ſon of ſir William Penn, Admiral in the Dutch wars, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a conſiderable debt due from the crown to his father; but, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the grants made him by the crown, he did not eſteem himſelf the real proprietor, until he had given the Indians a valuable conſideration for their country. He therefore came over from England and aſſembled the ſachems or kings, and purchaſed a very large extent of country from the natives; with whom, he and his ſucceſſors lived in good harmony: and to this day they mention the name of William Penn with great reſpect. King Charles cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the country, thus granted, Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania: in the ſame year he founded the city of Philadelphia, now the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the United States, and the

               <p>The mildneſs of the government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Penn, induced many of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, chiefly of the people called qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and the proſecuted of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to flock to Pennſylvania, as a ſafe aſylum from their oppreſſors; nor were they diſappointed, finding on their arival that quiet in the peaceful woods, that they in vain ſought for under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

               <p>Philadelphia is the capital of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, and is now by far the greateſt commercial city on the continent, and is riſing faſt to that oppulence and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence as will ſoon make her the envy of European powers.

STATE OF MARYLAND.</head>
               <p>MARYLAND, is bounded on the north by Pennſylvania, by the Atlantic ocean on the eaſt, by Virginia on the ſouth, and by the Apalachian mountains on the weſt. Maryland is divided into two parts by the bay of Cheſapeak, viz. the eaſtern and weſtern diviſion. This ſtate is watered by innumerable ſprings and rivers, king Charles the firſt nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtate in honour to his queen, Henrietta Maria, daughter of Henry the fourth of France, when he granted it to George Calvert, lord Baltimore, A. D. 1613. It is ſeparated from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia by the river Potowmac. It was diſcovered, in 1606; the lord Baltimore, in the year 1633, ſent over his brother, the honourable Leonard Calvert, <abbr>eſq</abbr> with ſeveral Roman catholic gentlemen, and other adventurers, to the number of two hundred, who arrived in the bay of Cheſapeak the ſame year, and planted
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028831_0028_0FDE2933E33371B0"/>
the firſt colony near the mouth of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towmac river, and advancing to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian town of Yoamico, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to reſide in one part of the town in conſideration of ſome preſents they made to the weorance, or prince of the country, who left them in poſſeſſion of the whole town, as ſoon as his people had got in their harveſt. Whereupon, the governor, Calvert, gave the town the name of St. Mary. While the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh were improving the country, the Indians hunted for them in the woods, and brought in great quantities of veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and wild fowl. Many other Roman catholics coming over from England to avoid the penal laws it ſoon became a flouriſhing colony; of which, the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts remained governors, until the civil wars in England; when the family were deprived of it, but recovered it again at the reſtoration of king Charles the ſecond, when the honourable Charles Calvert, ſon of lord Baltimore, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

This ſtate ſends eight members to congreſs.

On the firſt planting of Maryland there were ſeveral nations of Indians; but now it is rare to ſee one in the ſtate: It is, however, well ſtocked with negroes, which ſome people think a poor exchange.</p>

VIRGINIA.</head>
               <p>THE rich and populous ſtate of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia is bounded by the river Potow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac, which divides it from Maryland on the north-eaſt; by the Atlantic ocean on the eaſt; by Carolina on the ſouth; and by the Apalachian mountains on the weſt; into the weſt ſide of the bay falls four great rivers, which riſe in the Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachian mountains, running from the north-weſt to the ſouth-eaſt; the moſt ſoutherly is James river; the Indian name of this river was Powhatan. The great bay of Cheſapeak runs up through Virginia and Maryland, almoſt due north, three hundred miles and upwards. North of Rappahanic river is the great river Potowmac, which runs, and is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable, near two hundred miles. As we approach Virginia from the ocean, it appears to be low lands, and for a hundred miles up into the country, there is ſcarce a hill or ſtone to be met with.

The woods are lofty, and but little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-wood to intercept travellers in their paſſage, through the ſtate, who never want a fine ſhade to protect them from the ſummer heats. No country pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces greater quantities of excellent tobacco: ſir Walter Raleigh obtained a grant from queen Elizabeth, A.

Whereupon, ſir Walter form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſociety amongſt his friends, who contributed large ſums and provided two ſhips to go upon the expedition, who ſet ſail the 20th of April, A. D. 1514, and arrived on the coaſt of Carolina, in 34 degrees 15 minutes north latitude, where they bartered with the natives for ſkins and furs, and loaded their ſhips with ſaſafras, cedar, and tobacco; which laſt, was cried up in England as a moſt
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028831_0031_0FDE294943305478"/>
valuable plant, and a remedy for almoſt every diſeaſe. There is a diverting anecdote in ſir Walter's life, in which, we are informed, that as he was private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmoking a pipe in his cloſet, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a ſtranger to the uſe of it, coming into the cloſet with a mug of ale, and ſeeing the ſmoke iſſuing from his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's mouth, was aſtoniſhed, and empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mug in his face, and immediately alarmed the family, inſiſting in poſitive terms that his maſter was on fire. Sir Walter called the country he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Virginia, in honour to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, a maiden queen. Another ſet of adventurers arrived from England, April 26th, 1607, and came up the Cheſapeak, and thence up James river, and landed on a Peninſula, about fifty miles up the river, where they built a fort, and a town, which they named James town: this was the firſt town built upon the continent of America by the Engliſh. This ſtate ſends nineteen

               <p>THIS ſtate was included with South-Carolina and Georgia in one grant, and was a proprietary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but by the diſagreement of the parties concerned became ſubject to the crown. Edenton, ſituated near the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quotank, is an ancient town, but is not in a flouriſhing ſtate, owing to the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the navigation: Newbern is the capital. The country near the rivers is unhealthy; intermitting fevers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Autumn, and the people look ſickly. In the bays, and by the ſide of large rivers are found the alligators, or American crocodile: It has a large mouth, furniſhed with ſharp teeth; this dreadful creature grows to the length of ſeventeen or eighteen feet. As we go to the ſouth they are more fierce and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous: like the wolf, when preſſed by hunger, it will ſwallow mud or even ſtones: they float on the water, in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

ſeaſons, and look much like an old log; and ſhould any perſon venture to gratify his curioſity, the attempt might be fatal. There has been ſeveral exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of crocodiles taking a man out of a canoe, in ſight of his companions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their being able to lend them any aſſiſtance. It often lurks by the ſide of a bank near the river, and there patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waits for ſome land animal, coming to drink, be it a man, tyger, bull or dog; it ſeizes the victim with a ſpring, and having ſecured his prey with teeth and claws, he ſinks with it to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the river, and it is ſoon drowned. The tyger, as ſoon as he is ſeized by this enemy, immediately turns with great agility and forces his claws in his eyes, while he is plunged by his fierce antagoniſt into the water, where he is ſoon deſtroyed. Notwithſtanding all this it is related by good authority, that a ſingle negro will jump into the river, and make battle with this monſter, in

his own element; with a knife in his right hand, and his left arm wrapped round with a piece of cow hide: being thus prepared, as the crocodile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches he holds out his left arm, which is inſtantly and greedily ſwallowed, but as it ſticks in his throat, the knife in his right hand is buſily employed in ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him below the chin, a place eaſily vulnerable and the water alſo getting in the mouth, the creature is ſoon bloated up as big as a tun and expires.

               <p>KENTUCKY was formerly a part of the ſtate of Virginia, but admitted into the Union as an independent ſtate, by act of congreſs, on the 1ſt day of June, 1792: this ſtate is ſituated between 36-39 of north latitude; and between 8 and 15 degrees of weſt longitude, from Philadelphia, being about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles in length from north-eaſt to ſouth-eaſt; and about two hundred miles in breadth. It is bounded to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the Ohio and Miſſiſſippi rivers, on the ſouth by a parrallel of latitude, which divides it from the territory ceded to the United States by North Carolina, to the eaſtward by the Cumberland mountain, and to the northward by the Great Sandy river. The Ohio river, waſhes the north-weſtern ſide of this ſtate, in its whole extent; except about thirty miles, which is bounded by the Miſſiſſippi. The rapid ſettlement and

population of the ſtate, notwithſtanding the united oppoſition of all the weſtern Indians, almoſt exceed belief. It was in the year 1775, that the firſt family ſettled in this country, at that time a foreſt, inhabited only by wild beaſts. By the cenſus taken in 1791, according to the returns, it contained 75,000 ſouls; but from the great numbers of emigrants, who daily repair to that country, from the different ſtates, there muſt now be more than double that number. The inhabitants enjoy a happy temperature of climate: ſnow ſeldom falls deep or lies long, and the rivers are rarely frozen over: it includes the largeſt body of the moſt fertile land in the United States, ſuitable to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of every kind of grain. Horſes, cattle, ſheep, hogs, and poultry of every kind are raiſed here in great numbers, and with little trouble or expenſe, owing chiefly to the ſhortneſs of the winters, and great abundance of food. The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

THE LIFE OF GENERAL MONTGOMERY.</head>
               <p>GENERAL MONTGOMERY de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from a reſpectable fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the North of Ireland, and was born in the year 1737. His attachment to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery was innate, and matured by a fine education and an excellent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Having married, and purchaſed an eſtate in New-York, he was, from
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028831_0041_0FDE297BB721EFF8"/>
theſe circumſtances, as well as from his natural love of freedom, and from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the juſtneſs of her cauſe indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to conſider himſelf as an American. From principle, he early embarked in her cauſe, and quitted the ſweets of eaſy fortune, the enjoyment of a loved and philoſophical rural life, with the higheſt domeſtic felicity, to take an active ſhare in all the hardſhips and dangers that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſoldier's life.</p>
               <p>Before he came over to America, he had been an officer in the ſervice of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and had ſucceſsfully fought her battles with the immortal Wolfe at Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec, in the war of 1756, on the very ſpot, where when fighting under the ſtandard of freedom, he was doomed to fall in arms againſt her. No one who fell a martyr to freedom in this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conteſt, was more ſincerely, or more univerſally lamented. And what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, the moſt eminent ſpeakers in the Britiſh parliament, forgetting for
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028831_0041_0FDE297BB721EFF8"/>
the moment, that he had died in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their cruel and oppreſſive meaſures, diſplayed all their eloquence in praiſing his virtues and lamenting his fate. A great orator, and a veteran fellow ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of his in the French war of 1756, ſhed abundance of tears, while he expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated on their paſt friendſhip and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exchange of tender ſervices in that ſeaſon of enterpriſe and glory.</p>
               <p>All enmity to this veteran ſoldier ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with his life; and reſpect to his private character prevailed over all other conſiderations. By the orders of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Carlton, his remains received eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible mark of diſtinction from the victors, and was interred in Quebec, on the firſt day of January, 1776, with all the honours due to a brave ſoldier.</p>

               <p>There is a remarkable circumſtance connected with the fall of this brave offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, that merits to be recorded, becauſe the fact is of a very intereſting nature, and will ſerve to perpetuate the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a very amiable and deſerving cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, who was alſo a martyr in the cauſe of his country.

               <p>One of General Montgomery's Aids-de-Camp, was Mr. Macpherſon, a moſt promiſing young man, whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſided at Philadelphia, and was greatly diſtinguiſhed in privateering in the war of 1756. This gentleman had a brother in the ſixteenth regiment, in the Britiſh ſervice, at the time of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery's expedition into Canada, and who was as violent in favour of the Engliſh government, as this General's Aid-de-Camp was enthuſiaſtic in the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028831_0043_0FDE298B8CF04950"/>
cauſe of America; the latter had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his General a day or two previous to the attack in which they both loſt their lives, to view and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the ſpot where Wolf had fallen; on his return he found a letter from his brother, the Engliſh officer, full of the bittereſt reproaches againſt him, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entered into the American ſervice, and containing a pretty direct wiſh, that if he would not abandon it, he might meet with the deſerved fate of a rebel. The Aid-de-Camp immediately return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him an anſwer, full of ſtrong reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in defence of his conduct, but by no means attempting to make the oppoſite principles of his brother, and not only free from acrimony, but full of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of tenderneſs and affection; this letter he dated, "From the ſpot where Wolf loſt his life, in fighting the cauſe of England, <hi>in friendſhip with Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>" This letter had ſcarcely reached the officer at New-York, before it was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028831_0044_0FDE299284DCC810"/>
by the news of his brother's death.

SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF THE LATE NATHANIEL GREENE, Major General of the Forces of the United States of America.</head>
               <p>THIS gallant officer, whoſe death is ſo generally and ſo juſtly regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was born in the town of Warwick, Kent county, Rhode-Iſland, in or about the year 1741, and was the ſecond ſon of a reſpectable citizen of the ſame name (deſcended from ſome of the firſt ſettlers in the colony,) who was extenſively concerned in lucrative iron-works, the property of which, at his death, (prior to the war) he left to his children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:028831_0046_0FDE299AC3FFC9D8"/>The ſubject of this ſketch was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with an uncommon degree of judgement and penetration, which with a benevolent manner and affable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, acquired him a number of valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friends, by whoſe intereſt and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he was, at an early period of life, choſen a member of the aſſembly of the then colony of Rhode-Iſland. This truſt, in which he gave the higheſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his conſtituents; he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to poſſeſs until, and at the period, when the folly and madneſs of England ſevered a world from her empire.</p>
               <p>After the ſkirmiſhes at Lexington and Concord, when a ſpirit of reſiſtance ſpread like wild fire over the continent, Rhode-Iſland was not deficient in her contributions for the general defence: ſhe raiſed three regiments of militia, the command whereof was given to Mr. Greene, who was nominated brigadier-general. The liberty, ſafety, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of his country being expoſed to
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028831_0046_0FDE299AC3FFC9D8"/>
imminent danger, the pacific principles of Quakeriſm, in which he had been educated, proved inſufficient to combat the ardent ſpirit of liberty with which his boſom glowed.</p>
               <p>He led the troops under his command to Cambridge, and was preſent at the evacuation of Boſton, by a force which had in England been vauntingly ſtated treble the number that would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to dragoon America into uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>General Greene's merit and abilities, as well in council as in the field, were not long unnoticed by Gen. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who repoſed in him the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and paid particular deference to his advice and opinion on all occcaſions of doubt and difficulty. This excited the jealouſy of ſeveral officers of older date and higher rank, who were not wanting in endeavours to ſupplant him: but in vain—the commander in chief knew, and prized his worth as it deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:028831_0047_0FDE299F21071BD0"/>He was appointed major-general by congreſs, the 26th of Auguſt, 1776. Towards the cloſe of that year he was at the Trenton ſurprize, and at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next, was at the battle of Princetown, two enterprizes not more happily planned than judiciouſly execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in both of which he highly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf, ſerving his noviciate under the American Fabius.</p>
               <p>At the battle of Germantown, he commanded the left wing of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army, and his utmoſt endeavours were excited to retreive the fortune of that day, in which his met with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the commander in chief.</p>
               <p>In March, 1778, he was appointed quarter-maſter-general, which office he accepted under a ſtipulation that his rank in the army ſhould not be affected by it, and that he ſhould retain his right to command in time of action, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his rank and ſeniority. This he exerciſed at the battle of Monmouth,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028831_0047_0FDE299F21071BD0"/>
where he commanded the right wing of the army.</p>
               <p>About the middle of the ſame year, an attack, in conjunction with the French fleet, on the Britiſh garriſon at Newport, Rhode-Iſland, being planned, General Sullivan was appointed to the command, under whom Gen. Greene ſerved. This attempt was unſucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: the French fleet having ſailed out of harbour to engage lord Howe's fleet, they were diſperſed by a ſtorm, and the Americans were obliged to raiſe the ſiege of Newport, in doing which General Greene diſplayed a great degree of ſkill in drawing off the army in ſafety.</p>
               <p>After the hopes of the Britiſh Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, to execute ſome deciſive ſtroke to the northward, were fruſtrated, they turned their attention to the ſouthern ſtates, as leſs capable of defence, and more likely to reward the invaders with ample plunder. A grand expidition was
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028831_0048_0FDE29A613795230"/>
in conſequence, planned at New-York, where the army embarked on or about the 26th day of December, 1779, and landed on the 11th of February, 1780, within thirty miles of Charleſton, which, after a brave defence, was ſurrendered to ſir Henry Clinton, on the twelfth of May.</p>
               <p>A ſeries of ill ſucceſs followed this unfortunate event: the American arms in South Carolina were in general un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, and the inhabitants were obliged to ſubmit to the invaders, whoſe impolitic ſeverity was extremely ill calculated to anſwer any of the objects for which the war had been commenced.</p>
               <p>Affairs were thus circumſtanced, when General Waſhington appointed General Greene to the command of the American forces in the ſouthern diſtrict. He arrived at Charlotte, on the ſecond day of December, 1780, accompanied by General Morgan, a brave officer, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf to the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028831_0048_0FDE29A613795230"/>
northward, in the expidetion againſt Burgoyne. He found the forces he was to command reduced to a very ſmall number by defeat and by deſertion. The returns were nine hundred and ſeventy continentals and one thouſand and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen militia; military ſtores, proviſions, forages and all things neceſſary, were if poſſible in a more reduced ſtate than his army. His men were without pay and almoſt without cloathing, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of the latter were not to be had but from a diſtance of two hundred miles. In this perilous ſituation, he had to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a reſpectable and victorious army. Fortunately for him, the conduct of ſome of the friends of royalty obliged numbers, otherwiſe diſpoſed, to remain neuter, or take up arms in their own defence. This and the prudent meaſures the general took for removing the innumerable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and diſadvantages he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with, and for conciliating the affections of the inhabitants, ſoon brought
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028831_0049_0FDE29AC8A7D3228"/>
together a conſiderable force, far inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, however, to that of the Britiſh, who eſteemed the country perfectly ſubjugat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The happy period at length arrived, when by virtue and bravery of her ſons, aided by the bounty of heaven, America compelled her invaders to recognize her independence. Then her armies quitted the tented fields, and retired to cultivate the arts of peace and happineſs. Amongſt the reſt, General Greene reviſited his native country, where he proved himſelf as valuable a citizen, as the Carolinas had witneſſed him a gallant officer. Diſſenſions and jealouſies had extended their deſtructive influence among the Rhode-Iſlanders, and their animoſity had ariſen to ſuch a degree, as to threaten the moſt ſerious ill conſequences: Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Greene exerted himſelf to reſtore harmony and peace amongſt them once more, and was happily ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>In October, 1785, he ſailed to Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, where he had a conſiderable eſtate,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028831_0049_0FDE29AC8A7D3228"/>
not far diſtant from Savanah: here he paſſed away his time, occupied in his domeſtic concerns, until the hour of his mortality approached. Walking out one day in June laſt, we are told, he was overpowered by the extreme heat of the ſun, which brought on a diſorder, that carried him off a few days after, on the 19th of the ſame month.</p>
               <p>When the melancholy account of his death was arrived at Savannah, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſtruck with the deepeſt ſorrow.</p>
               <p>All buſineſs was ſuſpended; the ſhops and ſtores throughout the town were ſhut; and the ſhipping in the harbour had their colours half maſted.</p>
               <p>The body was brought to Savannah, and interred on the 20th: the funeral proceſſion was attended by the Cincina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, militia, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the following or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</p>

Immediately after the interment of the corpſe, the members of the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnati retired to the coffee-houſe in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah, and came to the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:</p>

A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF ISRAEL PUTNAM, SENIOR MAJOR GENERAL IN THE ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES.</head>
               <p>ISRAEL PUTNAM, who, through a regular gradation of promotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Senior Major General in the army of the United States, and next in rank to General Waſhington, was born at Salem, in the province, now ſtate of Maſſachuſetts, on the 7th day of January, 1718. His father, captain Joſeph Putnam, was the ſon of Mr.
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028831_0052_0FDD1D8E9507A2F0"/>
John Putnam, who, with two brothers, came from the ſouth of England, and were among the firſt ſettlers of Salem.</p>
               <p>When we thus behold a perſon, from the humble walks of life, ſtarting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed in the career of fame, and by an undeviating progreſs through a life of honour, arriving at the higheſt dignity in the ſtate; curioſity is ſtrongly excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and philoſophy loves to trace the path of glory from the cradle of obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the ſummit of elevation.</p>
               <p>His diſpoſition was as frank and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as his mind was fearleſs and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. He diſguiſed nothing; indeed he ſeemed incapable of diſguiſe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in the intercourſe he was ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to have with an artful world, his ſincerity on ſome occaſions, outwent his diſcretion. Although he had too much mildneſs in his nature to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a quarrel, he had too much ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility not to feel, and too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour not to reſent an intended inſult.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028831_0052_0FDD1D8E9507A2F0"/>
The firſt time he went to Boſton, he was inſulted for his ruſticity by a boy of twice his ſize and age; after bearing his ſarcaſms until his patience was worn out, he challenged, engaged and vanquiſhed his unmannerly antagoniſt, to the great diverſion of a croud of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators. While a ſtrippling, his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to perform the labour of a man, and to excell in athletic diverſions. In that rude, but maſculine age, whenever the village youth aſſembled, on their uſual occaſions of feſtivity; pitching the bar, running, leaping and wreſtling were favourite amuſements. At ſuch gymnaſtic exerciſes (in which during the heroic times of ancient Greece and Rome, conqueſt was conſidered as the promiſe of future military fame) he bore the palm from almoſt every ring.</p>
               <p>In the year 1739, he removed from Salem to Pomfret, an inland fertile town in Connecticut, forty miles eaſt of Hartford: having here purchaſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028831_0053_0FDD1D94A6B93540"/>
tract of land, he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſucceſsfully to agriculture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Putnam, before he attained the twenty-firſt year of his age, married Miſs Pope, daughter of Mr. John Pope, of Salem, by whom he had ten children, ſeven of whom are ſtill living. He loſt the wife of his youth in 1764: ſometime after he married Mrs. Gardiner, widow of the late Mr. Gardiner, of Gardiner's Iſland, by whom he had no iſſue: ſhe died in 1777.</p>
               <p>Our farmer had to encounter not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the calamities occaſioned by drought in ſummer, blaſt in harveſt, loſs of cattle in winter, but the deſolation of his ſheep-folds by wolves. In one night he had ſeventy fine ſheep and goats killed, beſides many lambs and kids wounded: this havock was committed by a ſhe wolf, which, with her annual whelps had for ſeveral years infeſted the vicinity. The young were commonly deſtroyed by the vigilance of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028831_0053_0FDD1D94A6B93540"/>
but the old one was too ſagacious to come within reach of gunſhot: when cloſely purſued ſhe would generally fly to the weſtern woods, and return the next winter with another litter of whelps.</p>
               <p>This wolf at length, became ſuch an intolerable nuiſance, that Mr. Putnam entered into a combination with five of his neighbours to hunt alternately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they could deſtroy her. Two, by rotation, were to be conſtantly in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; having loſt the toes from one foot, by a ſteel trap, ſhe made one track ſhorter than the other. By this veſtige, the purſuers, recognized in a light ſnow, the route of this pernicious animal. Having followed her to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut river, and found ſhe had turned back in a direct courſe towards Pomfret, they immediately returned, and by ten o'clock the next morning, the blood hounds had driven her into a den, about three miles diſtant from the houſe of
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028831_0054_0FDD1D961281CEE8"/>
Mr. Putnam. The people ſoon collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dogs, guns, ſtraw, fire, and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, to attack the common enemy. With this apparatus ſeveral unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efforts were made to force her from the den. The hounds came back badly wounded and refuſed to return. The ſmoke of blazing ſtraw had no effect; nor did the fumes of burnt brimſtone, with which the cavern was filled, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel her to quit the retirement. Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch fruitleſs attempts (which had brought the time to ten o'clock at night) Mr. Putnam tried once more to make his dog enter, but in vain: he propoſed to his negro man to go down into the cavern and ſhoot the wolf; the negro declined the hazardous ſervice: then it was, that their maſter, angry at the diſappointment, and declaring that he was aſhamed to have a coward in his family, reſolved himſelf to deſtroy the ferocious beaſt, leaſt ſhe ſhould eſcape through ſome unknown ſiſſure of the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028831_0054_0FDD1D961281CEE8"/>
rock. His neighbours ſtrongly remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt the perilous enterprize; but he knowing, that wild animals are intimidated by fire, and having provided ſeveral ſtrips of birch-bark, the only combuſtible material which he could obtain, that would afford light in this deep and darkſome cave, prepared for his deſcent. Having accordingly diveſted himſelf of his coat and waiſtcoat, and having a long rope faſtened round his legs by which he might be pulled back, at a concerted ſignal, he entered head foremoſt with the blazing torch in his hand.</p>
               <p>The aperture of the den, on the eaſt ſide of a very high ledge of rocks, is about two feet ſquare; from thence it deſcends obliquely fifteen feet, then run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning horizontally about ten more, it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends gradually ſixteen feet towards its termination. The ſides of this ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous cavity are compoſed of ſmooth and ſolid rocks, which ſeem to have been
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028831_0055_0FDD1D97921AB848"/>
divided from each other by ſome former earthquake. The top and bottom are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſtone, and the entrance, in winter, being covered with ice, is exceedingly ſlippery. It is in no place high enough for a man to raiſe himſelf upright; nor in any part more than three feet in width.</p>
               <p>Having groped his paſſage to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal part of the den, the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying darkneſs appeared in front of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was ſilent as the houſe of death: none but monſters of the deſert had ever before explored this ſolitary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of horror. He, cautiouſly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onward, came to the aſcent, which he ſlowly mounted on his hands and knees, until he diſcovered the glaring eye-balls of the wolf, who was ſitting at the extremity of the cavern. Start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the ſight of fire, ſhe gnaſhed her teeth and gave a ſullen growl. As ſoon as he made the neceſſary diſcovery, he kicked the rope as a ſignal for pulling
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028831_0055_0FDD1D97921AB848"/>
him out. The people at the mouth of the den, who had liſtened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of the wolf, and ſuppoſing their friend to be in imminent danger, drew him forth with ſuch celerity that his ſhirt was ſtripped over his head, and his ſkin ſeverely lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. After he had adjuſted his cloaths and loaded his gun with nine buck-ſhot, holding a torch in one hand and the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket in the other, he deſcended the ſecond time, when, he drew nearer than before, the wolf aſſuming a ſtill more fierce and terrible appearance, howling, rolling her eyes, ſnapping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the attitude and on the point of ſpringing at him. At the critical inſtant, he levelled and fired at her head: ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſhock, and ſuffocated with the ſmoke, he immediately found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf drawn out of the cave; but having refreſhed himſelf, and permitted the ſmoke to diſſipate, he went down the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028831_0056_0FDD1D992BA0BF38"/>
third time; once more he came within ſight of the wolf, who appearing very paſſive he applied the torch to her noſe and perceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope, (ſtill tied round his legs) the people above, with no ſmall exultation dragged them both out together.</p>
               <p>But the time had now arrived which was to turn the inſtruments of huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into weapons of hoſtility, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the hunting of wolves, who had ravaged the ſheep-folds, for the purſuit after ſavages who had deſolated the frontiers. Mr. Putnam was about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven years old, when the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and France, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the laſt, broke out in America. His reputation muſt have been favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly known to the government, ſince the firſt troops that were levied by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut. In 1755, he was appointed to the command of a company in Lyman's regiment of provincials: the regiment
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028831_0056_0FDD1D992BA0BF38"/>
joined the army, at the opening of the campaign, not far diſtant from Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. The time for which the colonial troops were to ſerve, terminated with the campaign. Putnam was re-appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and again took the field in 1756.</p>
               <p>The active ſervices of captain Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, on every occaſion, attracted the admiration of the public, and induced the legiſlature of Connecticut to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote him to a majority in 1757.</p>
               <p>In the month of Auguſt, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men were employed under the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of majors Rogers and Putnam, to watch the motions of the enemy near Ticonderoga. Upon being, ſometime afterwards, diſcovered, they concerted meaſures for returning to fort Edward: at the moment of moving, the famous French partizan, Molang, who had been ſent with five hundred men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept our party, was not more than one mile and an half diſtant from them; having heard the firing, he haſted to lay
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028831_0057_0FDD1DB184904DF0"/>
an ambuſcade preciſely in that part of the wood moſt favourable to his project. Major Putnam was juſt emerging from the thickeſt, into the common foreſt, when the enemy roſe, and with diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant yells and whoops, commenced an attack upon the right of his diviſion. Surprized, but undiſmayed, Putnam haſtily returned the fire, and perceiving it would be impracticable to croſs the creek, determined to maintain his ground: inſpired by his example, the officers and men behaved with great bravery: ſometimes they fought aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gately in open view, and ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually under cover; taking aim from behind the bodies of trees, and acting in a manner independent of each other; for himſelf having diſcharged his fuſil ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, at length it miſſed fire, while the muzzle was preſſed againſt the breaſt of a large well proportioned Savage. This warrior, availing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the indefenſible attitude of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028831_0057_0FDD1DB184904DF0"/>
with a tremendous war-hoop ſprang forward, with his lifted hatchet, and compelled him to ſurrender; and having diſarmed and bound him faſt to a tree, returned to the battle.</p>
               <p>The intrepid captains, D'Ell and Harman, who now commanded, were forced to give ground for a little diſtance, the Savages, conceiving this to be the certain harbinger of victory, ruſhed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly on, with dreadful and redoubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cries: but our two partizans, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting a handful of brave men, gave the purſuers ſo warm a reception as to oblige them, in turn to retreat a little beyond the ſpot where the action firſt commenced: here they made a ſtand. This change of ground, occaſioned the tree to which Putnam was tied to be directly between the fire of the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Human imagination can hardly figure to itſelf a more deplorable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The balls flew inceſſantly from either ſide, many ſtruck the tree, while
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028831_0058_0FDD1DB2965A7538"/>
ſome paſſed through the ſleeves and ſkirts of his coat. In this ſtate of jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy, unable to move his body, to ſtir his limbs, or even to recline his head, he remained more than an hour: ſo equally ballanced, and ſo obſtinate the fight. At one moment, while the battle ſerved in favour of the enemy, a young ſavage, choſe an odd way of diſcovering his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor: he found Putnam bound: he might have diſpatched him at a blow: but he loved better to excite the terrors of the priſoner, by hurling a tomahawk at his head; or rather it ſhould ſeem his object was to ſee how near he could throw it without touching him; the weapon ſtruck in the tree a number of times at a hairs breadth diſtance from the mark. When the Indian had finiſhed his amuſement, a French baſ-officer (a much more inveterate ſavage by nature, though deſcended from ſo humane and poliſhed a nation) perceiving Putnam, came up to him, and levelling a fuſil
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028831_0058_0FDD1DB2965A7538"/>
within a foot of his breaſt, attempted to diſcharge it; it miſſed fire. Ineffectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did the intended victim, ſolicit the treatment due to his ſituation, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating that he was a priſoner of war. The degenerate Frenchman did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the language of honour or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deaf to their voice, and dead to ſenſibility, he violently and repeatedly, puſhed the muzzle of his gun againſt Putnam's ribs, and finally gave him a cruel blow on the cheek with the butt of his piece: after this daſtardly deed he left him.</p>
               <p>At length the active intrepedity of D'Ell and Harman, ſeconded by the perſevering valour of their followers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; they drove from the field the enemy, who left about ninety dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. As they were retiring Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam was untied by the Indian who had made him priſoner, and whom he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called maſter. Having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted for ſome diſtance from the place
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028831_0059_0FDD1DB412D05478"/>
of action, he was ſtripped of his coat, veſt, ſtockings and ſhoes, and loaded with as many of the packs of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as could be piled upon him: ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pinioned, and his wriſts tied as cloſely together as they could be pulled with a cord. After he had marched, through no pleaſant paths, in this painful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, many miles, the party (who were much fatigued) halted to reſt. His hands were now immoderately ſwelled from the tightneſs of the ligature; and the pain had become intolerable. His feet were ſo much ſcratched that the blood dropped faſt from them. Exhauſted with bearing a burden above his ſtrength, and frantick with torment, exquiſite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond endurance; he entreated the Iriſh interpreter to implore, as the laſt and only grace he deſired of the ſavages, that they would knock him on the head and take his ſcalp at once, or looſe his hands. A French officer inſtantly interpoſing, ordered his hands to be unbound and ſome of the packs to be taken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:028831_0059_0FDD1DB412D05478"/>By this time, the Indian who cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured him, and had been abſent with the wounded, coming up, gave him a pair of mocaſons, and expreſſed great indignation at the unworthy treatment his priſoner had ſuffered.</p>
               <p>The ſavage cheif again returned to the care of the wounded, and the Indians, about two hundred in number, went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt of the party to the place where the whole were, that night, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp. They took with them Major Putnam, on whom (beſides innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other outrages) they had the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to inflict a deep wound with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahawk, in the left cheek. His ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were in this place conſummated. A ſcene of horror, infinitely greater than had ever met his eyes before, was now preparing: it was determined to roaſt him alive. For this purpoſe, they led him into a dark foreſt, ſtripped him nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bound him to a tree, and piled dry bruſh with other fuel, at a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028831_0060_0FDD1DB59102B0C8"/>
in a circle round him. They accompanied their labours, as if for his funeral dirge, with ſcreams and ſounds inimitable but by ſavage voices: then they ſet the piles on fire; a ſudden ſhower damped the riſing flame. Still they ſtrove to kindle it, until, at laſt, the blaze ran fiercely round the circle: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Putnam ſoon began to feel the ſcorching heat. His hands were ſo tied that he could move his body. He oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſhifted ſides as the fire approached. This ſight, at the very idea of which, all but ſavages, muſt ſhudder, afforded the higheſt diverſion to his inhuman tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; who demonſtrated the delirium of their joy by correſpondent yells, dances and geſticulations. He ſaw clearly that his final hour was inevitably come: he ſummoned all his reſolution and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his mind, as far as his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would admit, to bid an eternal farewell to all he held moſt dear. To quit the world would ſcarcely have coſt
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028831_0060_0FDD1DB59102B0C8"/>
him a ſingle pang; but for the idea of home, but for the remembrance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic endearments, of the affectionate partner of his ſoul, and their beloved of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. His thoughts was ultimately fixed on a happier ſtate of exiſtence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the tortures he was beginning to endure. The bitterneſs of death, even of that death which is accompanied with the keeneſt agonies, was in a manner paſt; nature, with a feeble ſtruggle, was quitting its laſt hold on ſublunary things; when a French officer ruſhed through the crowd, opened away by ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the burning brands, and unbound the victim. It was Molang himſelf, to whom a ſavage, unwilling to ſee another human ſacrifice immolated, had ran and communicated the tidings. That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant ſpurned and ſeverely repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the barbarians, whoſe noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal powers and helliſh orgies he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ended. Putnam did not want for feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or gratitude. The French com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028831_0061_0FDD1DB711A0DCF8"/>
fearing to truſt him alone with them, remained until he could deliver him in ſafety into the hands of his maſter.</p>
               <p>The ſavage approached his priſoner kindly and ſeemed to treat him with particular affection, but being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, however, not to loſe his captive he took the mocaſons, from his feet and tied them to one of his wriſts; then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him to lie down on his back on the bare ground, he ſtretched one arm to its full length, and bound it faſt to a young tree; the other arm was extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bound in the ſame manner: his legs were ſtretched apart and faſtened to two ſaplings, then a number of tall but ſlender poles were cut down; which with ſome long buſhes, were laid acroſs his body, from head to foot: on each ſide lay as many Indians as could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently find lodging, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the poſſibility of his eſcape. In this diſagreeable and painful poſture he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained until morning. During this
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028831_0061_0FDD1DB711A0DCF8"/>
night, the longeſt and moſt dreary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, our hero uſed to relate that he felt a ray of cheerfulneſs come caſually acroſs his mind, and could not even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from ſmiling when he reflected on this ludicrous groupe for a painter, of which he himſelf was the principal fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p>At night, the party arrived at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, and the priſoner was placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſtrong French guard. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been examined by the marquis de Montcalm, Major Putnam was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to Montreal by a French officer, who treated him with the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and humanity.</p>
               <p>To mention the dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that this brave officer underwent both before and after he was taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the ſavages, is beyond my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, ſuffice it to ſay, that at the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ten years from his firſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a commiſſion, after having ſeen as much ſervice, endured as many hadſhips,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028831_0062_0FDD5CAB2CD829E0"/>
encountered as many dangers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as many laurels as any officer of his rank, with great ſatisfaction laid aſide his uniform and returned to his plough, which occupation he followed until the fatal day arrived, when hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities commenced between Great Britain and her colonies, now the United States of America. As he happened to be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at Boſton, he held many converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on theſe ſubjects with General Gage, the Britiſh commander in cheif, lord Peircy, colonel Sheriff, colonel Small, and many officers with whom he had formerly ſerved, who were now at the head quarters. Being often queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned—in caſe the diſpute ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to hoſtilities, what part he would take, he always anſwered, with his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and, that let whatever might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, he was prepared to abide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Being interrogated,—whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, who had been a witneſs to the proweſs and victories of the Britiſh fleets
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028831_0062_0FDD5CAB2CD829E0"/>
and armies, did not think them equal to the conqueſt of a country which was not the owner of a ſingle ſhip, regiment or magazine. He rejoined, that he could only ſay, juſtice would be on our ſide, and the event with Providence; but that he had calculated, if it required ſix years for the combined forces of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and her colonies to conquer ſuch a feeble country as Canada, it would at leaſt, take a very long time for England alone to overcome her own widely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended colonies, which were much ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Canada: that when men fought for every thing dear, what they believed to be the moſt ſacred of all cauſes, and in their own native land, they would have great advantages over their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who were not in the ſame ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that, having taken into view all circumſtances, for his own part, he fully believed that America would not be ſo eaſily conquered by England as thoſe gentlemen ſeemed to expect. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028831_0063_0FDD5CACADEB3BD8"/>
once, in particular, aſked whether he did not ſeriouſly believe that a well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Britiſh army of five thouſand veterans could march through the whole continent of America? He replied briſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no doubt, if they behaved civilly and paid well for every thing they wanted, but, after a moments pauſe, added—if they ſhould attempt it in a hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (though the American men were out of the queſtion) the women with their ladles and broom ſticks, would knock them all on the head before they had got half way through. This was the tenor of theſe amicable interviews.</p>
