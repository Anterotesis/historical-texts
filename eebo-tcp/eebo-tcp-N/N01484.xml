            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHAT gave Occaſion to the SERMONS here Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, was an Amazing Inſtance of what the poor Children of Men abandoned unto <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> may be left unto! A Prodigious Inſtance of that <hi>Hardneſs of Heart,</hi> which eſpecially the <hi>Sins of Unchaſtity,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Delays of Repentance,</hi> do lead unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Margaret Gaulacher,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, arrived the laſt Winter from <hi>Cork</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Servant, that ſoon found a Place in a Family where ſhe would not have wanted Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Encouragements for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of GOD.</p>
                  <p>She had been by her part in a <hi>Theft</hi> brought into Trouble in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and after her Tranſportation hither, it was not long before ſhe was found in <hi>Thieviſh</hi> Practices.</p>
                  <p>Ere ſhe had been long here, it was begun to be ſuſpected, that ſhe
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:001764_0004_0FB7CBCFEEEC8708"/>
was with Child, by a Fornication; But ſhe ſo Obſtinately all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, that at laſt ſhe muſt feel the Effects of her Obſtinacy.</p>
                  <p>She was delivered of her <hi>Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> when ſhe was all alone; and ſhe hid the <hi>Killed Infant</hi> out of the way; which was within a little while diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Of her Behaviour in the Time of her Impriſonment, and of the Means uſed for her Good, there is an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given in our SERMONS.</p>
                  <p>The Woman was of a very Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirit; and the Tranſports and Furies thereof, ſometimes were with ſuch Violence, as carried in them, one would have thought, an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Degree of <hi>Satanic Energie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By'nd by, ſhe would bewail her Paſſions, and promiſe to indulge herſelf no more in ſuch Paſſionate Outrages.</p>
                  <p>One who owns himſelf to be a <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> affirms to me, that ſhe privately Declared herſelf unto him, to be in her Heart, of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:001764_0005_0FB7CBD0DEBB1890"/>
But ſhe never would own any thing of <hi>that</hi> unto the Miniſters who viſited her with the Means of her Salvation.</p>
                  <p>A Gracious and Worthy Servant of God, Mr. <hi>Thomas Craighead,</hi> (a Faithful and Painful Miniſter of the Goſpel, who came from <hi>Ireland,</hi> much about the ſame time that ſhe did) having Inſtructed her, and uſed many Charitable Endeavours for her Good, was deſired by her to be near her at her Execution; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Pray'd with her there, and continued his Inſtructions unto the Laſt.</p>
                  <p>She ſaid little, but referr'd herſelf to the Paper which had been read Publickly in the Congregation juſt before.</p>
                  <p>And yet ſhe Frowardly let fall one Word, which did not ſeem very conſiſtent with it; For which fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Strain of Impatience, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, ſhe added, <hi>Then the Lord be Merciful unto me!</hi> and ſpoke no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:001764_0006_0FB7CBD2588A0738"/>
All that remains for us to do, is to leave her in the Hands of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign GOD, whoſe <hi>Judgment,</hi> and not <hi>ours,</hi> has the Diſpoſal of her; and make the <hi>beſt Improvement</hi> we can of ſuch a Tragical Spectacle; for which the enſuing SERMONS are ſome Eſſays.</p>
                  <p>But, I ought now if I can, to Refreſh my Readers, with ſomething that ſhall be more Agreeable, more Comfortable; have leſs to Trouble them; ſomething that may be the <hi>Reverſe</hi> of ſo ſhocking a Spectacle, as has here given Troubleſome I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's unto them.</p>
                  <p>Looking among my Reſerved Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, I find an Excellent Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid of the Lord, a bright Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of the <hi>Heavenly Glory,</hi> finiſhing her Holy Life, in ſuch Remarkable Circumſtances, that I cannot withold a Brief Relation of the Matter.</p>
                  <p>Some while ago, there died in our <hi>Salem,</hi> a Gentlewoman whoſe Name was Mrs. <hi>Rix,</hi> the Daughter of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> (one of the
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:001764_0007_0FB7CBD55F6AC538"/>
Two firſt Miniſters, that Illuminated the Firſt of the Churches in the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi> Colony;) A Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Real <hi>Piety,</hi> and of equal <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;</hi> and one who had been a Diſciple of the Croſs, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured much Affliction, eſpecially by Sickneſs, with much Submiſſion to the Will of God. Some while before ſhe died, her Valuable Paſtor, (the Reverend Mr. <hi>Nicholas Noyes,</hi>) gave her a Viſit, wherein the Holy Minds of both, had their grateful Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. Particularly, ſhe told him, That there had newly appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, ſeveral <hi>Shining Perſons,</hi> who told her, <hi>That they were not now come for her, but on that Day ſix Weeks hence, they would come for her, and fetch her away with a Glorious Equipage.</hi> And then ſhe immediately asked her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, <hi>I pray Syr, what is the meaning of the Word EQUIP AGE? I don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I have heard that Word EQUIP AGE!</hi>—Her Paſtor with his uſual Wiſdom, (tho' wondring at what ſhe ſaid, and pondering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Secondly. When a Sinner <hi>hardens his own Heart,</hi> the Righteous <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of an Holy GOD, will caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sinner ſuch <hi>Objects,</hi> as he ſhall Abuſe to ſtrengthen the <hi>hardneſs of his Heart,</hi> how Perniciouſly, how Exceedingly! As the Potter ſets his Clay in the Sun, and it is <hi>hardened</hi> here; ſo the great God, before
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001764_0031_0FB7CC200C159120"/>
whom we are, as the <hi>Clay before the Potter,</hi> [And, <hi>whom He will, He har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth!</hi>] when a Sinner <hi>hardens his own Heart,</hi> the great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is provoked then to ſet him in very <hi>hardening</hi> Circumſtances. Perhaps, the Sinner ſhall now be <hi>hardened,</hi> by being left in the Hands of Wicked Company. Among all the <hi>Engines of Hell,</hi> there is not upon the Face of the Earth a greater <hi>Hardener!</hi> 'Tis from a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Holy God, that the Sinner becomes intimately Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Company</hi> that ſhall teach him the <hi>Arts of Sin,</hi> and ſpur him to the Practice of them; <hi>Company</hi> that ſhall inſtill into him Notions that diſpoſe him to Atheiſm, and prepare him for <hi>all manner of Sin and Blaſphemy; Company</hi> that ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice him againſt the Beſt Men and Things, and ſo lay the Dark Fetters of Death upon him. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a <hi>Companion</hi> of ſuch <hi>Fools,</hi> Sinner, Thy Heart is <hi>hardened,</hi> and thy Immortal Soul deſtroy'd. But then, there is another diſmal Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001764_0032_0FB7CC215021E200"/>
which brings an <hi>hardneſs</hi> upon the <hi>Heart</hi> of many a Sinner, which is forever to be deplored. It is in the Scandalous Falls of ſuch as have made a fair and high Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. By the Diſpoſal of God, it comes to paſs, that when a Sinner has been <hi>hardening</hi> his own <hi>Heart,</hi> his Lot ſhall be caſt, where ſome that every body thought <hi>Firſt-Rate Chriſtians,</hi> fall into Scandalous, Amazing, Infandous Actions. The Divel knew, what a Game he ſhould pray, when he drew thoſe Perſons into ſuch Actions! The perverſe Uſe the Sinner makes of what he ſees, is to conclude; <hi>Well, All Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a Cheat. If I do the worſt Things in the World, I do nothing, but that in which the greateſt Pretenders to Religion indulge themſelves!</hi> The Fooliſh Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is now <hi>hardened,</hi> and the Bars of the Pit are about him forever!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly. A Sinner that <hi>hardens his own Heart,</hi> is by the Righteous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Holy GOD, left in the Hand of <hi>Satan;</hi> And Oh! what
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001764_0033_0FB7CC2289ECF078"/>
a <hi>Satanic Hardneſs</hi> will the Heart of ſuch a Sinner be ſoon congeled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to! Of Impious ones, we read, 2 Cor. IV. 4. <hi>The God of this World has Blinded their Minds.</hi> 'Tis the ſame, who <hi>hardens their Hearts.</hi> An <hi>Ahab</hi> will be <hi>hardened</hi> with a Vengeance when the <hi>Lying Spirit</hi> ſhall have a Permiſſion for the Seducing of him. An <hi>hardened Heart</hi> is a <hi>ſeared Heart.</hi> But it is the <hi>Divel,</hi> that brings from Hell, thoſe Hot Irons, by which the <hi>Heart</hi> of a Sinner comes to be ſo <hi>Hardened</hi> and <hi>Seared.</hi> Anatomical Obſervations have told us, That the <hi>Stone</hi> whereof ſome have died, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, a <hi>Snake</hi> has been found in it. When the Heart of a Sinner is <hi>hardened,</hi> there is the <hi>Old Serpent</hi> in the <hi>Stone,</hi> to make it ſo. A Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by <hi>hardening his own Heart,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites the <hi>Divel</hi> to take Poſſeſſion of it. What the Sinner <hi>Invites,</hi> that the Holy GOD <hi>Permits.</hi> Yea, There is a Sentence now paſſed from the ſpotleſs Throne, <hi>That it ſhall be ſo</hi> But, Oh! What an <hi>hard Heart</hi> will
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001764_0034_0FB7CC24CD48CD78"/>
that be, which has the <hi>Divel</hi> filling of it! Forlorn <hi>Ananias,</hi> If <hi>Satan fill thy Heart,</hi> what, what wilt thou come to?</p>
                     <p>But then, Finally. When God <hi>Judicially</hi> gives a Sinner up to <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart,</hi> what Sin will there be, which the Sinner will not fall into? 'Tis a dreadful Word; LXXXI. 12.<hi>I gave them up unto their own Hearts Luſt, and they walked in their own Counſels.</hi> Oh! the Snares and Pits into which now their <hi>Walk</hi> will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them! The Doom which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly GOD now paſſes on the <hi>hardened Sinner,</hi> is; <hi>He is Unjuſt, and he ſhall be ſtill Unjust. He is Filthy, and he ſhall be Filthy ſtill!</hi> The Sinner is now left unto the enſlaving Power of Sin: He will now <hi>ſerve diverſe Luſts;</hi> and he will now ſtick at no Sin that ſhall be propoſed unto him. Is not here <hi>Miſchief</hi> enough! And an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all the <hi>Miſchief</hi>
imaginable; <hi>Miſchief</hi> ſurpaſſing all Imagination! For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001764_0035_0FB7CC26464ED670"/>
Secondly. A Sinner by <hi>hardening</hi> his own <hi>Heart,</hi> muſt alſo fall into all that <hi>Miſchief,</hi> which <hi>every</hi> S<hi>in,</hi> as well as an <hi>hard Heart</hi> has entail'd upon it. <hi>SIN,</hi> what is the <hi>Wages</hi> of it? Our youngeſt Children have this Inſtruction given them, as part of the <hi>Milk for our Babes; The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> Now, this <hi>Death,</hi> yea, all of this terrible <hi>Death,</hi> is what a Sinner by <hi>hardening</hi> his <hi>Heart</hi> will fall into: All the <hi>Curſe</hi> due to Sin; all the <hi>Wo</hi> brought by Sin; all the <hi>Wrath</hi> to which by Sin the Sinner becomes obnoxious. Verily, O <hi>Hard-hearted</hi> Sinner, Nothing leſs than <hi>Deſtruction</hi> will be thy Portion; A <hi>Destruction from God,</hi> if thou were not horribly <hi>Hardened,</hi> would be a <hi>Terror</hi> unto thee. Lo, the Great GOD <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters His Voice,</hi> and that a <hi>mighty Voice,</hi> in thoſe Words; XXIX. 1. <hi>He that being often Reproved, hardens his Neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without Remedy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are <hi>Temporal Miſchiefs</hi> and Ruines, whereto Sinners do by <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:001764_0036_0FB7CC2F197E4E60"/>
their <hi>Hearts</hi> in Sin, expoſe themſelves. There is that Word ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd upon them; Ezek. VII. 26. <hi>Miſchief ſhall come upon Miſchief unto them.</hi> Their Sin brings a <hi>Miſchief</hi> on their <hi>Eſtate;</hi> It is a <hi>Fire that conſumes their Subſtance.</hi> It brings a <hi>Miſcheif</hi> on their <hi>Eſteem:</hi> A <hi>Wound and a Diſhonour</hi> do they get by it, and a <hi>Reproach</hi> that will not be <hi>wiped away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> It brings a <hi>Miſchief</hi> on their <hi>Bodies:</hi> God <hi>makes them</hi> S<hi>ick</hi> in <hi>Smiting</hi> them for it. <hi>Spiritual Plagues</hi> accompany theſe <hi>Miſchiefs.</hi> The Sinners plunge themſelves into <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> into <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> into <hi>fooliſh and hurtful Luſts.</hi> They are given up to <hi>vile Affections.</hi> They are left unto the moſt <hi>Self-undoing Follies.</hi> They keep <hi>Cutting</hi> and <hi>Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> themſelves among the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Dead, and there is no binding of them. It won't be long before the Execution of that Word falls upon them; Rom. II. 5. <hi>After thy Hardneſs thou treaſureſt up unto thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Wrath againſt the day of Wrath,</hi> God will e're long break the Heads

of the <hi>Hard-hearted Leviathans.</hi> e're long, the <hi>hardened Heart</hi> ſhall be thrown into the <hi>Devouring Fire, and Everlasting Burnings,</hi> where, who can dwell? Oh!

The <hi>End</hi> of it will be in Miſeries that will never have an <hi>End!</hi>

                     <p>I. Moſt certainly, it very much behoves us, to <hi>Examine</hi> ourſelves, Whether we are not <hi>Hard-hearted</hi> and <hi>Self-hardened</hi> Sinners before the Lord.

find out theſe Heirs of Bleſſedneſs? They are thoſe who have a <hi>yielding Soul;</hi> a Soul ready to <hi>yield</hi> unto the Demands of GOD; They ſay, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Yea, or to bear?</hi> They are <hi>afraid</hi> of All <hi>Sin; troubled</hi> at All <hi>Sin.</hi> The <hi>Sins</hi> that ſeem <hi>Little</hi> to others, are <hi>Grievous</hi> to them; A <hi>vain Word</hi> Grieves them; A <hi>baſe Thought</hi> Grieves them. To ſay no more; They perceive the <hi>hardneſs</hi> of their own <hi>Hearts;</hi> They bewail it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They bemoan it; It makes them cry out, O <hi>wretched one that I am!</hi> To theſe <hi>Tender-hearted</hi> ones there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the <hi>great Conſolations</hi> of God! <hi>Comfort ye, Comfort ye, this my People, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But then there are ſome, upon whom a Sinful <hi>hardneſs of Heart</hi> is very Conſpicuous, very Notorious, very Diſtinguiſhing. Of theſe my Context ſhall direct us to make ſome Diſcovery.

If you will retain your <hi>Sins,</hi> and not <hi>confeſs</hi> them, not <hi>forſake</hi> them, upon thoſe Calls unto Repentance, which you are Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained withal, you are the Sinners that <hi>harden their Hearts.</hi> But Oh! what <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> do you lye open to? Concerning the Hearers of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, we read; Mar. III. 5. <hi>He looked round about on them with Anger, being grieved for the hardneſs of their Hearts.</hi> He now <hi>looks round about</hi> our Congregation; and where he ſees any-ſtill going on in their Sins, He ſays upon them, <hi>Oh!

When the <hi>Fear of Sin</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains and Governs the Mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, then the Man <hi>Fears the Lord exceedingly.</hi> The <hi>Fear of Sin,</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> main Ingredient in the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> We read. Prov.

                  <p>The <hi>Fear of Sin</hi> in True <hi>Religion,</hi> iſſues from an Awe, and an <hi>awful Sight</hi> which a Believer has of ſome Things that are <hi>not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt; The <hi>Preſence</hi> of GOD, is Awful to a Man that <hi>Fears</hi> Him. The <hi>Fear of God</hi> will make a Man
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001764_0060_0FB7CC7C181607E8"/>
Realize the <hi>Eye of God.</hi> One that <hi>Fears God,</hi> is under the Power of this Apprehenſion; <hi>O Lord, Thou art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all my ways: O Lord, There is not a Word in my Tongue, but thou knoweſt it: O Lord, Thou knoweſt my Thoughts afar off.</hi> This makes him <hi>afraid</hi> of every Sin; <hi>afraid</hi> of even the moſt <hi>Secret Sin.</hi> If a Sinful and Vicious or Fooliſh <hi>Thought</hi> break into his Mind, he is <hi>afraid</hi> of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a Lodging there. An Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent GOD, is much Conſidered, much Reverenced, by the Man that, <hi>Fears Him.</hi> Such an one may ſay, <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me.</hi> He Labours, he Watches, he Wiſhes, That he may behave himſelf <hi>always as before the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again; The <hi>Judgment</hi> of GOD is Awful to ſuch a Man. The <hi>Fear of God</hi> aſſures a Man of a <hi>Judgment to come;</hi> and it makes him <hi>Tremble</hi> at the Apprehenſion of being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Guilty,</hi> in that <hi>Judgment, The time of the Dead, when they ſhall be Judged,</hi> is the Time, when a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

ſhall be given to them that <hi>Fear God.</hi> They that <hi>Fear God,</hi> have their Eye much on the Time, when the <hi>Dead</hi> ſhall be <hi>Raiſed</hi> and <hi>Judged,</hi> and on the <hi>Reward</hi> which is then to be given to the Children of Men. One that <hi>Fears God,</hi> is very Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Day, when we muſt <hi>every one ſtand before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt;</hi> the Day when <hi>God will bring every Work into Judgment.</hi> The Dread of this Day, is to ſuch a Man, <hi>The Terror of the Lord.</hi> His great Study is, <hi>Oh! That in the Day of God, I may give up my Account with Joy, and not with Grief! Oh! That I may do nothing that may prove to my Diſadvantage in the Day when I give up my Account unto God!</hi> The <hi>Fear of God</hi> is not in the Man, who is not ſo diſpoſed, ſo affected.

                  <p>Secondly. Some who <hi>Sinned</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they <hi>Suffered,</hi> fall into New and more <hi>Sins,</hi> after their <hi>Sufferings.

added <hi>new Sins</hi> unto the vaſt Heap of their Provocations; and been more Sinful, in further Out-breakings, and Outrages of Impiety. 'Tis eſpecially thus, when People do like the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Thief</hi> on the Croſs, <hi>Blaſpheme</hi> God under their Afflictions; When they are full of <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> full of <hi>Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> full of <hi>Murmuring</hi> under their Afflictions; full of <hi>Envy</hi> againſt thoſe who do not endure the like Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; When they take <hi>Indirect Courſes</hi> to eſcape their Afflictions, <hi>unlawful Methods</hi> to abate their Afflictions.

upon ſuch Admonitions. Thus we read; Zech. UI. 7. <hi>I have cut off the Nations,—I ſaid, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive Inſtruction.</hi> Surely then, if we do not <hi>receive Inſtruction</hi> from Suffering upon <hi>ourſelves,</hi> 'tis plain, that we do not <hi>Fear God.</hi> When <hi>others</hi> are Scourged, God expects that <hi>we</hi> ſhould all <hi>Hear and Fear, and no more do Wickedly.</hi> Surely then, if they that are <hi>under the ſame Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> go on to Sin under their Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, theſe do not <hi>Fear God.</hi> There can be no doubt of this!</p>
                  <p>Secondly. They who <hi>get no Good</hi> by their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> forget that they have to do with God in their <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> Were People ſenſible that God ſends their <hi>Sufferings</hi> on them, and <hi>comes looking for the Fruit</hi> of His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, they would certainly <hi>get ſome Good</hi> by them. We read, Job V. 6, 8. <hi>Affliction comes not forth of the Duſt, neither doth Trouble ſpring out of the Ground.—I would ſeek unto God.</hi> Were we ſenſible, that we have to do with an Higher than all <hi>Second
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001764_0070_0FB7CCA3C0C45D88"/>
Cauſes</hi> in our Sufferings, they would certainly bring us nearer to God. But now, if Men caſt off the <hi>Senſe</hi> of God, it is plain, they alſo caſt off the <hi>Fear</hi> of God. It is undoubtedly, ſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. They that are <hi>Incorrigible</hi> Sinners under Sufferings, are unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably <hi>Unconverted</hi> Sinners. We read; Pſal. CXIX. 71. <hi>It is good for me, that I have been Afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> It is then <hi>good for us</hi> that we have Suffered any Humbling Things, when we are quickened in and by our <hi>Sufferings,</hi> to Learn, and to Love, and to Do the <hi>Statutes</hi> of God. There is a true <hi>Converſion</hi> to God, in doing ſo. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sufferings, to be brought into the <hi>Frames,</hi> and unto the <hi>Rules</hi> of a <hi>New-Creature;</hi> under <hi>Sufferings,</hi> to be brought into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, and of His Grace, and unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto all the Articles of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Sufferings,</hi> to Embrace a Precious CHRIST, in all His <hi>Offices,</hi> for and with all His <hi>Benefits;</hi> And under
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001764_0071_0FB7CCA6C937C1A8"/>
                     <hi>Sufferings</hi> to have all Sin rendred A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable to us; This is to <hi>get Good</hi> by <hi>Sufferings.</hi> But they who are Strangers to theſe things, are <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted</hi> Sinners. And all <hi>Unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Sinners, are Strangers to the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> Unto every <hi>Unconverted,</hi> and <hi>Unregenerate</hi> Soul, <hi>Thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and my Fear is not in thee, faith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> This cannot be queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly. Sinners <hi>Incorrigible</hi> under <hi>Sufferings,</hi> proclaim themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Fear</hi> that the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, may yet bring more <hi>heavy Sufferings</hi> upon them. They make a <hi>Fearleſs,</hi> Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Hardy Challenge to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God. God threatens them who are <hi>Incorrigible</hi> under their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> at that rate; Lev. XXVI. 23, 24. <hi>If ye will not be Reformed by theſe Things, then will I Puniſh you yet ſeven times more for your Sins.</hi> God will go on, <hi>Puniſhing</hi> the <hi>Incorrigible</hi> Sinner, and Multiplying His Plagues upon him, until he has deſtroy'd the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wonderfully. God will <hi>go on ſtill</hi> in His Inflictions, if the Sinner will <hi>go on ſtill</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="unknown:001764_0072_0FB7CCAD69B94E10"/>
in his <hi>Treſpaſſes.</hi> Yea, 'Tis the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Commination of God; <hi>After thy Hardneſs and Impenitent Heart,</hi> O Incorrigible Sinner, thou ſhalt find thou haſt been <hi>treaſuring up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath,</hi> and thy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Portion will be in the <hi>Perdition of Ungodly Men.</hi> But, the <hi>Incorrigible</hi> are not afraid of what a juſt God will do unto them. No, you Wretches, whoſe Heart-ſtrings are Sinews of Iron, you <hi>Fear</hi> it not! This fully proves the <hi>Indictment,</hi> That the <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors have not the Fear of God before their Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Things cannot well go off, without this Direction unto us. My Brethren, Give this Demonſtration; that you have the <hi>Fear of God;</hi> Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſuffered Evil Things,</hi> do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, Oh! no longer perſiſt, in <hi>Doing</hi> any <hi>Evil Things.</hi> Be prevailed withal, to make this Uſe of all your <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> Conſider, <hi>What is the Errand which the Affliction I now ſuffer is come upon?</hi> Make that Requeſt unto God; Job X. 2. <hi>Shew me wherefore thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest

It neceſſarily follows upon the Rectitude and Holineſs of His Nature, together with His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government. If there be one moſt Holy Lord and Governour of the World, I'm ſure that it is Eſſential to Him to Puniſh Sin at ſuch Times, and in ſuch Manner and Circumſtances, as His Wiſdom, Purity, the Order and Good of the World, and His own Honour and Glory do direct unto. So far God's Puniſhing Sin by a <hi>neceſſity of Nature</hi> is Intelligible, and Certain; and no
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001764_0107_0FB7CB1B2182EB20"/>
farther can I apprehend it. GOD's Holineſs, Honour &amp; Juſtice is dearer to Him than a thouſand Worlds; <hi>Pereat Mundus ſed fiat Juſtitia;</hi> let the World be Burnt up, but let Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice be Glorify'd. The <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD can have no Pleaſure in any Diſplay of itſelf, any further than is conſiſtent with the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Glory of <hi>Juſtice. They</hi> do not Luſt againſt each other; oppoſe, repine at, or glory over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: No; they agree, unite, and are both Glorious in the Exaltation of either. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in GOD is as much for the Preſervation of the <hi>Rights of a Holy and Wife and Perfect Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Government,</hi> as ſtrict Juſtice is; and Juſtice delights in the Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Mercy <hi>theſe preſerv'd,</hi> as much as it does in the Inflictions of the Puniſhments which they call for. Hence GOD is <hi>juſt to forgive,</hi> as well as to puniſh. It is as Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to GOD to glorify His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice as His Mercy. The one is as dear to Him as the other. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>
                     <hi>GOD is liable to no Paſſion, or diſorder of Affection.</hi> Heaven is the <hi>Temperate Region.</hi> Humane Paſſions have their <hi>Tranſports</hi> and their <hi>Pain;</hi> and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate Himſelf to us and affect us God ſpeaks of Himſelf <hi>after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men;</hi> but let us beware of thinking GOD <hi>altogether ſuch as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> What is <hi>imperfect</hi> in us, we muſt <hi>infinitely remove</hi> from GOD, when we conceive and ſpeak of Him.

has no Pleaſure that the Wicked ſhould die, yet it is infinitely Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable to Him to hate Sin, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify His Juſtice, and to perform His Truth and Threatnings againſt Sin; and the <hi>Miſeries</hi> of them that periſh are no grief or <hi>offence of Heart</hi> unto Him.</p>

wherein it is impoſſible for GOD to change; and ſo is a Ground for the ſtrongeſt Confidence, and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that <hi>fly for Refuge</hi> from Guilt and the Avenger of Blood to lay hold on the <hi>hope</hi> of Forgivneſs and Life Eternal. Now this <hi>Oath</hi> we have in <hi>Form</hi> and expreſs Terms: Ezek. 33. 11. <hi>Say unto them, As I live, ſaith the Lord GOD, I have no pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye dye, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> How ſolemn is this Aſſurance given to Sinners? and what could GOD do more to aſſure them? Is it not a wonderful <hi>Condeſcention</hi> in the Great GOD to ſuperadd His Oath unto His Word? to <hi>ſwear</hi> to what He had once ſaid, that ſo His Word might make the deeper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on us? whereas any <hi>one Word</hi> of GOD, the <hi>Eternal Truth</hi> is inſtead of ten thouſand Oaths.

Lord, I have no</hi> &amp;c. GOD is Sincere <q>and Faithful in all that He ſays; He deals plainly with us and ſpeaks what He intends:</q> His Words are the true Image and Declaration of His Mind.

                  <p>NOW ſhall we believe GOD, or ſhall we make Him a Liar? ſhall we ſcruple and doubt after His poſitive Word is paſſed? No; <hi>let GOD be true;</hi> let His Word be magnified, in GOD let us praiſe His Word! that Word by which the World ſtands! until the time come when the Angel lifts up his Hand to Heaven hereafter and ſwears by him that liveth for ever and ever, that time ſhall be no mercy and then by the ſame word ſhall all things be diſſolved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. GOD has given aſſurance to Sinners that He hath no pleaſure in their Death, <hi>in the Revelation which

                  <p>TRUE, To His <hi>own</hi> Honour and Glory, the Ends of His Holineſs Wiſdom and Juſtice, and the common Good of all His Creation, it is meet &amp; good that a <hi>Million</hi> of Creatures be thrown away in a day into an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perdition: for what are <hi>theſe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Honour and <hi>Government</hi> of GOD? and to His Glory from Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Millions of Holy and better Creatures, and their joynt-happineſs?

But otherwiſe, the GOD who made us, the Rock that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, certainly bears a very gracious Inclination to us and our happineſs: the Miſery of His Creatures can in it ſelf alone be no pleaſure to Him.</p>

Death and Miſery was thus forbidden in the Cauſes of it; Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were before given and the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preſervation of them was thus requir'd. It was with great Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that He ſaw Man <hi>naked</hi> and ruined. <hi>What is it that you have done?</hi> ſaid He—and drove them out of Paradice into Labours and Sorrows, in a World which their Sin had blaſted.

                  <p>TO Conclude, GOD had no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the <hi>Fall of Angels,</hi> nor of <hi>Man;</hi> He made them both Happy: He has pleaſure in the Angels that <hi>ſtand,</hi> and in the Sinners whom His <hi>Grace

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>THE very Threatnings of the Law againſt Sin, the Threatning of Eternal Death in caſe of Impenitence in Sin,</hi> ſhows that GOD has no pleaſure that the Sinner ſhould die, but that he repent and live.</p>
                  <p>THE Intention of the <hi>Threatning</hi> is in Mercy to the Sinner, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his Sin and Deſtruction: it is to deter and affright us from Sin, that ſo the woful Effects thereof may not fall upon us. GOD ſhows us the Evil of Sin, and what a dangerous thing it is to commit it, that we may tremble at the Motion of it, and fly therefrom.</p>
                  <p>CAN we think that He who warns us of our Danger deſires that it ſhould befall us? No, far from it: It were the moſt croſs and perverſe Imputation that can be; moſt abſurd, and alſo moſt ungrateful and bafe.</p>

THE Threatning does not make the <hi>Effect</hi> of Sin to be what it is: No; <hi>that</hi> had been the ſame without the Publication of the Curſe. That the <hi>Wicked ſhall die</hi> is founded in the very Nature of Sin; the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Eſſential Dominion of GOD make <hi>that</hi> Neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>It is not owing to the <hi>Abſolute and meer Will</hi> of GOD, that he who Sins ſhall die; but to the Holineſs and <hi>Rectitude</hi> of the Divine Nature, and to the wiſe and <hi>Righteous Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of His Government.</p>
                  <p>THE Threatning of God's Word only lets us know what <hi>will be</hi> and <hi>muſt be</hi> in caſe of Sin; what the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Juſtice of GOD make Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. And why is this made known to us by the <hi>Word,</hi> but for our Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that we may not by Sin, and by continuance therein, bring Death and Damnation upon our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>LET us look into <hi>Humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and their Laws. Theſe ordain <hi>Death</hi> in many Caſes as the <hi>Sanction</hi> neceſſary to the Ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

THUS the Threatning of Death againſt Sin ſhows that GOD has no pleaſure that the Sinner ſhould die.</p>
                  <p>AND the <hi>Juditial Executions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in this Life</hi> do really ſpeak the ſame thing.

                  <p n="5">5. GOD's <hi>ſending His own Son, our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to die for us,</hi> is the higheſt Argument of all that He has no pleaſure that the Sinner ſhould die.

                  <p>THIS Divine and Glorious Perſon ſubmitted for this End to the deepeſt Humiliation and Abaſement, to bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sorrows and to an accurſed Death.

Not only did the Son of GOD become <hi>Man,</hi> but a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to ſatisfy the Juſtice of GOD for Man's Sin. And <hi>therefore did His Father love him,</hi> becauſe He laid down His Life for us. What pleaſure then has He in the Life and Salvation of poor Sinners?</p>
                  <p>WHY elſe has He provided for it at ſuch an Expence of Grace? and why is the Call, the Offer, Tender and Promiſe of Life thro' Him ſo earneſtly urged on us?

This is true <hi>Love</hi> to Men, true <hi>Devotion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward GOD.</p>
                  <p>III. OUR Doctrine brings <hi>Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Wicked, the Ungodly and Impenitent,</hi> and on diverſe Accounts do they ſtand <hi>Condemned</hi> by it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>AS having pleaſure in their own Death.</hi> GOD ſays to them, <hi>Why will you die?</hi> This He <hi>Charges</hi> upon you, and juſtly <hi>Complains</hi> of it.

that hurts its Life; but mad as <hi>Men</hi> are, they Murder their own Souls, void equally of pity and of fear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. OUR Doctrine reproves and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns <hi>all them thao have pleaſure in the Sins of others:</hi> whether <hi>Tempting</hi> them to Sin, <hi>Approving</hi> them, <hi>Indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them in it, or <hi>Rejoicing</hi> at it and <hi>Inſulting</hi> over them. The latter is as <hi>barbarous,</hi> as the former <hi>treacherous;</hi> but all <hi>Impious.</hi> Rom. 1. 32. <hi>Who knowing the Judgment of GOD, that they who do ſuch things are worthy of Death, not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> Rom. 14. 15. <hi>Deſtroy not him—for whom Chriſt died.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>THY Damnation will be owing to thy ſelf at laſt, thy own wilful Choice of Death in the Cauſes of it.</hi> Thou art a <hi>Self-deſtroyer,</hi> and canſt have no Excuſe, nor lay the Blame of thy Eternal Miſery on any one but thy ſelf. <hi>Thou haſt a Devil and art Mad, he goeth about to kill thee.</hi> With the furious <hi>Demoniac</hi> thou ſtabbeſt thy ſelf.

And ſuch Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will be your exquiſite and eternal Torment.</p>
                  <p>IV. ON the other hand, <hi>The Doctrine is full of Comfort and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to every poor and contrite Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that trembleth at GOD's Word,

feels the plague of its own Heart, and fears the Wrath of GOD; that is mourning in the Conſcience of Sin, and in the Apprehenſion of the Curſe due thereto.</p>
                  <p>IS Sin your Burden, GOD your Fear, Grace your Deſire? and do you doubt whether GOD will delight to ſhew thee Mercy? let me rebuke thy Unbelief, and warn thee of the Wickedneſs thereof.</p>
                  <p>THO' your Sins are many, great and hainous; tho' they may have been long perſiſted in and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; yet GOD ſeeks thy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and deſires you wou'd turn and live: He would glorify His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Grace, and His pardoning Mercy upon thee. Have you <hi>conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>turned?</hi> then all your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions ſhall <hi>not be mentioned</hi> againſt you; <hi>you ſhall ſurely live, you ſhall not die.</hi>
