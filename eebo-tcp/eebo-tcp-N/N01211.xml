            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Exod. 18. 21.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Moreover thou ſhalt provide out of all the People, Able men, ſuch as fear God, men of Truth, Hating Covetouſneſs; and place ſuch over them, to be Rulers of thouſands, and Rulers of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Rulers of Fifties, and Rulers of Tens.</hi>

            <p>WE Read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 18. That <hi>Moſes</hi> fled from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the Land of <hi>Midian,</hi> and Married <hi>Zippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Jethro, the Prieſt or Prince of Midian.</hi> The reaſon why he is thus ſtiled, I conceive may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, by conſidering the Character that is given of <hi>Job. Job</hi> is ſuppoſed to be deſcended from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and that he lived in the time between <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> he was the Greateſt Man of the Eaſt, not only as to <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> For, <hi>When he went out to the Gate through the City, when he prepared his Seat in the Street. The Young men ſaw him, and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Aged aroſe, and ſtood up. The Princes refrained talking, and laid their hands on their mouth. The Nobles held their peace; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e dwelt as King in the Army.</hi> Job 29. 7, 8, 9, 10, 25. Yet this <hi>Prince</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001448_0003_0FB2F37E68B1DCA8"/>
Burnt-Offerings; <hi>Job</hi> 1. 5. Yea, his three Friends were directed to go to him with their Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he was to Pray for them, which he did, and the Lord accepted him, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 8, 9, 10. Being thus conſecrated by God, he might be ſtiled <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jethro</hi> was deſcended from <hi>Midian,</hi> the fourth Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by his Wife <hi>Keturah,</hi> Gen. 25. 2. and was <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Midian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> was <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the Moſt High God. <hi>Jethro</hi> owned, and worſhipped the True God, <hi>Exod-</hi> 18. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> by expreſs Command from God, departed from <hi>Midian</hi> to go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> taking his Wife and two Sons with him. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 20. But after God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his diſpleaſure againſt him, for neglecting to Circumciſe his Son; he ſent his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren back unto <hi>Jethro,</hi> who remained with him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the happy Congreſs mentioned in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>It is conceived that this part of the Hiſtory is tranſpoſed; becauſe it appears that this meeting was after the giving of the Law: when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſat as <hi>Judge;</hi> both to explain the Mind and Will of God to the People, and to determine matters in Controverſy according to the Law. That it ſhould therefore in point of time have been mentioned after the 10th verſe of the 10th of <hi>Numbers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jethro</hi> had in his own Land, a general account of the wonderful deliverance God had granted his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> under the Conduct of his Son-in-law <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore moves towards him, with his Wife and Children;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001448_0004_0FB2F380AF73FAD0"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> went out to meet him; and after the joyful Congratulation, and they were come into the Tent, <hi>Moſes</hi> gives him a more particular account of the merciful and wonderful diſpenſations of Divine Providence towards <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſince he left him in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This filled the heart of the Good old man with joy, <hi>which he expreſſed, by acknowledging the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Glory, and excellency of the God of Iſrael; by offering of Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices, and feaſting with</hi> Aaron, <hi>and the Elders of Iſrael before God,</hi> Exo. 18. 12. ſo joyning with the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Solemn Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>The day following, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſat to judge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſtood before him from morning to even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which his wiſe Father-in-law obſerving, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his diſlike of, as a method that would be very prejudicial both to himſelf, and alſo to the people: to prevent the inconvenience, he propoſeth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; yet, as a good, as well as a wiſe man, ſubmits to the determination of God himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>If thou ſhalt do this thing, and God command thee ſo, thou ſhalt be able to endure, and all this people ſhall go to their place in peace.</hi> His advice was to provide out of all the people, a certain number of Officers, who might bear the burthen with <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſenſible of the neceſſity of complying with this advice, and acknowledged <hi>before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that he was not able by himſelf alone, to bear their cumbrance, their burthen and their ſtrife.</hi> Deut. 1. 12. The people therefore, having by his direction, Choſen a ſufficient number of perſons for
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001448_0005_0FB2F3831C96B5D8"/>
divers Offices; <hi>Moſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> made them Heads over <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> in ſeveral Diſtricts, with a moſt ſolemn Charge; ſaving to them, <hi>Hear the Cauſes between your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and judge righteouſly between every man, and his brother, and the Stranger that is with him; ye ſhall not reſpect perſons in judgment, but you ſhall hear the ſmall, as well as the great; you ſhall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is Gods; and the Cauſe that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</hi> Deut. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16, 17.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Divine Approbation</hi> of this advice, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by that ſtanding Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Judges and Officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy Gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy Tribes, and they ſhall judge the people with juſt judgment, thou ſhalt not wreſt judgment, thou ſhalt not reſpect perſons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wiſe, and pervert the words of the Righteous; that which is altogether juſt (Juſtice, Juſtice) ſhalt thou follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly that great Reformer, King <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> ſet <hi>Judges in the Land, throughout all the fenced Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>City by City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with the like ſolemn Charge, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 5, 6, 7. He ſaid to the Judges, <hi>Take heed what you do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of Gifts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words of the Text, <hi>Jethro</hi> manifeſts both his Wiſdom, and his Piety, in directing not only to a ſuitable number of Officers; but to thoſe qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001448_0006_0FB2F388DEE69178"/>
which were neceſſary for the diſcharge of their duty, in their ſeveral Stations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jethro</hi> mentions four qualifications; Able men, ſuch as fear God, men of Truth, hating Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions three more, Wiſe men, and Underſtanding, and known among your Tribes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. Under theſe ſeven, all other good Qualities and Vertues being comprehended; I ſhall briefly explain, and diſtinguiſh them.</p>

            <p>For the clearing and proving of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I ſhall inſiſt on two Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Propoſition I. <hi>In Chuſing of Perſons for Publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Employments, reſpect ought to be had to their Qualifications for ſuch Offices and Employments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſo evident to the light of nature, that no rational man will Chuſe a <hi>Servant,</hi> or a <hi>Slave</hi> that is not fit for the work he deſigns him.</p>
            <p>Here Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Choice is a free, deliberate and diſtinguiſhing act of the Mind.</hi> In this caſe, it is ſuppoſed that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

            <p n="2">2. <hi>As there are different Offices and Employments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo there are different Gifts which adapt, or fit for ſuch Offices; and different meaſures and degrees of thoſe Gifts.

Now Choice ought to have reſpect to <hi>Divine Providence;</hi> conſidering who is it that the Supreme Governour of the World doth <hi>indigitate; or point me to,</hi> as fitted for ſuch a Station, by the qualifications he hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? Election of Officers ought to be attended unto with ſeriouſneſs, looking up to God for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, his Glory is concerned in their management; the judgment is Gods; and they ought to act in his name and fear, for his Glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To have a liberty for Choice, and not to reſpect qualifications, is to trifle in a matter of greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;</hi> it is to ſlight a priviledge, which ſome

               <hi>Heathens</hi> would ſooner part with their Lives, then their Children ſhould be deprived of: It is to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the Sin and Folly of <hi>Eſau, who for a morſel of meat fold his birth-right.</hi> Oh! how often do men ſuffer themſelves to be impoſed on by thoſe who ſeek their own Intereſt, by their neglect or credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> little Emiſſaries are often imployed, by falſs repreſentations to divert from the Choice of the moſt Uſeful and Vertuous, and to engage a party to ſerve the <hi>Covetous.</hi> Oh! how often have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Cities and Countreys been loſt, ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſpoiled of all their Glory, by <hi>ungrateful</hi> 80 <hi>perfidious Hypocrites,</hi> who were Choſen to ſerve the Publick Intereſt. It is therefore of the <hi>laſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> in chuſing perſons to Publick Offices, to have reſpect to their <hi>Qualifications, That they be wiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, known among the tribes, able men, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, men of Truth, Hating Covetouſneſs.</hi> Which leads to the ſecond Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Propoſition II. <hi>In Chuſing perſons to be Publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, there ought to be ſpecial care, that they be men hating Covetouſneſs.</hi> The holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the qualifications for Biſhops and Deacons, doth in a very particular manner warn againſt the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous. A Biſhop muſt be blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not greedy of filthy lucre, not covetous; likewiſe the Deacons muſt be grave,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not greedy of filthy lucre.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 3, 8. Tit. 1. 7. <hi>not given to filthy lucre.</hi> As <hi>Covetous</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Deacons are a peſt to the Church, ſo are <hi>Covetous</hi> Officers to the State.</p>

In clearing this Propoſition, I ſhall anſwer three Queſtions.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is Covetouſneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Who may be ſaid to be men hating Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Why ought there be ſpecial care that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons choſen to publick Offices, ſhould be men hating Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is Covetouſneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. G.</hi> I intend only to explain the nature of the evil, in general; and not to diſcourſe of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways &amp; methods wherein this Sin doth appear.</p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>Covetouſneſs is ſometimes uſed as a term that comprehends all irregular and inordinate inclinations, and motions of the Soul towards forbidden Objects;</hi> the firſt motions of depraved nature towards ſin; the firſt <hi>Iſſues</hi> of Indwelling ſin, are termed <hi>Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Luſting.</hi> Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not known luſt, or concupiſcence, except the law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not Covet; but ſin taking occaſion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence. Thus, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is tempted when be is drawn aſide of his own luſt, and enticed; then when luſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin; and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi> Jam. 1. 14, 15. <hi>Thus, every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart, are only evil continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Gen. 6. 5. And the employment of the <hi>Unregenerate</hi> is to fulfil <hi>the wills or deſires of the fleſh and of the mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> all their labour and toil, their risques &amp; hazards, are only to this end; <hi>to make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>A. 2. <hi>Covetouſneſs is commonly taken in a more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited

or reſtrained ſence, for a peculiar ſort or kind of luſt, diſtinguiſhed from other luſts by a particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> The holy Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth the ſeveral ſorts of luſts that are in the world, into three heads. <hi>The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life. Covetouſneſs</hi> is a luſt of the eyes, having Riches for the Object; The holy Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The love of mony is the root of all evil. Covetouſneſs</hi> is the firſt expreſſion of that <hi>love,</hi> which is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in them that will be rich.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Covetouſneſs is a diſtemper of</hi> the <hi>Soul, which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts itſelf in a conſtant, greedy, inſatiable deſire</hi> after <hi>Riches, and employeth</hi> the <hi>whole man in various me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to gratifie that deſire.</hi> More particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a diſtemper of</hi> the <hi>Soul ſeeking after Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; a Covetous man is one that will be rich,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9. <hi>Riches, Mammon,</hi> is their chiefeſt good, and laſt end, their <hi>Idol,</hi> and they are termed <hi>Idolaters,</hi> Eph. 5. 5. I term it a diſtemper of the Soul, on a double account.

               </hi> But the <hi>Covetous</hi> man (who eſteemeth himſelf the wiſeſt of the three) ſaith, <hi>mony anſwers all things;</hi> if I can but get enough of that, I can purchaſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures;</hi> therefore laying aſide all other deſigns, but what are ſubſervient to his main end, he ſaith, <hi>he will be rich.</hi> (2.) <hi>Covetouſneſs is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a diſtemper,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from a lawful, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited deſire after a competent portion of the good things of this life, for the ſupport of our ſelves, &amp; thoſe under our Charge, according to our ſeveral Stations. <hi>Our Heavenly Father knoweth that we have need of theſe things;</hi> and requires us in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent uſe of <hi>proper</hi> means, to manifeſt our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him for ſuch a competency; hence we are directed to pray <hi>for our daily bread;</hi> that <hi>God would feed us with food convenient for us;</hi> that which is a competency for a ſingle perſon, is not for a Family; and that which is a competency for an <hi>Husbandman,</hi> is not for a <hi>Prince.</hi> That God who hath ordained <hi>Publick Offices,</hi> Sacred and Civil, and calleth perſons whom he qualifieth for ſuch Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, therein to abide with him, attending on the duty of their Callings; alloweth them a <hi>ſuitable ſupport.</hi> There is <hi>an accurſed Levelling</hi> Spirit in the World, which I cannot teſtifie againſt with a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient indignation; It will ſtarve Religion &amp; Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a Land;</hi> thoſe of this temper would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

allow ſo much to <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Officers</hi> as to the <hi>meaneſt Artificer,</hi> or <hi>Day Labourer.</hi> This is contrary to diſtributive Juſtice, and the Rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The holy Apoſtle, who ſaith, <hi>Rulers</hi> are the <hi>Miniſters of God for good: h. e.</hi> to thoſe under their Government; requires, <hi>for this cauſe to pay tribute</hi> alſo, <hi>for</hi> they <hi>are Gods Miniſters,</hi> attending <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon this very thing; Render therefore to all their dues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom is due, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</hi> And due it is, on the ſame account the people ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> Thou art worth <hi>Ten Thouſand of us,</hi> 2 Sam. 18. 3. So in proportion, the Service which Righteous, Wiſe and Faithful Officers do for the Publick, is <hi>vaſtly more</hi> than what <hi>many Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> can do by their Induſtry. Thus an <hi>Ingenious man</hi> often by a ſingle propoſal, doth ſave more to the Publick Treaſury; or directs to a method for gaining more than a <hi>Labouring</hi> man can procure by his Induſtry in many years; the Uſe and Service of ſuch men is beyond what the Vulgar can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: If their Service then be more in proportion, ſo ought their <hi>Support</hi> to be; but <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> is a diſtemper that will not allow <hi>Tribute, to whom Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is due.</hi>

            <p>Q. 3. <hi>Why ought there to be ſo much care to Chuſe men hating Covetouſneſs, for Publick Officers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>Covetous men will do no good to the Publick. h. e.</hi> they have no real, direct intentions to ſerve the <hi>Publick Intereſt:</hi> they often by <hi>accident,</hi> and by ſerving their <hi>own intereſt,</hi> do ſome good; but this is not their deſign. You may as well expect the Stream will riſe above the Fountain, as think that <hi>Covetous</hi> men will act above the principle of <hi>ſelf-love;</hi> this is the firſt ſpring of action, and this their center; here their thoughts, deſigns, cares &amp; endeavours terminates <hi>I will be Rich.</hi>

A. 2. <hi>Covetous men will hinder</hi> others <hi>from doing good;</hi> they hate thoſe who are of a Publick Spirit: they know their propoſals will interfere with their private intereſt; therefore they will what they can, blaſt their reputation, find fault with their Schemes for the Publick Service; they will to the utmoſt of their power, by themſelves and Agents, ſtop, clog, hinder, obſtruct; and if poſſible, ſubvert and overthrow whatever may thwart their private Intereſts.</p>
            <p>A. 3. <hi>Covetous men will do much hurt to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi> For, (1.) Their predominant principle influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth them thereto; for <hi>the love of mony is</hi> the root <hi>of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10. Many fooliſh and hurtful luſts ſpring from this root, ſuch as <hi>Lying, Fraud, Cheating, Bribery, Uſury,</hi> &amp;c. beſides, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to all other ſins that may ſubſerve this great deſign of getting mony. What will a <hi>Covetous man</hi> ſtick at to accompliſh his deſign? They are Time-ſervers, and Men-pleaſers, and will turn with every wind: They often proſtitute themſelves to the greateſt abominations in compliance with the luſts of men, in order to obtain their end. It will make <hi>Princes</hi> the <hi>companion of Thieves.</hi> Iſa. 1. 23. (2.) There is nothing will obſtruct, or hinder them, they will break all bonds, both Sacred and Civil, rather than be reſtrained from getting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

Let us conſider, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns, Cities and Strong Holds (the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of Art) have been ſhattered, beaten down, conſumed by fire, plundered and ravaged, during the long War; and yet this Town preſerved; <hi>no Gally with Oars, nor Gallant Ship hath ſhot a Bullet, nor Bomb againſt it; this is the doing of the Lord, &amp; it ought to be marvellous in our eyes;</hi> we ought to <hi>call upon our Souls, and all within us to ſing praiſes to God, ſing praiſes, for he hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad,</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed be his glorious name.</hi> But we are not only <hi>preſerved; we enjoy many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, we are daily loaden with benefits,</hi> we have a <hi>great meaſure of health, peace and plenty,</hi> while others are conſumed by the <hi>Sword, Famine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Peſtilence;</hi> the <hi>Lord dealeth bountifully with us.</hi> To all this.

to conſider what <hi>ill-uſage</hi> ſuch have ſometimes met with. (2.)

it, and employ all the <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Agents</hi> I can, to get that which they unjuſtly detain from me.

               <hi>Viz.</hi> To ſhew what miſchief <hi>Covetous men</hi> do in Churches. <hi>Where Church-Officers are greedy of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucre,</hi> and the Body of the Community <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened</hi> with the ſame evil; there is nothing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure where <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> reigns.

innumerable difficulties and temptations; divert them from their Duty, or ſo clog them; that as diſpirited and diſcouraged men will do little or no Service! It is ſo contrary to the Goſpel, that thoſe who are under the power of it, are excluded from the Priviledges of it. <hi>If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> Such Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are <hi>Spots</hi> and <hi>Blemiſhes; they grieve the Holy, Spirit of God, quench his motions, and cauſe him to depart from that people; and provoke the Holy One to give them up to ſtrong deluſions.</hi>

            <p>Having been thus helped to leave a plain <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt Covetouſneſs;</hi> through Grace I will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide thereby; leaving it to the Bleſſing of God; and recommend the Advice of our Lord Jeſus; Luke 12. 15. <hi>Take heed, and beware of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
