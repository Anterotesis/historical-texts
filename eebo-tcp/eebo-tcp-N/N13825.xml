            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manifeſtation of the love of God to mankind. Our bleſſed Saviour came into the world to put an end to ſin, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh tranſgreſſion and in the room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs. Hence he was called Jeſus, a Saviour, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, to ſave his people from their ſins <note n="*" place="bottom">Not in their ſin by a faith or belief in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's outward ſufferings, but by a radical change of heart through the operation of his ſpirit.</note> and in the room thereof to introduce his life, light and ſpirit in them, that they might ſerve him, without fear, in holineſs,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017472_0003_0FA121296FF43308"/>and righteouſneſs, all the days of their lives. Hence we are told, John i. 12. That as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God. Himſelf kindly invites his creatures to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this love, Matt. xii. 28. <q>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden and I will give you reſt.</q> No circumſtance of life can ſeparate or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitate us from being made partakers of this love; ever the moſt abaſed appear to be the particular objects of his care, Iſaiah lxvi. 1. <q>The Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footſtool—but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite ſpirit and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſh at my word</q> The plainneſs and ſimplicity of the work of redemption, in oppoſition to the perplexed intricacies of thoſe ſyſtems of religion taught in the ſchools, &amp;c. is moſt worthy of note. Where a feeling ſenſe of our natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption prevails, and a ſincere deſire of being delivered from the power of evil, with a convincment that this great work is alone to be perfected by obedience to the teaching of the ſpirit of grace, the work of redemption is ſo plain and eaſy, that we read Iſa. xxxv. 8. The wayfaring men, though fools ſhall not err therein.</p>
            <p>This power of God to ſalvation, operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017472_0004_0FA1212A2FA46558"/>through obedience, in the minds of the ſincere hearted, has from the beginning of the world been verified in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of people of every kind and nation. <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. viii. 11. Many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of Heaven.—Rev. vii. 9. I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all Nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues ſtood before the throne</note> Indians, Negroes, and others, even thoſe eſteemed of the loweſt order, by no means excepted: Many of theſe have, in great ſimplicity, experienced its ſalutary effects: a remarkable inſtance, whereof ſome years paſt appeared in a number of Indians in this province, ſince removed beyond the Allegany Mountains. The account given by ſome of the firſt of theſe was, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through divine favour, made deſirous of leading an orderly, religious life, they found a violent oppoſition in themſelves, to this good work, from the hardneſs, or as they termed it, the badneſs, which they felt in their hearts, <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. xvii. 9. The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it.</note> this put them upon ſeeking help from their fellow-men; but being diſappointed therein, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſeek and cry to God, the great and good Creator of the heart of man, who, as they perſiſted in ſeeking to him,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017472_0005_0FA1212AEF9B87D0"/>granted their requeſt, they finally experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the hardneſs, and badneſs of their hearts taken away; <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxvi. 26. A new heart alſo will give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you: and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</note> and in the room thereof, love to God, and tenderneſs to their fellow-men prevailed to that degree, as enabled them to bear the ill uſage which ſome of theſe might inflict upon them, without reſentment; but rather with pity and compaſſion; from a conſideration that thoſe who thus perſecuted them, were ſtill captives to that evil power which had ſo long kept them in thraldom, from which, through divine favour, they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. <note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe Indians, abſolutely, refuſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in war, of any kind, however they were threatened and abuſed on this account by the other Indians, being perſuaded that in the original crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, God did not intend they ſhould annoy, or kill, but cheriſh and comfort each other. In this diſpoſition they have continued now, for about thirty years, notwithſtanding the ill treatment they have received from Indians and others: more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of late that they have been pillaged, their ſetilements at three towns broke up, and they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away captives towards Canada. Thoſe Indians who carried them away, giving as a reaſon for this violence, that they were in their way, and a great obſtruction to them, when going to ward. See the Pennsylvania Packer, for December 22, 1701.</note>

The ſimplicity and plainneſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel call, farther appears in the account given by Edward Andrews, a perſon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, an eminent inſtrument in the hand of God, in gathering many towards the fold of reſt. His reſidence was at that time in the Jerſeys, near the Sea-ſhore, amongſt a wild ſort of people, Indians and others, vain and looſe in their converſation, fond of frolicking, muſic and dancing; amongſt theſe he acted the part of a fiddler. In this ſituation, as he was one day work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his field, he came acroſs a part of a human body, which he had ſeen before, which, as he now ſaw it, lying on the ground, a thought ſtruck him, that it was not right to ſuffer a part of his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be thus thrown up and down in the open field; but that he ought to do with it as he would deſire to be done by in the like condition; after ſome reaſoning in this ſort, he decently buried it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his work again, with an anſwer of peace in his mind. From that time he grew penſive, the pure witneſs of truth roſe in him, by which he was made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he had ſpent many years in vanity, that it was high time for him to turn unto the Lord, and a deſire was begot in him to experience an inward acquaintance with God, and be favoured with power from
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017472_0007_0FA1212D2ECA1A88"/>him, to forſake his vanity and looſe living the iniquity of which was then opened to him; and he found a call in his mind to deſtroy that fiddle, which had been ſo much an inſtrument to lead himſelf, and others, to the miſpending their precious time; this he concluded to do, when he went home; but delaying to perform this reſolution, as he lay in his bed he felt the fire of God's wrath kindled, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his diſobedience, which induced him, the next day, to break the fiddle in pieces, which, when done his heart rejoiced, and he felt a ſtrength of hope riſing in him, that God would give him farther power over all his vanities: A ſenſe was alſo given him, that if he was faithful to what the Lord would require of him, he ſhould be made an inſtrument in God's hand, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a people to his praiſe, from thoſe very looſe people amongſt whom he reſided, which ſeemed ſtrange to him. But as his heart became daily more and more exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards God, and in giving him thanks, for his mercies, a lively concern and deſire came upon him, that ſinners might be brought, as he had been, to a ſight of the error of their ways. He then found it to be his duty to ſpeak to thoſe ſame people, whom he had led on in folly and vanity, and to direct them to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017472_0008_0FA1212DEF326D90"/>of God; this he at firſt found to be hard work; but being charged by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to be faithful to what was required of him; and made ſenſible that if he was ſo, God would be with him, but that if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, he ſhould be left to himſelf, and fall into a worſe condition than that he was in before, he was enabled to ſpeak to them, though in great fear, and the Lord cauſed his admonition to be well received by his neighbours. And on the next day of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, inſtead of ſpending their time in riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exceſs, as they were uſed to do, ſome of them ſat with him to read the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and confer together upon the things which related to eternity; in which his underſtanding was opened to ſee, that the right worſhip of God was to be performed in ſilence, unleſs when moved by the ſpirit to appear in vocal ſervice, under which proſpect he found himſelf moved to kneel down and pray; and, ſometime after, to exhort his companions, which was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſo much energy and power, that the people were much affected: Thus the Lord maniſeſted his love and power amongſt thoſe people, by this mean inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till by degrees, a religious meeting was gathered to the praiſe of God, whoſe baptizing power was ſenſibly felt amongſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017472_0009_0FA1212EAF93BFA0"/>them; in which ſervice he continued du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole courſe of his life.</p>
            <p>By theſe and many more inſtances which could be mentioned, the goſpel diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is undoubtedly confirmed to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of peculiar love and good will to men, through a communication of the ſpirit of grace, influencing the hearts of thoſe who ſubmit to its operation, whereby the hearts of the faithful being repleniſhed, it abundantly flows out in acts of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſympathy and compaſſion to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-men, and leads not only to pity and commiſerate thoſe who remain in bondage to their corruption, but alſo to overcome the evil they may inflict, with benignity, patience and love.</p>
            <p>When chriſtianity, conſidered in this light, is compared with the pride, the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs and the wrath, ſo predominant in the world, particularly in the indulgence of thoſe luſts, which the apoſtle declares to be the occaſion of war, with all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and corrupting effects, it cannot but ſtrike the conſiderate mind with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and horror.</p>
            <p>Several hiſtorians obſerve, that at the battle of Cunnersdorf, between the Pruſſians and the Muſcovites, in 1759, the carnage was truly horrible, about twenty thouſand Pruſſians lay on the field; the loſs of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017472_0010_0FA1212F70901930"/>Ruſſians, amounted to ten thouſand. At the battle of Zorndorf, the loſs of the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, amounted to ten thouſand dead on the ſpot, and ten thouſand wounded moſt of them mortally. <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the war, from 1756, to 1760, page 314.</note> To think how many of theſe were dragged from their connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and compelled to kill or be killed, ſeparated from a wife, a parent, or child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, who ſtood in need of their affectionate care and aſſiſtance; but more eſpecially to conſider the number, which were ſuddenly cut off from life, and driven into eternity, in the bitterneſs of wrath and revenge or other exceſſes, to which the life of a ſoldier is ſo much expoſed, from any farther pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of anſwering the end of their exiſtence, muſt occaſion very ſolemn reflections to every conſiderate, feeling, mind. And if we turn our eyes from this deplorable ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, towards the many thouſands <note n="†" place="bottom">In ſome caſes were the vanquiſhed retreats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the victor, many thouſands are after battle, left to die in the field.</note> who, after ſuch battles remain alive, in a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition; many ſo ſorely as to be obliged to undergo the painful amputation of their limbs, or perhaps more grievous operation, to ſuffer long under the cure. And yet more piteous is the caſe of thoſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017472_0011_0FA121302F63AB08"/>whoſe wounds, beyond the poſſibility of cure or for want of ſufficient help, die in painful languiſhment. From this view of the dreadful effect of war, there will naturally ariſe a query, in the minds of every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, feeling, heart, why and whence does ſuch ſhocking ſcenes take place amongſt men of humanity and reaſon, to ſay nothing of chriſtianity; a ſcene contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to every idea of that mutual affection and good will, which nature and duty, ſo forcibly calls for, from creatures ſo help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in themſelves, and who ſtand in ſuch need of one another's ſympathy and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, originally formed, by one common father, for the purpoſe of ſerving and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him, through a life of virtue, thankfulneſs and love, which, himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, is beſt manifeſted by mutual endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in patience and love to each other. To theſe obſervations, which will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily occur to thoſe, whoſe ſenſes are not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deafened, or heart quite hardened by the luſt of revenge, the luſt of honour, the deſire of wealth; it is generally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the caſe is grievous indeed, but that there is no other means of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuſtice and oppreſſion from reigning in triumph, but by the means of war. If thoſe who make this anſwer, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to quiet the tumultuous paſſions of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017472_0012_0FA12130EFC4C668"/>nature, ſuffer reaſon and humanity to ſpeak, and only conſider from the idea implanted in us, from our youth, of our Maker's goodneſs, they cannot otherwiſe think, but that if he was properly ſought unto, he would provide different modes of ſettling thoſe differences, which will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſe from the different tempers and intereſt of mankind. He has expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to be a God, hearing prayer, For the oppreſſion of the poor, and for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe ſaith the Lord, Pſalm lxxvi. 9. That he is ſo ready to fulfil the deſire of the honeſt hearted, that even before they call he will anſwer, whilſt they are yet ſpeaking he will hear, Iſa. lxv. 24. And to remove all doubts of every right petition being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; our Saviour brings it to the moſt ſenſible feelings of nature, even to the tender connection of a father, to his child; <q>if a ſon, ſays he, aſk bread of any of you who is a father, will he give him a ſtone; or if he aſk a fiſh, will he give him a ſcorpion; if you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the holy ſpirit, to thoſe that aſk it.</q> Luke xi. 11. But in fact men, who are encouragers of war, either give way to an evil heart of unbelief,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017472_0013_0FA12131B129D0C0"/>or take pleaſure in indulging their wrath, their ſelfiſhneſs and pride, or the more ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous deſire of advancing their fortunes. That wars are mentioned in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have ſubſiſted before the time of our Saviour's appearance upon earth, makes nothing in its favour under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of peace and univerſal love, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we now live, which he came to eſtabliſh. The apoſtle in the deſcription he gives of the occaſion of war, makes no diſtinction between preſent and paſt times, but centers the origin of war wholly in thoſe luſts, which war againſt the ſoul, "ye fight, ye kill, and deſire to have, that ye may ſpend it upon your luſts." Hence there is reaſon to conclude, wars were allowed to the Jews for the ſame reaſon, as our Saviour tells them, Moſes ſuffered them to put away their wives, becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts, and was a violence upon that purity and brotherly love, which ſubſiſted in the beginning. Neither does the force uſed in the ſupport of civil order, to regulate the weak and ill diſpoſed, make any thing in favour of war. Government is the ordinance of God, a compact and agreement of a number of people, mutually to ſupport juſtice and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amongſt themſelves, upon an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that order, reſtraint becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017472_0014_0FA121327005CAF0"/>as mentioned in ſcripture, <q>for the puniſhment of evil doers, and the praiſe of thoſe; that do well;</q> for this purpoſe, <q>that we may lead a peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty,</q> which falls ſolely on the tranſgreſſors, upon the breach of their own agreement; hence civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will always be neceſſary, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the peace and happineſs of mankind. But the caſe is vaſtly different in the proſecution of war, when people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the military ſervice, as a profeſſion, their ideas of right and wrong become, in a great meaſure, vitiated by many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt prejudices and cuſtoms; looking upon war, as the moſt agreeable means of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing themſelves, they often in deſpite to the impreſſions of grace, and the feelings of humanity wiſh for it, and endeavour to promote it. And here the ſeveral innocent and uſeful employments, either of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or mechaniſm, ſo congenial with our health of body and peace of mind, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſlighted or deſpiſed; a vain eſteem for the importance of his ſituation, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally takes poſſeſſion of the mind of the warrior, which cauſes him to behold with undervaluement and ſcorn, every other way of life. That golden rule of doing as we would be done unto, ſo much the glory as it is the happineſs of humanity, is given
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017472_0015_0FA1213330C76570"/>up for a fooliſh idea of human glory; the moſt empty fanthom that ever poſſeſſed the diſtracted mind of man, or ſome other vain or corrupting purſuit, which centers in human life; the calls of humanity and reaſon are, avowedly, no more to regulate our conduct, the maxims generally agreed to, by the military men, muſt ſuperſede all other conſiderations; one of which is, that where a fortified place refuſes to obey the enemies ſummons, and is taken by ſtorm, thoſe within may be put to the ſword, even though the ſoldiers and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were not parties to their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers imprudent reſolution, nevertheleſs they muſt fall victims to this horrible maxim. <note n="*" place="bottom">Several hiſtorians mention the dreadful tragedy which was acted at the city of Magdeburg, by the Auſtrian General Tilly, who having taken it by ſtorm, delivered up the citizens, without diſtinction of age or ſex, to the barbarity and luſt of his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Beſides the general maſſacre, they exhibited ſuch acts of wanton cruelty, as diſgrace human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Three or four hundred were all that were ſaved out of twenty thouſand citizens.</note> Whatever pillage and deſtruction is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted neceſſary, to annoy and diſtreſs the enemy, muſt be put in practice; nor, (ſay they) can any diſtinction be made on theſe occaſions; thoſe who are peaceably and innocently diſpoſed, muſt partake of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017472_0016_0FA12133F024DFF8"/>the ſame fate with the guilty. Neither may the warrior parley with reaſon or humanity, much leſs chriſtianity, in ſtrictly executing the orders of his ſuperior; which he has engaged in all caſes to obey.</p>
            <p>And here a reaſonable query ariſes. What real advantage has been gained from the purſuit of theſe horrid maxims, to thoſe who are principals therein, even when they have obtained their deſire by the addition of ſome territory, to thoſe they held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, perhaps; already larger than they could properly govern; in the proſecution of which ſo vaſt a number of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who might, in the innocent and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful engagements of life, have been happily and profitably employed for themſelves and the advantage of ſociety, have been cut off in their prime. What benefit has been reaped by the ſeveral powers, engaged in the laſt German war, wherein during the ſhort ſpace of only ſix years, from 1756, to 1762, more than twenty battles were fought, two hundred thouſand ſoldiers flain, the ſouls of each of whom, were as valuable in the ſight of God as their own; and this with as little concern, or perhaps leſs concern, than if they were ſo many brute beaſts, in the particular deſcription of which, from the account of the hiſtory of that war, printed in London 1762, we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017472_0017_0FA12134CDF257D0"/>meet with relations of barbarities the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of which, the author ſays, would be ſhocking to humanity; whole diſtricts laid waſte; cities deſtroyed, by bombs and red hot bullets; regiments cut to pieces; a horrid and undiſtinguiſhed carnage in cloſe engagements, by ſword and bayonet, and lanes made through the ranks of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, by the artillery charged with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge ſhot. <note n="*" place="bottom">If perſons who are active in war, particularly thoſe who for gain, or in purſuit of honour, or from ſome other ſelfiſh views, have been inſtrumental in its promotion; if theſe are not hardened beyond reaſon, or the feelings of humanity; the thought of this dreadful carnage, cannot but ſtrike them with amazement and horror. And however whilſt in health and under the prevalency of corrupt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and paſſions, people may make light of ſuch awful ſcenes; yet if not deprived by ſudden death, of the deſirable opportunity of reflection, or beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſtupid perſuaſion of an annihilation; when the awful time of their diſſolution ſhall draw near, and their ſpirits fail under pain or mortal lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhments; and they erpect to meet with thoſe ſouls, they have been inſtrumental to hurry into eternity; the reflection of having in any degree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted this mighty evil, muſt be a cauſe of deep an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and forrow, which will be much augmented in thoſe who, believing the chriſtian religion to be a revelation of the will of God to man, will conſider the different fruits it would produce in thoſe who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to its ſpirit, as mentioned by the apoſtle, even <q>love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, meekneſs, &amp;c.</q> Gal. v. 22. or, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by its wiſdom, which is pure, peaceable, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good works, James iii. 17.
<p>In the courſe of this German war we meet with accounts of a whole regiment, ſome battalions, and in one inſtance, of eight hundred Pandours cut to pieces; now ſimply to picture to ourſelves the horror of ſuch a tranſaction; the confuſion, the carnage, the ſtreaming blood, the cries and ſhrieks of the wounded; by men and horſe, ſtriving with every effort of nature in the utmoſt rage and fury to out do each other in the murder of their fellow-men; in deſpite of the commandment Thou ſhalt not kill; and this towards men whom they have no perſonal enmity againſt nor knowledge of, but that they are of thoſe whom, by every call of nature and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they are required to love, as they love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The imagination of the reader, if not loſt to every ſenſe of reaſon and humanity, muſt ſuggeſt ſuch apprehenſions of the horror as well as wicked neſs and madneſs of ſuch a ſcene, as is beyond the force of expreſſion to remark upon, and which no pretended neceſſity nor uſage can excuſe or paliate.</p>
               </note> Surely the dark cloud of prejudice which prevails in ſupport of war,
<pb n="19"
                   facs="unknown:017472_0018_0FA1213686770B68"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>amongſt, the chriſtian powers will, by the mercy of God, in time, be diſpelled; men will ſee their miſtake and be as much aſtoniſhed at their blindneſs and folly, and look with as much abhorrence at that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which is ſuch an obſtruction to that happineſs which God intends for his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture man, as they are at the recital of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017472_0019_0FA12136F086BAC0"/>folly of our anceſtors, expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſo much labour and ſuffering, in the time of the Croiſades, for the recovery of Jeruſalem from the Turks.</p>
            <p>The ſentiments of that celebrated author A. De Voltaire, upon the ſolemn ſubject of war, is worthy of note. In the firſt vol. of his works, he obſerves "That the primitive chriſtians, without exception, held the ſame ſentiments with relation to war as did the Eſſenees and ſome others; and as the Quakers now do. Tertullien he ſays, ſpeaks with the moſt ſtrength upon theſe legal murders, which our abominable nature has made ſo neceſſary; that there is no law nor uſuage that can juſtify this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal act. In other parts of his works he ſays, It would ſeem that the law of loving our neighbours as ourſelves was made only for the Quakers; and in truth, how can any one preténd that he loves his neighbour as himſelf, when for reward he will ſhoot or ſtab him, and, at the ſame time he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes himſelf to be killed, might it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be truly ſaid, That he hates his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelf. He reproaches the preachers of the time when he wrote, who made ſo many ſermons againſt impurity and other ſmaller evils, whilſt they were ſilent againſt thoſe various kinds of murder, thoſe robberies, thoſe violences and that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017472_0020_0FA12137B08BB048"/>univerſal rage by which, under pretence of neceſſary war, the world is laid waſte. Put together, ſays he, all the vices of all ages and places, and they will not come up to the miſchiefs or enormities of one cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign." He appears to have a proſpect of a time, when as he ſays, "That part of mankind dedicated to heroiſm, will be eſteemed the moſt execrable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive monſters in nature."</p>
            <p>Under theſe afflictive proſpects, we have reaſon to return thanks to the great and good Father of mankind, in that, there is a remnant, under different religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous denominations who remain, unſhaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, that the voice of reaſon, the feelings of humanity, and more eſpecially the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, calls upon them to bear a uniform teſtimony againſt every thing which is inconſiſtent with that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and love, which the goſpel propoſes; and which, in any meaſure tends to impede its eſtabliſhment, agreeable to the antient prophecies. Hence they can in no wiſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that ſpirit which gives life to war in any of its branches, but apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uniformly called to promote to the utmoſt of their power, the welfare of all men, to bleſs thoſe that curſe them, and do good to thoſe that hate them, thus to overcome evil with good, agreeable to the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017472_0021_0FA121386FD66DF0"/>precepts of their meek Saviour, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came by ſuffering, leaving us, ſays the apoſtle an example that we ſhould follow his footſteps. Theſe are perſuaded that the great and good Father of mankind, will preſerve and protect thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the beſt of their power, to obey and love him, ſo that what ever may befal them, in conſequence of their obedience, of their dwelling in the patience, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that love and forbearance to their fellow-men which he requires, however threatning of depriving them of what men ſo much eſteem to be happineſs, yet he will in ſuch ſort protect them that every thing will work for their good, and will afford them ſuch a degree of inward peace and conſolation, ſuch a frame of ſubmiſſion to the will of their creator, ſuch a fund of compaſſion and love to their fellow-men, as will give them a happineſs which paſſeth the human underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And however worldly men, or ſhort-ſighted politicians, may conclude, that no other means but that of war can be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued to protect their reſpective countries from oppreſſion; yet inſtances are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of the bleſſing which has attended upon contrary meaſures. Pennſylvania furniſhes an inſtance how far the divine bleſſing may co-operate with the ſpirit of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017472_0022_0FA12139315A1820"/>peace and good order; ſo long as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment continued chiefly in the hands of a people principled againſt war, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their expoſed ſituation, the great number of Indians within their borders, and the ſeveral warlike nations which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded them, they experienced the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting hand of providence, and enjoyed an uninterrupted tranquillity for more than ſixty years; whilſt Canada, and moſt of the other colonies who purſued different meaſures, ſuffered dreadfully from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian neighbours. Ancient hiſtory alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a ſtriking example of the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which a ſpirit influenced by the fear of God, producing moderation and univerſal benevolence will produce. Numa Pompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, the ſecond king of Rome, is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtance of this intereſting truth, born ſome hundred years before the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Era, he appears to have been in a ſpecial manner one of thoſe wiſe heathens, mentioned by the apoſtle, who, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to that inward principle of divine intelligence, which all men are favoured with, doing by nature the things contained in the law, was a law unto themſelves; which ſhewed the works of the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their hearts. Some of theſe were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs favoured, as our Saviour declares Abraham was, with a ſight of his day, a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017472_0023_0FA12139F096C438"/>day of good tidings to the meek, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial peace and good will to men. Numa's natural diſpoſition for moderation, probity, and juſtice, had been greatly ſtrengthened by a proper education. Inured betimes to induſtry and labour, and extremely averſe to ambition and violence, he infuſed the ſame ſentiments in his ſubjects. Numa, ſays Rollin, had a great veneration for the Deity, whoſe nature and perfections were his ſtudy. He deemed true goodneſs to conſiſt in ruling the paſſions, and keeping them in ſubjection to reaſon. Luxury and magnificence, were unknown to him. He plainly ſaw that to accompliſh his deſign, and infuſe the ſame ſentiments into the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, his firſt care muſt be to ſoften and tame their minds, in order to extinguiſh by degrees, that inclination for war, which Romulus had inſpired them with; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly turn them to ſuch pacific, gentle, and profitable exerciſes, as would cauſe them to forget and loſe this firſt inclination. The remembrance of the Deity, whom Numa endeavoured ſhould be always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in their thoughts; <note n="*" place="bottom">Numa laboured to bring the Romans from that wretched inclination, ſo prevalent with mankind, of corpolizing the divinity. Hence, Plutarch obſerves, that he forbade to repreſent God in the form of man or beaſt; no painted or graven image was admitted amongſt them; thinking it great impiety to repreſent the moſt excellent Being, by things ſo baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. He taught them, that there was no poſſible acceſs to the Diety, but by the minds being raiſed and elevated by divine contemplation. That he ſeemed to favour the Pythagorien doctrine of ſilence, in a familiar and conſtant attendance on the Deity, who was not ſubject to ſenſe or capable of paſſion, but inviſible, incorruptible and to be comprehended only by the mind. Hence Numa, before his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the throne, ſpent much of his time in unfrequented groves and fields, conſecrated to the Diety, not out of melancholy, or diſturbance of mind; but becauſe he had experienced a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime converſation, by which he became ſkilled in matters of a divine nature. Plutarch adds, That it was not ſtrange that God ſhould be pleaſed to dwell with thoſe who were more eminently virtuous. That many in paſt ages had been thus favoured with the love of God.</note> the induſtry and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017472_0024_0FA1213AAF6890F0"/>moderation, he had inſtilled in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, cauſed that warlike people to lay down their arms, and employ themſelves, throughout his whole reign, which laſted forty three years, in conciliating the favour of heaven, cultivating their land, and the other innocent employments of a country life; which proved an excellent ſchool of ſimplicity, frugality and other moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. "He dedicated himſelf intirely to the ſervice of the citizens and ſtrangers, to whom he was counſellor, arbiter and judge. All, ſays Livy, formed their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017472_0025_0FA1213B6F2F48E0"/>by the King's, whom they took for their ſole pattern." Hence the nations about him who before had conſidered Rome more like a camp than a city, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a reverence for them, that they would have thought it a ſort of impiety to have attacked a people, wholly intent upon ſerving God, and making men happy.</p>
            <p>A wonderful change of manners alſo prevailed in the neighbouring cities; the people viſited one another without fear, uniting in religious ſervices, and rejoicing together, as if Numa's wiſdom had been a plentiful fountain, from whence the ſtreams of virtue and juſtice had flowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minds of the people; inſtead of a martial ardor, an eager deſire to live in peace, to cultivate their lands, and bring up their children in the ſame, infuſed into their hearts the ſame tranquillity which reigned in his own.</p>
            <p>The nations around, were ſo far from taking advantage of his pacific temper, to make war upon him, that in their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they choſe the Romans for umpires, and referred themſelves entirely to Numa's deciſions; a glory founded on the eſteem and gratitude of the nations, who paid a public homage to the wiſdom, juſtice and ſincerity of a prince, void of ſelf intereſt and ſolely intent on the happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017472_0026_0FA1213C2F8E31C0"/>Neither did any rebellion appear during the long reign of Numa, whether, ſays Plutarch, reverence for his eminent virtue, or fear of the Diety, who ſo viſibly protected him, vice was diſarmed; or whether, by a particular providence, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was pleaſed to preſerve this happy reign from whatever might ſully its glory, or diſturb its peace; it has ſerved for a proof of what God, in his mercy and love can do, in rendering virtue triumphant over vice. Numa ended his life in the gentleſt manner, by nature's being quite exhauſted, in the 83d year of his age, and 43d of his reign.</p>
            <p>If Plutarch, though an heathen, under the prevailing prejudices in favour of war, could manifeſt ſo much eſteem for the maintainance of peace, as freely to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the diſplay of a particular providence in Numa's protection, from the violence of unreaſonable men, as a ſpecial mark of the divine approbation on his diligent labour, for the eſtabliſhment of virtue in a people, before ſo daring in rapine and murder, how much more have chriſtians reaſon to rely upon the ſame divine protection, in the maintenance of that love to their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and patient ſuffering of injuries, ſo ſtrongly enjoined by the precepts and practice of their great exampler Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:017472_0027_0FA1213CEFD01CC0"/>
And certainly men thus peaceably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, have great reaſon to expect to be protected by the rulers wherever their lot may be caſt, as theſe rulers cannot but be ſenſible of the advantages which ariſes from the virtuous example of perſons ſo diſpoſed, in oppoſition to thoſe vices which war na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally produces. For, notwithſtanding ſome chriſtians look upon defenſive war as lawful; yet ſober men, of every religious denomination agree, that it is a great evil and much to be depricated; hence great tenderneſs is due to thoſe who, in ſincerity of heart, apprehend themſelves called out of the ſpirit of war, to the promotion of harmony and love.</p>
            <p>We alſo find Cardinal Fleury, long Prime Miniſter of France, under the late King, to have been a perſon of much mildneſs and moderation, and a great lover of peace. He had ſeen the dreadful miſery occaſioned by the proſecution of a long war, during great part of the reign of Lewis the 14th, which ſeveral writers of that reign ſay, gave the old king ſo much concern, that, upon his death-bed, he exhorted his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, the late king, to uſe meaſures dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe he had purſued. The good diſpoſition which prevailed in this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, in favour of pacific meaſures is thought to have, in a great degree, been
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017472_0028_0FA1213DB0AD1EE0"/>the occaſion of the long peace, which ſo generally prevailed amongſt the different powers of Europe, from the peace of Utrecht, in 1712, to the year 1733. If the influence of one miniſter of ſtate can have ſo good an effect, how happy would it be for mankind, and how happy for themſelves, if the preſent rulers of the different kingdoms, would ſo far yield to that good principle, which every man in his cool moments, is, in ſome degree fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with, as to feel for the miſeries of mankind, and become advocates on behalf of the Prince of Peace, and thus promote as much as may be in their power the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of that peace and love, which not only the prophets, but alſo the wiſe men of all ages have had a proſpect of, a time of love and good will to men; when righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and peace ſhall univerſally prevail.</p>
            <p>The prejudice that ſo ſtrongly prevails in the young nobility of moſt European Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, in favour of war, which they are taught to look upon as the only buſineſs worthy their attention, very much prevents the eſtabliſhment of that peace and love amongſt men, ſo much the deſire of the well minded. Moſt of thoſe who do not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the family eſtate, and indeed moſt who do, enter into the military life; hence the diſorderly paſſions of the human mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017472_0029_0FA1213E6FC4A340"/>of being molihed by the ſoft endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of locial life, are rather increaſed, through the violent and cruel meaſures they are obliged to purſue. The culture of their eſtates, which might afford them ſo much benefit and pleaſure, is abandoned to the attention and weak efforts of a poor, often exhauſted and oppreſſed race of peaſants, who have neither ability, nor courage to do any thing to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And, indeed, it muſt be allowed, that thoſe evil luſts and paſſions, which are the remote cauſes of war, are much ſupported and encreaſed by that romantic and falſe idea of the honour, reſulting from a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, which induces ſo many of the principal men, of moſt chriſtian States, to ſpend the prime of their days in that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whence, from a ſtrange infatuation, it is eſteemed the greateſt honour to riſque the putting a period to their exiſtence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have anſwered the purpoſe for which their life was given, even the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the corrupt propenſities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo as to bring them under the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of reaſon and religion. Wonderful inſtance of the corruption of the human heart; that men will voluntarily, and even with pleaſure, encounter ſo much hardſhip and labour, in the proſecution of war, which upon the leaſt reflection, they muſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017472_0030_0FA1213F2EC8CE80"/>be ſenſible, ſo greatly tends to corrupt the morals, and ſo miſerably deſtroys the lives of their fellow men. The weight of this conſideration is greatly encreaſed from a thought, how, trivial and often unjuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have been the occaſions of ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wars. The laſt German war, wherein as has been mentioned, more than twenty battles were fought, two hundred thouſand ſoldiers were killed, cities and extent of countries laid waſte, beſides the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deaths, diſtreſs and deſtruction, which on theſe dreadful occaſions, on various ways attend, was chiefly conſequent of the queſtion, Whether the King of Pruſſia or the Queen of Hungary, ſhould govern Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia, founded upon ſome ancient contract between their anceſtors, in which it is doubtful, the people of that province were never conſulted <note n="*" place="bottom">After ſix years war, a peace was concluded in 1763, when it was agreed by the contending pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>"That all things are to remain in the ſame ſtate in which they were at the beginning of the war."</hi> What a dreadful conſideration, that to anſwer the politicks of a few, ſuch a ſacrifice of men ſhould be made to the Prince of darkneſs. And what muſt all thoſe think, if they dare to think at all, who from vain or ſelfiſh ends have given it ſupport or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, particularly when on a bed of ſickneſs and of pain, they will have to reflect on thoſe numbers of ſouls, which they have been inſtrumental, to bring to ſuch a miſerable and untimely end. Under theſe awful conſiderations can it be thought ſtrange that ſome who behold war in this fearful light, and are perſuaded that ſuch doings are utterly abhorent in the ſight of the great and good Father of mankind, will encounter all difficulties rather than take any part in it.</note> How long will men thus ſuffer the enemy of their happineſs to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017472_0031_0FA12140E52FDDF0"/>them? How long will it be ere they reto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſenſes, and ſuffer the voice of reaſon and humanity to prevail in their councils and conduct.</p>
            <p>If the young nobility and gentry were encouraged by their elders, whom it might be expected age, and experience had given a better eſtimation of the nature and value of things, to employ themſelves in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of their eſtates; giving proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and aſſiſtance to their tenants and poor neighbours; promoting uſeful arts and manufactures; the proper educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the children of the poor, and in every other reſpect, as the truly great and happy Numa did, earneſtly labour to make the people around them virtuous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, they would ſurely render better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to their country, and ſoon find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves poſſeſſed of a ſubſtantial happineſs, unknown to thoſe who purſue different meaſures. How different, on a dying bed, muſt the ſenſation of theſe who have thus
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017472_0032_0FA12141705788B8"/>laboured to procure the improvement and happineſs of mankind be, to that of thoſe who have lived to themſelves, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of thoſe vain honours and pleaſures, which the thoughtleſs part of mankind ſo carneſtly ſeek for, in camps and courts.</p>
            <p>However mankind when in health and ſtrength, generally ſuffer themſelves to be influenced by ſelfiſh principles of pride, wrath, &amp;c. yet, when humbled by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death, we often find them bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a uniform teſtimony, to thoſe humbling truths of the goſpel, which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated in their lives. The two noted miniſters of ſtate of France, Cardinal Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu and Mazarine, appear to have been of this number. The firſt, confeſſed to Peter Dumoulin, the famous proteſtant, that being forced upon many irregularities, by that, which they call reaſons of ſtate, he could not tell how to ſatisfy his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for ſeveral things, and therefore had many temptations to doubt and diſbelieve a God, another world, and the immortality of the ſoul, and thereby to relieve his mind from any diſquiet, but in vain: So ſtrong, he ſaid, was the notion of God on his ſoul, ſo clear the impreſſion of him, upon the frame of the world, ſo unanimous the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of mankind, ſo powerful the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own conſcience, that he could
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017472_0033_0FA1214230134428"/>but <hi>"Taſte the power of the world to come"</hi> and ſo live as one that muſt die, and ſo die as one that muſt live forever. And being aſked one day, why he was ſo ſad; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, The ſoul is a ſerious thing; it muſt be either ſad here for a moment, or ſad forever.</p>
            <p>Cardinal Mazarine, reputed the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt ſtateſman of his time, and who gave great proofs of it in the ſucceſſes of the French crown, under his miniſtry: His aim was the grandeur of the world, to which he made all other conſiderations ſubmit. But, poor man; he was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind a little before his death: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awakened by the ſmart laſhes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which repreſented his ſoul's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition very diſmal, with aſtoniſhment and tears he cried out. "O my poor ſoul, what will become of thee: Whither wilt thou go" And ſpeaking one day to the Queen Mother of France, he ſaid "Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, your favours have undone me: Were I to live again, I would be a Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, rather than a Courtier."</p>
            <p>Charles Vth. Emperor of Germany, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many pitched battles, many triumphs and kingdoms conquered, &amp;c. reſigned up all his pomp, and betook himſelf to retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; leaving this teſtimony behind him, concerning the life he ſpent in the honours
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017472_0034_0FA12142F18E14B8"/>and pleaſures of the world, and in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time of his retreat from them all, That the ſincere ſtudy, profeſſion and practice of the chriſtian religion, had in it joys and ſweetneſs, which courts were ſtrangers to.</p>
            <p>Philip III. King of Spain, his grand-ſon, reflecting upon the life he had led in the world, cried out upon his death-bed. Ah! How happy were I, had I ſpent theſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three years, that I have held my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in a retirement—My concern is for my ſoul, not my body.</p>
            <p>Count Oxenſtiern, Chancellor of Sweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, a perſon of the firſt quality, ſtation and ability. After all his knowledge and honour, being viſited in his retreat from public bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs by Bulſtrod Whitlock, Ambaſſador from England, in the concluſion of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he ſaid to the Ambaſſador, I have ſeen much, and enjoyed much of this world, but I never knew how to live till now, I thank my good God that has given me time to know him, and to know myſelf. All the comfort I have, and all the comfort I take, and which is more than the whole world can give, is feeling the good ſpirit of God in my heart, and reading in this good book (holding up the bible) which came from it. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addreſſed himſelf thus, to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, You are now in the prime of your age and vigour, and in great favour and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017472_0035_0FA12143B06538A0"/>buſineſs; but this will all leave you, and you will one day, better underſtand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh what I ſay to you; and then you will find that there is more wiſdom, truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and pleaſure, in retiring your heart from the world, to the good ſpirit of God, and in reading the bible, than in all the courts and fayours of princes. Bulſtrod Whitlock, himſelf, gives a noble teſtimony to the power of religion. "I ever have thought, ſaid he, there has been one true religion in the world, and that is, the work of the ſpirit of God in the heart of ſouls of men. There has been indeed divers forms and ſhapes of things, through the many diſpenſations of God to men, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his own wiſe ends, in reference to the low and uncertain ſtate of man in the world; but the old world had the ſpirit of God, for it ſtrove with them, and the new world has had the ſpirit of God, both Jews and Gentiles; and it ſtrives with all; and they that have been led by it, have been the good people in every diſpenſation of God to the world. And I myſelf muſt ſay, I have felt it, from a child, to convince me of my evil and vanity, and it has often given me a true meaſure of this poor world, and ſome taſte of divine things; and it is my grief I did not more early apply my ſoul to it. Since my retirement from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017472_0036_0FA1214470AC1158"/>neſs and hurries of the world, I have felt ſomething of the work and comſort of it, that it is both ready and able to inſtruct, and lead, and preſerve thoſe that will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ſincerely hearken to it. So that my religion is <hi>the good ſpirit of God in my heart;</hi> I mean, what that has wrought in me, and for me.</p>
            <p>Secretary Walſingham, a man of great note, in Queen Elizabeth's time, towards the concluſion of his days, in a letter to his fellow-ſecretary Burleigh, then Lord Treaſurer of England, writes thus. We have lived enough to our country, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, our Sovereign. It is high time we begin to live to ourſelves, and to our God. Which giving occaſion for ſome court-droll to viſit, and try to divert him, "Ah! ſaid he, while we laugh, all things are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious round about us; God is ſerious, when he preſerveth us, and hath patience to wards us; Chriſt is ſerious, when he dieth for us; the Holy Ghoſt is ſerious, when he ſtriveth with us; the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſerious, in ſerving God and us; they are ſerious in Hell and in Heaven; and, ſhall a man that hath one foot in the grave, jeſt and laugh."—O that our ſtatesmen, would ſerjouſly and deeply weigh the conviction, advice, and concluſion of this great man.</p>

Sir John Maſon, who though but 63 years of age, at his death, yet lived and flouriſhed in the reign of four princes, viz. Henry 8th Edward 6th Queen Mary, and Elizabeth, and was Privy-counſellor to them all, and an eye witneſs of the various revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and viciſſitudes of thoſe times. Towards his latter end, being on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, he called his clerk and ſteward, and ſpoke thus to them. "Lo here have I lived to ſee five princes, and have been Privy-counſellor, to four of them, I have ſeen the moſt remarkable obſervables in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, and have been preſent at moſt tranſactions for thirty years together, and I have learned this, after ſo many years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that ſeriouſneſs is the greateſt wiſdom, temperance the beſt phyſic, and a good conſcience the beſt eſtate; and were I to live again, I would change the court for a cloiſter, my Privy-counſellor's buſtle for an hermit's retirement, and the whole life I lived in the palace for an hour's enjoyment of God in the chapel; all things elſe forſake me, beſides my God, my duty, and my prayers.</p>

            <p>WITH reſpect to your natural gifts or abilities, remember, Eirſt, That you have nothing, that you have not received. Secondly, That you poſſeſs them not as a Lord over them, but as an accomptant for them. Thirdly, If you employ them to ſerve this world, or your own worldly delight, which the prince of this world will ſeek to entertain you with, it is ingratitude, it is injuſtice, yea, it is perfidious treachery: For what would you think of ſuch a ſervant of yours, who ſhould convert your goods, committed to his charge, to the advantage or ſervice of your greateſt enemy; and what do you leſs than this with God, ſince you have all from him, and know that the world, and the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017472_0039_0FA12147B205E0B0"/>princes thereof, are at a continual enmity with him: And therefore, if ever the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of your trueſt friend ſhall be heared by you, or if your country, which you may ſerve in ſo great and many things be dear unto you; if your God, who you muſt (if you deal truly with yourſelf) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be powerſul over all, and juſt in all, be feared by you; yea, if you be dear unto yourſelf, and prefer an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs before a pleaſant dream, which you muſt ſhortly awake out of, and then repent in the bitterneſs of your ſoul; if any of theſe things be regarded by you, then, I ſay, call yourſelves to account for what is paſt; cancel all the leagues you have made without the warrant of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſcience; make a regular covenant with your God, to ſerve him with all your natural and ſpiritual, inward and outward gifts and abilities, and then he who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and cannot lie, hath promiſed to honour thoſe, who honour him; he will give you that inward peace of foul, and true joy of heart, which till you have, you will never reſt; and which when you have, you ſhall never be ſhaken; and which you can never attain to any other way, &amp;c.</p>

And to one that admired his great induſtry, he returned this by way of complaint, Ah! I have conſumed my life in laboriouſly doing nothing. And to another, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of his wiſdom and learning, what courſe to take he ſolemnly anſwered, Be ſerious.

            </p>
            <p>MY DEAR BROTHER,</p>
            <p>THERE is but one thing, that deſerves our higheſt care, and moſt ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and that is, that we may anſwer the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017472_0043_0FA1214A709B9A80"/>great end for which we were made, viz. to glorify that God, who has given us our beings, and all our comforts, and to do all the good we poſſibly can to our fellow-men, while we live in the world: And verily life is not worth the having, if it be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for this noble end and purpoſe, yet, alas, how little is this thought of among mankind; moſt men ſeem to live to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without much regard to the glory of God, or the good of their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; they earneſtly deſire, and eagerly purſue after the riches, the honours, and the pleaſures of life, as if they really ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that wealth, or greatneſs, or merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could make their immortal ſouls happy. But, alas, what ſalſe and deluſive dreams are theſe, and how miſerable will thoſe ere long be, who are not awaked out of them; to ſee, that all their happineſs conſiſts in living to God, and becoming holy, as he is holy. Oh! may you never fall into the tempers and vanities, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality and folly of the preſent world, you are, by divine providence, leſt as it were alone, in a wide world to act for yourſelf; Be ſure then to remember, it is a world of temptation. You have no earthly parents, to be the means of forming your youth to piety and virtue; let this excite you with greater diligence and fervency to look up
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:017472_0044_0FA1214B2FE959B0"/>to the Father of mercies, for grace and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt all the vanities of the world. Daily endeavour to practiſe a life of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſtrict ſobriety—Think of the life of Chriſt; and when you can find that he was pleaſed with jeſting and vain merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then you may indulge it in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Be careful to make a good improvement of precious time. When you ceaſe from labour, fill up your time in reading, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and prayer. And, while your hands are labouring, let your heart be employed as much as poſſible in divine thoughts. Never expect happineſs from the world. If you hope for happineſs in the world, hope for it from God, and not from the world. Don't think you ſhall be more happy, if you live to ſuch or ſuch a ſtate of life, if you live to be for yourſelf, to be ſettled in the world, or if you ſhould gain an eſtate in it; but look upon it, that you ſhall then be happy, when you can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employed for God, and not for yourſelf; and deſire to live in this world, only to do and ſuffer what God allots you. When you can be of the ſpirit and temper of Angels, who are willing to come down into this lower world, to perform what God commands them, tho' their deſires are heavenly, and not in the leaſt ſet on earthly
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:017472_0045_0FA1214BEF7F5CE0"/>things, then you will be of that temper, you ought to have, Col. iii. 2. Never think you can live to God, by your own power or ſtrength; but always look to, and rely on him for aſſiſtance, yea, for all ſtrength and grace. There is no greater truth than this, that we cannot do any thing of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Yet nothing but our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can effectually teach it to us. Indeed, we are a long time in learning that all our ſtrength and ſalvation is in God.</p>
            <p>To A SPECIAL FRIEND.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY the greateſt, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt pleaſure of intelligent creatures, muſt reſult from their acquaintance with the bleſſed God, and with their own ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and immortal ſouls. And Oh! how divinely ſweet and entertaining it is to look into our own ſouls, when we can find all our powers and paſſions, united and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in purſuit after God. Verily, there are no hours paſs away with ſo much divine pleaſure, as thoſe that are ſpent in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and our own hearts. Oh! how ſweet is a ſpirit of devotion, a ſpirit of ſeriouſneſs and divine ſolemnity, a ſpirit of goſpel ſimplicity, love, and tenderneſs. Surely this is a pious temper worthy the higheſt ambition, and cloſeſt purſuit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent creatures, and holy chriſtians.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:017472_0046_0FA1214CF3B06C00"/>Vaſtly ſuperior is the pleaſure, peace, and ſatisfaction derived from this divine frame, to that which we (alas) ſometimes purſue in things impertinent and trifling. Our own bitter experience teaches us, that in the midſt of ſuch laughter the heart is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and there is no true ſatisfaction but in God.</p>
            <p>MY DEAR BROTHER,</p>
            <p>IT is from the ſides of eternity I now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs you. I am heartily ſorry that I have ſo little ſtrength to write, what I long ſo much to communicate to you. But let me tell you, my brother, eternity is another thing, than we ordinarily take it to be, in a healthful ſtate. Oh! how vaſt and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs! Oh! how fix'd and unalterable, Oh! of what inſinite importance is it, that we be prepared for eternity; I have been juſt a dying now for more than a week; and all around me have thought me ſo: But in this time, I have had clear views of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; have ſeen the bleſſedneſs of the godly in ſome meaſure, and have longed to ſhare their happy ſtate; as well as been comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſatisſied, that, thro' grace, I ſhall do ſo! But, Oh! what anguiſh is raiſed in my mind, to think of an eternity for thoſe who are Chriſtleſs, for thoſe who are miſtaken, and who bring their falſe hopes to the grave
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:017472_0047_0FA1214EAE7ED500"/>with them: The ſight was ſo dreadful, I could by no means bear it. Oh! me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, that I could now ſee my friends, that I might warn them to ſee to it, that they lay their foundation for eternity ſure. Oh! my brother, let me then beſeech you, now to examine, whether you are indeed a new creature? Whether you have ever acted above ſelf? Whether the glory of God has ever been the ſweeteſt, higheſt concern with you—whether God has been your portion, and a holy conformity to him, your chief delight? If you cannot anſwer poſitively, conſider ſeriouſly the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent breathings of your ſoul, But don't, however, put yourſelf off with a ſlight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. If you have reaſon to think you are graceleſs, Oh! give yourſelf and the throne of grace no reſt, till God ariſe and ſave. But if the caſe ſhould be otherwiſe, bleſs God for his grace, and preſs after holineſs.</p>
            <p>And now, I ſhall conclude with the teſtimony of the pious Biſhop Taylor, Chaplain to King Charles, the Iſt. with reſpect to war. " As contrary as cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to mercy, tyranny to charity, ſo is war and bloodſhed, to the meekneſs and gentleneſs of the chriſtian religion I had often thought ſays he, of the prophecy. <hi>That in the goſpel our ſwords ſhould be turned into plow-ſhares, and our ſpears into pruning books.</hi> I knew that no tittle ſpoken by God's ſpirit, could return unperformed. and ineffectual; and I was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ſuch was the excellency of Chriſt's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that if men would obey it, chriſtians ſhould never war one againſt another."</p>
