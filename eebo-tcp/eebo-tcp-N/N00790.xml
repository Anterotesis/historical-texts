            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Selling OF JOSEPH A Memorial.</head>
            <p>FOR <hi>AS MUCH as Liberty is in real value next unto</hi> Life: <hi>None ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon most mature Consideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Numerousness of Slaves at this day in the Province, and the Uneasiness of them under their Slavery, hath put many upon thinking whether the Foundation of it be firmly and well laid; so as to sustain the Vast Weight that is buuilt upon it. It is most ceertain that all Men, as they are the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> are and have equal Right unto Liberty, and all other outward Comforts of Life. <hi>GOD hath given the Earth</hi> [with all its Commodities] <hi>onto the Sons of</hi> Adam, <hi>Psal</hi> 115. 16. <hi>And <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> made of One Blood, all Nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> determined the Times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation: That they should seek the Lord. Forasmuch then as we are the Offspring of GOD</hi>  
               <hi>Act</hi> 17.26,27,29. Now although the Title given by the last ADAM doth infinitely better Mens Estates, respecting GOD and themselves; and grants them a most beneficial and inviolable Lease under the Broad Seal of Heaven, who were before only Tenants at Will; Yet through the Indulgence of GOD to our First Parents after the Fall, the outward Estate of all and every of their Children, remains the same, as to one another. So that Originally, and Naturally, there is no such thing as Slavery. <hi>Joseph</hi> was rightfully no more a Slave to his Brethren than they were to him: and they had no more Authority to <hi>Sell</hi> him, than they had to Slay him. And if <hi>they</hi> had nothing to do to sell him to the Ishmaelites bargaining with them, and paying down Twenty pieces of Silver, could not make a title. Neither could Potiphar have any better Interest in him than the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> had. <hi>Gen</hi>37. 20, 27, 28 For he that shall in this case plead <hi>Alteration of Property,</hi> seems to have forfeited a great part of his own claim to Humanity. <hi>There is</hi> no proportion between Twenty Pieces of Silver, and LIBERTY. The Commodity it self is the Claimer. If <hi>Arabian</hi> Gold be imported in any quantities, most are afraid to meddle with it, though they might have it at easy rates; lest if it should have been wrongfully taken from the Owners, It should kindle a fire to the Consumption of their whole Estate. 'Tis pity there should be more Caution used in buying a Horse, or a little lifeless dust, than there is in purchasing Men and Women: Whenas they are the Offspring of GOD, and their Liberty is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auro pretiosior Omni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And seeing GOD hath said, <hi>He that Stealeth a Man and Selleth him, or if he be found in his band, he shall surely be put to Death.</hi> Exod. 21. 16. This Law being of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Equity, wherein Man Stealing is ranked amongst the most atrocious of Capital Crimes: What louder cry can there be made of that Celebrated Warning,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caveat Emptor!</hi>
            </p>

And all things considered, it would conduce more to the Welfare of the Province, to have White Servants for a Term of Years, than to have Slaves for Life. Few can endure to hear of a Negro's being made free; and indeed they can seldom use their freedom well; yet their continual aspring after their forbidden Liberty, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them Unwilling Servants. And there is such a disparity in their Conditions, Colour &amp; Hair that they can never embody with us, and grow up into orderly Families, to the Peopling of the Land: but still remain in our Body Politick as a kind of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasat Blood. As many Negro men as there are among us, so many empty places there are in our Train Bands, and the places taken up of Man that might make Husbands for our Daughters. And the Sons and Daughters of <hi>New England</hi> would become more like <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> if this Slavery were thrust quite out of doors. Moreover it is too well known what Temptations Masters are under, to connive at the Fornication of their Slaves; lest they should be obliged to find them Wives, or pay their Fines. <hi>It</hi> seems to be practically pleaded that they might be Lawless; 'tis thought much of, that the Law should have Satisfaction for their Thefts, and other Immoralities; by which means, <hi>Holiness to the Lord,</hi> is more rarely engraved upon this sort of Servitude. It is likewise most lamentable to think, how in taking Negros out of <hi>Africa,</hi> and Selling of them here, That which GOD ha's joyned together men do boldly rend asunder; Men from their Country, Husbands from their Wives, Parents from their Children. How horrible is the Uncleanness, Mortality, if not Murder, that the Ships are guilty of that bring great Crouds of these miserable Men, and Women. Methinks, when we are bemoaning the barbarous Usage of our Friends and Kinsfolk in <hi>Africa</hi> it might not be unseasonable to enquire whether we are not culpable in forcing the <hi>Africans</hi> to become Slaves amongst our selves. And it may be a question whether all the Benefit received by <hi>Negro</hi> Slaves, will balance the Accompt of Cash laid out upon them; and for the Redemption of our own enslaved Friends out of <hi>Africa.</hi> Besides all the Persons and Estates that have perished there.</p>
