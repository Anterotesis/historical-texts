            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDS AND COUNTRYMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THREE years have now passed away, since the commencement of the present war. A war without parellel in the annals of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It hath displayed a spectacle, the most solemn that can possibly be exhibited. On one side, we behold fraud and violence labouring in the service of despotism; on the other, virtue and fortitude supporting and establishing the rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature.</p>
            <p>You cannot but remember how reluctantly we were dragged into this arduous contest; and how repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, with the earnestness of humble intreaty, we supplicated a redress of our grievances from him who ought to have been the father of his people. In vain did we implore his protection: In vain appeal to the justice, the generosity, of Englishmen—of men, who had been the guardians, the assertors and vindicators of liberty, thro' a succession of ages: Men, who, with their swords, had established the firm barrier of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and cemented it with the blood of heroes. Every effort was vain. For, even whilst we were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated at the foot of the throne, that fatal blow was struck, which hath separated us for ever. Thus spurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, contemned and insulted—thus driven by our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into measures, which our souls abhorred—we made a solemn appeal to the tribunal of unerring wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and justice. To that Almighty Ruler of Princes, whose kingdom is over all.</p>
            <p>WE were then quite defenceless. Without arms, without ammunition, without cloathing, without ships, without money, without officers skilled in war; with no other reliance but the bravery of our people, and the justice of our cause. We had to contend with a nation great in arts and in arms, whose fleets covered the ocean, whose banners had waved in triumph thro' every quarter of the globe. However unequal this contest our weakness was still farther increased by the enemies which America had nourished in her bosom. Thus exposed, on the one hand, to external force and internal divisions; on the other, to be compelled to drink of the bitter cup of slavery, and to go sorrowing all our lives long; in this sad alternative, we chose the former. To this alternative we were reduced by men, who, had they been animated by one spark of generosity, would have disdained to take such mean advantage of our situation; or, had they paid the least regard to the rules of justice, would have consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with abhorrence, a proposition to injure those, who had faithfully fought their battles, and industriously contributed to rear the edifice of their glory.</p>
            <p>But, however great the injustice of our foes, in commencing this war, it is by no means equal to the cruelty with which they have conducted it. The course of their armies is marked by rapine and devast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Thousands without distinction of age or sex, have been driven from their peaceful abodes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the rigours of inclement seasons; and the face of Heaven hath been insulted by the wanton con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of defenceless towns. Their victories have been followed by the cool murder of men, no longer able to resist; and those who escaped from the first act of carnage, have been exposed, by cold, hunger and nakedness, to wear out a miserable existence in the tedious hours of confinement, or to become the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers of their countrymen, of their friends, perhaps, dreadful idea! of their parents or children. Nor was this the outrageous barbarity of an individual, but a system of deliberate malice, stamped with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the British legislature, and sanctioned with all the formalities of law. Nay, determined to dissolve the closest bonds of society, they have stimulated ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to slay their masters, in the peaceful hour of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic security. And, as if all this were insufficient to slake their thirst of blood, the blood of brothers, of unoffended brothers, they have excited the Indians against us; and a General, who <hi>calls</hi> himself a<hi>chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> a follower of the merciful Jesus, hath dared to proclaim to all the world his intention of letting loose against us whole hosts of savages, whose rule of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is promiscuous carnage, who rejoice to murder the infant smiling in its mother's arms, to inflict on their prisoners the most excruciating torments, and exhibit scenes of horror from which nature recoils.</p>
            <p>WERE it possible, they would have added to this terrible system, for they have offered the inhabitants of those States to be exported by their merchants, to the sickly, baneful climes of India, there to perish. An offer not accepted of, merely from the impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of carrying it into execution.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHITANDING these great provocations, we have treated such of them as fell into our hands, with tenderness, and studiously endeavoured to alleviate the afflictions of their captivity. This conduct we have pursued so far, as to be by them stigmatized with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice, and by our friends with folly. But our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence was not upon man. It was upon Him, who hath commanded us to love our enemies, and to render good for evil. And what can be more wonderful then the manner of our deliverances? How often have we been reduced to distress, and yet been raised up? When the means to prosecute the war have been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, have not our foes themselves been rendered instrumental in provided them? This hath been done in such a variety of instances, so peculiarly marked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most by the direct interposition of Providence, that not to feel and acknowledge his protection, would be the heighth of impious ingratitude.</p>
            <p>AT length that God of battles, in whom was our trust, hath conducted us thro' the paths of danger and distress, to the thresholds of security. It hath now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come morally certain, that, if we have courage to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe, we shall establish our liberties and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—The haughty Prince, who spurned us from his feet with contumely and disdain,—and the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which proscribed us, now descend to offer terms of accommodation. Whilst in the full career of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, they pulled off the mark, and avowed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended despotism. But, having lavished in vain the blood and treasure of their subjects, in pursuit of this execrable purpose, they now endeavour to ensnare us with the insidious offers of peace. They would seduce you into a dependence, which necessarily, inevitably leads to the most humiliating slavery. And do they believe that you will accept these fatal terms? Because you have suffered the distresses of war, do they suppose that you will basely lick the dust before the feet of your destroyers? Can there be an American so lost to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which adorn human nature? To the generous pride, the elevation, the dignity of freedom! Is there a man who would not abhor a dependence upon those, who have deluged his country in the blood of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants? We cannot suppose this; neither is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that they themselves can expect to make many converts. What then is their intention? Is it not to lull you with the fallacious hopes of peace until they can assemble new armies, to prosecute their nefarious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs? If this is not the case, why do they strain every nerve to levy men throughout their Islands? Why do they meanly court each little tyrant of Europe to sell them his unhappy slaves? Why do they continue to embitter the minds of the savages against you? Surely this is not the way to conciliate the affections of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Be not, therefore, deceived. You have still to expect one severe conflict. Your foreign alliances, though they secure your independence, cannot <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> your country from desolation, your habitations from plunder, your wives from insult or violation, nor your children from butchery. Foiled in their principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, you must expect to feel the rage of disappointed ambition. Arise then! To your tents! And gird you for the battle. It is time to turn the headlong current of vengeance upon the head of the destroyer. They have filled up the measure of their abominations and like ripe fruit, must soon drop from the tree. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' much is done, yet much remains to do. Expect not peace, whilst any corner of America is in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of your foes. You must drive them away from this land of promise, a land flowing indeed with milk and honey. Your brethren, at the extremities of the Continent, already implore your friendship and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. It is your duty to grant their request. They hunger and thirst after liberty. Be it yours to dispense to them the heavenly gift. And what is there now to prevent it!</p>
            <p>AFTER the unremitted efforts of our enemies, we are stronger than before. Nor can the wicked emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, who so assiduously labour to promote their cause, point out any one reason to suppose that we shall not receive daily accessions of strength. They tell you, it is true, that your money is of no value; and your debts so enormous they can never be paid. But we tell you, that if Britain prosecutes the war another campaign, that single campaign will cost her more than we have hitherto expended. And yet these men would prevail upon you to take up that immense load, and for it to sacrifice your dearest rights. For, surely, there is no man so absurd as to suppose, that the least shadow of liberty can be preserved in a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent connexion with Great-Britain. From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it is evident, that the only security you could obtain, would be, the justice and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a parliament, who have sold the rights of their own constituents And this slender security is still farther weakened, by the consideration that it was pledged to rebels (as they unjustly call the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of these States) with whom they think they are not bound to keep faith by any law whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Thus would you be east bound among men, whose minds (by your virtuous resistance) have been sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to the keenest edge of revenge. Thus would your children, and your childrens children, be by you forced to a participation in all their debts, their wars, their luxuries, and their crimes. And this mad, this impious system they would lead you to adopt, because of the derangement of your finances.</p>
            <p>IT becomes you deeply to reflect on this subject. Is there a country on earth, which hath such resources for the payment of her debts as America? Such an extensive territory? So fertile, so blessed in its climate and productions? Surely there is none. Neither is there any, to which the wise Europeans will sooner confide their property. What then are the reasons that your money hath depreciated? Because no taxes have been imposed to carry on the war. Because your commerce hath been interrupted by your enemy's fleets. Because their armies have ravaged and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated a part of your country. Because their agents have villainously counterfeited your bills. Because extortioners among you, inflamed with the lust of gain, have added to the price of every article of life. And because weak men have been artfully led to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is of no value. How is this dangerous disease to be remedied? Let those among you, who have leisure and opportunity, collect the monies which individuals in their neighbourhood are desirous of plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the public funds. Let the several legislatures sink their respective emissions, that so, there being but one kind of bills, there may be less danger of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits. Refrain a little while from purchasing those things which are not absolutely necessary, that so those who have engrossed commodities may suffer (as they deservedly will) the loss of their ill gotten hoards, by reason of the commerce with foreign nations, which their fleets will protect. Above all, bring forward your armies into the field. Trust not to appearances of peace or safety. Be assured that, unless you perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, you will be exposed to every species of barbarity. But if you exert the means of defence which God and Nature have given you, the time will soon arrive, when every man shall sit under his own vine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own fig-tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.</p>
            <p>THE sweets of a free commerce with every part of the earth, will soon reimburse you for all the losses you have sustained. The full tide of wealth will flow in upon your shores, free from the arbitrary impositions of those, whose interest, and whose declared policy it was, to check your growth. Your interests will be fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and nourished by government that derive their power from your p<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant, and will therefore be obliged by the influence of cogent necessity, to exert it in your favour.</p>
            <p>It is to obtain these things that we call for your stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, unremitted exertions. Yet do not believe that you have been or can be saved merely by your own strength. No! It is by the assistance of Heaven, and this you must assiduously cultivate, by acts which Heaven approves. Thus shall the power and the happiness of these sovereign, free and independent States, founded on the virtue of their citizens, increase, extend and endure, until the Almighty shall blot out all the empires of the earth.</p>
