            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Attention of Americans has of late been uncommonly rouſed, and deeply engag'd about the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Good. We have look'd on our invaluable Liberties, and important Privileges to be in Danger. And ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012013_0005_0F89401AAEB50FD0"/>
Concern relative to theſe Things, and Zeal for their Preſervation, has prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as Regard for Liberty is wont to inſpire a free People with.—In ſuch an alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Situation, many invincible Reaſons have been offered in ſupport of our juſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Rights; many Expedients of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and prudential Nature have been urg'd with great Force, and preſs'd upon us by very weighty Motives: And may they have their Effect—The Deſign of them is certainly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Important.</p>
            <p>BUT there are doubtleſs Conſiderations of a moral and religious Nature, which ought to command our Attention, and which are really of far greater Importance, both to our preſent and future Happineſs, than any Thing meerly civil or political can be.—Indeed the chief and ultimate Deſign of Religion, as it reſpects Mankind, is to deliver us from the fatal Effects of the Apoſtacy, and to fit us for a State of perfect Holineſs and Happineſs in the coming World. But this is not all; Godlineſs has the Promiſe of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. And it tends to the preſent Happineſs not only of Individuals, but the Love and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it has a moſt friendly Aſpect on pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Weal; and the neglect of it the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Tendency to the Miſery and Deſtruction of a State.—Several Conſiderations of this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012013_0006_0F89401B70013328"/>
Nature, and of great Importance, are ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us from our Text and Context.</p>
            <p>THE Jews were become a very wicked and abandoned People, at the Time when God ſent this Meſſage to them by the Prophet. Many Threatnings, and of fore Calamities had been frequently denounced againſt them, which had as yet, very little, or rather no Effect to reform them. The Prophet Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah is directed therefore to go to the Place where the Potter faſhioned his Veſſels of Clay: There he obſerved that the Potter had an uncontrolled Power to form theſe Veſſels as he pleaſed: If they would not ſerve for one Purpoſe he could very eaſily turn them to another. From this lively Similitude, the Prophet is ordered to repreſent to the Jews God's ſovereign Power over the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable States and extenſive Empires: And with how much Eaſe God either exalts or depreſſes them, proſpers or afflicts, encreaſes or diminiſhes, or in a Word, preſerves or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys them. And God has certainly a greater Right to do this, than the Potter has to new Mould the Clay of which he is not the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Proprietor.</p>
            <p>THIS was true in Jeremiah's Time, and is equally true now; and really it is a Truth of very great Importance to be conſidered and realized; for it ſhews us that we are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012013_0007_0F89401C2E578298"/>
abſolutely dependent on God for our all:—Proſperity or Adverſity, whether private or public, is entirely from God.</p>
            <p>BUT God gives us to underſtand in our (Text, that whatever his Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty might enable him to do,) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts not only according to the invariable Rules of Juſtice and Equity, which gives us the greateſt Aſſurance that he never will wrong any People, or bring any Evil upon them, meerly to ſhew himſelf Sovereign, but farther that he is diſpoſed to treat Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind according to the Rules of Clemency and Kindneſs: So that when a Nation or Kingdom have been guilty of a Conduct cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal to that Degree, that they have greatly provoked God, and which would juſtify him in proceeding to the laſt Extremities with them; yea, if God had proceeded ſo far as to threaten them with utter Ruin, if after all this, they ſhould even then repent, and turn from their evil Ways to God, he would avert the Tokens of his Diſpleaſure, recall the Threatnings, proſper and eſtabliſh them.</p>
            <p>ON the other Hand, God lets them know that whatever Encouragement he had given of granting Enlargement and Proſperity to any State; if they after this degenerate and backſlide, to that Degree, that their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter becomes that of Evil Doers, an unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, ungodly People, they forfeit his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012013_0008_0F89401D42964AE0"/>
and Protection; and if they continue irreclaimable, he will not build them up, but deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>IT is worthy of Obſervation, that the Declarations made in our Text relative to God's providential Diſpenſations, are not confined to the Jews; they are of a general Nature, and publiſhed in an indefinite Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Whence it appears that God Almighty deſigns here to exhibit a general Rule of his Conduct towards public Bodies or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
            <p>IT is indeed true that we have no Reaſon to expect an exact Correſpondence between God's providential Diſpenſations towards the Jews and other Kingdoms or civil Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Yet as God is the moral Governor of the World, and approves of Virtue and Holineſs wherever it appears, and always hates Sin and Wickedneſs among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo it is reaſonable to believe he will ſhew his Approbation, Favour and Protection to the one, and frown upon and puniſh the other. The State of the Caſe is very different (as to the Time of Rewards and Puniſhments) between Individuals and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Bodies of Men. The future State is the Time of Retribution to Individuals.—Though therefore many among the godly may ſuffer very grievous Things in this preſent State, they ſhall be abundantly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012013_0009_0F89401EE2446E30"/>
hereafter: In that happy World Light is ſown for the Righteous, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the upright in Heart. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the wicked may flouriſh and proſper here, their triumphing is ſhort, for it is that they may be cut off and deſtroyed. But the Caſe is very different with regard to civil Communities. Whatever Forms of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration they aſſume, they are the Creatures of Time. They have no Exiſtence but in this World—All their Bands of Society, as Bodies-Politic, are diſſolved, and have no Exiſtence in a future State. If therefore they are not rewarded or puniſhed in ſome Proportion to their Character as righteous or ſinful in this World, they never are at all. It appears therefore agreeable to the Divine Perfections, that God ſhould ſhew viſible Marks of Approbation of public Virtue, and frown upon and puniſh a ſinful People, as in our Text he has expreſsly declared he will do.</p>
            <p>IT appears then that God ſpeaks to us in theſe Days as really, tho' not in the ſame Manner as he did to Nations and Kingdoms in ancient Times. To them he ſpake by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and particular Meſſages from Heaven, pointing out their Sins, and the particular and ſpecial Judgments which they might aſſuredly expect if they continued Incorrigible. To us he ſpeaks by his written. Word and his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012013_0010_0F89401F2DEF9908"/>
Providence. In his Word he ſhews us what is the Character of ſuch a People as have Encouragement to hope for his Favour, or Reaſon to fear his Diſpleaſure;—and what he juſtly expects from ſuch a People as have wickedly departed from him, that they may be reſtored to Favour, and enjoy his Smiles. Many Examples are left us in ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for our Inſtruction and Admonition. Thus God ſpeaks to us now, and ſurely the Man of Wiſdom will hear what God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the City and to the Country. We muſt carefully examine into our real Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and compare it to that of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and then conſider how God has declared he would treat them, and what Treatment they have in fact met with, and from thence collect what we have to hope for, or to fear from the Hand of God.</p>
            <p>THAT which may be further attempted, by Divine Aſſiſtance, will be to ſhew,
<list>
                  <item>I. THAT the Love and Practice of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has the greateſt Encouragement of God's Favour; and therefore is the ſureſt Means of the Happineſs of a People.</item>
                  <item>II. THAT the prevalence of Irreligion and Wickedneſs have a dreadful Tendency to their Deſtruction;</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012013_0011_0F89401FEE6A3F78"/>
And,
<list>
                  <item>III. THAT if a People have revolted from God, Repentance and Reformation will be the ſureſt and beſt Means to prevent their Ruin, and reſtore them to the Divine Favour.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. THE firſt Thing propoſed is to ſhow, that the Love and Practice of Religion has the greateſt Encouragement of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and therefore is the ſureſt Means of the Happineſs of a People.</p>
            <p>THIS is implied in the Text. 'Tis indeed taken for granted, that God will bleſs and proſper a People who continue holy and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Such who do not Evil in his Sight, but obey his Voice. Theſe are Phraſes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed in the Writings of the Prophets to decypher true Religion. But we muſt always remember that a right Temper of Heart is always included in this Obedience to the Voice of God: otherwiſe it is deſtitute of the moſt eſſential Property of Obedience.—A ſupreme Love to God, on Account of his tranſcendent Excellence and abſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: an ultimate Regard to his Honour, and a Diſpoſition to be ſubject to his Will, are eſſential Ingredients in Obedience to the Voice of God. This Voice of God is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his Word, and when we have ſuch a Temper of Mind as the Word of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; when we believe and live as God
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012013_0012_0F894020B27BFEF8"/>

               <q>ALL the great Truths and Duties of Morality are adopted by Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into his Laws, are refined and purified, and ſet in the faireſt and ſtrongeſt Point of Light, and raiſed to their higheſt Perfection in the Chriſtian Inſtitution.</q> This Word or Voice of God diſcovers his glorious Nature and amiable Perfections, in Conformity to which, the Happineſs of all intelligent Beings conſiſts.—It ſhews that Mankind, tho' originally created in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of God, have fallen from him, and are become both guilty and polluted by Sin.—The ſurprizing Method of Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, the great Mediator; and the Recovery to a holy Temper and Life, which (thro' Divine Influence) always takes Place in all who are by Faith in him, made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the great Salvation. All theſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths in one connected View, all that Holineſs that is required, and thoſe Duties which are directed to in God's Word, tend to promote the Happineſs of civil Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; for God has moſt plainly ſhewn in his Word</p>
            <p>THAT, Religion, and this only, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to his Favour.</p>
            <p>THAT, the Religion which God's Word requires, is ſo framed, as in the very Nature
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012013_0013_0F8940216FFBD428"/>
and Genius of it, to have a tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the public Good.</p>
            <p>AND this Word of God points out many Duties to Men, in all Characters, Relations and Circumſtances, which directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately tend to promote the beſt Good of the State.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD has moſt plainly ſhewn in his Word, that Religion, and only this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to his Favour. Very many are the Promiſes of this Kind. God promiſed the Iſraelites,<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. 28. 1.</note> that if they would hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the Voice of the Lord their God, to do all his Commandments, the Lord their God would ſet them on High, above all the Nations of the Earth. And thus alſo ſaid the Lord to them by the Prophet Azariah,<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Chron. 15. 2.</note> 
               <q>Hear ye me Aſa and all Judah and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, the Lord is with you while ye be with him; and if ye ſeek him he will be found of you; but if ye forſake him, he will forſake you.</q> Many other Promiſes of this Kind, taken in connection with our Text, are ſo plain as to put this Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Doubt; for they are made not only to particular Perſons, but to civil Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as ſuch.</p>
            <p>I proceed therefore to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THAT</hi> Religion, which God's Word
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012013_0014_0F8940222FD2BCA0"/>
requires, is ſo framed, as in the very Nature and Genius of it to have a tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the public Good. It might eaſily be ſhewn, (were there Time) that the more general Requiſitions and Prohibitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Religion which is deſcribed and required in the Word of God, have all a tendency to promote the Good of civil Society: But what I would eſpecially inſiſt on under this Head is, that the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt forms Men to ſuch a Temper as powerfully inclines them to promote the Intereſt of the Public.</p>
            <p>THE Depravity of humane Nature, the corrupted and vitiated Temper of Mens Minds, is the real original Source of all thoſe wicked Practices, which are prejudicial both to their private and public Intereſts. Hence proceed all thoſe open, bold Violations of God's Law, thoſe enormous Crimes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, which tend to the Ruin and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of a State. This Fountain muſt be cleanſed, or putrid Streams will continue to flow. And when this Temper is changed, the Heart renew'd and made holy, the Man will be ſtrongly and vigorouſly engaged in all the Duties of Holineſs; and conſequently to promote the public Tranquility.</p>
            <p>Now, (<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev'd Mr. Lockwood, of Weathersfield, in his Election Sermon for 1754.</note> as one ſays) <q>the Goſpel and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012013_0015_0F894022EE8B2558"/>
of Jeſus is admirably deſign'd and calculated to produce this bleſſed Effect; and this bleſſed Effect it does and will actually produce, wherever it is cordially and ſincerely entertained and ſubmitted to. Hence we are ſaid to be ſanctified by the Word; to be born again, not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Seed, but of Incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. The Goſpel of Chriſt, attended by the ſacred Influences of the Divine Spirit, is the powerful Means of rectifying the ſinful Nature of Man, and forming it to Purity and Holineſs, and a governing Diſpoſition to pleaſe and obey God in all Things. As the Laws of Religion require the univerſal Practice of Virtue &amp; Holineſs; they that are truly Religious, chooſe to obey God and live holy Lives; there is a bleſſed Agreement &amp; Harmony, tho' not a perfect one between the Temper of their Minds, and the ſacred Laws of Religion; they are not only aw'd and influenced by the Authority and Command of God, but they find an inward Propenſity and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to devote and approve themſelves to God, not only in the Duties of Piety and Godlineſs, but in the Performance of all relative and ſocial Duties, and to exert themſelves in their Places, to promote the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012013_0016_0F894023B09A13E0"/>
Welfare of Mankind, and the Tranquility and Happineſs of the State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to ſay</p>
            <p n="3">3. RELIGION requires and implies many Duties in the various Characters, Relations and Circumſtances of Life, which tend immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Good of the State. And an inward Principle of Piety will prompt Men readily to perform them. A hint of the principal of theſe Duties as they reſpect Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Subjects, will be all I have Time now to mention.   And,</p>
            <p>UNDER the Influence of Religion, Rulers will diſcharge the Duties of their important Truſt with ſtrict Fidelity. In the height of Elevation, they will not forget they have a Maſter in Heaven, to whom they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, before whom they muſt ſhortly ſtand, ſtrip'd of all the Robes of State and Enſigns of Grandeur, to give an Account of their Stewardſhip. They know God requires them, while they rule over Men, to ſerve the Lord, to ſerve him with Fear &amp; to rejoice with Trembling.—Religion will influence and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden them to diſtribute Juſtice with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality and Intrepidity; knowing that it is an Ordinance of Him that ruleth among the Gods, That he that ruleth over Men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God. In Obedience to this great Lord, they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to let Judgment run down as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012013_0017_0F8940246FE21E20"/>
and Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream, as an irreſiſtable Torrent, bearing down all Oppoſition, and ſweeping away Wickedneſs, Oppreſſion and Injuſtice from the Earth.—Religion, in the Life and Spirit of it, would diſpoſe Rulers to be ſo far from any Aims after arbitrary Power, as to be zealous Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the juſt and important Rights of the Subject. It would greatly Influence, not only by making them afraid to ſet themſelves againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed; but would temper the Thoughts of Dignity, cure a godleſs Thirſt for Deſpotiſm, and ſo keep them back from all guilty Reaches after arbitrary Power, and teach them to conduct as the Miniſters of God for the good of their Subjects.—Religion would, above all other Things inſpire them with paternal Tenderneſs, &amp; engage them to act as Fathers of the People. There is no other Principle of true Patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm equal to that of Religion. Men have indeed ſometimes from lower Principles than thoſe of Chriſtianity done well for the Public: But certainly no other Principles can actuate them with equal Force and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity to purſue the public Good. A Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Holineſs is of a divine Original, and not only fills the Mind with Veneration and Awe of the Divine Majeſty, but inſpires the Heart with Love to God and Man. Such
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012013_0018_0F8940252F1008E0"/>
a Principle will enlarge the Ruler's Heart, and engage him with unreſtrained Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to purſue the Good of all. Such Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers would therefore willingly exert all their Powers, and employ their whole Time for the Intereſt of their Country. And no doubt their greateſt and moſt valuable Intereſts will proportionably excite the generous Concern of ſuch Rulers.—The Regulation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce—The Encouragement of Agriculture and Manufactures—The Promotion of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning—The Preſervation or Reſtoration of Liberty—But above all, Religion will meet with their warmeſt Encouragement, be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized by their Example, and their Hearts will bleed for their People when under the Rebukes of Heaven, or dreadfully expoſed to the Frowns of an angry God for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from him.—In a Word, what like Religion will be a ſource of Magnanimity and Fortitude in Seaſons of ſpecial Danger?</p>
            <p>WHEN nothing but the Teſtimony of an unreproaching Conſcience, and the plaudit of the Omniſcient Judge can yield Support, what but this will ſupport them when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay'd with I gratitude for their noble and Self-denying Exertions for the Good of their Country? What but Religion will inſpirit them with Reſolution to perſiſt with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Vigour and unabated Diligence, tho'
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012013_0019_0F894025EE55A220"/>
the more abundantly they Love the leſs they are beloved? What like Religion will arm thoſe in Power againſt the Temptations to Pride and Luxury, Venality and Oppreſſion which an elevated Station peculiarly expoſes to? In fine; Religion and this only will Influence them to exhibit ſuch an Example as ſhall have the greateſt Tendency to reform a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and backſliding People. As they are Gods by Office, Religion will render them God-like in the Temper of their Minds, in their public Adminiſtrations, and in private Life. Such an Example as this would have a peculiar Tendency to give Charms to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to make Religion appear reputable and amiable, and to reform a vicious Age.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe particulars it appears that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in Rulers, not only in Speculation, but in Love and Practice; not only protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by wholeſome Laws, but appearing in real Life, and in high Life, would have a Tendency directly to promote public Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>AND no leſs would it do ſo with Regard to Subjects. The Religion of Chriſt directs Mankind in general to many Duties which have the moſt direct Tendency to render a State proſperous at home, and reſpectable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and, when it is cordially embraced, will effectually incline them to ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012013_0020_0F894026ADB6BE58"/>
For Righteouſneſs, i. e. Holineſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth a Nation. The Word of God ſtrictly enjoins that Deference and Submiſſion to Rulers, which is abſolutely neceſſary for the public Peace and Happineſs; and ſeverely threatens and condemns a diſobedient, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and unruly Temper and Conduct. In this Word God commands,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 13.</note> 
               <q>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">I Pet. 2. 13.</note> 
               <q>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man,</q> (viz. which is agreeable to the Ordinance of Heaven) "for the Lord's ſake." He that reſiſts the juſt Commands of lawful Authority is threatned with no leſs Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than Damnation.—Religion, in the Power of it, would engage Men conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to adhere to the Rules of ſtrict Juſtice.—To ſpeak the Truth in Love.—It would ſweetly, yet powerfully incline them to lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Honeſty as well as Godlineſs.—It would baniſh Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury and Intemperance from the Earth; for the Grace of God teacheth to live ſoberly as well as righteouſly and godly.—Theſe Things moſt manifeſtly tend directly and greatly to increaſe the public Tranquility.—But beſide and above all this, the noble and generous benevolent Spirit which real Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity does not fail to inſpire the Mind
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012013_0021_0F89402856462218"/>
with, would have an unfailing Tendency (if generally imbibed) to promote general Good, and diffuſe Happineſs all around—A ſelfiſh, narrow, contracted Temper is very inimical to the State. When Men are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent on private Advantage, grudge every Farthing which goes beſide their own Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, <q>and coil themſelves up in the narrow and dirty Shell of private Intereſt,</q> the Public will be neglected—The State cannot proſper. Religion is calculated in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree to cure this Diſtemper. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the Heart, greatens and ſublimates the Views of the Mind. That Benevolence which is the very Life and Soul of the Religion of the Goſpel, embraces the whole Syſtem of Beings, thro' the Univerſe, in the Arms of diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Love. This then will be the nobleſt Principle of public Spirit: 'T will engage and diſpoſe us to love our Neighbour as ourſelves, to purſue the public Happineſs as our own, and greatly to deny ourſelves, from a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ardent Deſire to promote the Good of Mankind.</p>
            <p>THIS brings me to the Second general Head, viz.</p>
            <p>II. THE prevalence of Irreligion and Wickedneſs have a dreadful Tendency to the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012013_0022_0F89402919C40608"/>
Deſtruction of a People: As Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation, ſo Sin is a reproach to any People. The general Practice of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neceſſarily diminiſhes and weakens a State, and if Impenitently perſiſted in will terminate in their final ruin.—If ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are promoted to Places of Power and Truſt, and fill the Seats of Government, are deſtitute of Principles of Piety, void of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Honor, it will have a baleful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the State of the People whom they govern. Whatever Talents or Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments they are Maſters of, while deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of theſe, there can be no ſufficient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their proving public Bleſſings: Moſt probably the nobleſt Talents will be abuſed and proſtituted to ſerve the vile Purpoſes of Ambition, Avarice or Luxury, as their lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſion chances to direct. And what can be expected under ſuch Rulers but a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Series of Diſtreſſes and Judgments? What but Scenes of Oppreſſion, Violence, Corruption and Effeminacy?</p>
            <p>THE Examples of ſuch Men will be very fatal. <q>If Magiſtrates have the Characters of Rulers of Sodom, it may be expected that their Subjects will be the People of Gomorrah.</q> The wiſe King of Iſrael obſerves, If a Ruler hearken to lies, all the People are wicked. When therefore Rulers
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012013_0023_0F894029AE2E47E8"/>
take no Care to make and execute ſuch Laws as are calculated to ſuppreſs Vice and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and to encourage Virtue and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much more if Oppreſſion, Venality or any Kind of Iniquity is encouraged; or if by their evil Example they enervate the force of Laws, and put it out of their own Power to execute them to Advantage; they give a public Invitation to their Subjects to ſhake off all Reſtraints to Sin, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Iniquity with Greedineſs. Such Rulers have brought infinite Miſchief on the State. <q>They have (as one ſays) like baleful Comets, ſpread Plagues and Deſolation through a Land, by their malignant Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</q> — But,</p>
            <p>HOWEVER virtuous, wiſe, faithful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Rulers are, if Vice and Irreligion prevail among the People, ſo that their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Character is that of a ſinful People, they have awful Reaſon to Tremble at God's Diſpleaſure: Indeed, according to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which Sin prevails, it naturally weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and injures the public Intereſt, as plainly appears from what has been already obſerved. For in the ſame Proportion that Religion tends to the public Emolument, Irreligion tends to the Damage of the State.—God, the moral and righteous Governor of the World, has ſo conſtituted the Nature of Things, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012013_0024_0F89402A6E881FE8"/>
the general Courſe of his Providence, that the Conſequences of Sin in general, ſhould be very pernicious to the Temporal as well as the future and eternal Intereſts of Men. Nothing is more obvious than that many Sins tend to bring Miſery, and indeed ſwiftly to haſten Ruin and Deſtruction on that People among whom they prevail.</p>
            <p>THUS Pride and Luxury, Venality, Injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Oppreſſion, Intemperance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery will have a moſt fatal Influence and ſwiftly haſten on every Kind of Miſery. Diſſipation, Indigence and Beggary tread on the Heels of Luxury, Pride and Prodigality. Men of this Character, thus reduced by their evil Courſes, often betake themſelves to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices pernicious and ruinous to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſuch as Robbery, Theft, Counterfeiting, or if not to theſe, to others, if not ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, yet very hurtful and pernicious; ſuch as ſharping, over-reaching, and the like.—Idleneſs often cloaths a Man with Rags, and reduces whole Families to the moſt forlorn and pitiable Circumſtances. How often do the ſlothful and indolent plunge deep into ſome of the above-mentioned Vices? or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Intemperance, which is a Vice which may properly be more particularly mentioned and inſiſted on, as it contains in Embrio all other Vices. Riot, Exceſs, Debauchery, Gaming,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012013_0025_0F89402B2E14E3E8"/>
Prophaneneſs, neglect and contempt of all Religion; theſe all are the common Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants on Intemperance: The Perſon who wallows in this worſe than brutal Vice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites every Temptation, enfeebles and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculates himſelf, and is therefore in the high Road to Ruin. And with Regard to States and Kingdoms, all Hiſtory Witneſſes, that when ſuch Sins have prevailed ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the general Character, they have been on the very Brink of Deſtruction. Thoſe mighty Empires of the World, which had for Ages been growing reſpectable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, by Induſtry, Temperance, Oeconomy and public Virtue, whenever theſe Vices pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, have ſunk by ſwift Degrees into total Diſſolution.</p>
            <p>THERE are other Sins, ſuch as Idolatry, Prophaneneſs, contempt of the Grace of God, Incorrigibleneſs under Chaſtiſements and the various Means which God is uſing for the Recovery of a backſliding People, which are daring Affronts and aggravated Provocations to Almighty God, and more direct and immediate inſults upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and therefore that People who are and continue Guilty of them, may expect ſevere Frowns and ſpecial Judgments from Heaven.—The God who governs univerſal Nature will often ſpecially interpoſe to diſtreſs and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012013_0026_0F89402BEE9B8C90"/>
puniſh ſuch a People.—When therefore all theſe Kinds of Iniquity prevail and abound among a People, natural and moral Cauſes concur to render their Situation gloomy and diſmal. God ſeverely threatens them; he ſays of ſuch a People,<note n="*" place="bottom">Jere. 5. 9.</note> 
               <q>Shall I not viſit for theſe Things? and ſhall not my Soul be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this?</q> His Treatment of the Jews, (to wave all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtances) may ſerve for a juſt Comment on his Promiſes and Threatnings of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. By viewing their Circumſtances at any given Time, a pretty exact Judgment might have been drawn up of the State of Religion among them: And that compleat Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they finally ſuffered for obſtinate Perſeverance in Sin and Rejection of Grace, when God overthrew them, even as he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, is left on ſacred Record, as a monitory Example to all other Nations.</p>
            <p>THIS brings me to the laſt Obſervation;</p>
            <p>III. THAT if a People have revolted from God, Repentance and Reformation are the moſt certain and beſt Means to prevent their Ruin, and reſtore them to the divine Favour. Indeed theſe are the only Things mentioned in the Text. It is true, when a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012013_0027_0F89402CAFEF5CC0"/>
People by their own Folly and Prodigality are reduced into low Circumſtances, or are threatned with ſore Judgments and heavy Calamities, they are to uſe all proper Means of a civil and prudential Nature, as well as thoſe which more ſtrictly ſpeaking are of a religious Kind. Frugality, a prudent Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of civil and commercial Affairs, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Exertion to preſerve their juſt Rights, are all highly reaſonable and neceſſary; they are no ways inconſiſtent with Religion or contrary to Repentance. But all theſe are inſufficient without Repentance. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enſure Succeſs; they have no Promiſe from God. In a Word, whatever be their Struggles and Exertions; whatever the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients they uſe, yet if they leave Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of the Queſtion, they are very far from any certainty of Succeſs; rather they have Reaſon to fear that the beſt concerted Plans will prove abortive, and that God will teach them by Experience, that the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battle to the ſtrong, that their own Strength is Weakneſs, and that Salvation is only from the Lord.</p>
            <p>IT is allowed that in ſome extraordinary Caſes God has for ſome Time ſpared a very ſinful People from immediate and impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruin upon the Interceſſion of eminently godly Men. Thus he ſpared Iſrael at the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012013_0028_0F89402D6FF56F70"/>

               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' God has in his great Clemency ſpared a People for ſome Time, whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Character was very bad, on Account of the godly living with them, and eſpecially when with Fervency and Importunity they have interceeded for them; or tho' he may have ſuſpended the immediate Execution of Puniſhment on the Account of a partial or meerly external Reformation; I believe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance attended with Reformation as the general Character of a People, has the only certain Encouragement of the divine For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and Favour. Such Repentance as is ſincere, univerſal and evangelical; as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an inwrought godly Sorrow for Sin, as againſt a God of infinite Purity, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               </gap> in a Word, ſuch a Repentance wherein every Sin is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken. Reformation from all evil Ways, and a Practice of all moral and chriſtian Duties will accompany true Repentance.</p>
            <p>AND where ſuch a Repentance takes Place, though among a People who have been very wicked, and whoſe backſlidings have been attended with the moſt crimſon Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it will be a Means of averting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſpleaſure. God will return in Mercy to them, and build them up. The many clear and poſitive Declarations which God has made in his Word, that Repentance and Reformation are agreeable to him, are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly required by him, and are the only Terms on which he will turn away from his Diſpleaſure and be reconciled; and the undoubted Evidence which we have that theſe have been frequently the Means of averting impending Danger, and ſaving from deſerved Ruin; are ſufficient to put this Matter out of all doubt; and therefore ſhould
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012013_0030_0F89402EEF4234A0"/>
be an effectual Inducement to a People, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſinful and degenerate, however afflicted, or however threatned, though on the very Borders of Extermination, to turn to God, through Chriſt, by unfeigned Repentance. The kind Declarations and Promiſes which God made to the Jews, of this Nature, are very many and expreſs; and they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued even to the laſt; when they were on the Brink of Ruin. Such was their Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy that God ſays of them,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai. 1. 5.</note> 
               <q>Ah ſinful Nation! a People laden with Iniquity! a Seed of evil-doers! The whole Head is ſick: The whole Heart is faint.</q> In fine, ſuch was their Degeneracy, ſuch their Obſtinacy, that the Threatnings of Almighty God are levelled directly againſt them; threatnings not meerly of paternal Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the earlier Days of their State, but of the entire Deſtruction of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Meaſure of their Sins was full, and God ſeems to be bringing Evil on them, even to the uttermoſt. He was juſt about to pluck up, to pull down and to deſtroy.—The Nation is here compared to a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; the Similitude is pertinent, and the threatned Deſtruction compleat. If the Fences be thrown down which ſurrounded the Vineyard, the Vines plucked up by the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012013_0031_0F89402FADBBA058"/>
Roots, and the Beaſts of the Field let in and ſuffered to lay it waſte, and to tread it down ſo that it ſhould grow up no more, the Vineyard is compleatly deſtroyed. Further God ſays,<note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. 19. 11.</note> 
               <q>Thou ſhalt ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, even ſo will I break this People and this City as one breaketh a Potter's Veſſel that cannot be made whole again.</q> But behold the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of God, <q>If that People againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</q> Again, God ſays,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. 1. 16, 17, 18, 19.</note> 
               <q>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes; Ceaſe to do evil, Learn to do well.—Come now and let us Reaſon together ſaith the Lord, though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow, though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool. If ye be willing and obedient ye ſhall eat the good of the Land.</q>

            <p>I MIGHT alſo ſhew many Inſtances in which God has appeared in his providence, &amp; ſignally delivered a penitent People from multiplied Diſtreſſes; but it is needleſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite particular Facts for the Purpoſe, ſince every one acquainted with ſacred Hiſtory eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012013_0032_0F89403155DE6380"/>
cannot be at a Loſs for them. Many a Time<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 107. 11, 12, 13.</note> when they rebelled againſt the Words of God, and contemned the Counſel of the Moſt High; ſo that he brought down their Heart with Labor, they fell down and there was none to help. Then they cried unto the Lord in their Trouble, and he ſaved them out of their Diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid may be inferred the ſuperlative Excellency of Religion, which is calculated to promote the nobleſt Ends, viz. to form Men in every Character and Relation to love and honour God, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and promote the higheſt Intereſt and trueſt Happineſs of Mankind.</p>
            <p>WE may alſo infer the inexcuſable Folly of wicked Men, who while they are inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately perſuing their preſent and private Intereſt, in the neglect and contempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, act in direct Oppoſition to both, and ſo expoſe themſelves to everlaſting Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for leſs, for worſe than nothing.</p>
            <p>WE learn further, that it is a Thing of the laſt Importance to a People who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the evident Frowns of Heaven, critically to examine what is their real Character: And if it ſhould appear that they have done Evil in God's Sight, and have not obeyed

his Voice: If it ſhould appear eſpecially that they have gone away backward, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Lord, that they ſpeedily hearken to the Warnings of God's Word, and repent and reform what is amiſs.—It appears of indiſpenſible Neceſſity that every Order of Men in their various Capacities, exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vigorouſly to promote a Work of ſuch Difficulty and Importance. And as in this critical Day this is the Duty of all, ſo it is in many Reſpects, eminently the Duty of Rulers.</p>
            <p>As therefore in Obedience to his Honor's Command I ſtand in this Place on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Occaſion, may I be allowed, with all due Deference and Reſpect, yet with a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom becoming the miniſterial Office, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the honored Legiſlative Body of this Government, preſent in the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this Day.</p>
            <p>WORTHY and renowned Fathers,
I TRUST it is the ardent wiſh of many in this Government, that you may have Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs equal to your Deſires and Endeavours for the public Good; and that you may be long continued in your important Poſts of Government, to exert your well known A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities in defending our invaluable Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, watching for the public Peace, and at the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012013_0034_0F894032AE4A7AA8"/>
ſame Time protecting, encouraging and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Religion.</p>
            <p>IT is a ſignal Honor to you, (revered Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators) that by the Suffrages of a People, who ſtill enjoy and highly prize Freedom, you have been be truſted with the important Affairs of Government in a Seaſon ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly Dangerous and critical as this. The Confidence repoſed in you is indeed great, and we truſt and have Reaſon to hope, your Vigilance, Firmneſs, Zeal, Prudence and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion will be anſwerable to our Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and to the Exigencies of the State.</p>
            <p>WHAT Expedients of a political Nature are requiſite at this Day to guard our juſt Rights, to regulate Commerce, to encourage Manufactures, Agriculture and Oeconomy, we leave to your Wiſdom, not doubting your Care. Theſe Things have been frequently and moſt pertinently urged, eſpecially of late.—My Subject leads me to Conſiderations of another Nature, however not leſs important.</p>
            <p>THAT we are involved in great Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and have Reaſon to fear ſtill greater, in this Day of perplexing Uncertainty and doubtful Expectation, is ſo Obvious that it is needleſs to enlarge on the diſagreeable Theme. And whatever are the immediate Sources of theſe Diſtreſſes, our Sins are no Doubt the procuring Cauſe. Our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012013_0035_0F8940336E845EF8"/>
have ſeparated between us and our God. That Prophaneneſs, Impiety and Senſuality which have prevailed, and do ſtill prevail among us, (may I be allowed to ſay) with too much Impunity; <q>Our ſtupid Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, and our general neglect (under all our Struggles and Concern) of the only effectual Way of Deliverance, from all the Calamities we feel or fear,</q> theſe things point to us in a ſtriking Light the Neceſſity of Repentance and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>UNDER God, our Eyes are unto you, our Dependance is upon you, to exert yourſelves in your Places of Dignity and Authority, with yet greater Spirit and Vigilance, that you may not bear the Sword in vain, but be a Terror to evil doers, and a Praiſe and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them that do well. We hope for the Continuance of your friendly Care to the Seminary of Learning in this Government, that you will promote Learning, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a learned Miniſtry, between which and Religion there is ſo cloſe a Connection. We alſo truſt you will with Firmneſs ſupport our religious Conſtitution in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being well calculated to ſubſerve the Intereſts of Religion. And if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, either by enacting other Laws, or more punctually executing the many good and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012013_0036_0F89403431E4C420"/>
wholeſome Laws now in being, to ſuppreſs the growing Prophaneneſs, Intemperance, Contempt of Worſhip and Prophanation of the Sabbath, which are viſible and awfully increaſing among us, it would have a happy Tendency to promote Reformation.</p>
            <p>ONE very honorary and expreſſive Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given to Rulers in God's Word, is that of <hi>Gods;</hi> this implies that they ſhould be God-like, and (as far as humane Infirmities will permit) imitate the God of Gods. And what a glorious Pattern is held up to the Rulers View in this particular? What boundleſs Compaſſion God has ſhewn to a guilty apoſtate World? What has he left undone to reduce guilty Rebels to Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Love and Obedience? We truſt you will imitate this glorious Example. That you <q>will ſympathize with your People in their Difficulties and Sorrows, and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reſent all the Evils they groan under, even when they ſuffer by their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault: That your Bowels of Compaſſion will peculiarly move towards them, when they are under deep Apoſtacies from God, and under terrible Impreſſions of his Wrath, both in Temporal Judgments and Spiritual Plagues. As the Head in the natural Body ſees the uneaſy State of the whole and each Member, ſo you will have
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012013_0037_0F894034EFC7C7F0"/>
a moſt ſenſible Share, in all the Loſſes, Reproaches, Burdens and Dangers, that are among this People; and your Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs will be expreſs'd in taking the beſt Meaſures for their Relief and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH Rulers as have been Friends to God and to Religion, who have been nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Church, have mourn'd for her Afflictions, critically obſerv'd her Declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and nobly exerted themſelves to bring about a Reformation, have embalmed their Memories with Poſterity, and their Names have been tranſmitted to future Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with peculiar Honors. Much more precious are their Memories than thoſe of the moſt renowned Heroes, or Men of the moſt exalted Geniuſes, who were yet deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of and paid no regard to Religion.</p>
            <p>SUCH a Ruler was Moſes, a Man mighty in Faith and Prayer, eminent for Patience and Meekneſs, willing to relinquiſh Fame, and even to lay down his Life for the good of God's choſen People.</p>
            <p>How glorious is the Character of Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah and of Hezekiah and Joſiah Kings of Judah, as Reformers and lovers of Religion? Such have been many of our Rulers in this Government. Such in an eminent Degree was our late Governor. And was not he

So great a part of the ſpecial Buſineſs of the Miniſters of Chriſt, is to inculcate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and promote Reformation; and ſuch is the general Character of this Order of Men in this Government, that I cannot doubt of their cordial Concurrence and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Endeavours to promote a Work ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and neceſſary at this Day.</p>
            <p>Reverend Fathers and Brethren,
IN this apoſtate and ſinful World it has ever been the Errand on which God has ſent forth his Ambaſſadors to preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Reconciliation to God, through a Mediator; and at ſpecial ſeaſons to give Warning of impending Danger, and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Repentance and Reformation, by all poſſible Motives.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3. 19, 20.</note> NOAH warned the antediluvian World of imminent Deſtruction, and inculcated Repentance for a long Space. This was the great Errand on which the Prophets were ſent to the Jews. The Burden of all their Meſſages was, Turn now unto the Lord with all your Hearts. And as their Sins increaſed and God's Judgments were more numerous and awful, and eſpecially when the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Storm thickned, and ſeem'd ready to burſt on their guilty and defenceleſs Heads,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012013_0040_0F8940372F9682A8"/>
the Prophets were ordered to redouble their Efforts, and with an honeſt Freedom and pious Zeal, point out their Danger, and the Reaſons of it. Thus Iſaiah is directed to<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. 58. 1.</note> cry aloud and ſpare not, to lift up his Voice like a Trumpet, and to ſhew unto God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their Tranſgreſſion.—The weeping Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is ſent with many ſuch Meſſages as that in our Text.—When John, the immediate Fore-runner of Chriſt appear'd, he cried,<note n="¶" place="bottom">Mat. 3. 2.</note> 
               <q>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.</q>—And our bleſſed Saviour, as the firſt of all his Meſſages, proclaimed,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark 1. 15.</note> 
               <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and believe the Goſpel.</q> And to add no more Inſtances, St. Paul in few Words tells us what was the main Buſineſs and Practice of the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, (and which no doubt we ſhould imitate them in)<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> 
               <q>Now then we are Ambaſſadors of God, as tho' God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God.</q> And does not the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God point out to us many peculiar Motives and loud Warnings, to be very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, vigilant and diligent in preſſing Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation, on the People of this Government? Perhaps never in this Land was there greater need of Reformation, or louder calls to it. God expects we ſhould
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012013_0041_0F894037EFDAEA60"/>
join with our worthy Rulers in this moſt important Work, and not only faithfully ſhew this People their Sins and Deſerts, but ſincerely bewail their and our own Sins, and deprecate God's Judgments. In this Day of Darkneſs and Diſtreſs, ought not the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, above all others, to weep and to ſay, <q>Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not up thine Heritage to Reproach.</q> In brief, it appears clearly that Repentance and Reformation are that one Thing needful at this Day, on which our political and temporal Salvation, as well as our eternal depends; and that God juſtly expects that we, above all others, ſhould be ſenſible of it, and endeavour to promote them. This then ſhould engroſs our Thoughts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our Solicitude, and employ our Time.</p>
            <p>AND I would humbly ſuggeſt, that as we would ſucceed in our Endeavours, we muſt hold faſt the Form of found Words, and adhere inviolably to the Doctrines of Grace, thoſe great Important Doctrines, which our pious Anceſtors held, and for which they ſuffered: 'Tis the plain, faithful preaching of theſe which is like to be attended with Succeſs. It was obſerved by<note n="†" place="bottom">The Rev'd Mr. Lockwood, of Weathersfield, in his Election Sermon, 1754.</note> a worthy Gentleman ſome Years ago, on this Occaſion, that, <q>'Tis the plain, ſerious, affectionate
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012013_0042_0F894038B5D64D88"/>
preaching of Chriſt crucified, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches, the merit of his Croſs, the Prevalence of his Interceſſion, and the Power of his Grace, and the other pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Doctrines of the Goſpel, that are nearly connected therewith, God has been wont eſpecially to own and bleſs, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Repentance from dead Works, and all the excellent Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Life and Converſation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MAY I be allowed juſt to add, that Union among ourſelves is greatly neceſſary, that we may be ſucceſsful in our Endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt of Religion among others.</p>
            <p>SCARCE any Thing has given a greater Advantage to the Enemies of the Church, than that Diſcord which has prevailed among Chriſtians; or any Thing ſtab'd the Cauſe of Religion with deeper Wounds than thoſe Contentions and unchriſtian Alienations which have took Place among the Clergy: may they never prevail among us; may we let alone Contention before it is any further meddled with. While we contend for the Faith, may we take heed that it is indeed the Faith of the Goſpel, and thoſe plain, great, important Truths which have a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote practical Godlineſs, and not ſubtil Speculations and ſcholaſtic Niceties:
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012013_0043_0F8940396DEF52B8"/>
And while we look upon ourſelves obliged to contend earneſtly, let us alſo contend meekly, and not looſe Sight of Charity, in the Defence of Orthodoxy. Should not this thought, that there are cruel Foes enough abroad, watching for our halting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in our Diviſions, cement us in the cloſeſt Union to one another? Should we not, as Servants of the meek and lowly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, forbear one another in Love, and unite in this Day of great Degeneracy and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in every probable, ſuitable and prudent Method to promote the common Good:—Above all, are we not under the moſt ſacred Obligations to join in humble fervent Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, to that God who heareth Prayer, who loves Unity and Fervency in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, who has never ſaid to the Houſe of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain; who has often in anſwer to the united, humble Petitions of his Servants, appeared for Zion, and for New-England in particular. In this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I truſt there will not be a diſſenting Voice, or a diſuniting thought among us.</p>
            <p>THIS brings me to conclude with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to this numerous Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>YOU have been often told, my Brethren, that this is the important Day which will
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012013_0044_0F89403A5B1A7618"/>
probably decide the Fate of America: That to be unconcern'd therefore in this Conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Affairs muſt be the Effect of the moſt ſtupid Dulneſs, or unaccountable Frenzy: And that we are under indiſpenſible Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to uſe the moſt vigorous Efforts, and practice much of Self-denial (if call'd to it) for the good of our Country. All this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true: And God's Word directs us to the only certain and effectual Expedient to obtain Help in our Troubles, and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from our Dangers. In one Word, this is Repentance. This would be very reaſonable and important, were we in no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Circumſtances of Danger, or under no ſpecial Frowns from Heaven: But as the Caſe now ſtands with us, 'tis neceſſary, in every View neceſſary to our civil and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intereſts, neceſſary to the Preſervation of the State, as well as to the Salvation of our Souls. Is not God now in his Providence directing that ſame pathetic Exhortation to us which he did once to the Church of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus;<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 2: 5.</note> 
               <q>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt Works.</q> This Land, New-England in particular, was planted a noble Vine. We have the Honour to be deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Anceſtors who really deſerved the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012013_0045_0F89403C00D9E540"/>
Name which was given to them in Deriſion, I mean that of Puritans.—They were indeed faſt Friends of Liberty, but abhorred Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs.—They were inviolably attached to Purity and ſtrictneſs in Faith, in Worſhip and Converſation. God's Promiſe in our Text was fulfilled to them. He ſpake Good concerning them, and performed it to them. He marvellouſly preſerved them from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding Savages, when they were few in Number.—He increaſed them almoſt to a Prodigy—Defended them from powerful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies abroad, and rendered abortive many deep-laid Plots for their Ruin.—The Time would fail, tho' in the briefeſt Manner, to recount the ſignal Appearances of God's Providence for them and us; or to deſcribe the diſtinguiſhing Privileges, civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, which we have enjoyed. Is there a Spot upon the Globe, happier in theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards than the Britiſh Subjects in America have been? or a Government on the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent which has exceeded Connecticut? But we have evilly departed away from the God of our Fathers, and are in many Reſpects become the degenerate Plants of a ſtrange Vine. How inexcuſable is our Ingratitude herein? And now when God is holding the Rod of Correction over us, let us not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Incorrigible, and give Occaſion for the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012013_0046_0F89403C6F6A2348"/>
mournful Complaint of the Prophet, <q>O Lord when thy Hand is lifted up they will not ſee:</q> Leſt God ſhould put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the threatning annexed to the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Exhortation: In theſe awful Words, <q>Or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candleſtick out of his Place, except thou repent.</q> May God mercifully grant that this dreadful Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may never be executed againſt us, as it has been long ſince, on all thoſe renowned Churches in Aſia. Who that has the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree of Love to God, or Regard to the Kingdom of Chriſt? who that wiſhes well to his Country? or who that has not put off all the Bowels of a Parent, or has any feelings of Humanity in his Breaſt, but muſt ſhudder at the Thought of New-England's ever ſharing the dreadful Fate of thoſe Churches?</p>
            <p>BUT unleſs we repent, have we not awful Reaſon to fear this will be our Caſe? Should we plead that notwithſtanding our general Declenſions, we have many good Things to be found among us, and many good Men who are mourning for our abounding Sins, and the viſible Decays of Godlineſs; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently praying for Zion, and willing as it were to thruſt themſelves into the Gap and ſtop the Plague? This is no doubt true;
