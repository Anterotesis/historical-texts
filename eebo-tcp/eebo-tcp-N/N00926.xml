            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Occasion of the Author of those Remarks, his publishing them in Print, was, as he declares in pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The first part of my Sermon, that goeth before the Rules, he hath said nothing against, and in Charity I judge he hath nothing against it.</p>
            <p>Pag. 1. Sect. 1. He saith, <hi>The Author, instead of keeping to his Text, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Seeing all this is said, without proof, I shall not regard it, but recommend what is contained in those Rules to every well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Conscience of those that have read, or may happen to read them, (and who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> forbidden by the divine Law, the Commandments of Bishops must be obeyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That is doubtless my meaning, for the very words of the <hi>Rule</hi> plainly import it. But <hi>I</hi> find nothing to the purpose either of Argument or good Authority, that he saith against it. What the Author quotes out of Dr. <hi>Richard Smith</hi> his Recantation, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>That Bishops and Ministers have no Authority in making Laws and Decrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Gods Word, I</hi> reckon may charitably be construed, in Opposition to <hi>Popery,</hi> to mean such Laws and Decrees as Popes and Popish Councils commonly make, both against Gods Word, and besides it, as if they were Commands of God, or Articles of Faith, or Means of Grace; all which the <hi>first Rule</hi> expresly provides against. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> as an Ecclesiastick Person had Power to command what the divine Law did neither command nor for bid, see <hi>Philemom</hi> v. 8. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
            <p>But whereas he doth peremptorily affirm, <hi>That it belongs to Christ alone to appoint Laws for the Government of his Church.</hi> If he mean such Laws as primarly and by themselves immediately bind the Conscience, and concern the <hi>substantial part</hi> of the Government of the Church, I

grant; which nothing militates against the above given <hi>Rule.</hi> But that our Superiours, both Ecclesiastick and Civil, have not power to make Laws and Rules in <hi>Circumstantials,</hi> that do not bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science primarly and immediately by themselves, he has not in the least proved, but takes it for granted without all Proof, and contrary to all good Reason and common Practice of all Christian Societies. For the Laws of Christ in Scripture, many of them being general, in order to their being the better understood, and obeyed, require some particular Rules made by Superiours, and even by the Community, where the Community is a <hi>Democracy</hi> (such as <hi>I</hi> guess these called <hi>Independent Churches</hi> generally are, or at least very near to, in resemblance (which sort of <hi>Democracy</hi> in a Christian Church, <hi>I</hi> can no where find in holy Scripture) even the said Community gives Laws and Rules, binding not only the Makers of them, but their Children and Successors after them, that had no hand in the making of them. For it is hardly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that any Society, whether Ecclesiastick or Civil, can consist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out several <hi>Rules</hi> determining such particular Circumstances, as to Times, Places and Persons, which general Laws of Scripture do not determine, as, <hi>To meet for Religious Worship at such Places and Times, Who, or What Persons shall be Past<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs of such a Congregation;</hi> and many other Cases of great and weighty Circumstances. And upon a very slender Search, I think it will be easie to find, that these called <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Churches</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and else-where, have Laws and Rules among them, which they as really and severely impose on all that come in to them, after such Laws are made by the Community, as any other do, insomuch that who will not submit to them, are not to be received into their <hi>Community;</hi> and among other things, that called by them their <hi>Church Covenant,</hi> which they make a distinct thing from the <hi>Baptismal Covenant,</hi> and to be sure widely distinct from <hi>Episcopal Confirmation,</hi> not only <hi>I,</hi> but many Thousands of good Christians cannot find any Warrant for it in Scripture, by the best <hi>Judgment of Discretion</hi> that we can make; but on the contrary, we not only think it <hi>superfluous,</hi> but more burdensom to our Consciences, should we submit to it, than all the <hi>Ecclesiastick Canons,</hi> on the <hi>supposition</hi> that they were as Unprofitable to Edification as the Author and his Brethren render them to be. Besides, as to the time and manner of receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, do ye not make some Law or Rule when the Congregation is to receive it, as at or before Noon, or some time before Night, though at
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001109_0009_0FB0482D65E96220"/>
its first Institution it was practised at Night, and after the Passover Supper? And do ye not as much impose it on your People, that they should not kneel at the receiving the Lords Supper, but sit, as ye think the <hi>Church of England</hi> imposes it no her Members to Kneel? And why do ye not allow or practise your Males sitting with their Hats upon their Heads at the Communion Table? Do ye not hold this Practice of Mens sitting at the Communion Table with their Hats on their Heads in time of receiving, a very indecent Practice, as I have heard some <hi>Independents</hi> confess? And suppose a great Number of a Congregation should begin to receive with their Hats upon their Heads, or lying on their sides, would ye not think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to make some Law or Rule against it? This is but a hint in a few things, instead of many more that might be objected in your own Discipline. Which, if they have not sufficient weight to you, No more, but indeed far less has what ye object against the Commands of Our Superiors to us, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Circumstantials</hi> of either Religious Worship or Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Besides, Ye have no Command in Scripture enjoyning you to sing <hi>Davids Psalms</hi> in Meeter and Rhyme (the putting them into Rhyme being altogther done by Humane Art) your ground then of doing it must either be a Law made among you, or such a constant Custom as is equivolent to a Law. And if no Law be warrantable but what is commanded by Christ, as to <hi>Circumstantials</hi> of Worship and Discipline in the Church, by the like Reason, or rather by greater Reason, ye may argue against all Customs not commanded by Christ in the holy Scriptures. And why do ye not read the holy Scripture in your Congregations, which are given for Mens Instruction to be read and heard in Publick, as well as in Private? I think ye had much better agree to make it a Law, that every time the Congregation meets, One Chapter, at least, of the Old Testament should be read, and another of the New, and that in good Order, than to neglect it, as ye ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally do, One only Congregation at <hi>Boston</hi> excepted, as <hi>I</hi> am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now though the reading of the holy Scriptures in Publick is well warranted by Holy Writ, yet <hi>What,</hi> or <hi>How Much</hi> ought to be read every day the Congregation meets, the Scripture determines not, and therefore in This, as in Other the like Cases, Ecclesiastick Superiors may give Laws or Rules, What is to be done, according to the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations given in the <hi>first Rule.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>What things we see amiss in particular Persons, are not to be charged upon the whole Church, unless the Church do Justifie those Persons in those Things; and what we cannot amend, we ought to bear; for there is no Christian Society on Earth but has some particular Persons that do amiss; and all Dissenters, when parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Failings of particular Persons are objected to them, give the like Excuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the streined Sense which he puts upon the words of it, is this, That by <hi>Justifying,</hi> I mean an <hi>avowed defending of Scandalous Criminals,</hi> at least he is very jealous that I so meant it, otherwise why should he find fault with this <hi>Third Rule?</hi> The Author cannot be ignorant, that <hi>Not to justifie,</hi> doth several times in Scripture signifie not only <hi>not to defend</hi> or <hi>approve,</hi> but severely to Censure and blame, as where <hi>Job</hi> said to his Friends, <hi>God forbid that I should justifie you,</hi> and where God is said, <hi>Not to clear or justifie,</hi> (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> doth bear it) <hi>the Guilty, i. e.</hi> He doth severely censure and judge them; and like that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not, i. e.</hi> I greatly dispraise and blame you. All which is said by a <hi>Rhetorical Figure</hi> frequent in Scripture, as well as in other Writers, called, <hi>A Meiosis,</hi> where something more is understood than is expressed. And that my plain meaning was, That scandalous Persons, who gave pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Scandal, are not only Not to be defended or connived at, but that they are to be publickly censured &amp; a due Testimony born against them, is evident from my saying, <hi>That all Dissenters, when particular Failings of particular Persons are objected to them, give the like excuse.</hi> And <hi>All Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi> include the <hi>New-England Independents</hi> as well as others, who profess, That scandalous Persons ought not only Not to be defended, but to be duly Censured, and a due Testimony born against them. And the Author knows in his Conscience, That <hi>The Discipline of the Church of England requires this:</hi> He had therefore no just reason to object against the Third Rule. But where he cannot find a fault, in this

            <p>But when the Author cannot find sufficient matter against this <hi>Third Rule,</hi> (the only proper subject of the Dispute) he preceeds after his former manner to inveigh against the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for her neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Discipline: Though in many places good Discipline is used in her (praised be God) and there are as many good Christians eminent in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But as want of Discipline in some particular Places and Congregations, is no Refutation of the Rule given, so nor is it any just Cause of Seperation from the Church: And dare the Author say, there is no want or neglect of due Discipline in the <hi>Churches of New-England?</hi> And are all the Failings of particular Persons amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

This is no good Argument against the lax Discipline of the Church; but that it is severely punished, when discovered, is a good argument for her Discipline being so far good. Besides that, the Antient Discipline of the Church was severe upon the Deserters of it, &amp; such as did seperate and make a Schism there from; the which severe Discipline were it now, or but the half of it performed upon all the deserters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <hi>To joyn in external Acts of publick Worship, where the Matter is sound, though there be a great Mixture of Unsound Members, with others sound, is no sin, but our Duty, for which we are warranted by the Practice both of the Prophets and Apostles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He saith, <hi>This Argument, though often urged, is not Cogent.</hi> But how does he prove that it is not Cogent? Is his bare Authority or Word a sufficient Proof against the Rule, which was the main subject of the Dispute, as stated by himself? for I find not that he gives any other Proof, only to divert his Reader from the proper subject, he tells, <hi>That it is controverted among learned Men, whether there were any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Discipline in the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church, in respect of Moral Offences;</hi> but however, the Author himself affirms, that <hi>Heresies</hi> (and to be sure they are great Moral Evils and Offences) were censurable among them. And this is all he saith against the Fourth Rule, which is just nothing. But when all his Shot is spent against the Fourth Rule, after his wonted manner, he makes a fresh Assault upon the <hi>Church of England,</hi> so that his Spleen is mainly against her; and were but the Rules as much in favour of the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> called, <hi>Independents,</hi> its very like he could swallow them all down very kindly, and easily digest them. He tells us, That <hi>I cannot but know, that the Dissenters from the</hi> Church of England <hi>find fault with some particulars in the matters of the Worship required in the</hi> Liturgy. <hi>They verily believe that such things are therein commanded, as God has forbidden; whether they are Mistaken in their Judgment, the day will declare it.</hi> And then he has a Hit at the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Church of England, telling us, <hi>That the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists believe that they are forbidden in the second Commandment.</hi> But what is here of real Argument either against the fourth Rule or the Church?

Divines of the <hi>Church of England</hi> have more truly and more elaborately also answered all their Arguments against what they call the <hi>Ceremonies of the Church of England.</hi> But have the <hi>New-England Independents</hi> no Ceremonies among them, that is, no things that they use relating to Circumstantials of Worship or Religion, but what is contained in Scripture? Have they nothing of <hi>Humane Institution</hi> among them?

But he should have said, [<hi>after Baptism</hi>] and not [<hi>in Baptism</hi>] for the Church of England makes not the Sign of the Cross any <hi>part of Baptism;</hi> and therefore it is not [<hi>in it</hi>] but [<hi>after it</hi>] and many are baptized in the Church of England daily, who are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>But why doth he make all this Cry against the <hi>Church of England</hi> for holding, <hi>That to joyn in external acts of Worship, where the matter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> this Rule, notwithstanding he is so set against it.</p>
            <p>In his disputing against the <hi>Fifth Rule,</hi> he is as weak, as against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the former. The Rule is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What things soever were commended of God or allowed and practised lawfully under the Old Testament, that were neither any part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now what saith he against this? Surely nothing to prove the Rule to be false; for what things were either commanded or permitted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that are not lawful, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Precepts? I cannot but oft wonder at the Author's Inadvertency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He mentions the Observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> and some <hi>Holy Dayes</hi> that were observed among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and that they had <hi>Musick</hi> in their Temple Worship, and the Priests had <hi>Holy Garments</hi> to distinguish them from others; and from this he infers, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> doth Judaize in observing the Christian Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> and other <hi>Christian Festivals,</hi> and having <hi>Musick</hi> in their <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> and some other places. But he has made no Essay to prove his Consequence, which is with as good Authority denyed, as by him affirmed. And why did he not as well argue, <hi>That because the</hi> Jews <hi>heard the</hi> Old Testament <hi>read in their Synagogues and in the Temple, and</hi> Prayed <hi>and</hi> sung Psalms, <hi>that therefore it is</hi> judaizing <hi>for the</hi> Church of England <hi>to either Pray or Sing in their Congregations, or to hear the Old and New Testament read in their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi> This last, it seems, they think <hi>Judaizing,</hi> and therefore do not practise it; only (as <hi>I</hi> am informed) Mr. <hi>Colmans</hi> Church at <hi>Boston</hi> hath the Scriptures read in it, which I suppose the <hi>Independent Brethren</hi> do reckon not only <hi>Judaizing</hi> in them so to do, but coming too near to a <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Church of England.</hi> The Author should better know or at least consider, <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> like Practises, when done on different Reasons, and to different Ends,</hi> the one may be good and justifiable, the other bad and condemnable. But is it not a rare Argument of the Author against the <hi>fifth Rule,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> in Swearing, should say, <hi>By the Law I Swear?</hi> But did the Law permit or command any such thing? Surely Nay; and our Saviour taught the <hi>Jews,</hi> They were not to Swear by any Creature, <hi>But the</hi> Jews, <hi>when they Swear, did lay their hand on the Pentateneh.</hi> What then? we do not find that our Saviour did blame any of them for this, if they so did; nor can the <hi>Church</hi> be charged with <hi>Judaizing,</hi> for allowing her Members to lay their hand on the Bible when they Swear. He may as well argue, <hi>Quaker-like,</hi> That because <hi>Jews</hi> did Swear, therefore all Swearing under the Gospel is <hi>Judaizing;</hi> yea, and all Self-Defence by Carnal Weapons, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> say, &amp; argue with as much Strength as this Author doth against the <hi>Church of England</hi> for some aforesaid things, such as the <hi>Jews</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, but on quite different Reasons, and to quite different Ends.</p>
            <p>Pag. 20. Whereas I had affirmed, <hi>That Proofs out of the Old Testament are in all Cases as good as Proofs out of the New,</hi> which I brought as a Reason or Illustration of the <hi>Fifth Rule,</hi> the Author saith, <hi>No Man doubts of that, provided they be Proofs indeed, and not Scriptures Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted

But this I throughout observe, that the Author, instead of proving the RULES to be false, which was his main Undertaking, he makes it his main Business to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>I Answ.</hi> As many Prayers are not Psalms, so many Psalms are Prayers, and such as are Prayers (as the Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> abounds with such) ought, when used in Acts of Worship, to be used as Prayers; and if some of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> had them all by heart, yet its not likely that all had them so, but rather they used the Book to help their Memory in Prayer; and the Author can never show a right Reason why a Book may not be as lawfully used in Prayer as in Singing, seeing both are high Acts of Worship, and ought to be spiritually performed. Nor doth the <hi>Church of England</hi> think that bare reading a Prayer or Prayers, either in private or publick, is any acceptable Worship to God (and no more is <hi>extempore Prayer</hi>) but as it comes from the heart, with Sincerity and true Devotion &amp; Life.

            </p>
            <p>But whereas in my Sermon, p. 16.

            <p>
               <hi>To which I Answer:</hi> The Author of the Remarks, I think, cannot be ignorant that the common People have no part in those <hi>Antiphones</hi> and <hi>Responses,</hi> being all in <hi>Latine,</hi> which is an unknown Tongue to the generality of the people, and therefore he cannot be ignorant that his comparing the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> so as even to out-do her, is very Unfair, seeing all the Prayers in the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are in the <hi>English Tongue,</hi> and very intelligible to the generality of the People.</p>
