            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE favorable reception which the Firſt Book of ARISTOCRACY has met with from an indulgent Public, encourages the Editor to proceed in the Publication; and, agreeable to his engagement, to preſent the Second Book to the notice of his Fellow-Citizens.

               <l>WASH'D by the tempeſt of the gloomy night,</l>
               <l>Mild roſe the morn, in bluſhing beauty bright.</l>
               <l>Cheerful the hinds awake, from ſhort repoſe,</l>
               <l>Cheerful the city's buſy ſwarms aroſe.</l>

               <l>In interrupted ſleep, ARISTUS lay.</l>
               <l>Vainly he languiſh'd for refreſhing reſt—</l>
               <l>Unkind deſerter of the anxious breaſt—</l>
               <l>And vainly ſtrove in Lethean dews to ſteep</l>
               <l>Th'increaſing woes of his perturbed ſleep;</l>
               <l>When now, from SATAN ſent, a bolder dream,</l>
               <l>On quivering wings, with ampler meſſage came;</l>
               <l>And, lightly hovering o'er th'unconſcious Sage,</l>

               <l>To one, unknown, aloft, to view diſplay'd,</l>

Aſtoniſh'd at a ſcene ſo ſtrange, the Chief</l>
               <l>Dar'd not withhold, yet ſcarce could grant belief;</l>
               <l>And round him look'd, with anxious doubts oppreſt—</l>
               <l>When thus the MAN unknown the Chief addreſt.</l>
               <l>"Why ſtands ARISTUS wrapt in mute ſuſpence?</l>

               <l>As when an army, far from friendly aid,</l>
               <l>Retiring, flee the land they dar'd invade;</l>
               <l>And, night ſucceeding night, a ſhort repoſe,</l>
               <l>Prone on his arms, is all the warrior knows;</l>

               <l>Doubt after doubt diſturbs his labouring brain;</l>
               <l>And all his long conjectures prove in vain.</l>
               <l>At length, joy-ſtricken, and with glad ſurprize,</l>
               <l>"Can it be ſo?" the enraptur'd hero cries—</l>

               <l>"Swift from my proſpect now the clouds withdrew,</l>
               <l>"And future glories open'd on my view;</l>
               <l>"Nor did I fail to bleſs the bounteous day;</l>
               <l>"But well reſolv'd to brook no more delay,</l>
               <l>"I tried each art, each known expedient us'd,</l>
               <l>"Here favours offer'd, terrors there infus'd;</l>
               <l>"'Till from his ſeat, an abſent rival thrown,</l>
               <l>"I found the hard-earn'd dignity my own.</l>
               <l>"Hence a kind preſage of ſucceſs I drew;</l>
               <l>"More firmly fixt my purpoſe to purſue.</l>
               <l>"Still to be gain'd ſuperior power appear'd;</l>
               <l>"When he ſhould fear me, whom I long had fear'd.</l>
               <l>"But yet no ſyſtem gave our ſcatter'd bands</l>
               <l>"The ſtrength which every arduous taſk demands;</l>
               <l>"Scarce to each other were the leaders known,</l>
               <l>"Or yet their intereſts deem'd alike, and one.</l>
               <l>"Mark then, while I the ſecret ſource diſcloſe</l>

               <l>"Thrice had the Sun his annual circuit trac'd</l>
               <l>"And half of his remaining diſtance paſs'd,</l>
               <l>"Whoſe hop'd completion brings the joyful day,</l>
               <l>"The ſure renewer of expiring ſway.</l>
               <l>"Think, thou exalted, thou attentive, SAGE,</l>
               <l>"What fears, what wiſhes, in my boſom rage:</l>
               <l>"Each artifice I us'd, employ'd each plan,</l>
               <l>"That e'er was practis'd, or devis'd by man;</l>

               <l>Here paus'd the Chief: with grief and rage oppreſt,</l>
               <l>Deep ſighs convulſe his ſwelling, labouring breaſt;</l>
               <l>Tears fill his eyes: but ſhame, and native pride,</l>

               <l>A feeble ſmile his countenance illum'd,</l>
