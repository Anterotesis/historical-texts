         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AN ANSWER To a BOOK lately put forth By <hi>Peter Pratt,</hi> Entituled, The<hi> Prey </hi>taken from the Strong.

            <p>In which Anſwer there Is a true and impartial Relation of thoſe Sufferings of <hi>John Rogers,</hi> on which the Author has built his Abuſes: As alſo many of the ſaid Scoffs, Falſhoods, blaſphemous Expreſſions, great abuſes of Scripture, together with many groſs Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and ignorant Speeches contained in ſaid Book; all which are diſcovered and plainly proved,</p>

            <head>To the Sober READER.</head>
            <p>AS it has ever been allowed, that the defaming of the Dead is a mark of the moſt unmanly and baſe Spirit of a Coward, and ought to be abhorred by all Perſons who bear the Image of Men; then how much more abominable is it of <hi>P. P.</hi> to ſport himſelf with his own Lies over a Man in his Grave? And I think no Perſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon will expect any Apology from me on account of this my Undertaking, ſince my Silence in this matter would have rendered me very unmanly.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall proceed to inform the <hi>Reader</hi> what parts of his Book I have undertaken to anſwer.</p>
            <p>And firſt, As to his firſt Chap. where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give an account of his being led into and recovered from <hi>Quakeriſm;</hi> I have remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much of his own Relation of the matter, that I think will be ſufficient to ſatisfy every Perſon that knows any thing of the Work of God wrought upon their Hearts, that what he calls his being led into <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> was the Day of his Viſitation, and a gracious Call of God in Mercy to his Soul; and alſo what he calls his Recovery from <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> was nothing elſe
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002809_0003_0FE63FD82FEF7818"/>but his Apoſtacy, being overcome by Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to his Songs which he adds to the Account of his Recovery from <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he pretends to praiſe God for his Recovery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have briefly remark'd ſome of the groſs Blaſphemies therein contained; as alſo ſhewed by Scripture, that it is no other than the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Hypocrites in former Ages in their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, to imitate the Praiſes of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>And as to what he ſays in his ſecond Chap. wherein he pretends to give an account of the principal Heads of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> I have only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd ſome groſs Contradictions and ignorant Expreſſions in which he abuſes <hi>J. R.</hi> and I have refered the <hi>Reader</hi> to <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Books, which will ſufficient diſcover the Author's Folly and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; and which Books I have ſufficient by me to ſupply any that deſire Satisfaction in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>And as to his third Chap. wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give an Account of the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Boaſting of his ſufferings, and to offer ſome advice to ſuch as hold his Principles. I have particularly proved all his Charges againſt <hi>J. R.</hi> to be notoriouſly falſe in every Article; and that the advice which he gives to ſuch as hold his Principles, is nothing elſe but his own groſs Darkneſs and Ignorance, by which he wreſts the holy Scriptures and abuſes the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God.</p>
            <p>Alſo I have given a true and impartial Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſufferings of <hi>J. R.</hi> on which the Author has built his abuſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002809_0004_0FE63FD831A93608"/>
And as to what he has ſaid concerning the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Principles, I have wholly omitted, and that for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I am not in fellowſhip with them, and therefore it is not my Buſineſs to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in their Quarrel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although I abhor the abuſing of any Sect, yet becauſe I know them to be a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People, both wealthy and learned, and that they are in as good Eſteem in the higheſt Courts of <hi>England</hi> as any of the Diſſenters in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and therefore have no need of ſuch mean Help as mine, but are well able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt far more wiſe and potent Enemies than <hi>P. P.</hi> And I am well knowing that <hi>P. P.</hi> is a Man wholly ignorant concerning the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> being brought up and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways living in <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony, where he has never had the opportunity of acquainting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with either their Perſons or Books. And for as much as I have been well knowing to his management from a Child, I have ſufficient grounds to be well ſatisfied that he never had one Hours Diſcourſe with a <hi>Quaker</hi> in his life, as to matters of Religion, excepting a few Words formerly with one <hi>Chaddack,</hi> a young Man who was then inclining to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſince is joyned in fellowſhip with them at <hi>Rhoad-Iſland;</hi> which diſcouſe he has often told me of: nor do I ſuppoſe that he was ever at a <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting in his Life, nor has ever ſeen any of their Books, excepting only <hi>Robert Barkley</hi>'s Apology, which he lately borrowed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002809_0005_0FE63FE2D1548218"/>
And as to the many Quotations out of the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Books, which he has made uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I do affirm they are every one taken out of one Sheet of Paper, put forth by one <hi>George Keith,</hi> a Man which I well knew, and who was as famous for changing his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>P. P.</hi> himſelf. For firſt he was a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then turned <hi>Quaker,</hi> and ſo remained many years; after which he turned <hi>Church man,</hi> and then bent his whole force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and reproach the <hi>Quakers:</hi> and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Writings againſt them, he put forth this Sheet above-mentioned, wherein he greatly abuſed their Books, by taking and leaving ſuch parts as might moſt deſtroy the ſenſe. And one <hi>Daniel Leeds</hi> an Almanack-maker, and a great Friend to the ſaid <hi>Keith,</hi> Tranſcribed the ſame Quotations out of the above-mentioned Sheet of Paper, and put them into his Almanack; and I do affirm, that every individual Quotation in <hi>P. P</hi>'s. Book which he brings againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he has taken out of the above-named Sheet or old Almanack; and I am ready to ſatisfy any Perſon of the truth of what I here aſſert, that pleaſes to call at my Houſe, for as much as I have one of the ſame Sheets and Almanacks by me ready to compare with his Book, by which it is manifeſt that he never ſaw thoſe Books out of which theſe Quotations were taken.</p>
            <p>And indeed it was great folly in him ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf, as to pretend to inform others in the Principles of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when at the ſame time himſelf knew not what a <hi>Quaker</hi> was, as appears by his calling <hi>J. R.</hi> a <hi>Quaker,</hi> who was
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:002809_0006_0FE63FE2D3DEF9A0"/>the greateſt Writer againſt and publick Oppoſer of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in the chief Principles wherein they differ from other Sects, that ever was in <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony, as his Books will largely make appear.</p>
            <p>And it is marvellous that <hi>P. P.</hi> ſhould be ſo prompt with only licking up ſome of the Vomit of ſuch an Apoſtate as <hi>G. Keith</hi> out of an old Almanack, as to undertake to inform the World that he would ſhew them the principal Heads of Quakeriſm, in the firſt ſecond and third ſteps of its Progreſs in the World, as he promiſes in his 39th. page.</p>
            <p>Alſo in the ſame page he promiſes to ſhew <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Opinions, without any reference to his Books, for which he renders ſeveral reaſons, (as he calls them) Firſt, ſays he, <hi>Becauſe I don't need them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That this is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible and Childiſh Reaſon; for we know that the Reaſon why Authors quote the Books of them they write againſt, is not becauſe they want them themſelves, but becauſe the Reader wants them, that they may thereby be ſatisfied of the truth of what the Author charges them with.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon he gives is, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they contain but few of his Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Reaſon I quaery as follows, That if <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Books contain but few of his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then how comes <hi>P. P.</hi> to know what his Principles are ſeveral years after his Death? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſame Spirit which once deceived him in the matter of <hi>Longitude,</hi> has again deceived
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:002809_0007_0FE63FE45CE69328"/>him concerning <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Principles; and we have as much Reaſon to queſtion the truth of what he tells us of <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Principles, (ſince he makes no better proof than his own bare Word) as the General Aſſembly had to queſtion the truth of his Longitude, which ſoon after proved to be a Deluſion of Satan.</p>
            <p>Now by theſe fooliſh and vain pretended Reaſons, the Reader may plainly ſee, that he only wanted an excuſe to evade <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Books, that he might take his full ſwing to bely and abuſe him at his pleaſure; becauſe he well knew that if he had Quoted his Books, they would have diſcovered his Lies and Falſhoods.</p>
            <p>But I ſhould not have enlarged ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this head, were it not that I am ſenſible that there are many thouſands of grown Perſons in this Colony, that for want of opportunity to be informed in the Principles of other Sects, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo ignorant, that they know no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor between the <hi>Quakers</hi> and the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> but eſteem each couple to be alike.</p>
            <p>And how is it poſſible that ſuch Perſons ſhould be able to diſcern the Ignorance of <hi>P. P.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall mind the <hi>Reader,</hi> that in all his charges againſt <hi>J. R.</hi> (the dead Man with whom he has engaged War) he has not prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Article of his charges; excepting where he pretends to give an Account of his Principles, at the end of every falſhood he adds the name <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> which if that may paſs for ſufficient Proof, I muſt confeſs that he has found out a new Art,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:002809_0008_0FE63FE45EC906F8"/>which may be as helpful to the Hiſtorian as his Longitude might have been to the Mariner, had it but fell with the right ſide up, for by this new way of proof, the Hiſtorian may write what he pleaſes as <hi>P. P.</hi> has done, and at the end place but the name <hi>Rogers,</hi> will be as good proof as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>P. P</hi>'s. Book.</p>
            <p>And whereas it has ever been allowed by the wiſe and learned, that the very Marrow and Life of all Books conſiſts in good proof, without which Books are no better than idle Tales, and are but an abuſe to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Then how marvellous is it that <hi>P. P.</hi> who knew himſelf to be a Man ſo unconſtant and changable, not only in his worldly concerns from his very Childhood, but alſo in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſince he has arrived to riper years, ſhould preſume to put out a Book only on his bare Word, without any proof at all.</p>
            <p>Surely he might reaſonably have thought that all who knew him, would expect better Proof from ſuch an unconſtant Perſon, than from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man.</p>
            <p>However, ſince I have taken upon me the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of proving the main Articles of his Book to be falſe, I hope it will be a good motive to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, that his word is not a ſufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build any more of his Book on.</p>
            <p>Yet if he ſhould preſume to do it, I think no ſolid Perſon who ſhall read and conſider this preſent Anſwer to his Book, will judge it worth my while to follow him any farther.</p>
            <p>And for as much as I abhor the publiſhing of ſuch Romance Books as have no Proof but the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:002809_0009_0FE63FECAD173680"/>Author's bare Word, and ſo tend only to waſte and conſume the precious time of the Reader, and leaves the Reader as Ignorant as it ſound him; ſo the Reader will find that I have been at conſiderable trouble and Charge in procuring good Proof to all the main Articles that I have aſſerted throughout this Treatiſe, by which the Readers will be aſſured of the Truth of what they Read, which doubtleſs will be better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than the other.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place I ſhall obſerve to the Reader, that throughout my whole Treatiſe whereſoever I have had occaſion to make uſe of Teſtimonies, I have taken ſuch Perſons as the Reader may be ſenſible are moſt knowing to the matter they teſtify to. <hi>(As for Inſtance)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 56th. <hi>P. P.</hi> affirms, that great part of <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Impriſonment at <hi>Hartford,</hi> was upon ſtrong ſuſpicion of his being acceſſary to the Burning of <hi>New-London</hi> Meeting-houſe. Now tho' I might have had multitudes of Witneſſes that would have teſtified that this affirmation was falſe, yet I took the pains of going more than fifty Miles to get the Jaylor's own Teſtimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every one knows that he was well knowing to the matter. Alſo as to the great Horror which <hi>P. P.</hi>'s Father fell into before his Death, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Marrying <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Wife, tho' multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of People were knowing to it, it being the Publick Diſcourſe of the Country in the time of it; yet I have taken both Witneſſes out of one Family of his near Neighbours, and a Houſe which he was moſt Intimate at of any Houſe in the Town, as is well known to the ancient
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:002809_0010_0FE63FECAED32AD8"/>Neighbours thereabouts; and ſo in many other caſes I have done the like, as the Reader may eaſily diſcern.</p>
            <p>And although <hi>P. P.</hi> did ſufficiently diſcover his unmanlineſs to the World, by picking a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with a dead Man, as he himſelf is forced to confeſs in the beginning of his Book; yet had he but uſed fair play in the time of his Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhould never have concerned my ſelf in the Quarrel, being well ſatisfied that he never could thereby have hurt his Antagoniſt. But when I ſaw him begin to uſe ſuch abominable ſoul play, I thought it proper to ſtep between them, and take his Weapon out of his hand, judging that a Wooden Sword might better ſuit his Courage.</p>
            <p>And whether any Perſon in the vindication of a dead Father would have done leſs than I have done, I freely leave to the Judgment of all Mankind.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer to a Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AND firſt, I ſhall begin with his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to hereafter, which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Treatiſe was begun in the Life-time of</hi> John Rogers, <hi>and by the beſt Advice finiſhed ſince his Death; tho' not without much Reluctancy in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as Judging it leſs Manly to Write againſt One whom</hi> the Clods of the Valley <hi>forbid to Anſwer for himſelf: Upon which Account</hi> John Rogers <hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, is uſed with as much Tenderneſs as the Subject will poſſibly allow of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 2d. of his <hi>Preface</hi> ſays he,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next Place,</hi> I have given you the main Heads of the <hi>New-London Quakeriſm,</hi> an Hereſie Advanced and Maintained there by <hi>John Rogers,</hi> late of that Town, Deceaſed, and to this Day adhered to by many Perſons thereabout.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This ſhort Paragraph is ſufficient to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy all Perſons who are knowing to the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Principles, that <hi>P. P.</hi> is wholly Ignorant as to the Principles wherein the <hi>Quakers</hi> differ from other Sects, which appears by his charging <hi>J. R.</hi> with advancing and maintaining <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> who in his life-time was the only Man in <hi>Connecticut</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002809_0015_0FE63FF4C9D699B8"/>Colony (as I have ever heard of) that did Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in Print oppoſe the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in thoſe main Principles wherein they differ from other Sects. And for the better ſatisfaction of ſuch Perſons who have not had opportunity to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed wherein the <hi>Quakers</hi> mainly differ from other Sects, and thereby may be as ignorant as <hi>P. P.</hi> who I ſuppoſe never was at a <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting in his life; nor has he excepting very lately, had the opportunity of ſeeing any of their Books.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt mention what are the main Points wherein they differ from other Sects.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly I ſhall Quote out of <hi>J. R.</hi>'s Books, wherein he has confuted them in thoſe Points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> they deny Water Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> they deny the Bread and Wine called the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they hold that the Light which is in the Hearts of all Mankind by which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Good and Evil, is Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> many of them deny the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body.</p>
            <p>And theſe are the four main Points wherein they differ from other Sects, as they themſelves will grant if demanded; and that <hi>J. R.</hi> hath largely vindicated all theſe Principles againſt them, may be ſeen firſt in his Book entituled, <hi>A Midnight Cry from the Temple of God, to the ten Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</hi> Beginning at page 48 concerning <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and in page 82 of the ſame Book, begins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> And in the ſecond part of the ſame Book, beginning at the firſt
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002809_0016_0FE63FF4CBB46A08"/>page he largely proves that the <hi>Light within</hi> is not the Chriſt. To which Diſcourſe he adds an Expoſition on moſt of thoſe Scriptures which the <hi>Quakers</hi> commonly make uſe of to prove their Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, in his Expoſition on the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> he largely proves the Reſurrection of the Body, beginning at page 232.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that it is nothing elſe but <hi>P.P.</hi>'s ignorance in charging <hi>J. R.</hi> with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing and maintaining <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> ſince he was the moſt publick oppoſer of it in <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> Colony. And this I give as a general An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer throughout his Book, whereſoever he ſhall ignorantly call <hi>J. R.</hi> a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Page 6th (ſays he)</hi> It remains that I ſpeak of the third ſtep in <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> taken by <hi>J. R.</hi> who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his firſt notions of Spirituality from <hi>Banks</hi> and <hi>Caſe,</hi> a couple of lewd Men of that ſort called <hi>ſinging Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Men as they danced through this Colony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lit of <hi>J. R.</hi> and made a <hi>Quaker</hi> of him; but neither they nor the Spirit could teach him to ſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, he remained their Diſciple for a while, and then being wiſer than his Teachers, made a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Church of the ſeventh-day Baptiſts; but the ſame Spirit not deſerting him, but ſetting in with the diſpoſition of his own Spirit, to a vehement affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Precedency; he Reſolved to reach it, though it ſhould happen to lead to ſingularity; whereupon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few Revelations, he reſolved upon <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> again, though under a modification ſomewhat new, I call it <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> not but that he differed from them in many things, yet holding with them in the main, being guided by the ſame Spirit, acknowledging
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002809_0017_0FE63FFD5BB17658"/>their Spirit, and they his, be muſt needs be called a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> That every Article of this whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph (ſo far as it relates to <hi>J. R.</hi>) is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe; for the proof of which I have taken theſe following Teſtimonies from two of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Neighbours, which tho' they have always been Enemies to his Principles, yet have been very free in giving their Teſtimonies to the Truth, ſignifying their abhorrence of ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe done to a dead Man.</p>

            <p>Now the firſt Falſhood which I ſhall obſerve in this place, is his aſſerting that the firſt notions of Spirituality taken by <hi>J. R.</hi> was from <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Banks,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas the above Witneſſes Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002809_0019_0FE63FFFC54F6000"/>that he had broke off from the Church of <hi>New-London,</hi> and joyned with the Seventh-day <hi>Baptiſts;</hi> upon which account his Wife had left him. And that all this was many years before <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Banks</hi> firſt came into this Colony.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Falſhood is his ſaying, <hi>Theſe Men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>lit of</hi> J. R. <hi>and made a</hi> Quaker <hi>of him;</hi> whereas theſe Witneſſes Teſtify, that he never inclined to their way, nor countenanced their Practices, but continued in the Religion which he was in before.</p>
            <p>The third Falſhood is his ſaying, <hi>He remained their Diſciple for a while,</hi> ſince it is fully proved that he never was their Diſciple at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth Falſhood is his ſaying,</hi> That after be had remained their Diſciple a while, be made a tranſition to the Church of the ſeventh-day Baptiſts.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is fully proved, that his joyning with the ſeventh-day <hi>Baptiſts</hi> was many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe People firſt came into this Colony.</p>
            <p>Another poſitive Falſhood is his aſſerting, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>acknowledged his Spirit, and be theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as much as they always denied him, and would not ſuffer him to Preach in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
            <p>And although he did allow that the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> at their firſt coming forth, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from the World, were the faithful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, the ſame alſo he confeſſed of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time; yet it would be as weak an Argument as <hi>P. P.</hi>'s for any to ſay, that becauſe <hi>J.

And we find both by the Old and New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Church of God ſeldom remained in a ſtate of Purity ſo long as fifty years at any one time. Nay, ſome of the Churches that were brought into the Faith by <hi>Paul,</hi> were ſo far ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted before his Death, that they were turned from him, as is to be ſeen 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.15. <hi>This thou knoweſt, that all they which are in</hi> Aſia <hi>be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me,</hi> &amp;c. We alſo find that the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> in the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s time was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, that they had only a <hi>Name to live, and were dead.</hi> By which I underſtand, that although they retained their outward form of Worſhip, yet had loſt the Spirit of God, and were got into the Spirit of the World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>J. R.</hi> always Teſtified, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were fallen from their firſt love, is well known.</p>
            <p>But now I would mind the Reader of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and Promiſe in his <hi>Advertiſement. Firſt,</hi> he confeſſes his unmanlineſs in writing aginſt a dead Man, which I doubt not but will be the Judgment of all ſober Perſons as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> His Promiſe, <hi>upon which account</hi> (ſays he) <hi>J. R.'s Character is uſed with as much tenderneſs as the ſubject will poſſibly allow of.</hi> From which it may juſtly be ſuppoſed, that the ſubject of his Book is Envy and Malice againſt <hi>J. R.</hi> the dead Man with whom he has proclaimed War; Since it will admit of no tenderneſs at all, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the five Falſhoods already proved, which by the heat of his firſt Engagement, has cauſed him to vomit up. And I would adviſe him not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002809_0021_0FE640084AED8028"/>to make Lies his refuge, nor hide himſelf under Falſhoods, as ſome have done, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15.</p>
            <p>And whereas among his other Scoffs and Falſhoods, he aſſerts that <hi>J. R.</hi> often changed his Principles. To which I anſwer, That upon condition that <hi>P. P.</hi> will make it appear that <hi>J. R.</hi> ever altered or varied in any one Article of his Religion, ſince his ſeparating from the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and joyning with the ſeventh-day <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> which is more than fifty years paſt, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only as to the obſervation of the ſeventh day) I will reward him with the ſum of <hi>twenty Pounds</hi> for his labour. No verily, he miſtakes the Man, it was not <hi>J. R.</hi> that uſed to change his Religion, but it was <hi>P. P.</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>In page 7th. he makes this obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are certain times which paſs over ſome Men, in which they are in more eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of departing from the Faith, and giving heed to ſeducing Spirits.</p>
            <p>One (ſays he) is the time of ſore Affliction <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know (ſays he) the Jews under Dark and Afflictive Providences Murmured and fell to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here he greatly abuſes the Scripture through his own ignorance; for the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly informs us, that it was in Proſperity that the Jews fell to Idolatry, and that God's uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way to bring them out of their Idolatry was, by ſending ſore Afflictions on them.</p>
            <p>Another time (ſays he) is when a Man has ſuffered very unjuſt Treatment from Men, as he conceives, and having applied to the Authority
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002809_0022_0FE640084F43B318"/>for Relief, but not obtaining it, he'll be tempted to think uncharitably of and rail againſt them; which if he allows himſelf to do, his next Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will be to fall away to ſome party that oppoſes them; and this was the caſe of one <hi>Gates</hi> in <hi>New-London</hi> County.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If this was the caſe of <hi>Gates, viz.</hi> that he ſuffered very unjuſt Treatment from Men as he conceived, and applying to the Authority for Relief, but obtaining none; then it was very agreeable to Scripture, to withdraw from ſuch a corrupted People, where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People were ſo corrupted as to treat their Neighbours very unjuſtly; and the Authority whom God has ſet up to puniſh evil doers ſo corrupted, as to grant no Relief in ſuch caſes; ſurely theſe were great Diſorders, and it was highly commendable in <hi>Gates</hi> to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the holy Scripture, 2 <hi>Theſ. 3.6. Now we command you, Brethren, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you withdraw your ſelves from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Brother that walketh diſorderly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In Page 8th he quaeries as follows; <hi>And what could I have done leſs than to have diſplayed Signals of Danger over thoſe fatal Rocks and Sands, on which I had ſuffered Shipwreck?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> I ſuppoſe he here intends a Spiritual Shipwreck, for that he never has been a Man concerned in Sea Affairs: And for as much as I know of no Spiritual Shipwreck mentioned in Scripture, but that of <hi>Faith and a good Conſcience,</hi> which I am ſure he has ſuffered; and that he may ſtand for a Signal to be a Warning to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is my earneſt deſire: And if any Perſon
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002809_0023_0FE6400952E81298"/>ſhould happen to fall into the <hi>Longitude</hi> of thoſe Rocks and Sands, I would adviſe them to look out ſharp, and they will ſee more ſignals than <hi>P. P. viz. Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the ſame Rocks and Sands. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Holding Faith and a good Conſcience, which ſome having put away, concerning Faith have made Shipwreck. Of whom is</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo as Hiſtory informs us of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> who like <hi>P. P.</hi> denyed the Truth by Publick Recantation, and thereby was received into the favour of the World, and ſo ſtands for a ſignal with the other three above mentioned.</p>
            <p>And now we are come to his firſt Chap. which is as follows.</p>
            <p>CHAP. 1ſt. <hi>Giving an Account of the Author's being led into, and his Recovery from</hi> Quakeriſm.</p>
            <q>
               <p>My near alliance to <hi>John Rogers</hi> (then Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or) who is my Brother, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Son of my Mother, proved an unhappy Snare to me. He being naturally a Man as Manly, Wiſe, Face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Generous, perhaps as one among a thouſand, I was exceedingly delighted in and with his Converſation. He alſo indeared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me very much by his repeated Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Complacency in me, by which I was induced to be frequently in his company, and often at his Houſe, where his Father would be entertaining of me with Exhortations to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious life, warning me of the danger of Sin, and certainty of that Wrath which ſhall come on all that know not God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would ſome times for Curioſity be enquiring into his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and other times for Diverſion be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002809_0024_0FE6400955564BA8"/>a point with him; but I knew not <hi>that the dead were there,</hi> Prov. 7.24. I was not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious enough to be much concerned about his Principles, but pitiful enough to be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved with the Story of his Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I had alſo a reſerve in his favour, that it was poſſible he might be a good Man, (the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Doctrine notwithſtanding) eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing all his Sufferings were not able to ſhake his Conſtancy, or oblige him to recede from the leaſt part of his Religion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here I obſerve, that he owns that <hi>J. R.</hi> would be entertaining him with Exhortations to a Religious life, warning him of the danger of Sin, and certainty of that Wrath which ſhall come on all that know not God.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, This was the ſame Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which the Prophets and Apoſtles taught their Hearers, as may be ſeen <hi>Mat. 3.2. Repent ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Verſe 7. <hi>Who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come,</hi> &amp;c. To which he Replies, <hi>That he knew not that the dead were there;</hi> Prov. 7.24. And in the very next words adds, <hi>That he was not Religious enough to be much concerned about his Principles.</hi> By which the Reader may eaſily diſcern that the dead was there ſure enough, that is <hi>P. P.</hi> was there, who was dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, not being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious enough to be concerned to live a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Life, or to take warning of the danger of Sin, and certainty of the Wrath of God, which <hi>is Revealed from Heaven againſt all Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 1.18. Now if he intends <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Exhortation by the dead being
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002809_0025_0FE640141F0B3078"/>there, I think it is becauſe he is in that ſtate of darkneſs ſpoken of, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Wo unto them that call Evil Good, and Good Evil; that put Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But he acknowledges that he was pitiful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be extreamly moved with the Story of his Sufferings.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That whoever ſhould be made ſenſible of <hi>J. Rogers</hi>'s Sufferings, had they not an Heart of Stone, would be as much moved with pity as <hi>P. P.</hi> ſince I ſuppoſe the like has not been known in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> for ſome Ages paſt; and which continued for more than forty five Years.</p>
            <p>He alſo confeſſes, that he had a reſerve in his Favour, <hi>that poſſibly he might be a good Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>eſpecially ſeeing all his Sufferings were not able to ſhake his Conſtancy, or oblige him to recede from the leaſt part of his Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> I muſt confeſs this Reaſon of <hi>P. P.</hi> is very ſound, and agreeable with the Scripture; and ſufficiently proves that <hi>J. R.</hi> was not like the <hi>ſtony Ground</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>But he that receiveth the ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it: Yet hath he not root in himſelf, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Word, by and by he is offended.</hi> But ſays <hi>P. P. All his Sufferings were not able to ſhake his Conſtancy, or oblige him to recede from the leaſt part of his Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This olſo proves him to be one of thoſe which Chriſt ſpeaks of <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24, 25. <hi>Therefore whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002809_0026_0FE64014225D0AF8"/>will liken him unto a wiſe man which built his houſe upon a rock: and the Rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At length</hi> (ſays he) <hi>my Brother became a very ſtrict and devout Profeſſor of his Father's Religion, and ſo became leſs ſociable, tell at length our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was almoſt wholly ſuſpended for divers Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Here it is obſervable, that when his Brother became a ſtrict and devout Profeſſor of his Father's Religion, and himſelf remained in his vain Converſation, they could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their former Fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>Which well agrees with the Teſtimony of the holy Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>For what fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath Righteouſneſs with Unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath Light with Darkneſs? And what Concord hath Chriſt with Belial? And what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 2d. he enters upon his account of his firſt being led into <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> as he calls it.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <hi>it pleaſed God in a ſolitary moment to bring into his thoughts thoſe words, Forſake the Fooliſh and live, and go in the way of underſtanding.</hi> Prov. 9.6. He ſays, he underſtood them to ſuggeſt that if he would live Eternally, he muſt forſake his Sins, which the Scripture calls <hi>Folly,</hi> and his vain Companions, which the Scripture calls <hi>Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 3d he ſays, he took the Words as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of his vain Courſe of life, and a Counſel and Invitation to him to walk with the wiſe &amp; be wiſe. <hi>Whereupon</hi> (<hi>ſays he</hi>) <hi>I fully reſolved from Thenceforth to turn from Sin to God, and accordingly
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002809_0027_0FE640195D46D7B0"/>began to ſet up a ſtrict and Religious Courſe of Life, to reform the Errors of my ways, to Pray to God in ſecret,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In page 5th. he goes on to give an account how inceſſantly he cryed to God for Mercy and Grace by ſecret Prayer, and how the Devil op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him in his ſecret Prayer. And in page 6th. he gives an Account how earneſtly he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God to rebuke thoſe foul Spirits, and how inſtantly God anſwered his Prayer, and cauſed them to vaniſh away.</p>
            <p>In page 7th. he gives an Account how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Queſtion whether he had not been in the way of an Erroneous and Heterodox Religion; and that upon this doubt with all poſſible Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs he asked Counſel of the <hi>Wonderful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor,</hi> and Wiſdom of him that gives it <hi>liberally to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the remaining part of this 7th. page, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the 8th. and part of the 9th. he ſtill goes on to ſhew what ſcruples and doubts he was in as to the ſeveral forms of Religion; and in the latter part of the 9th. page he gives an Account how Earneſtly he cryed to God to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him in the matter, which he gives in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following.</p>
            <q>
               <p>In this diſtreſs I poured out my Soul to God in Prayer, I implored the Guidance of his Word and Spirit, I confeſſed my loſt and Sinful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but I told him of his Word, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I flew to our Saviour's Words, <hi>That if a Son ask Bread, the Father will not give him a Stone.</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002809_0028_0FE64019839C6488"/>Luke 11.11. and pleaded them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>O thou that heareſt Prayers, and haſt never ſaid to the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, ſeek ye me in vain; <hi>who art a fountain of light and truth, and therefore the Sons of Men believe thy Word, behold the promiſe of thy Son, which I now humbly plead before thee. I implore the Bread of Life, and the knowledge of the Truth. Wilt thou now ſend me ſtrong Deluſions to believe lies, and ſo let his Words fall to the ground? Surely thou wilt not, for they are ſettled in Heaven, and more permanent than the Heavens or the Earth, and I will believe them, and adventure my Soul thereupon.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>In page 11th he tells us, <hi>That after this he ſoon laid aſide Family-Prayer, could ſee no Rule for the practice of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The eighth of <hi>January,</hi> (ſays he) being the Lord's-Day, I doubted ſo much of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that I dared not go to Meeting.</p>
               <p>The 22d of <hi>January</hi> I thought it my Duty to Labour as on other Days, and I did ſo.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now that which is obſervable in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he has been giving is, that when he came to fear that he had been in the way of an erroneous and heterodox Religion, and reſolved to examine it, and thereupon asked Counſel of the <hi>Wonderful Counſellor,</hi> as he ſays he did, and earneſtly pleaded with God to give him the knowledge of the Truth, and that he might not be held under ſtrong Deluſions to believe lies.</p>
            <p>And now God is graciouſly pleaſed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to him thoſe ſtrong Deluſions, which he had ſo long been deceived by, in thinking to pleaſe God by attending formal and cuſtomary Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002809_0029_0FE64024425BFD18"/>which he had been taught by Tradition, and had been practiſing in his unregenerate ſtate, while he was in fellowſhip with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who always love to pray in Synagogues and publick places, which Chriſt forbids his Diſciples to practice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5.</p>
            <p>Another ſtrong Deluſion which is now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to him upon his earneſt Prayer, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>firſt Day,</hi> which in his unregenerate ſtate he thought to be a <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but upon this anſwer of Prayer, he thought it his Duty to labour on as on other Days, and did ſo. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when he ſaw no Rule for the practice of his formal Prayer, he ſoon laid it aſide: All which proves his faithfulneſs to God at that time, by yielding Obedience to what God diſcovered to him.</p>
            <p>Page 12th he declares, that on the 26th of <hi>January</hi> he was carried to Priſon for refuſing to pay a fine laid on him for prophaning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath laſt before. In the ſame page he tells us, how ſome laboured to allure him by proſpects of worldly Advantage; and in page 13th. ſome curſed him in the Streets, wiſhing him dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others by mocking and other verbal abuſes miniſtred ſuch Provocations, as one would think nothing but a Stock or Stone would have been ſilent under.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This is no new thing, but hath always been the practice of the wicked World to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, Mock, Deride and Revile Gods faithful Children, as both Old and New-Teſtaments do abundantly inform us. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are you when Men ſhall Revile you, and Perſecute you, and

Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven: For ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> Joh. 15.18, 19. <hi>If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me before it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you. If ye were of the World, the World would love its own: but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.13. <hi>Marvel not, my Brethren, if the world hate you.</hi> Iſai. 59.15. <hi>Yea, truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh himſelf a prey.</hi> Iſai. 51.7. <hi>Hearken unto me, ye that know Righteouſneſs, the people in whoſe heart is my Law, fear ye not the reproach of Men, neither be ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of their Revilings.</hi> Jer. 15.10. <hi>Wo is me, my mother, that thou haſt born me a man of ſtrife, and a man of contention to the whole earth: I have neither lent on uſury, nor men have lent to me on uſury, yet every one of them doth curſe me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 13th. page he alſo tells us, how that <hi>in the Morning before he went to Priſon, he committed all concerns and Intereſts to God by ſolemn Prayer, and that taking a ſad farewel of his Wife, addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Journey, taking a Bible with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo largely ſets forth how great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible his Tryals were, in forſaking his dear Wife, with all other valuables in this World.</p>
            <p>In page 14th. ſays he, <hi>Under theſe preſſing Burthens I went to</hi> New-London, <hi>about ſixteen miles from my own Houſe, lifting up my Heart to God by the way, in thouſands of Ejaculations, with the moſt vehement application of Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This account which he gives of his giving up in this great Trial is ſufficient to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002809_0031_0FE6402547BDB850"/>prove, that the great Love of God was ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in his Heart at that time, by which he was enabled to forſake his dear Wife, with all other Earthly things for Chriſt's ſake, and as Chriſt ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37, 38. <hi>He that loveth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me;</hi> then may we ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſuch as love Chriſt above all Earthly things, and are ready to take up their Croſs and follow him, are worthy of him, all which <hi>P. P.</hi> then did.</p>
            <p>He alſo tells us, how that <hi>in this great Tryal, he lift up his Heart to God in thouſands of Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the moſt vehement application of Mind,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He ſtill goes on in this 14th. page to ſet forth the great aggravations of his Tryals, by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting of the Jaylor over him,</hi> alſo the <hi>going into a dark Goal without Fire or Lodgings, in a very cold Seaſon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the 15th. page he ſays, <q>Under theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies, his <hi>Fleſh and Heart cryed out for God, for the ſtrong and living God,</hi> I ſupplicated his Mercy for Chriſt ſake, (<hi>ſays he</hi>) confeſſing my Sin and Miſery; I Bleſſed him for his Word, and appealed to his Omniſciency, that I deſired to keep his Precepts.

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002809_0032_0FE64025587759F8"/>had now aſſurance of my Union to Chriſt, &amp; that nothing ſhould ſeparate me from his Love.</p>
               <p>This Rapture laſted me that Night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was (<hi>ſays he</hi>) in the Goal five days, in which time <hi>J. R.</hi> and his Company often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited and treated me with ſufficient Expreſſions of their tendereſt Regard; Providing me a Lodging in the Goaler's Houſe the firſt Night, otherwiſe 'tis like I ſhould have dyed of the Cold, being a Man of a tender Conſtitution, and not innured to hardſhips; and afterwards they furniſhed me with Lodging and other things for my Comfort, during my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page 16th. he tells us, That the next Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that happened, was upon Reading</hi> Rom. <hi>10.9, 10.</hi> If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt Believe with thine Heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved: for with the heart Man Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</p>
               <p>Page 17th. He tells us, that his Sorrows were now turned into Joy, and his Prayers into Praiſes of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>In the ſame page (ſays he) on the fifth day of my Confinement, my wife (againſt my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Prohibition) having paid the Fine, and procured a <hi>Mandamus</hi> to the Goaler to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge me, the Meſſenger came in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This was ſurpriſing and unwelcome news to me, for that Morning I had awaked in a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002809_0033_0FE6402AD2FB3120"/>marvellous Calm, every thing was pleaſant and eaſy to me, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 18th. (ſays he) Amongſt other things I had a deſire to be Baptiſed by <hi>J. R.</hi> Thoſe words in <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. ran much in my mind, <hi>And now why tarrieſt thou? Ariſe and be Baptiſed, and waſh away thy Sins,</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly I was Baptiſed of him, as ſoon as releaſed from Priſon, by burying my Body in the Water. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I went home, it being <hi>Tueſday.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>And now we are got through the account which he gives of his being led into <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> as in his groſs darkneſs he calls it.</p>
            <p>Now the next account he is entering upon, is what he calls his recovery out of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> which in truth is nothing elſe but his Apoſtacy, being overcome by Perſecution, according to what is written <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. Concerning the <hi>Stony places,</hi> which <hi>receive the Word with Joy, but when Tribulation or Perſecution ariſeth, they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;</hi> So was it with <hi>P. P.</hi> who being thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, ſoon turns like the <hi>Dog to his own vomit,</hi> that is licks up again thoſe erroneous Principles which ſo lately he had diſgorged; and like the <hi>Sow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire,</hi> by defiling himſelf again with his former vain Converſation and Companions.</p>
            <p>And now as to the Account of his Recovery out of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> as he vainly calls it, I ſhall only Remark ſome Paſſages briefly, which may be ſufficient to ſatisfy every ſober Reader, that he ſoon fell from Grace, into a ſtate of total Darkneſs; as by his own account appears, in the following Words: <q>The reſidue of that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002809_0034_0FE6402AD65E0748"/>Week, (<hi>ſays he</hi>) I walked in Darkneſs and deep Diſtreſs; for as I was without Light, ſo I was without Comfort.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is very obſervable, that as God had comforted and ſupported him in the time of his Suffering, while he continued inſtant in Prayer and faithfulneſs to God; ſo upon his forſaking God, and embracing the things of this World, God leaves him in darkneſs and deep diſtreſs. This is no other than the Scriptures abundantly ſhew us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him; if we deny him, he alſo will deny us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 23d. he tells us, <q>that at the end of three Weeks, he made a Publick Recantation, which the Church accepting, received him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Charity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice, That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon his Apoſtacy, and returning back into the ſpirit of the World, he is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the favour of thoſe <hi>Iſhmaelitiſh</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, who as he tells us in page 13th. a few days before this were Curſing him in the Streets, and wiſhing him dead: and by mockings &amp; other abuſes miniſtred ſuch Provocations to him, that one would think nothing but a Stock or Stone would have been ſilent under.</p>
            <p>And in page 15th. he gives us an account, how that the firſt Night in which he fell into the hands of thoſe cruel Perſecutors, they were like to have Murthered him in the Priſon, had not <hi>J. R.</hi> and his Company prevented, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 24th. he tells us, <q>That ſtill after all there remained heavy upon him the guilt of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002809_0035_0FE6402D864E51A0"/>Sin and great Darkneſs, and uncertainty about his ſpiritual Eſtate. I trembled (<hi>ſays he</hi>) at the thoughts of thoſe miſerable <hi>Jews</hi> who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Wilderneſs, through the juſt Wrath of God, after their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and never ſaw the good Land.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo in the ſame page he adds as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In my darkneſs I applied to my ſelf almoſt in diſpair, what God ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 9.16. <hi>For this Cauſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my wonders in thee.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Page 25th. (<hi>ſays he</hi>) <q>Theſe deep diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were alſo accompanied with the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Temptations; through the force whereof I was ready to Envy the Salvation of others. This ſtartled me as what carryed in it the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of Satan.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In page 30th. he adds, <q>That for divers years after, he was frequently aſſaulted with Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to call all in queſtion over again, to conſider whether I had not apoſtatized from Chriſt and his Truth, which has been no ſmall annoyance, and the cauſe of a great deal of trouble to me, (<hi>ſays he.</hi>)</q>
            </p>
            <p>And thus having briefly gone through the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which he gives us of his recovery out of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> I ſhall not trouble the Reader with any Expoſition upon it; judging it ſo plain of it ſelf, that every Chriſtian Reader will be at no loſs to ſee that what he calls his being led into <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> was a gracious Call and Invitation of God to his Soul, and had he remained faithful to God, and not fainted under his Perſecutions, he might have been a happy Man. And alſo what
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002809_0036_0FE6402D88D33760"/>he calls his recovery from <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> may as plainly be ſeen to be his Apoſtacy. And by the great darkneſs and horror that attended him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon his Apoſtacy, I underſtand it to be the ſame that attended <hi>Cain, Saul, Judas, Francis Spira,</hi> &amp;c. and is largely threatned againſt Apoſtates in the 10th. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 26, 27. verſes. <hi>For if we Sin wilfully after that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins, but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Adverſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall add one Inſtance more for the better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Reader, that what he calls his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> was his Apoſtacy; &amp; that is his ſending to the General Aſſembly at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven,</hi> to inform them, that he had found out the wonderful Art of <hi>Longitude,</hi> which had been hid from Mankind ſince the World began: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Aſſembly to fit and furniſh him for a Voyage to <hi>England,</hi> that he might diſcover the fame to the Crown, from whom he expected a vaſt Reward. But the Aſſembly not being taken with his Notion, and he ſoon finding himſelf deceived, betook himſelf to Pleading Caſes in the <hi>Common Law</hi> for a living which Calling he follows to this day.</p>
            <p>Now according to Chriſt's Doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21. <hi>For where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo,</hi> it is evident that <hi>P. P</hi>'s. Heart and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were now ſet upon Earthly and Carnal Things, and were not in that ſpiritual Frame as when he forſook his Wife, and all Worldly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments that he might pleaſe God, and gain a treaſure in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:002809_0037_0FE64033C106BDB8"/>
Alſo the Spirit that he was led by in the time of his Sufferings, cauſed the World to perſecute, mock and revile him; but the Spirit that enters into him immediately upon his Apoſtacy, unites him to the World again.</p>
            <p>Alſo this Spirit which re-enters into him upon his Apoſtacy, could not be of God, becauſe it was a falſe Spirit, as appears by its deceiving him in the matter of <hi>Longitude,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And ſo leaving what is aboveſaid to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Reader, I ſhall proceed to his next Article, which is ſeveral <hi>Songs</hi> compoſed in Verſe, in which he pretends to praiſe God for his Recovery out of the Errors of <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is no other than Apoſtates and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites were ever wont to do, I mean, hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to imitate God's People in their Songs and Praiſes to God; as may be ſeen <hi>Amos</hi> 6.5. <hi>That Chant to the ſound of the Viol, and invent to themſelves Inſtruments of Muſick like David,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now ſome of the Sins which thoſe Hypocrites were charged with, who were thus imitating <hi>David</hi> in his Praiſes to God, may be ſeen in the 5th. Chap. of this Propheſie of <hi>Amos,</hi> at the 12th. Verſe. <hi>For I know your manifold Tranſgreſſions, and your mighty Sins: they afflict the juſt, they take a Bribe, &amp; they turn aſide the Poor in the gate from their Right.</hi> And in the 23d. verſe ſaith the Lord, <hi>Take thou away from me the noiſes of thy Songs, for I will not hear the Melody of thy Viols; but let Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment run down as Waters, and Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream.</hi> From which Scripture we may obſerve, that thoſe apoſtatized Hypocrites whoſe Songs the Lord thus abhorred, were ſuch as by
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002809_0038_0FE640341E1D5DA8"/>taking Bribes procured unrighteous Judgments, whereby the <hi>Poor were turned aſide from their Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now as to his <hi>Songs</hi> and other Verſes, I ſhall be very brief, only mentioning ſome of the groſs Blaſphemies which they contain, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but all ſober Chriſtians, together with my ſelf, will abhor ſuch Prophaneſs as may be ſeen in Page 36th. and is as follows.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>That Sacramental Bond</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>by which my Soul was ty'd</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To Chriſt in Baptiſm, I caſt off,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>and baſely Vilifi'd.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I ſuffer'd to be waſh'd</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>(as Satan inſtituted)</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My Body, ſo my Soul thereby,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>became the more polluted.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>Now I ſuppoſe he intends by that <hi>Sacramental Bond,</hi> by which he ſays his Soul was ty'd to Chriſt, that non-ſcriptural Practice of ſprinkling a little Water out of a Baſon on his Face, in his unregenerate ſtate. Now the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſhew us, that the Spirit of God is the Bond by which God's Children are ſealed or united to him; as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> Eph. 4.3. <hi>Endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi> Verſe 30 <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the day of Redemption.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.24. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we know that he abideth in us, by the ſpirit which he hath given us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:002809_0039_0FE6403893E65088"/>
Thus it plainly appears, that it is the Spirit of God which is the Bond by which God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are united to Chriſt, and not by ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a little elementary Water on their Face, as <hi>P. P.</hi> has ignorantly and blaſphemouſly aſſerted.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Whereas he ſays, <q>He ſuffered his Body to be waſhed as Satan inſtituted:</q> I ſuppoſe he intends his being Baptiſed according to the Rule of Scripture, of which he gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in page 18. how that he was ſtirred up to ſubmit to this Ordinance from thoſe Words, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>And now why tarrieſt thou? ariſe and be Baptiſed and Waſh away thy Sins.</hi> And that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he was Baptiſed by burying his Body in the Water.</p>
            <p>This is according to the Rule given us in Scripture, relating to the Adminiſtration of this Ordinance of Baptiſm, as may be ſeen <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm. Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe this Ordinance could not be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Adminiſtred without a ſufficiency of Water to bury the Perſon in, we read <hi>John</hi> 3.23. That <hi>John</hi> was Baptiſing in <hi>Enon</hi> near <hi>Salim,</hi> becauſe there was much Water there.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> As to the firſt Inſtitutor of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we know that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was the firſt practiſer of it; therefore let us take his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony as to the Inſtitutor of it, which is to be ſeen <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.33. <hi>And I knew him not, but he that ſent me to Baptiſe with Water, the ſame ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And here I ſuppoſe none but <hi>P. P.</hi> will dare to deny that it was God Almighty that inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002809_0040_0FE64038961B8008"/>this Ordinance, and ſent <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> to adminiſter it.</p>
            <p>Joh. 3.22. <hi>After theſe things came Jeſus and his Diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarried with them, and baptiſed.</hi> Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and teach all nations, baptiſing them,</hi> &amp;c. By all which Scriptures it is evident, that it was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that inſtituted <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and not Satan, as <hi>P. P.</hi> has blaſphemouſly aſſerted.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall proceed to his ſecond Chap. wherein he pretends to give an account of the principal Heads of <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi> As to this Chap. I ſhall not give any particular Anſwer, and that for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Becauſe <hi>J. R.</hi> in his life-time did large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſh his Principles in Print, and therefore I ſhall refer the Reader to his Books; which will ſufficiently diſcover the abuſes done him by <hi>P. P.</hi> now after his Death. And if there be any Perſons that have not ſeen his Books, and are deſirous to be ſatisfied in this matter, I have ſufficient by me to ſupply them.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> Reaſon is, Becauſe his account is ſo confuſed, ſelf-contradictory and falſe, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no Anſwer. And for the proof of this, take theſe following Inſtances.</p>
            <p>In page 48. he tells the Reader as follows: <q>But <hi>Rogers</hi> held three Ordinances of Religious uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, the Lord's Supper, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands. <hi>Of Worſhip in general.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All Worſhip is in the Heart only, and there are no external Forms in which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Rogers.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Here the Reader may obſerve, that firſt he owns that <hi>Rogers</hi> held three external Ordinances,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002809_0041_0FE640440BC398C0"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, the Lord's Supper, and impoſition of Hands; and in the very next Words forgets himſelf and tells the Reader, that <hi>Rogers</hi> held all Worſhip to be in the Heart only, and that there was no external Forms. See how plainly he contradicts himſelf.</p>
            <p>Page 46. he ſays as follows, Of <hi>Sanctification, Mortification and Perfection.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Sanctification is a perfect cleanſing from Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If <hi>P. P.</hi> will dare to ſay, that a Perſon which is perfectly cleanſed from Sin, is not in a ſtate of Sanctification, I think the World will condemn his Darkneſs; and if he owns it, why then doth he charge it as an Error upon <hi>J. R.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Says he, <hi>The place of it is before Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Here he charges <hi>J. R.</hi> with an Error, for holding that the place of Sanctification is before Juſtification.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, If God ſhould juſtify a Sinner before he Sanctifies him, then ſurely he muſt juſtify him while he remains under the guilt of his Sins, which is both contrary to the pure and holy nature of God, and to the holy Scriptures, as may be ſeen <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving Iniquity Tranſgreſſion and Sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> Exod. 23.7. <hi>Keep thee far from a falſe matter, and the Innocent and Righteous ſlay thou not, for I will not Juſtify the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which Scriptures it is evident that the place of Sanctification is before Juftification, (otherwiſe God muſt juſtify the wicked.)</p>
            <p>Page 49. Speaking of Goſpel Miniſters, at the third Particular, ſays he, <hi>They muſt labour
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002809_0042_0FE640440F817F68"/>with their hands, for the ſupport of themſelves and others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here I think he does <hi>J. R.</hi> great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, by charging him with this Error, which if it be an Error, he ought to have charged it on the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was the Perſon that gave the command to Goſpel Miniſters, as may be ſeen <hi>Acts</hi> 20. At the 17th verſe we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that from <hi>Miletus</hi> he ſent to <hi>Epheſus</hi> and called the Elders of the Church. And verſe 33, 34. he ſets before theſe Elders or Goſpel Miniſters, his own Example, in theſe words, <hi>I have coveted no Man's Silver, or Gold, or Apparel: ye your ſelves know that theſe Hands have miniſtred to my neceſſitics, and to them that were with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 35th verſe he orders them to do the like, minding them of the words of the Lord Jeſus, as follows.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed you all things, how that ſo labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye ought to ſupport the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give than to receive.</p>
            <p>By which Scripture it is plain that it was <hi>Paul</hi> that gave this order to the Goſpel Miniſters, and ought not to be charged as an Error upon <hi>J. R.</hi>
            </p>

I ſhall boldly appeal to all Mankind who had Converſation with him in his life-time, for that they well know it to be utterly falſe: And for the Satisfaction of ſuch as had not acquaintance with him, I ſhall refer them to his Books, and particularly in this Point to his Expoſition on the <hi>Revelations,</hi> beginning at page 232. where he largely ſets forth the Reſurrection of the Body, both of the Juſt and unjuſt, and of the Eternal Judgment which God ſhall then paſs upon all both ſmall and great, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which ſufficiently proves <hi>P. P.</hi> guilty of Slandering and Belying a dead Man, a Crime generally abhorred by all ſober People, and ſo I ſhall paſs to his 3d. Chap. Judging that by theſe few Remarks which have been taken, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may plainly ſee, that the account he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give of <hi>J. R.'s</hi> Principles is ſo falſe and ſelf-contradictory, that it deſerves no Anſwer at all; and that it was great folly in <hi>P. P.</hi> ſo to expoſe himſelf, as to pretend to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>J. R.</hi>'s Principles in ſuch a falſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſince <hi>J. R.</hi> himſelf has largely publiſhed his own Principles in print; which Books are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and will fully ſatisfy every one that deſires Satisfaction in that matter, of what I have here aſſerted.</p>
            <p>And now we are come to his third Chap, which begins as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Giving an account of the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>J. R.'s</hi> boaſting of his Sufferings: And offering ſome Advice to ſuch as hold his Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:002809_0044_0FE6404A54CDD228"/>
               <p>I purpoſe (<hi>ſays he</hi>) in this laſt Chapter, to make a few Remarks upon ſome of <hi>J. R.</hi>'s Sufferings, and the Cauſes of them; to the end it may be known, that his Sufferings were not Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor for his Religion and Conſcience, as he vainly and falſly boaſted, and as ſome 'tis like have believed.</p>
               <p>But that really he was himſelf a Perſecutor, and that his Sufferings were the demerits of his horrid Immoralities and Impieties.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that he mentioned on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Sufferings, was the divorcing his <hi>Wife</hi> from him. To which I anſwer, that the cauſe of it was his Adultery, Beaſtiality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which he had lived for divers years, as he boaſted, and endeavoured partly to Juſtify.</p>
               <p>If any in his behalf object, that the proof was inſufficient, I anſwer, that neither they nor I are competent to judge of that. And farther, that upon his Tryal, he never denied a tittle of the Charge, and out of Court always own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and particularly to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who was his Council, but thereupon deſerted him, and gave an Evidence againſt him.</p>
               <p>And for the Proof of this, I refer the Reader to the Records and Files in the Secretary's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at <hi>Hartford.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> As to this firſt charge of <hi>P. P.</hi> againſt <hi>J. R.</hi> I ſhall firſt affirm &amp; then prove, that every Article of it is poſitively falſe.</p>
            <p>But before I come to my Proof, I ſhall give the Reader a true account concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the firſt difference between <hi>J. R.</hi> and his Wife, as I received it from their own Mouths,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002809_0045_0FE640553B06BF90"/>they never differing in any material Point as to the account they gave about it.</p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſs, that it is a hard task for me to give a true Relation of this matter; for that it will ſo much expoſe the Adulterous Life which my dear Mother was drawn into by thoſe wicked Perſons, who were the cauſe of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</p>
            <p>And although I did faithfully and in the fear of God labour with her in her life-time, by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her to forſake her Adulterous Life and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Companions, yet ſince her death, ſhould have been glad to have heard no more about it, had not <hi>P. P.</hi> like a bad Bird <hi>befowled his own Neſt,</hi> by raking in the Graves of the dead, and by publiſhing ſuch notorious Lies againſt them, <hi>whom the Clods of the Valley forbid to anſwer for themſelves:</hi> For which cauſe I am compelled to give a true account concerning thoſe things, which are as follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Rogers</hi> and his Wife were both brought up in the <hi>New-England</hi> way of Worſhip, never being acquainted with any other Sect; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were zealous of the Form which they had been brought up in, yet were wholly ignorant as to the work of Regeneration, until by a fore Affliction which <hi>J. R.</hi> met with, it pleaſed God to lay before his Conſideration the vanity of all Earthly things, and the neceſſity of making his Peace with God, and getting an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, which he now applies himſelf to ſeek for, by earneſt Prayer to God in ſecret, and according to Chriſt's words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002809_0046_0FE64055465648B0"/>find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And he coming to witneſs the truth of theſe Scriptures, by Gods giving him a new heart and another Spirit, and by remitting the guilt of his Sins, did greatly engage him to love God with all his heart, and his Neighbour as himſelf, as did appear by his warning all People he met with to make their Peace with God, declaring what God had done for his Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now his Wife obſerving the great Change which was wrought in her Husband, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his fervent Prayers, continual ſearching the Scriptures, and daily diſcourſing about the things of God to all Perſons he met with, and particularly to her, perſwading her to forſake her vain Converſation and make her peace with God, did greatly ſtir her up to ſeek to God by earneſt Prayer, that he would work the ſame work of Grace in her Soul, as ſhe ſaw and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be wrought in her Husband. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time it pleaſed God, graciouſly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her Prayers, by ſending the Spirit of his Son into her Heart, whereby ſhe was able to cry, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> The Spirit of God it ſelf bearing witneſs with her Spirit, that ſhe was a Child of God; according to what is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16.</p>
            <p>And now her Husband and her ſelf, came to be united together in a double Bond of love; for before this there was only the love that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man and his Wife, but now there was the love of the Brotherhood, even that love by
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002809_0047_0FE640564A38DDF8"/>which God's Children are united together. And in this unity they lived together ſeveral Months, witneſſing both to ſmall and great what God had done for their Souls.</p>
            <p>But after ſome time, upon their diligent ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Scriptures, they began to doubt of ſome of the Principles which they had tradition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been brought up in; and particularly that of ſprinkling Infants, which they had been taught to call <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but now they find it to be only an invention of Men, and neither Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Example in Scripture for it: Upon which they bore a publick Teſtimony againſt it, which ſoon cauſed a great uprore in the Country. And their Relations, together with their Neighbours, and indeed the World in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral who had any opportunity, were all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in perſwading them that it was a Spirit of Error, by which they were deluded: But the main Inſtrument which Satan at length made uſe of to deceive <hi>J. R.</hi>'s Wife, was her own natural Mother, who by giving her Daughter an account of her own Converſion, as ſhe called it, and telling her Daughter there was no ſuch great Change in the Work of Converſion, as they had met with; but that it was the Devil had tranſformed himſelf as an Angel of Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And at length fully perſwaded her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to believe that it was even ſo. Whereupon ſhe ſoon publickly recanted, and renounced that Spirit which ſhe had been led by, and declared it to be the Spirit of the Devil; and then vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently perſwaded her Husband to do the like; telling him with bitter Tears, that unleſs he
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002809_0048_0FE640564CB5A598"/>would renounce that Spirit, ſhe dare not live with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he conſtantly telling her that he knew it to be the Spirit of God, and that to deny it would be to deny God, which he dare not do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon ſhe left her Husband, taking her two Children with her, and with the help of her Relations went to her Fathers Houſe, about eighteen miles diſtant from her Husband's Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And I do ſolemnly declare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that this is a true Relation of their firſt ſeparation, as I received it from their own Mouths; as alſo by the Teſtimony of <hi>Daniel Stubbins</hi> and <hi>Mary Tubs,</hi> two of their next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is fully proved, whoſe Teſtimonies are in the foregoing part of this Book.</p>
            <p>And ſo having left her Husband upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Religion, as has been declared, and Renouncing her Profeſſion, ſhe ſoon returned into her vain Converſation, and let in a flood of Malice againſt her Husbaud. For as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is an Ordinance of God, and is often made uſe of in Scripture to ſet forth the union that is between Chriſt and his Church; ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, where Satan has ever made a breach in that Relation, it is commonly followed with a greater degree of Enmity than is common in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes. For ſoon after ſhe had left her Husband, ſhe declared, that he had given her an account of his former Courſe of Life in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſtate, how he had been the worſt of Sinners, and guilty of many groſs acts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, which ſhe ſaid he had particulariſed
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002809_0049_0FE6405B400FD6B0"/>to her, and which ſhe now makes a Catalogue of, and preſents to the Authority by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt her Husband; whereupon her Husband was ſeized by an Officer, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Hartford</hi> Goal, for a Tryal at the next Court of Aſſiſtants, where ſhe appeared and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her Oath to confirm the truth of what ſhe had charged him with.</p>
            <p>But the Court obſerving what an imbittered ſpirit ſhe was in againſt her Husband, refuſed to give her her Oath to any one Article of her Complaints; yet her Complaints were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Grand Jury, with all the Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſeveral Attorney's who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for her could invent; But the Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry judging the Charges of a prejudiced Woman againſt her Husband to be of no weight, ſoon returned <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> and that they found not the Bill againſt him. Whereupon the Court granted him Goal delivery, and ſo he was never brought to any Tryal. And for the proof of this, take the following Copy of Record.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And now having given a true and impartial Account of the firſt cauſe of <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s Wife leaving her Husband, and alſo the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002809_0051_0FE6405F48A689E0"/>that were in that matter, ſo far as to the Bill of Divorce.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall make Reply to the ſeveral notorious Falſhoods aſſerted by <hi>P. P.</hi> concerning this matter.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that I ſhall obſerve is, that he poſitively aſſerts, that the cauſe of the divorc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wife from him, was his Adultery, Beaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which he had lived for divers years, as he Boaſted, and endeavoured partly to juſtify, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I think I may boldly conclude that he has reference to theſe charges laid againſt <hi>J. R.</hi> by his Wife; and the reaſon why I may well conclude he means ſo, is becauſe I never heard or underſtood that ever he was charged with any Miſdemeanour in his life before that time.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>P. P.</hi> boldly to affirm, that the cauſe of the Divorce was for his Adultery and Beaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, when the Divorce it ſelf nor any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord alledges any ſuch thing to be the Reaſon; and alſo the Record of that matter proves that he was acquitted by the Grand Jury, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt by the Court, without ſo much as being brought to a Tryal. All which proves <hi>P. P</hi>'s. charge to be abominably falſe.</p>
            <p>In the next place he adds as follows.</p>
            <p>If any in his behalf object, That the proof was inſufficient, I anſwer, that neither they nor I are competent to judge of that.</p>
            <p>Here he confeſſes that he is not competent to judge whether the proof was ſufficient or not.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That the Jury who had the hearing of it, were competent to judge of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002809_0052_0FE6405F4AAFAC08"/>it, and accordingly did, and have left their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Record, which is the only Rule for all other Perſons to judge by.</p>
            <p>But then how abominable is it for <hi>P.P.</hi> who confeſſes himſelf not capable to judge of it, yet has preſumed to judge and condemn a dead Man, in a matter wherein the Court had juſtified him fifty Years paſt, and I ſuppoſe near ten Years before <hi>P. P.</hi> was born: And <hi>farther,</hi> (ſays he, ſpeaking of <hi>J. R.) that upon his Tryal, he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied a tittle of the Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This is another poſitive Falſhood, in that <hi>J. R.</hi> was never brought upon any Tryal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matter, as has been ſufficiently proved already, yet I confeſs that upon his Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he did not deny any one tittle of his Wife's charges, which is no token of a guilty Perſon. He taking his Example from the innocent Lamb of God, who upon his Examination did the like, as may be ſeen, <hi>Mat. 27.13, 14. Then ſaid Pilate unto him, Heareſt thou not how many things they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt thee? And he anſwered him to never a word, in ſo much that the Governour marvelled great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that it was the Example of Chriſt to do the like, &amp; it is well known through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, that guilty Perſons are never wanting in denying the Crime they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with. Beſides this <hi>J. R.</hi> ſaw that the Court refuſed to give his Wife her Oath to her char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt him, and therefore it was no Witneſs in Law, and altogether needleſs for him to deny it, ſo long as no Witneſs was taken againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:002809_0053_0FE640679E4680E8"/>
He alſo aſſerts that <hi>J. R.</hi> always owned the charge out of Court, and in particular to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who was his Counſel, but thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him, and gave an Evidence againſt him.</p>
            <p>Before I make any particular Anſwer to theſe laſt Aſſertions, I ſhall give an account concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Edwards</hi> which he mentions: And firſt, I ſuppoſe <hi>P. P.</hi> by not mentioning his Chriſtian Name, would have the Reader believe him to be <hi>Richard Edwards,</hi> late of <hi>Hartford,</hi> deceaſed, who was a ſober Man, given to no Vice, as I know of.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Edwards</hi> which tendered an Evidence againſt <hi>J. R.</hi> was one <hi>William Edwards,</hi> a Man notoriouſly given to Drink, as is well known to all the ancient Dwellers at <hi>Hartford.</hi> This Man was never employed by <hi>J. R.</hi> to be his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; yet he informed the Court, that <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Friends deſired him to ſpeak in his behalf; whereupon the Court admitted him. But <hi>J. R.</hi> not rewarding him as he expected he would, he drew up an Evidence againſt him, wherein he declared, that <hi>J. R.</hi> had confeſſed to him a groſs act of Uncleanneſs: But <hi>J. R.</hi> affirming his Evidence to be ſalſe, and deſiring the Court to interrogate him as to the Time and Place, which accordingly they did; and he ſaid it was at <hi>Hartford,</hi> naming the day of the Month; and the Judges of the Court well knowing that <hi>J. R.</hi> was at the ſame time at <hi>New-London,</hi> which is fifty Miles diſtant from <hi>Hartford,</hi> did ſharply check him and command him out of the Court, which I think was a moderate Puniſhment for ſuch a Crime. And this I am told by them that
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002809_0054_0FE64067A74D37E0"/>were preſent and ſaw it; yet for my own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I went to <hi>Hartford</hi> on purpoſe to ſee it, and according did ſee it among the Complaints of <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Wife, his Oath not being given to it: Which evidenced the truth of what I had heard about it.</p>
            <p>And now as to <hi>P. P</hi>'s. aſſerting that <hi>J. R.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways owned the Charge out of Court, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to Mr. <hi>Edwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I charge to be a Falſhood, and for the proof of it, I ſhall refer to the Judgment of all who know the Duty of Grand Jurors, and the Cuſtom of Courts, who well underſtand, that if there had been but one Evidence given under Oath to the Grand Jury, that they had heard <hi>J. R.</hi> own out of Court, that he was guilty of any ſuch Fact as <hi>P. P.</hi> alledges, they could not by their Oaths have acquitted him, (as they did) but muſt have return'd <hi>Billevera,</hi> and he muſt have been brought to a Tryal: Which is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident proof that this is another Faſhood.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, he refers the Reader for proof to the Files and Records in the Secretary's Office in <hi>Hartford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This is an unreaſonable Impoſition upon the Readers, in putting them upon a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Hartford,</hi> there to ſearch the Records for fifty Years ſtanding, or they muſt remain as ignorant as they were before they ſaw his Book.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt confeſs it is the wiſeſt Speech in his Book, ſince none will take the pains to do it; and ſo he hopes to conceal his Lies to the World's end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:002809_0055_0FE63F8E83145868"/>
And now I cannot but take notice of <hi>P. P.</hi>'s great Folly, in proving his own Illegitimacy to the World, in aſſerting, that the Divorce was on the account of his Beaſtiality; which if <hi>J. R.</hi> had been guilty of, every Child that can read the Scripture, knows he ought to have been put to Death by the Law of God, whereby his Wife would have been lawfully divorced from him, and might have been married to another Man, and not have been called an Adultereſs; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.2, 3. <hi>For the Woman which hath an Husband, is bound by the law to her Husband ſo long as he liveth: but if the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand be dead, ſhe is looſed from the law of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. So then if while her Husband liveth, ſhe be married to another Man, ſhe ſhall be called an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>P. P.</hi> has been left to act as ſometimes it hath happened to Thieves, who in the time of their Theft, have been ſo much concerned to watch where they expect moſt Danger, and thereby neglecting to look round them, have been ſurpriſed and taken at unawares: So <hi>P. P.</hi> by watching all Opportunities to miſchief the dead Man, which he is fighting with, has neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to look round him, and thereby has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf a <hi>Baſtard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having fairly proved <hi>P. P</hi>'s. char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt <hi>J. R.</hi> to be poſitively falſe in every Article, I ſhall obſerve to the Reader, how plain it appears that <hi>P. P</hi>'s. end in publiſhing thoſe Scandals againſt <hi>J. R.</hi> was only to expoſe his Perſon, and not his Religion, ſince thoſe charges laid againſt him by his Wife, had only reference
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002809_0056_0FE64069A40B8DE8"/>to the time in which he was a Member in the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> Church in <hi>New-Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and therefore could be no blemiſh to the Profeſſion which he lived and dyed in after his ſeparation from that Church; by which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that his Malice is only againſt the dead Man's Perſon.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall proceed to give the Reader an Account of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful event that followed upon granting of this unlawful Divorce, which was firſt her Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>P. P.</hi> the reputed Father of the preſent <hi>P. P.</hi> with whom I am now concerned: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time, having a Child by the ſaid <hi>Pratt,</hi> ſhe was remarkably ſmitten by the Hand of God, and the Child taken away by Death, as was <hi>David</hi>'s Child by <hi>Uriah</hi>'s Wife, and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be a monument of Diſtreſs for many Months, not being able to help or raiſe her ſelf off the Bed on which ſhe lay. In which time of her Diſtreſs, ſhe alſo fell into ſore horror and trouble of Conſcience on account of her Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>P. P.</hi> after which time I never heard her juſtify her ſelf concerning that matter, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than ſaying, the Authority was guilty of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And although theſe things were the publick diſcourſe of the Country in the time of it, yet becauſe I would not fill this Volume with more Evidences than needs muſt, I ſhall prove my aſſertion out of the Town-Records of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Towns where ſhe Recorded her ſelf the Daughter of <hi>Matthew Griſwould,</hi> after ſhe was Married to <hi>P. P.</hi> which is an evident Proof that ſhe did not eſteem her Marriage to be Lawful.

            <p>Thus it appears, that the Authority was ſo far from returning <hi>J. R.</hi> his son again, as <hi>P. P.</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:002809_0064_0FE6407971F6DCF0"/>has falſly affirmed, that they did their endeavour to take him away again, after his Mother had ſent him.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page ſays he,</p>
            <p>
               <q>For theſe two Reaſons he has unſpeakably railed upon and vilified the Authority of the Government, charging them with Adultery in the former, and Perſecution in both.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here I muſt confeſs, that according to my Judgment, there is as much truth contained in this laft Paragraph as in any part of his Book; for if the Railing and Reviling was unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then it was never ſpoken by <hi>J. R.</hi> which Conſtruction I doubt not but will be the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Perſons who had acquaintance with him in his life-time; for it is well known that he was no Railer or Reviler.</p>
            <p>And well might he charge the Authority with his Wive's Adultery, ſince they were the only cauſe of leading her into it, by divorcing her from her lawful Husband, and giving no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they did it, and then marrying her to another Man, while her Husband lived; which was the occaſion that both her ſelf and the Man that ſhe was married to after her Divorce, ſo publickly confeſſed their living together to be Adultery, as has already been proved.</p>
            <p>And for as much as the Authority of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment did deprive him of his Wife, without giving any Reaſon why they did it; which is a ſufficient proof that it was only for his Religion; and alſo did deprive him of his Children upon the account of his Religion, as has been proved by the Record of Court; well might he charge
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002809_0065_0FE6407C66B4E3C8"/>them with Perſecution in both.</p>
            <p>In Page 56th he goes on as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Another Suffering that he gloried in, was his Whippings and Impriſonments; of which to ſpeak particularly, and to ſhew the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſes of them, would tire my ſelf &amp; you. Wherefore let it ſuffice to affirm, that great part of his Impriſonment at <hi>Hartford,</hi> was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrong ſuſpicion of his being acceſſary to the burning <hi>New-London</hi> Meeting-Houſe.</q>

               <hi>Reply,</hi> As to this laſt Charge againſt <hi>J.

            <p>And that this long Impriſonment was for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to give a Bond of <hi>fifty Pounds,</hi> which he declared he could not in Conſcience do, and to pay a Fine of <hi>five Pounds,</hi> which he refuſed to do; for which Reaſons he was kept a Priſoner from the time of his firſt Commitment, three Years and eight Months, and then ſet at liberty by open Proclamation, is ſo fully proved by the Records of <hi>Hartford,</hi> that I preſume none will dare to contradict.</p>

            <p>Thus it plainly appears, that this Affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning <hi>New-London</hi> Meeting-Houſe, is a poſitive Falſhood.</p>
            <p>He ſtill goes on as follows. <q>His Whippings there were for moſt audacious Contempt of Authority; his ſitting on the Gallows was for
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002809_0067_0FE64082000AF898"/>blaſphemous Words; and in ſhort, he never ſuffered the loſs of one Hair of his Head by the Authority, for any Article of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor for the Exerciſe of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Firſt, he aſſerts, that his Whippings there, <hi>(viz.)</hi> at <hi>Hartford,</hi> were for moſt audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Contempt of Authority, but doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Reader what the Contempt was; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf the Judge as well as the Witneſs, whenas it was only his Buſineſs to have proved what the Contempt was, and to have left the Judgment to the Reader. And for as much as his aſſertion is altogether unintelligible, ſo may it reaſonably be expected that my Anſwer muſt be by ſuppoſition, and is as follows.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe he intends that Barbarous Cruelty which was acted on <hi>J. R.</hi> while he was a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Hartford</hi> in the time of his long Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above mentioned, which was ſo contrary to the Laws of God and Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> that I never could find that they made a Record of that matter, according to Chriſt's Words, <hi>John</hi> 3.20. <hi>For every one that doeth Evil, hateth the light,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But <hi>J. R.</hi> has given a large Relation about it, as may be ſeen in his Book entituled, <hi>A mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night Cry from the Temple of God to the ten Virgins,</hi> from page 13. to 15. where he aſſerts, that he was taken out of Priſon he knew not for what, and tied to the Carriage of a great Gun, where he had ſeventy ſix ſtripes on his naked Body, with a Whip much larger than the lines of a Drum, with knots at the ends as big as a Walnut, and in that maimed Condition returned to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002809_0068_0FE6408202EE4A38"/>again; and his Bed which he had hired at a dear Rate taken from him, and not ſo much as Straw allowed him to lie on, it being on the 18th. day of the eighth Month called <hi>October,</hi> &amp; very cold Weather.</p>
            <p>And although my ſelf with a multitude of Spectators who were preſent at <hi>Hartford,</hi> and ſaw this cruel Act, can teſtify to the truth of the account which he gives of it, yet I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Reader on what account it was that he ſuffered it, or what he was charged with; for as I ſaid before, I never could find a Record of that matter.</p>
            <p>But if it was for Contempt of Authority, as <hi>P. P.</hi> aſſerts, then I think thoſe that inflicted ſuch a Puniſhment were more guilty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt God, than <hi>J. R.</hi> was of Contempt againſt the Authority; for God in his holy Law has ſtrictly commanded Judges not to exceed forty ſtripes on any account, as may be ſeen <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.3. So that for Judges to exceed forty ſtripes, is high Contempt againſt God.</p>
            <p>In the next place he adds, that his ſitting on the Gallows was for blaſphemous Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here again he ought to have informed the Reader what the Words were, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs would have been more ſatisfaction to the Reader, than for <hi>P. P.</hi> to make himſelf both Witneſs and Judge, and ſo leave nothing for the Readers to do, but to remain as ignorant as they were before they ſaw his Book.</p>
            <p>And he might as well have ſaid of the Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> that his ſuffering was for blaſphemous Words, as what he ſays of <hi>J. R.</hi> for it was but
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002809_0069_0FE5F87BD22BC778"/>the judgment of <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Perſecutors, that the words were blaſphemous, and ſo it was the judgment of the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Perſecutors that he was guilty of ſpeaking blaſphemous words, as may be ſeen <hi>Acts</hi> 6.13. <hi>This Man ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to ſpeak blaſphemous Words,</hi> &amp;c. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they put him to Death.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall give the Reader an account what theſe words were, for which <hi>J. R.</hi> was charged with Blaſphemy, the account of which here follows.</p>
            <p>He being at a Houſe in <hi>New-London,</hi> where there were many Perſons preſent, was giving a deſcription of the ſtate of an unregenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and alſo of the ſtate of a ſanctified Perſon; wherein he alledged, that the Body of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Perſon was a Body of Sin, and that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had his Habitation there.</p>
            <p>And on the contrary that the Body of a Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Perſon was Chriſt's Body, and that Chriſt dwelt in ſuch a Body. Whereupon one of the Company asked him, whether he intended the humane Body? to which he replyed, that he did intend the humane Body.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Perſon replied again, will you ſay that your humane Body is Chriſt's Body? to which he replied, (clapping his hand on his Breaſt) yes, I do affirm that this humane Body is Chriſt's Body, for Chriſt has purchaſed it with his precious Blood; and I am not my own, for I am bought with a price, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon two of the Perſons preſent gave their Teſtimony as follows: <q>We being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaw <hi>John Rogers</hi> clap his Hand on his
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002809_0070_0FE5F844007251A0"/>Breaſt and ſay, This is Chriſt's humane Body.</q> But they omitted the other Words which <hi>J. R.</hi> joyned with it. And becauſe I was very deſirous to have given thoſe Teſtimonies out of the Secretary's Office, I took a Journey to <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> on purpoſe, but the Secretary could not find them: yet for as much as my ſelf was preſent both when the Words were ſpoken, and alſo at the Tryal at <hi>Hartford,</hi> I am very confident that I have given them verbatim. And whether or no this was Blaſphemy, I deſire not to be the Judge, but am willing to leave the judgment to every unprejudiced and ſober Reader; and ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to his next aſſertion which is as follows. <q>And in ſhort, (ſays he) he never ſuffered the loſs of one hair of his Head by the Authority for any Article of his Religion, nor for the Exerciſe of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> In anſwer to this laſt extravagant Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, which the whole Neighbourhood knows to be falſe, I ſhall only mention the Cauſes of ſome few of his ſufferings, which I am ſure that both the Records and Neighbourhood will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the truth of.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place he loſt his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on the account of his Religion, as has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been fully proved.</p>
            <p>The next long Perſecution which both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his Society ſuffered for many years, was for refuſing to come to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; upon which account their Eſtates were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly deſtroyed, and their Bodies often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="unknown:002809_0071_0FE5F844D12246B8"/>
            <p>Alſo the multitude of Fines and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he ſuffered on the account of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing ſuch as deſired to be Baptiſed after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, by burying in the Water. All which Fines and Impriſonments were executed in the moſt Rigorous manner. Sometimes the Officer taking him in the dead of Winter, as he came wet out of the Water, committed him to Priſon without a ſpark of Fire, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruel acts which for brevity I muſt omit.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the many hundreds of Pounds which the Collectors have taken from him for the maintainance of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, which ſuffering he endured to the day of his Death, and which his Society ſtill ſuffers.</p>
            <p>But for as much as his ſufferings continued more than forty Years, and were ſo numerous, that I doubt not but to give a particular account of them, would fill a larger volume than was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Printed in <hi>New-England,</hi> I muſt deſiſt, and ſhall only mention the laſt ſuffering which he met with from the Authority on account of his Religion, and was but a little time before his Death, and is as follows. <hi>J. R.</hi> and divers of his Society having as good a Right to <hi>New-Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Meeting houſe as any of the Inhabitants of the Town, it being built by a publick Rate, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one paying their Proportion according to their Eſtate, did propoſe to hold his Meetings there at Noon-time, between the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Meetings, ſo as not to diſturb them in either of their Meetings; and accordingly we came to the Meeting-houſe, and finding their Meeting was not finiſhed, we ſtood without the door till they
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002809_0072_0FE5F8459FE9DC60"/>had ended and were come out, and then <hi>J. R.</hi> told the People that our coming was to hold our Meeting between their Meetings, and that we had no deſign to make any diſturbance, but would break up our Meeting as ſoon as they were ready for their After-noon Meeting. Whereupon ſeveral of the Neighbours manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their freedom in the matter; yet the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble came in the time of our Meeting, with an Order to break up our Meeting, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with his attendance violently laid hands on ſeveral of us, hauling Men and Women out of the Meeting like as <hi>Saul</hi> did in his unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtate, as may be ſeen <hi>Acts</hi> 3.3. And for no other Crime than what I have here truly related, <hi>J. R.</hi> was had to Court, and charged with a Riot, tho' all that he did was to expound a Chapter in the Bible, and all that his People did was to ſit ſtill and attend to his Expoſition, till the Conſtable with his Attendance made the Diſturbance, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>So that if my ſelf had been the Judge, as I was not, I ſhould have thought the Conſtable to have been guilty of the Riot, and not <hi>J. R.</hi> However <hi>J. R.</hi> was fined ten Shillings, for which the Officer firſt took ten Sheep, and then complained that they were not ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Fine and Charges, whereupon he came a ſecond time and took a milch Cow out of the Paſture on the ſame account, and ſo we heard no more about it, by which I ſuppoſe that the Cow and ten Sheep ſatisfied the Fine and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:002809_0073_0FE5F8466FA15C00"/>
And I mention this Article of his ſufferings, becauſe it was the laſt Fine that was laid on him, for he ſoon after dyed.</p>
            <p>But the ſame Spirit of Perſecution under which he ſuffered, is yet living among us; as is evident by what here follows. The laſt 5th. Month called <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1725. We were going to our Meeting, being eight of us in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it being the firſt day of the Week, the day which we uſually meet on, as well as the reſt of our Neighbours; and as we were in our way, we were taken up on the King's High-way, by order of <hi>Joſeph Backus,</hi> called a Juſtice of the Peace, and the next day, by his order, cruelly whipt with an unmerciful Inſtrument, by which our Bodies were exceedingly wounded and maimed; and the next firſt day following, as we were returning home from our Meeting, we were again three of us taken up on the King's High-way, by order of <hi>John Woodward</hi> and <hi>Eben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezer Weſt</hi> of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> called Juſtices of the Peace, and the next day by them ſentenced to be whipt, and were accordingly carried to the place of Execution, and ſtript in order to receive the Sentence; but there happening to be preſent ſome tender ſpirited People, who ſeeing the Wounds in our Bodies which we had received the Week before, paid the Fine, and ſo preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Puniſhment. Alſo the ſame <hi>John Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ſoon after this, committed two of our Brethren to Priſon, (<hi>viz</hi>) <hi>Richard Man</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha Man,</hi> for not attending the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although they declared it to be contrary to their Conſciences ſo to do. Neither have their
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002809_0074_0FE5F84745DAB3F8"/>Perſecutors allowed them one meal of Victua's, nor ſo much as Straw to lie on, all the time of their Impriſonment, altho' they are well known to be very poor Men.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Matter I was upon, which was to prove <hi>P. P</hi>'.s Aſſertion falſe, in ſaying <hi>J. R.</hi> never ſuffered the loſs of one Hair of his Head by the Authority, for any Article of his Religion, nor for the Exerciſe of it: Whenas all theſe Sufferings which I have mentioned, were for Articles of his Religion, and for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it. And had not <hi>P. P.</hi> been bereft as well of Common Reaſon as Conſcience, he would not have preſumed to have aſſerted ſuch a thing, which the generality of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood knows to be falſe.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall proceed to his 58th Page, where in his <hi>Iſhmaelitiſh</hi> Language he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give a Relation concerning <hi>J. R</hi>'.s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriage: But before I trace him in his Mocks and Scoffs, I ſhall give the Reader a true and impartial Account of that matter, which is as follows.</p>
            <p>After <hi>J. R</hi>'s. firſt Wife had leſt him on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Religion, as has already been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he remained ſingle for more than twenty five years, in hopes that ſhe would come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and forſake her unlawful Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But ſeeing no Change in her, he began to think of Marrying another Woman, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did agree upon Marriage with a Maid belonging to <hi>New-London,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Mary Ransford.</hi> And for as much as he could not in Conſcience conform to the Cuſtomary
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:002809_0075_0FE5F84816035870"/>Form of Marriage practiced in <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, having publickly oppoſed them, and openly in Court declared that he did utterly renounce all the viſible Worſhip of <hi>New-England,</hi> for more than twenty years before, upon which account he had loſt his Children, as has already been proved; and there being no Perſon in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that would Marry them in any other Form, they thereupon agreed to go into the County Court, and there declare their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: and accordingly they did ſo; he leading his Bride by the Hand into Court, where the Judges were ſitting, and a multitude of Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors preſent, and then deſired the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to take notice, that he took that Woman to be his Wife; his Bride alſo aſſenting to what he ſaid. Whereupon the Judge offered to Marry them in their Form, which <hi>J. R.</hi> refuſed, telling him that he had once been Married by their Authority, and by their Authority they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away his Wife again, and rendered him no Reaſon why they did it. Upon which account he looked at their Form of Marriage to be of no value, and therefore would be Married by their Form no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from the Court he went to the Governour's Houſe, with his Bride, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their Marriage to the Governour, who ſeemed to like it well enough, and wiſhed them much Joy, which is a uſual Compliment.</p>
            <p>And thus having given a true and impartial Relation of the manner of his Marriage to his ſecond Wife, which I doubt not but every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Perſon will judge as authentick as any Marriage that was ever made in <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony.</p>

               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:002809_0076_0FE5F848E58E9020"/>
In the next place I ſhall proceed to inform the Reader in what manner he came to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this his ſecond Wife, for after they had lived together about three years, and had had two Children, the Court had up <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Wife, &amp; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>arged her with Fornication, for having her laſt Child, pretending no other Reaſon, than that the Marriage was not Lawful; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon called her <hi>Mary Ransford,</hi> after her maiden Name.</p>
            <p>And then vehemently urged her to give her Oath who was the Father of her Child, which they charged to be by Fornication, her Husband ſtanding by her in the Court with the Child in his Arms, ſtrictly commanded her not to take the Oath, for theſe three following Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it was contrary to Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> Reaſon was, becauſe it was a vain Oath, in as much as they had been Married ſo publickly, and then lived together three years after, and that he himſelf did not deny his Child, nor did any Perſon doubt who was the Father of the Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> Reaſon was, he told her they laid a ſnare for her, and wanted her Oath to prove their Charge, which was, that the Child was by Fornication; ſo that her Swearing would be that he was the Father of that Child by Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſo it would not only be a Reproach to him and the Child, but alſo a falſe Oath, for as much as the Child was not by Fornication.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:002809_0077_0FE5F849B79435E0"/>
For theſe Reaſons he forbid her taking the Oath, but bid her tell the Court, that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was the Father of that Child in his Arms. He alſo told her in the Court, that if ſhe would be ruled by him, he would defend her from any damage.</p>
            <p>But if ſhe would joyn with the Court againſt him, by being a Witneſs that the Child was by Fornication, he ſhould ſcruple to own her any more as a Wife.</p>
            <p>But the Court continuing to urge her to take the Oath, promiſing her favour if ſhe took it, &amp; threatning her with ſeverity if ſhe refuſed to take it, at length ſhe declared that ſhe would not be ruled by <hi>J. R.</hi> but would accept of the Court's Favour, and ſo took the Oath; and the Favour which the Court granted her, was to paſs this following Sentence.</p>

            <p>And now the poor Woman finding that by her Oath ſhe had proved her Child illegitimate, and thereby denied her Marriage, and that her Husband dare not own her as a Wife; for I think that no Woman can be ſaid to be a Wife, (though ever ſo lawfully married) if ſhe turn ſo much againſt her Husband, as not only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey his moſt ſtrict Commands, but alſo to prove by her Oath, that his Children are by Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it was in this caſe.</p>

Thus it appears by comparing the date of his Marriage with the date of his Wive's Marriage to <hi>Robert Jones,</hi> that he remained ſingle four Years after ſhe was married.</p>
            <p>And this is a true account of his two laſt Marriages.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>P. P.</hi> who ſeems to rouſe up his Courage, as if he intended to venture ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stroke at the dead Man with whom he is fighting, before he takes to his heels, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon arms himſelf like an <hi>Iſhmaelite,</hi> with Mocks and Scoffs; tho' all the Revenge he can promiſe himſelf thereby, is to move ſome vain ſpirited Perſon like himſelf to a Laughter.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> he begins as follows. <q>But before I conclude, let me mention ſome other of his Sufferings, which tho' he fretted at at home, yet never complained of publickly; I mean what happened to him about his Maid <hi>Mary Ransford,</hi> whom he firſt bought, then took to his Bed, <hi>(at leaſt when he wanted her)</hi> till ſhe proved with Child, and in the fifth or ſixth Month of her pregnancy, as I remember, he ſolemnly betrothed her to him; then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dwelling with her ſeveral years, and having had two Children by her, upon ſome diſguſt put her away, and all by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, agreeable to that Rule in the Law, at leaſt in one Reſpect, that in the ſame way that a Contract is made, it may be made void.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> As to what he ſays that he firſt bought her, I grant to be true, which is an Argument that no Perſon had any challenge to her, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002809_0081_0FE5F84CF9C4ECD8"/>therefore no ways unlawful for him to Marry her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Says he, <q>Then took to his Bed, at leaſt when he wanted her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This I take to be a falſe and laſcivious Speech.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is falſe, becauſe their firſt Child was not born within the limited time which the Law allows after their Marriage, nor were they ever charged with Fornication, nor any unclean act relating to their firſt Child: and as to his taking her to his Bed after he had Married her, no body doubts of it.</p>
            <p>Yet to ſay a Man takes his Wife to Bed when he wants her, I ſuppoſe all modeſt People will take to be a laſcivious ſpeech.</p>
            <p>In the next place he confeſſes, that after he had ſolemnly betrothed her to him, he lived with her ſeveral years, &amp; had two Children by her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here he plainly proves what I have already aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the Courts puniſhing her, was only on the account of their Marriage, becauſe <hi>J. R.</hi> could not in Conſcience be Married in their Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo adds, that upon ſome diſguſt he put her away, and all by his own Authority, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that in the ſame way that a Contract is made, it may be made void.</p>
            <p>This I affirm to be a poſitive Falſhood, for it was the Authority of the Court which terrified her ſo as to cauſe her to renounce her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and flee into another Government, and marry another Man, as has already been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:002809_0082_0FE5F84DCD7CAEB8"/>
And as to his Rule in the Law, it is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the taking away of <hi>J. R.</hi>'s firſt Wife; for it was the Authority that married her to him, and the ſame Authority took her from him, without giving a Reaſon why they did it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>After which (<hi>ſays be</hi>) he was lawfully Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Woman of <hi>Oyſter-Bay.</hi> He alſo adds, That he is not at all at a loſs how <hi>J. R.</hi> and this <hi>Quaker</hi> Woman overlook'd the ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in Religion that was between them, ſo as to match together; but by what ſophiſtry he levelled that horrible Jogg in his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſpecting <hi>Mary</hi> aforeſaid, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> inform the Reader what the horrible Jogg was, and <hi>ſecondly</hi> how it came to be removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The horrible Jogg was thoſe horrible Lies which <hi>P. P.</hi> has now preſumed to Print, which had been ſpread about the Country, as if <hi>J. R.</hi> had turned away his Wife; and the way that it came to be removed, was by carrying the Woman to <hi>Block Iſland,</hi> where ſhe might not only have opportunity of diſcourſing with his Wife, who had left him twelve years, and had been Married four years to another Man, but alſo with the Authority and Neighbours, and ſo the horrible Jogg came to be levelled; that is, the horrible Lies came to be diſcovered to the Woman, and they were Married on the Iſland before they came off.</p>
            <p>And now he proceeds in his <hi>Iſhmaelitiſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as follows.</p>
            <q>

               <p>To me I remember he accounted for it after this ſort: ſaid he, I have experienced wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operations of Gods hand upon my Body as well as upon my Soul, and ſo proceeding ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to me, that upon his entering into a ſtate of ſuffering, he felt ſuch a marvellous mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his members which were upon the Earth, as that his venereal Propenſity in particular ſeemed to be totally extinguiſhed. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever after he had encountered the ſharpeſt of his Tryals, it flamed forth again, even beyond the limits of Nature, whereby it was manifeſt, that God's hand was in an eminent way in it. Whereupon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I never could get him an inch farther than this, yet he would not make a full ſtop neither, but ſignified to me, that in a more convenient time he would let me into that Myſtery, and fully convince me that he did it by a divine Impulſe from firſt to laſt.

               <p>You ſhall hear the Rounds of the matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was thus, at a County Court at <hi>New-London,</hi> my ſelf a Spectator, with a multitude of others being preſent, came <hi>J.

Replied the Judge, How? how? What do you mean <hi>John?</hi> why are you not Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Married in an orderly way? Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:002809_0084_0FE5F84FDF8DE180"/>he, I do not regard your Laws in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, nor will I be Married by your Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then applying himſelf directly to the Judge, ſaid, Captain <hi>Wetherell,</hi> thou knoweſt ſomething of the occaſion of this, for I hinted it to thee at ſuch a time. Replyed the Judge, <hi>Why thou filthy Beaſt, I know nothing that thou told<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me, but of a baſe Pang of Luſt that beſet thee; go for ſhame, be gone, the Court will not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi>

               <hi>3dly.</hi> A third Reaſon is, That were the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he gives tranſlated out of his <hi>Iſhmaelitiſh</hi> and debaucht Language, into a civil Tongue, it might expreſs near the ſame thing as my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count has done.</p>
            <p>By theſe three Reaſons it is plain that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he pretends to give of this matter, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſome of his <hi>Iſhmaelitiſh</hi> Arrows ſhot at his imagined Enemy.</p>
            <p>And I do freely appeal to every Reader, who is endowed but with common Morality, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this civil Anſwer of <hi>J. R.</hi> to <hi>P. P</hi>'s. Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deſerves all thoſe Mocks, Scoffs, Flouts and Deriſions which <hi>P. P.</hi> has caſt upon him: or whether it is not the expreſs Image of the moſt laſcivious debaucht and unmanly ſpirit of a Coward, thus to inſult and trample upon the Grave of a dead Man.</p>
            <p>And now having diſgorged himſelf of thus much of his debaucht Meditations, and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it upon <hi>J. R.</hi> he prepares himſelf for another Vomit of the ſame matter, which he thinks to Father upon Capt. <hi>Wetherell,</hi> Judge of the Court, another dead Man, <hi>Whom the Clods of the Valley forbid to anſwer for himſelf,</hi> and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds as follows; You ſhall hear the Rounds of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002809_0086_0FE5F851DF668360"/>the matter, and ſo goes on as has already been ſhown, till he comes to theſe following words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Replied the Judge,</hi> Why thou filthy Beaſt, I know nothing thou toldeſt me, but of a baſe pang of Luſt that beſet thee; go for ſhame, be gone, the Court will not be hindered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> That theſe laſcivious Words were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoken by the Judge of the Court, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his own unclean Heart, is very obvious, for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For that it is altogether uncredible to ſuppoſe that an elderly Man, who was Judge of a Court, ſhould be ſo notoriouſly debauched and abuſive, as to tell a Man who came civily into his Preſence to be publickly married, that it was nothing but a baſe pang of Luſt that beſet him, and call him <hi>flthy Beaſt,</hi> and bid him be gone: Surely it would be a great abuſe to the Judge of a Court after his Death, to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing of him: Eſpecially ſince there is no better proof of it than <hi>P. P</hi>'s. bare Word, which has been proved falſe throughout his whole Book.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> Reaſon is, becauſe it ſo exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the reft of his debauched Diſcourſe throughout his Book, that any one may boldly ſay it is <hi>P. P</hi>'s. Language, for his Speech bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him.</p>
            <p>And now I can do no leſs than blame <hi>P. P.</hi> for that he neither attends the Rule of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor proper Speech; and yet in Page 39th. upbraids <hi>J. R.</hi> with the ſame thing, (<hi>viz.</hi>) for not attending the Rules of Speech in his Books.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:002809_0087_0FE5F852AE0C96E8"/>
Now had <hi>P. P.</hi> attended the Rule of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which ſays, <hi>Judge your ſelves,</hi> he would not have been judging a dead Man, who is gone into the hands of a righteous Judge.</p>
            <p>And <hi>2dly.</hi> Had he attended the Rules of Speech, he would not have called Marriage a baſe pang of Luſt, ſince it is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Marriage is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled; but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> By which we may obſerve, that Marriage is an Ordinance of God, and is not a baſe pang of Luſt; but Whoredom and Adultery is a baſe pang of Luſt: And had he attended theſe two Rules, he muſt have confeſſed, that himſelf was more properly the Effect of a baſe pang of Luſt, than <hi>J. R</hi>'s. marrying a ſecond Wife, after he had been unjuſtly deprived of his Wife for more than twenty five Years.</p>
            <p>But to follow him to the end of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, (<hi>ſays he</hi>) <q>In about three or four Months as I remember, <hi>Mary</hi> brought him a Child, he owned it, and got her with Child again, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffered Perſecution for the firſt according to Law; foreſeeing the ſecond Perſecution, he charged <hi>Mary</hi> not to lay the Child to him, if examined by Authority, ſhe promiſed him ſhe would not, but failed of her Word; which occaſioned him farther ſufferings for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; which ſo roiled him, that he put her away, and dwelt no more with her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> As to what he firſt aſſerts, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That <hi>Mary</hi> brought him a Child in three or four Months, and that he ſuffered Perſecution for it according to Law, is abominably falſe; for the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:002809_0088_0FE5F853815775C8"/>Authority never charged <hi>J. R.</hi> or his Wife with any Miſdemeanour relating to their firſt Child, as has already been declared. And as to what he ſays that he charged her not to lay the Child to him, if examined by Authority, and that ſhe promiſed him ſhe would not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not only falſe, but ſo nonſenſical and fooliſh, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no Anſwer: For what Perſon of common Reaſon will believe, that after he had been married in the King's Court, before a multitude of Spectators, as <hi>P. P.</hi> confeſſes in the ſame page, and then live with his Wife three Years, until he had had two Children by her, &amp; then charge his Wife not to lay his laſt Child to him; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none will believe ſuch Folly. And whereas he ſignifies, that his ſecond Child was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſuffering for Conſcience, I confeſs to be true; for it was on account of his ſecond Child, that his Wife was ſentenced to be whipt, for which ſhe fled out of the Colony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that it was for his Conſcience is evident, in that he could not in Conſcience be married according to the Cuſtom practiced in <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> Colony, which was the only Crime alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him, relating to that matter.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſays, that he put her away, and dwelt no more with her; that he put her away is falſe, for ſhe denied him and left him, and married another Man, but that he dwelt no more with her is true, for ſhe lives with the ſame Man to this Day.</p>
            <p>And now having followed him thus far thro' his Mocks, Scoffs and Falſhoods, in which he has been inſulting and ſporting himſelf over a
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002809_0089_0FE5F854D6DCE3D8"/>dead Perſon, a Crime ſo contemptible, that nothing but the baſe and unmanly Spirit of a Coward could have endured to have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place I can do no leſs than mind him of the ſevere Threatnings contained in the holy Scriptures, againſt ſuch Perſons as he is; who ſhall preſume to ſport themſelves by mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſcoffing at God's faithful Children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Death, as he has done; which is to be ſeen</hi> Iſai. <hi>57.1, 2, 3, 4. Verſes.</hi> The righteous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none conſidering that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is taken away from the evil to come. He ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into peace, they ſhall reſt in their beds, each one walking in his uprightneſs. But draw near hither ye ſons of the Sorcereſs, the ſeed of the Adulterer and the WHORE. Againſt whom do ye ſport your ſelves? againſt whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the Tongue? Are ye not Children of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, a ſeed of falſhood? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that God will ſurely call ſuch Perſons as <hi>P. P.</hi> to an account, for ſporting themſelves with their Falſhoods at his People af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death.</p>
            <p>In page 61. he endeavours to excuſe his ſully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Character of the dead as follows, <q>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks when we are engaged in the Cauſe of Truth againſt Error, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may be very war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, yea, neceſſary, and more eſpecially where the caſe is peculiar as this is, that a Man boaſting of Perfection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice Whoredom, and live in it divers years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:002809_0090_0FE5F855F925E5E8"/>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> But inſtead of being engaged in the cauſe of Truth againſt Error, he has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Lies againſt Truth, as has ſufficiently been proved throughout his Book, both by the plain Records of the Courts, and other ſufficient Evidence.</p>
            <p>And as to what he ſays of <hi>J. R</hi>'s. deliberately practiſing Whordom, and living in it divers years, it is manifeſt that he has Reference to the three years that he enjoyed his ſecond Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was driven from him; for as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after he was deprived of his firſt Wife, he lived ſingle twenty five years, and then Married his ſecond Wife, which he enjoyed but three years before he was deprived of her, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſingle again twelve years before he Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his third Wife: So that he was ſuffered to keep a Wife but three years in forty, which three years is the time that <hi>P. P.</hi> charges him with deliberately practiſing Whoredom. For he was never charged with Whoredom the whole ſeven and thirty years that he lived ſingle.</p>
            <p>And I ſuppoſe <hi>P. P.</hi> forgets that he has ſeveral times in his Book owned her to be his Wife, as in page fifty eight, where he ſays, <q>He ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betrothed her to him, then afterwards dwelling with her ſeveral years, and having had two Children by her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Here he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſes, that it was after ſhe was ſolemnly betrothed to him, that he had two Children by her; and yet in the turning over but one leaf forgets himſelf, and calls it deliberately practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Whoredom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus is he left through
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002809_0091_0FE5F856CC8BF1D0"/>the falſe and envious ſpirit by which he is acted, to confound his own diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In page 62 he pretends to apply himſelf to ſuch as are already fallen into the ſnare of that Fowler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I ſhall paſs over much of this Diſcourſe, judging it ſo nonſenſical and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Scripture, that every Perſon of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Capacity will eaſily diſcern the Folly of it.</p>
            <p>In page 66. ſays he, <q>Again, be perſwaded to take a view of <hi>J. R.</hi> and try whether he were a Miniſter of Chriſt or not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In trying of his Authority to Preach and Baptize, I think you may ſafely conclude that the Office of a Goſpel Miniſter is like that of a Prieſt, in this reſpect, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that <hi>no Man takes the honour of it upon himſelf but he that is called of God, as was</hi> Aaron. Heb. 5.4. Wherefore the Apoſtle ſays plainly, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they Preach except they be ſent.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> That all Gods Miniſters both in the time of the Law and Goſpel have been called of God, as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> I grant, and on the contrary all falſe Teachers and Hirelings which the World heaps up to themſelves, have always had their call from an earthly Power, and are not called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and as to what is written <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they Preach except they be ſent?</hi> (that is ſent of God) by which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that none can Preach the Myſteries of God's Kingdom, but ſuch who are ſent of God, and to ſuch God reveals his Mind and Will; ſo that they are capable to deliver their Meſſage from his Mouth, and have no need to ſtudy vain
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002809_0092_0FE5F8579BA67208"/>Words out of their own Heart, as falſe Prophers and Hirelings have always done, as may be ſeen, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of boſts, Hearken not to the Words of the Prophets that propheſy unto you, they make you vain, they ſpeak a viſion of their own beart, and not out of the Mouth of the Lord.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the People,</hi> &amp;c. Verſe 3. <hi>And through Covetouſneſs ſhall they with feigned Words make Merchandize of you.</hi> Thus the Scriptures ſhew us, that falſe Prophets who are not ſent of God, are they who through Covetouſneſs Preach ſtudied or feigned Words out of their own Heart, and not from the Mouth of the Lord. For they are not called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and therefore are Ignorant of his Mind and Will.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Says he, That the call of God thereto is either firſt, extraordinary as God called divers of the Prophets of old, and as Chriſt called the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who always proved their Authority by Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it is ordinary, (<hi>viz.</hi>) by Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and laying on of the Hands of the <hi>Presbytery, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And every Man pretending to that Office, has always been able to prove his Authority in the one or other of theſe ways, excepting a few ſuch as <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>John Rogers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> As Apoſtates and Hereticks have ever been the fitteſt Inſtruments for Satan to ſpread his damnable Doctrines abroad by, ſo I know of no Hereſy more dangerous than this now broacht by <hi>P. P.</hi> For if we are to reject, as he would have us, all Prophets and Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002809_0093_0FE5F858D21E4670"/>who cannot prove their Authority either by Miracles or Ordination, and the laying on of the Hands of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> then ſurely we muſt Condemn all thoſe Bleſſed Witneſſes which God raiſed up in the time of <hi>Popery,</hi> to teſtify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they did not prove their Authority by Miracles; nor was there any to ordain them, but their cruel Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors under whom they ſuffered Martyrdoms.</p>
            <p>Yet did God ſo open their underſtanding to underſtand the Scripture, and give them a Mouth and Wiſdom, that all their Adverſaries were not able to gainſay; which was a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſtimony to prove their Authority, and that they were the true Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> By the ſame Rule we muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and judge him to be a Deceiver; <hi>firſt,</hi> for that he did not prove his Authority by Miracles, as the Scripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us, <hi>John</hi> 10.41. <hi>And many reſorted to him,</hi> (that is Chriſt) <hi>and ſaid</hi> John <hi>did no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it appears by the Teſtimony of thoſe who were the Followers of Chriſt, that <hi>John</hi> did no Miracle.</p>
            <p>And <hi>2dly.</hi> That he was not Ordained by the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> is clear from <hi>Mark</hi> 1.1. <hi>The beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 3, 4. <hi>The voice of one crying in the Wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight.</hi> John <hi>did Baptiſe in the Wilderneſs, and preach the Baptiſm of Repentance, for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:002809_0094_0FE5F85A6D2D8188"/>
Thus it appears, that <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry was the Beginning of the Goſpel of Juſus Chriſt; and therefore no Perſon was capable to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain him to his Office: Otherwiſe they that did Ordain him, muſt have been in the Work before him, and he could not have been the beginner of it.</p>
            <p>And thus if we take <hi>P. P</hi>'s. Rule, we muſt number <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> in with theſe few which he ſays are ſuch as <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>John Rogers,</hi> becauſe they have not proved their Authority by Miracles, nor the impoſition of Hands, and ſo conſequently we are to doubt of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which is the beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and on which the whole New-Teſtament is built: And for as much as the Old-Teſtament is fulfilled in the New, this Hereſy now broached by <hi>P. P.</hi> tends to the overthrow of both Old and New Teſtament, and ſo conſequently to reduce the World into Paganiſm.</p>
            <p>In Page 67. he goes on as follows. Once more be perſwaded to make a few ſhort but reaſonable Reflections on ſome part of his Life, and ſee if you can therein diſcover the Characters and Signs of a Miniſter of Chriſt: Particularly the matter about <hi>Mary Ransford.</hi> And methinks Reaſon ſhould guide you thus in your Thoughts, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Firſt, That ſhe was either his lawful Wife, or not; if not, then his Whore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:002809_0095_0FE5F85C19375668"/>
Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> If ſhe were his lawful Wife, then his putting her away was without ſufficient Grounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And conſequently he broke Wedlock, and committed Adultery in ſo doing. If you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did as bad, I'll grant it; but I obſerve, that they both repented of, confeſſed and forſook their Sins; but he always juſtified his, and lived in it to the Day of his Death, that is his Adultery. If ſhe were his Wife, as I think you will judge ſhe was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> As to his quaerying whether ſhe were his Wife or his Whore, I take to be another of his <hi>Iſhmaelitiſh</hi> Arrows ſhot at his imagined Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for he has already confeſſed in page 58th. that the two Children he had by her were after he had ſolemnly betrothed her to him, and now again he ſays if ſhe were his Wife, as I think you will judge ſhe was.</p>
            <p>Here again he makes no doubt but every one will judge her to be his Wife; ſo that there is no Argument between us concerning that point, ſince we both allow her to be his lawful Wife.</p>
            <p>And as to what he ſays concerning his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her away, I have already given an account how ſhe was terrified by the Court, to deny and forſake her Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo aſſerts, That he lived in his Adultery to the day of his Death, by which it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:002809_0096_0FE5F85E9115AC28"/>that he forgets what he ſaid in Page 59th. (<hi>viz.</hi>) That after this woman had left him, he was lawfully married to a Woman of <hi>Oyſterbay, &amp;c.</hi> which if he had not forgot himſelf, he could not have been ſo ignorant, but that he muſt have known that while a Man lived in Adultery, he could not be lawfully married to another Woman.</p>
            <p>In Page 68th. he concludes with this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exhortation, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <q>Finally, Pray &amp; ſtrive againſt this one Evil in ſpecial, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will greatly retard your progreſs from Darkneſs to Light, and that is the ſlaviſh Fear of being made the <hi>Scorn of Fools,</hi> and <hi>Song of the Drunkards,</hi> who will probably at every turn upbraid you of Unconſtancy, twit you and yours of your <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> and the like; this ſort of Suffering is an evil Diſeaſe; it's what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> earneſtly deprecated after his Fall.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Here he greatly abuſes and wreſts the holy Scriptures, through his own Ignorance and groſs Darkneſs: For <hi>David</hi> was ſo far from being unconſtant in matters of Religion, or giving his Adverſaries occaſion to twit him on that account, that the Scriptures teſtify that he was a Man after God's own Heart, ſave only in the matter of <hi>Uriah;</hi> and throughout the whole Scripture is he mentioned as a Pattern of all ſuch as was moſt conſtant and unmovable in matters of Religion; And as to what <hi>David</hi> laments in the 69th Pſalm 12th Verſe, how that he was the <hi>Song of the Drunkards,</hi> was not after
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:002809_0097_0FE5F860F4E1D780"/>his Fall, as <hi>P. P.</hi> ignorantly affects: For before his Fall, and always after to the Day of his Death, he was the moſt honourable King upon the Earth; being honoured not only by God and his Church, but by all the great Nations in the World, who were moſt of them his Servants and Tributaries, and therefore was far enough from being the Scorn of Fools and Song of the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards. But the time that he was the Song of the Drunkards, was when <hi>Saul</hi> with his drunken Army were hunting him like a <hi>Partridge in the Mountains,</hi> and drove him out of all the Coaſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> into other Kingdoms, which he alſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the ſame Pſalm at the 8th. verſe, in theſe Words, <hi>I am become a ſtranger to my Brethren, and an aliant to my Mothers Children.</hi> Now we know that he was no ſtranger to his Brethren af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Fall, but was their King, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. By which it is manifeſt, that theſe Expreſſions of <hi>David</hi> had only reference to the time of his exile by <hi>Saul,</hi> and not after his fall as <hi>P. P.</hi> has ignorantly aſſerted; yet that this evil Diſeaſe which he ſeems to groan under, has been very grievous to him, I doubt not, (<hi>viz.</hi>) being twitted with his unconſtancy in Religion, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>But how he thinks to get rid of his evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe I know not, ſince he ſo much ſlighted his Religion when he had it, as to ſwap and change it about till he had none left; and for him to think to help his evil Diſeaſe by comparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was of ſuch an infinite <hi>Longitude</hi>

               </gap>de of the Life and Converſation of <hi>P. P.</hi> that the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:002809_0098_0FE5F864F7ED71A0"/>very compariſon tends more to ſtir up the ſtink of his evil Diſeaſe, than any ways to abate it.</p>
            <p>And now having gone through his Book, I ſhall look back and briefly mind the Reader of ſome Remarkable Paſſages therein contained, which may be worthy of Obſervation. Firſt, as to his Advertiſement, he tells us, it was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beſt advice ſince <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s Death.</p>
            <p>Now compare this with what he ſays in his ſeventh page, where he tells us, that when he began to fear that he had been in the way of an erroneous and Heterodox Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that with all poſſible earneſtneſs, he asked Counſel of the Wonderful Counſellor, and Wiſdom of him that gives it liberally to all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which I obſerve, that the Spirit which he was acted by in the time of his viſitation, (which he calls his being led into <hi>Quakeriſm</hi>) led him in times of difficulties to ask Advice and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, who is the Wonderful Counſellor, and he that gives Wiſdom to all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince his Apoſtaſy, he calls that the beſt Advice which adviſes him to deride and bely a Man in his Grave; which Advice muſt needs be given him either by the Father of Lies, or ſome of his Children, which is another manifeſt Proof of his Apoſtaſy.</p>
            <p>Another thing which I ſhall take notice of, is in page 54 where he aſſerts, that the Divorc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:002809_0099_0FE5F868F44F0D60"/>
               <hi>J. R</hi>'s. Wife from him, was his Adultery and Beaſtiality.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Here he greatly reflects upon the Authority of the Government, for if <hi>J. R.</hi> was guilty of Beaſtiality, then the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was highly guilty of injuſtice in a two fold manner.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Becauſe they did not execute that Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him which both the Law of God and their own Law required them to have done, which is Death.</p>
            <p n="2">And <hi>2dly.</hi> It was great injuſtice to take away his Wife on that account, becauſe there is no Law of God nor this Colony that allows of ſuch a Sentence.</p>
            <p n="3">And <hi>3dly.</hi> They were highly guilty of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, in not acting according to the Law of God and this Colony, which they were bound by their ſolemn Oath to have done.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>P. P.</hi> by belying <hi>J. R.</hi> has greatly expoſed the Authority of the Government.</p>
            <p>Again in page 60. and 61. he informs the Reader, how the Authority Puniſhed <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and his ſecond Wife on account of their two Children, and yet in page 58. confeſſes that <hi>J. R.</hi> had both the Children by her after he had ſolemnly betrothed her to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:002809_0100_0FE5F869CB5031C8"/>
So that in ſhort <hi>P. P.</hi> charges the Authority with Puniſhing <hi>J. R.</hi> for having Children by his Wife, and acquitting him for Beaſtiality.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, under the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s great Sufferings, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſoon after his Converſion, and continued all his Life after which was near fifty years, and that now after his Death the Adverſary having ſtirred up <hi>P. P.</hi> to purſue him in his Grave with Mocks, Scoffs and abominable Lies, and yet throughout his whole Book, is not able to prove him guilty of any one Miſdemeanour in the whole courſe of his Life, which is a ſufficient Argument that he is one of thoſe which Chriſt ſpeaks of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be exceeding glad, for great u your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Heaven: for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi>
