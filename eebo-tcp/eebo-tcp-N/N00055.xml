            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now had the main Subject of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Discourse a better Head and Heart to deal in and about it, it might be very advantageous to draw men seriously to Repent, according to that in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30, 31. and to quicken them up to <hi>watch and pray alwayes, that they may be counted worthy to escape those things that are coming upon the world, and to stand before the Sun of Man,</hi> Luke 21. 36.

see that it matters not for worldly glory, whether we have it or have it not, so we have a share in this glorious One, that will one day come in his Glory. 3 We see how good it is to be a Servant to him who is such a glorious One, and that we should use all means that we may be entertained in his Service.

            <p>For the first: The Place of this glorious Throne is by some thought to be in the Clouds, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.17. and it is very like it shall be there, or in some vast and spacious place in the Air, which shall be able to contain those innumerable Companies of persons that shall appear before him.</p>
            <p>For the second: How it does appear that he shall sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a Throne. It appears 1. By the multitude of his Attendants. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10. for Princes sit upon their Thrones, when they have such a Train about them. 2. By the Judgement that he is then to give; and then do Princes and Judges sit upon their Thrones and Sears, when they are to give Judgement, and to pass Sentence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. 3. By the Conventing of all Nations before him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 32. 4. By the summoning of them to appear by the sound of a Trumpet, and by the Voice of the Archangel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 16. 5. By the opening of all graves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. and those that were dead coming forth: The prisoners are brought forth, when the Judge is to sit upon his Throne.</p>
            <p>For the third; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the Reasons. 1. He is a glorious King, <hi>Psal.</hi> 24.7,8,9,10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 47.2. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15.

            <p n="2">2. He is the onely Law giver, which is able to save and destroy, <hi>Jam</hi> 4. 12. and therefore meet that a Throne of Glory should be erected for him to give rewards to the obedient, and punish the disobedient.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is the Judge of all the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. and they use to sit upon their Seats of Justice that are Judges on earth; much more he.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He will be so much the more terrible to his enemies, as a King upon his Throne is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10,11.</p>

We see that among evil men, they are the worst that are leaders in a way of wickedness: The leader causeth all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruliness that is in the rest of the Goats. 9. We see what a sad judgement it is to do much mischief in a little time against our selves or others; it is a sign of a Reprobate and a Goat. 10.

We see that the more mischievous any be in the places where they live, the more they discover themselves to be reprobate Goats; for Goats are mischievous creatures. 11. We see that it is a dreadful sign of Reprobation, to be of an haughty and aspiring nature, to climb high, and to seek great things in the world, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.12. and may be a curb to all proud spirits, that would fain be counted above the rest of their brethren: that spirit will undo any man, whoever he is.</p>

They have been a dishonour to the Gospel, to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they have professed, they have cast dirt and dishonour upon Churches, and if so, what can they expect, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour at Christs hand at that day?</p>

               <hi>Use</hi> 1. of the first Branch <hi>for Information</hi> 1. We see that the elect Saints need not be much troubled though they suffer some dishonour in this world, for Christ will honour them at that day. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 24,25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. 2. We see how faithfull the Lord is in his promise, in that he will honour them that honour him. <hi>Hebr;</hi> 10. 23. who would not trust such a faithfull one? 3. We see the blessed condition of the Saints of Christ, that He himselfe will put honour upon at that day: <hi>Haman</hi> thought it a great part of his happiness, that he was so honoured by the King, and that he was in hope of more honour, <hi>Esiber</hi> 6. 5,6 But oh how happy are they that Christ will delight to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at that day! 4. We see that we need never repent that we have been servants unto Christ, for we have served such a master as will surely honour us. If he that waiteth on his Master come to honour, <hi>Prov</hi> 27. 18. much more they that wait upon such a master as he is. 5. Wee see how contemptible the honour of the World should be, we should trample upon it with disdain, rather then lose the hope of Christs honour at that day. 6. We see that they that seeks Christs Honour more then their own shall be no loosers by it, for he will honour them at that day. 7. We see with what diligence, and chearfulness we should goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Masters service, for he will Honour us at that day. 8. We see how tender we should be of the name of Christ, that no dishonour may come to him by our meanes, for he will set us at his right hand with Honour.</p>

               <hi>Of the second Branch.</hi> 1. We see how Just the Lord is, and how equal his wayes are in putting dishonour upon them that have dishonoured him, <hi>Ezek</hi> 18. 25. 2. We see the folly of those men, that seek Honour from men, and make it the chiefe thing that they desire after, alas these little think of the dishonour, that shall be put upon them at the day of Judgement. 3. We see the mischiefe

               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. They are appointed to rise first. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17 and that may be a pledg of their Sentence of absolution, to be first passed upon them. 2. They are to sit with Christ to judg the world, and to judg Angels, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6. 2,3. and therefore it is meet they should be first absolved &amp; acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sentence of condemnation be passed upon the reprobate. 3. The Lord will have them to be without fear at that day: now if they should not be first in their sentence of absolution, they could not chuse but be affraid

at the dreadfull sentence of condemnation upon repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: and therefore that the Judg may take away all fear from them at that day, he first begins with them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits them. 4. That day is the day of their Redemption <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28. and if it were not so, that they were first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, it could not be so, for they would be in captivity to trouble and trembling, and then it could not be a day of redemption to them. 5. That day is a day of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. and that it may appear to be a day of refreshing to them, they are first acquitted before the other are condemned. 6. The day is called the day of Restitution, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. wherin all that the Lord hath promised, shall be restored to them, all their peace, all their comfort, all their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="12">12.

We see a reason why Christ shall be so glorified in his Saints at that day, 2 <hi>Thes</hi> 1. 10. there is good cause why it should be so, for he will first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with absolving them, before he do any thing else at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of judgment. 5. We see why he should be the first and chief with us, the first in our desires, and above all others in our esteem, <hi>Psal</hi> 73. 25 <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10 for we shall be the first with him at that day, he will first acquit us before he do any thing else at the great day. 6.

               </gap>. for as he doth here acquit us in his word, and by his spirit, so at that day he will with his own blessed mouth pass the blessed sentence of absolution upon us, and it shall be the first thing that he will then do. 7 We see that what the Lord calls his Servants to, he will then surely inable them to, and remove that they might hinder them, he calls his servants then to an honourable work, to Judg the World, to Judg Argells, and that they may not be in the least surprized with fear and so hindred, he takes that away and first passeth the sentence of absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, before he condemn the wicked World. 8. We see what tenderness we should use toward his Saints and people, we should do what we can to take them off from all their feares, such as are in temptation that are full of feares, if we judg them such as Christ hath acquitted and will acquit at that day, we should do as he doth, do what we can to take them off from all their feares, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5 14. <hi>Isai</hi> 35. 3,4. 9.

will acquit them and absolve them before his Father and the Holy Angels and the whole World, it is an honour to a poor man that is brought before an earthly Judg to be acquitted before all the company that are present at the assize. Oh what an honour then will y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Jesus put upon them that are his Elect at that day whom he will acquit before God, Angels, and Men, when the whole World shall be convented before him: <hi>Such honour have all his Saints,</hi> if the Psalmist said so upon a less occasion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 149. 9. much more may we say so upon this. 11.

            <p>For the first: <hi>It may be said to be an Inheritance,</hi> 1. In regard of the purchase of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. Christ hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it for us: Inheritances are sometimes purchased; so this. 2. In regard of the gift of it: Inheritances are made over by gift; so this, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 24. 3. In regard of the new birth that we are partakers of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3,4. Inheritances are often by birth; so this: not by our first birth, (for that damns us) but by the second. 4. In regard of the honour and dignity of it: Inheritances are honourable things that are estated upon men, much more this; no honour like to this. 5. In regard of the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienation of it: Inheritances are not alienated to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:000094_0058_0FA019A1451B5B98"/>
so this Inheritance is not alienated to others, but is the propriety of the Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 18. 6. In regard of the right of it to the first born: Inheritances are the right of the first born, so this Inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. 7. In regard of the Conveyance of it: an Inheritance is conveyed by the death of a father or friend; so is this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance conveyed to us by the death of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16. 8. In regard of the reservation of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Inheritances are reserved for the right heirs; so this.</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>What manner of Inheritance is it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is incorruptible, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. 2. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, <hi>ibid.</hi> 3. It fades not away, <hi>ibid. Heb.</hi> 9. 15. 4.

            <p>Q. 3. <hi>Why have they it by Inheritance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They are joynt heirs with Christ, <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. 17. 2. It is prepared for them: so the Text. 3.

They have the earnest of it, <hi>Eph:</hi> 1. 14. 6. They have the hope of it, <hi>Col:</hi> 1. 5. 7. They have a taste of it in the peace and joy that they have here in their souls, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5. 1,2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. 8. The Lord Jesus their Head hath taken possession of it for them, <hi>Heb:</hi> 6. 20. 9. The writings are drawn, the Seals put to, the Witnesses are for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it, <hi>Heb:</hi> 6. 17,18. <hi>Eph:</hi> 1. 13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7,8,11. 10. They long for the day when they shall come to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of it, as other heirs do, <hi>Cant:</hi> 8. <hi>ult. Rev:</hi> 22. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see what a firm state the Saints shall enjoy in Heaven, for its an inheritance; for what is held by inheritance is most firm, and sure, and stable hold, they shall never be removed from their blessed Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure in Heaven. 2. We see what a peaceable possession we shall there enjoy: Inheritances, of all other Tenures, are enjoyed most peaceably; they are most unquestionable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, and therefore most peaceably possessed: so this, we shall never be disturbed when we come in Heaven. 3. We see what desires we should have after the possession of that estate: young heirs in minority long to be at a full age, that they may possess their inheritances; so should we, that we may possess ours. 4. We see in what esteem the Saints should be with us, for they are great heirs, and shall have a great inheritance another day: Great heirs on earth are esteemed highly; how much more should these?

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:000094_0063_0FA019A99A248910"/>
and Creditors do not reckon for such sums which are blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, and do not so much as mention or speak of them. 3. In that they are all covered, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 85. 2. <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 5. and if they be covered, then sure they shall not be discovered or spoken of at that day. 4. In that they are forgotten and not remembred, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 25. <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 79. 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 17. And if so, how should they then be spoken of? 5. In that upon search they shall not be found, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 20. and things that cannot be found, are not mentioned nor spoken of among men: so here. 6. In that the Lord passeth them by, &amp; makes them as if they had never been committed, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18. and if he pass them by, surely they shall never be spoken of at that day. 7. In that all their sins shall be cast into the depths of the Sea, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 19. and therefore shall never come up more. Things cast into the bottom of the Sea never come up more: so here. 8. In that the Righteousness of Christ is imputed to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6,7,8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 7. Now if his Righteousness be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, then our sins surely shall not be spoken of at that day. 9. In that they are born, and taken away by Christ, and laid upon him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24 <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 6. and if he has taken them away, and born them, then sure they shall not be mentioned against us at that day. 10. In that the body of sin is destroyed in us, by virtue of our fellowship with Christ in his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6,7. and our sins being killed and destroyed, how should they be then spoken of or mentioned against us?</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Why shall not their sins be then spoken of or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned?</hi>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From the Lord Jesus. 2. From his Saints. 3. From their Enemies. 4. From the Day it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From the Lord Jesus.</hi> 1. He hath promised, <hi>John</hi> 5. 24. that they shall not come into Condemnation: and if so, to what end shall their sins be mentioned at that day? 2. He hath delivered them from the wrath to come, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 10. and that being so, there's no need that their sins should be mentioned. 3 He saves to the utmost, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 25. and therefore from sin, and all the shame of it, which the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their sin might bring upon them. Other men shall rise to shame, <hi>Dan</hi> 12 2. but not they. 4. He hides their sins here, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 11,31. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 11. and if so, much more will he do it at that day. 5. He then comes to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 10. but the mention of their sins would obscure that glory; and therefore they shall not be

at that day spoken of. 6. He then will fully acquit them and absolve them, <hi>as I said before,</hi> and therefore will not then mention any of them. 7. He will then present them faultless, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Saints.</hi> 1. They have blamed and shamed themselves for them here, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 7,8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 25. and therefore he will not shame them at that day. 2. They have not hid them here, but discovered them and acknowledged them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 5. and therefore no wonder if he hide them at that day. 3. They have been burthened with them here, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. and therefore he will not burthen them with the mention of them. 4. They have loathed and abhorred themselves for them here, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. <hi>Job</hi> 42. 6. And will he them speak of them, to make them an abhorring to Men and Angels? he will not surely do it. 5. They have fasted, mourned and wept for them, prayed against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the motions that have been made to the commission of them, bewailed them bitterly, <hi>Judges</hi> 2. 4,5. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23,24. and can we think that he will then speak of them, or mention them to their dishonour? 6. They have desired earnestly to be rid of them, and have counted that day happy wherein they have ceased to sin, and that has been the chiefest cause why they have desired to die, that they might sin no more, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1,23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4,6,8. And can it be thought then, that their sins shall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at that day, that they desired so to be freed from? it cannot be imagined.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From their Enemies.</hi> 1. They shall not have any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to reproach them, or Religion. 2. Nor to accuse them. 3. Nor to traduce the Judge. 4. Nor to cast Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie in their faces to shame them. 5. Nor to grieve them, for they shall not have any such thing befall them at, that day, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 25. 6. Nor to rejoyce at the mention of them. 7. Nor to think better of themselves by reason of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>From the Day it self.</hi> 1. It is the day of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the righteous judgement of God; and being so, how should their sins be then spoken of? for it would not be just to shame the innocent as they be in Christ. 2. It is the day of their rest, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7. and that it could not be, if their sins were mentioned; it would be a day of dis-rest rather to them. 3. It is the day of their exceeding joy, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 25. and that could not be, if their sins should be mentioned. 4. It is the day of their Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. and in such a day it were no way suitable
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000094_0065_0FA019AB13233B20"/>
to make mention of their sins. 5. It is the day of there Redemption, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28. and it would rather be a day of their Captivity then Redemption, should there be any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their sins. 6. It is the day of the Consummation of the Marriage betwixt Christ and his Saints, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed here, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 19,20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. But the day of the Solemnization of the Marriage is then; then Christ takes us to house, <hi>John.</hi> 14. 3. to himself, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 17. and the mentioning of their sins must needs be unsuitable to such a day.</p>

            <p>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. How it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that it shall be so. 2. Why it shall be so. 3. The Uses.</p>
            <p>For the first: <hi>How does it appear that what good they have done shall be mentioned and spoken of at that day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It does appear from hence, in that every secret good thing shall come into judgement, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 14. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 4. 5. 2.

In that every man that hath done any good, though others have not known of it, shall have due praise and commendation for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. 4. In that there shall be different depress of Glory, according to the different measures of good that men have done; and therefore all must be mentioned and spoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12. 5. In that good has been called evil in the world, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 20, and therefore all that good that has been so traduced, and evil spoken of, shall be owned and spoken of at that day. 6. In that the Saints here do vilifie and disesteem their best works, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. <hi>Phil</hi> 3. 8,9. and though indeed in themselves they be nothing worth, as coming from us, yet as they are in Christ, so they are good, and will be spoken of as such at that day. 7. In that it is not so easily discerned whose works are good, in regard that Hypocrites may go very far this way, but that day will declare which is which, which are good and which not. 8. In that for every right work a man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Q. 2. <hi>Why shall that that they have done well be then spoken of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From God himself. 2. From the Lord Jesus Christ. 3. From the Saints themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From God.</hi> 1. He works them in us and for us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 12. 2. He is glorified by them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12 3. He will reward them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6,7,10. and how should this be, if they be not spoken of at that day? 4. He has promised to honour them that honour him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Lord Jesus.</hi> 1. He commends them here, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2,3,8,9. and therefore will do it much more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. 2. He knows their works, and therefore knows how to speak of them at that day, <hi>ibid.</hi> 3. He takes it well if it be but in the heart, though it come not to outward act, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 18,19 Oh how well will he then take it, when it is actually performed, and speak of them at that day! 4. He loves then dearly, and where we love, we use to speak much in commendation of what is done, much more will Christ at that day, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Saints themselves.</hi> 1. They are his Members, Brethren, Fellows, Friends, Spouse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore no wonder that he will speak all the good of them that may be at that day 2.

They have aimed at the glory of his Name in what they have done, and no wonder then if he speak of what was done, at that day, <hi>John</hi> 15. 8. 4.

We see that want of Clothing may befall sometimes the dear Saints of Christ, for else how should Christ so sympathize with them? 9. We see what a blessed prerogative it is to be among the number of Christs Brethren and Members, for when naked he is very sensible of it. 10.

            <p>We are now come to the fifth and less Branch of the XVII, Doctrine, and that is this, <hi>That the Lord Jesus is very sensible of the imprisonment of his Saints and people. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> himself in Person in their Imprisonment.</hi>

            <p>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. How it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he is so sensible of their Imprisonment. 2. Why 3. The Uses.</p>
            <p>For the first: It does appear that <hi>He is very sensible of this state of theirs, and-counts himself in Prison with them;</hi>

               </gap> In that he chears them, and comforts them in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 24,25. So it was with many of the Marr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y's while they were in Prison, they were as chearful and full of comfort as their hearts could hold; as we see in Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> and divers others: see also Rev. 2. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

So Mr. <hi>Tindall, Bradford,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sands</hi> and others, were prospered in Prison in their holy Labours, to the Conversion of some there. 3. In that the Lord stirs up his peoples hearts, earnestly to pray for them when in prison, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5.

               </hi> was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 5. In that he makes their enemies to send to them to let them go out, <hi>Act,</hi> 16. 35,36. 6. In that he puts a fear into their adversaries, so as that they dare not keep them in, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 37,38,39. 7. In that he brings them out with honour, as he did <hi>Jos ph,</hi> Gen. 41. 14,40. So was <hi>Paul</hi> brought out with honour, <hi>Acts</hi> 16 39. 8. In that he gives them favour with their Keepers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 21,22,23. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33,34. 9. In that he sets their souls at liberty to Pray, and Hear, and Conferre, and Medicate, in a better manner sometimes then when at liberty. 10. In that he makes them glory in that condition, <hi>Philem.</hi> ver. 9. 11.

            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Why is he so sensible of their Imprisonment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From himself. 2. From them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From himself.</hi> 1. He knows what Prisoners undergo; many wants, many sorrows, many tortures from cruel ones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He would have us pity them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From them.</hi> 1. They suffer Imprisonment for his sake and the Gospels, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 16. 2. They have done no evil <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 37. 18. 3.

            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see that the Prison, though it be a dark, stinking, and uncomfortable place, yet may be born, for the Lord is very sensible of our condition therein. 2. We see a reason of the joy of Martyrs, and holy Confessors in former and later times, when in Prison, Christ's sympathy with them has caused them so to rejoyce.

3. We see how happy they be that are put in Prison for Christs sake, for he is very sensible of it, and suffers with them. 4.

We see that they that are active to put any of the Lords Saints in Prison, do commit Christ to Prison in his account: and let them look to it how they will answer it. 6. We see that when Prisons are opened, and Saints delivered out of Prison, Christ cannot but take it well. 7. We see that they are of a merciful spirit, that either are a means to keep the Saints from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Prison, or are means to let them out: they are of Christs spirit. 8. We see that Prisoners of Jesus Christ are honourable ones, for Christ reckons that himself is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned in them. 9. We see that the Spirits of the Saints that are imprisoned, shall be born up, that the Prisons noisomeness shall not be felt. 10. We see that surely he pities them that are cast into the Fire, Water, to wilde Beasts, that are Racked, Stoned, Sawn a sunder, Slain with the Sword, and otherwise cruelly dealt with, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37, 38.</p>

            <p>We are now come to the second Branch of the XVIII. Doctrine, which is this, <hi>That Christ takes it very kindly when his Saints that are strangers are kindly entertained into our houses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. How it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he takes their entertainment so kindly. 2. Why he takes it so kindly. 3. The Uses.</p>
            <p>For the first: It does appear that <hi>He takes their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment very kindly;</hi> 1. In that he gives it in charge that we should do it, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 2. and he cannot but take it kindly when we observe his charge. 2. In that he commendeth those that are kinde this way, 3. <hi>John</hi> 5, 8. 3. In that he makes account that such are fellow helpers to the truth, ver. 8. and this the Lord cannot but take kindly. 4. In that he does reward all such kinde entertainments; as we see he did to the widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. and the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 5. In that he stirs up the hearts of his Servants to wish for their health and outward pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, 3. <hi>John</hi> 2. 6. In that he gives such to thrive and prosper in their Souls, <hi>ibid</hi> 7. In that he vouchsafes them the love of his precious Saints, yea, the love of all them that know the truth, 3 <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. In that he gives them such blessings as they could not well expect, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 14, 15, 16. 9. In that he has sometimes restored their children from death to life, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 10. In that he has honoured them so, as that they have entertained Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 2. 11. In that the whole Family is blessed

by it, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 31. with <hi>Josh.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Why does he take so kindly the entertainment that his people finde?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From <hi>himself:</hi> 1. He loves and preserves stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Psal</hi> 146. 9. 2. He sometimes was a stranger himself, and therefore cannot but take it kindly what is done in way of entertainment of them. 3. He hates and abhors the covetous, that do it not, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 3. and therefore cannot but take it kindly when we do entertain them. 4. He knows what comfort his Saints have when entertained, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 21, 22. 5. He takes pleasure in their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Psal</hi> 35. 27. 6. He knows that the want of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has cost many a man his life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Saints:</hi> 1. They give him entertainment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, <hi>Ephes</hi> 3. 17. 2. They are the delight of his eyes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. 3. They are the very ravishment of his heart. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. 4. They are his Fathers blessed ones: so the Text. 5. They want entertainment very much, are sometimes in great distress for want of it, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 18,19. 6. They praise him when they have it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From the nature of Entertainment:</hi> 1. It is a fruit of their Faith, <hi>Heb</hi> 11. 31. So in the Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> and the <hi>Shunamite.</hi> 2. It flows from Love, and therefore we must not forget to do it, <hi>Heb,</hi> 13. 1,2. 3. It is a fruit of obedience to the Commandment, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 9. 4. It is a fruit of Bounty: and see <hi>Isa:</hi> 32. 8. 5. It may be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of life. 6. It refresheth them in their weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see what great delight the Lord Jesus hath in his Saints and People, in that he takes so kindly a little entertainment given to them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 149. 4. 2. We see how kindly he will take it when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him into our hearts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. 3. We see what entertainment himself will give such in his house here, and in his Kingdome hereafter, that takes it so kindly when they are entertained into our houses, surely he will honourably entertain them, <hi>Isa:</hi> 25. 6, <hi>John</hi> 14. 2,3. 4. We see how much more kindly he will take it, when we give that that may refresh and save the lives of their Souls. 5. We see that the Lord takes special notice of small kindnesses shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his people, in that a little entertainment is so kindly taken. 6. We see how kindly we should take it when the Lord bows the hearts of his people to be courteous in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining of us, for Christ takes it kindly at their hands. 7. We see that Hospitality is that that Christ loveth and delighteth in, how then should we love it? <hi>Titus</hi> 1: 8:

            <p>The fourth Branch of the XVIII. Doctrine is this, <hi>That the Lerd Jesus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it very kindly when his sick Saints are visited by us, and will own it at the last day as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For opening of which, let me shew, I How it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he takes the visiting of his sick Saints to kindly. 2. Why. 3. The Uses.</p>
            <p>For the first: It does appear, 1. In that he does not let the visits that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> give to his sick servants, go without some reward, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much less when one Saint visits another. 2 In that the Saints are ever better by such visits, both they that visit, and they also that are visited: for commonly they pray together, and speak gracious words together, and so both are bettered, <hi>Jam:</hi> 5. and such visits Christ cannot but take very kindly. 3. In that the sick come by such visits to be healed. <hi>Jam:</hi> 5. 14,15. 4. In that by such visits the sins which the sick have committed come to be forgiven: and to be a means of such an act of charity as that, must needs be kindly taken by Christ Jesus. 5. In that by such visits, the temptations, that sick ones are assaulted with, come often to be removed, and their hearts comforted. 6. In that the Lord commonly orders it, that they that have visited others shall be visited themselves. 7. In that the sick bless those that come to visit them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 1,2,8,9,10,15,16. 8. In that he makes it a pledge of blessedness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 41. 1,2. 9. In that when such as have visited others come to be sick, the Lord will graciously visit such, <hi>Psal.</hi> 41. 3. 10. In that if it should be a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to do to, the living will lay it to heart, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 2.</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Why does the Lord take visits so kindly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From himself 2. From his Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From himself.</hi> 1. He was willing to give such visits many times. 2. He looks at it as an act of our kindness, and he cannot but take our kindness kindly: if he be kinde to the unthankful and to the evil, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 35. much more will he be so to them that shew kindness to his people. 3. He chargeth us to visit his sick ones, <hi>James.</hi> 14,15. 4. He pities sick ones, <hi>Mat:</hi> 8. 16,17. and therefore cannot but take it kindly when we out of pity visit them. 5. He knows all their pains, groans, sorrows, conflicts, comba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000094_0092_0FA019C792E59DB0"/>
temptations; &amp; therefore a visit to them pleaseth him well.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Saints.</hi> 1. They need these visits; for in sick times Satan is bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, Unbelief is busie, Impatience is active and busie, and therefore need help, and the more their need is, the more kindly he takes these visits for their help. 2. They are the more indeared to those that visit them, and Christ takes that well, when love is more increased and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, <hi>Heb:</hi> 13. 1. 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 4. 8. 3. They are most tender to the Lord then, <hi>Heb:</hi> 4. 15. 4. They are not able to do any thing for themselves, cannot stir sometimes to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 5. They cannot speak nor call for help, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 4. 6. They are alone, and that is uncomfortable, <hi>Escles.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see how compassionate and full of bowels the Lord is to sick ones, that take is so kindly when they are visited by us. 2. We see what a little matter done out of Obedience and Faith, pleaseth him; a visit does it: not onely those high acts, <hi>Heb:</hi> 11. 8,17,18,25,26. and those <hi>ver.</hi> 35,36,37,38. but such a small thing as a visit. 3. We see how readily we should come off with this, seeing it is so kindly taken. 4. We see how kindly sick ones should take a visit, for Christ does. 5. We see how kindly we should take the Lords gracious visits to us, in sending Christ to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 78. 6. We see how kindly we should take it at his hands, when he visits us with his gracious Ordinances and Providences: he bewails the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 41—44. 7. We see how kindly we should take it, when he visits our hearts and families with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and Grace, and Spirit. 8. We see that sickness may be the better born, seeing Christ has such regard to a visit given to sick ones. 9. We see that we may not look at visitation of the sick as an arbitrary thing, but as our duty, being so highly set by. 10. We see how desireable and acceptable his last visitation should be to us, <hi>John</hi> 14. 3,18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 22. 11. We see that if we hazard or lay down our lives for the Brethren, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 4. he will much more take it kindly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Humiliation:</hi> 1. That we are so hardly drawn to visit sick ones, when it is so kindly taken by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. 2. That such as are sick sometimes are not so sensibly affected with the Saints visiting of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To those that are in health, to visit them, and pray for them, <hi>Jam:</hi> 5. 14,15. 2. To those that are sick, to take it kindly when they are visited, for Christ does. 3. To both whole and sick, to be thankful for Christs gracious visiting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and ours with his Presence and blessing. 4. To admire with thankfulness Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

in sending Christ to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 68, 69. 5. To visit him often with our holy Addresses to him, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 17. 6. To come off with highest acts of love to him, seeing he so kindly takes such a small matter as a visit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>for Consolation:</hi> 1. That the Lord tenders his sick ones, seeing he is so delighted in a visit of them. 2. That himself will surely visit them. 3. That he will take greater matters done to them kindly. 4. That he would not have them left alone.</p>
            <p>We are now come to the last Branch of the XVIII. Note, which is this, <hi>That Christ Jesus takes it very kindly at our hands, when he come unto his imprisoned ones.</hi>

In that they have their lives given them as a prey for this thing, <hi>Jer:</hi> 28. 7,8,9. with 39. 16,17,18. 3. In that he restores such from sickness to health, <hi>Phil:</hi> 2. 25,27. which is a pledge of the Lords kinde acceptance of it. 4. In that he would have such received with all gladness, <hi>Phil:</hi> 2. 29. 5. In that he would have such held in reputation, <hi>ibid.</hi> 6. In that he imparts some Spiritual blessing to them by the Prisoners means, by their savoury and gracious communication, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31,32. 7.

He desires mercy, and delights in it, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 18. 6. He looseth the Prisoners, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. 7. and therefore takes it kindly when we come to them.</p>

We see of what an amiable nature and sweet spirit the Lord Jesus is, that takes a walk to his Prisoners so kindly. 8. We see that we need not be much discouraged to go to Prison for Christs sake 9. We see that if he respect his Prisoners so, Oh how will he respect them in his Pallace of Glory! 10.

            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. They are the friends of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4. <hi>John</hi> 15.13,14. and men use to say when any are kinde to their friends, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they take it as if it had been done unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; much more will Christ say so, who loves his friends ten thousand times better then men do theirs. 2. They are the Brethren of Christ. <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11,12. and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will interpret the kindnesses done to their Brethren, as done to themselves; much more Christ, who has more brotherly affection then all the loving brethren in the world put all together. 3. They are the fellows of Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.7. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. and Companions are so dear one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that they will account that what is done to their Companions is done to them; much more Christ, who is above all the Companions in the world for love. 4. They are the Members of Christ, <hi>Ethes.</hi> 5. 30. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.18. his very flesh: and how can he do any other but reckon of that that's done to them, as done to himself? 5.

               <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. and Kings are concerned themselves in the welfare of their Subjects, much more this blessed King. 8. They are the very apple of his own eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.3. and therefore he must needs be much concerned in the tender care that is had of them. 9. They are his peculiar People, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 4. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. and how can be then do any other, then take himself as much concerned in what is done to them? 10.

               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see what a loving friend we have of the Lord Jesus, he is all love and sweetness to his people, that takes himself so much concerned in the kindnesses and works of mercy done for them: What love is to be compared to his? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 8. 2. We see what great encouragement merciful ones have to come off with works of mercy, for Christ will say, <hi>Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these my Brethren, ye have done i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That doubtless works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy shall finde a liberal Reward, for Christ takes himself as deeply concerned in them; and he will never take any thing of us (though his own) but will give us much more in lieu of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 9.6. 5. We see what our duty is to Christ, to take the unkindnesses that are done to Christ, as done to our selves, and to look at our selves as deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them. 6. We see that Christ and his Elect ones are one; so he makes account that sayes, <hi>Inasmuch,</hi> &amp;c. Oh what an honour and dignity is this! 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. 7. We see that we c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We see how nearly we should take our selves to be concerned in the matters that concern his Honour and Glory, and the advancement of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; we should think we can never do enough for him in these. 9. We see how willing Christ is to strengthen our Faith, in the words of truth that he speaks, and that we shall have no doubting of the certainty of them, in that he addes his <hi>Amen,</hi> or <hi>Verily,</hi> to what he sayes. 10. We see that they that are unmerciful to the poor and afflicted Saints of Christ, give him the Lie in what he here sayes, and do not believe his words, that are strongly asserted by him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. 11. We see how marvellous humble the Lord Jesus it in his state of Glory, that counts that that is done to the least of his Brethren, as done to himself. 12. We see that
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:000094_0111_0FA019DDF4CCB558"/>
works of beneficence rightly done, reach very far, not so much to the Saints on earth, as to Christ himself who is in Heaven. 13. We see that we have no cause to repent of what is so done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Humiliation:</hi> 1. To those that are hardly drawn to works of mercy; these forget that Christ is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them. 2. To those that turn away the poor from their doors, they turn away Christ from them. 3. To those that have done far less then they might have done.</p>

               <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To come off liberally to hungry, thirsty, strangers, naked, sick, and imprisoned ones, it's done to Christ <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1, 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. 2. To give glory to Christ Jesus, that thus owns what we do. 3. To own him and his Cause in hardest times, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26,33. 4. To be afraid of omitting any opportunity of mercy offered, left we should reject Christ himself, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. 5. To take pains in our beneficence these ways; all our pains are little, being for Christ Jesus, we should go about doing good, travel for it, as <hi>Phil</hi> 2.25—30. 6. To run great hazards, that we may shew mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.3,4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.30. it's for Christ. 7. To bewail that we have done no more, being for Christ. 8. To rejoyce that we have done any thing this way. 9. To rejoyce in our suffering for our mercy to the Saints. 10. To love mercy, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. it is for Christ. 11. To be unwearied in works of mercy, <hi>Gal</hi> 6.9. it is for Christ. 12. To work with our hands, that we may give, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.28. 13.

Against our own thoughts of the littleness of what we have done; if Christ own it, all will be well. 3. Against our defects, in that we have not done it to so many; Christ sayes, <hi>If it be done to one, it is done to me.</hi> 4. Against our fears, because not done to Ministers, or others of great esteem; Christ sayes, <hi>If it be done to the least of these my Brethren, it is done to me.</hi>

They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his Ordinances, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7. and what then can they expect, but that he should bid them depart from him at that day? 5.

            <p>
               <hi>From God.</hi> 1. He is an Infinite One, and his Justice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and finite creatures cannot satisfie Infinite Justice which is offended; and therefore what in their natures they cannot do, must be made up in the everlasting punishment which they must undergo. 2. He is true in all his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, as well as in his Promises; and therefore having threatned everlasting punishment to them, he will bring it to pass, and lay it upon them, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 9. 3. He is a God of Severity, and will not bate them a farthing of the debt they owe him; and therefore because they cannot pay it, they must be everlastingly punished, and lye by it to all eternity. 4. He is jealous God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 24. and jealousie in man will not spare in the day of vengeance, <hi>Prov</hi> 6. 34. much less will his jealousie spare in the day of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but lay on punishment to all eternity. 5. He is a God that will in no wise clear the guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7. and if they should not be punished everlastingly, he must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times needs clear them, and that he will not do. 6. He is a God that will repay the wicked to his face, and a God to whom vengeance belongeth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 35. <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 56. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. and being such a Sin-revenging God, he will revenge himself to the full upon them.</p>

They have deserved this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. and it is meet men should have their wages. 3. They anger him every day, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 11. and what wonder then if

We see what great enemies ungodly men be to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they bring everlasting misery upon their Souls: No such enemy as such a man is to himself. 4.

            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Sins of Omission are transgressions of the Law, as well as sins of Commission, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4. and every transgression of the Law must be charged upon them, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 10. 2.

them for, as well as sins of Commission, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. 5. Sins of Omission come cross to the love of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 17. and what wonder then is it if the Lord Jesus charge them with those sins at that day? 6. Sins of Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do directly strike at Christ, as we see in the Text, and will not he charge home such sins at that day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36 7. Sins of Omission burt others oftentimes as well as a mans selfe. A man may commit a sin sometimes and hurt no man but himselfe by it: but by a sin of Omission he may hurt many others; as for example, there may be many that depend upon a man for his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mes, and Charity, which if he omit, he robs them of their due, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 27. So if a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate should omit and forbear to do his duty, and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster his, many may come to be wrong'd thereby, <hi>Eze.</hi> 34. 3,4. <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 23. 8. Sins of Omission deserve death, as well as sins of Commission, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. and therefore they shall be charged with them at that day. 9. Sins of Omission are fruits of <hi>Adams</hi> Transgression, as well as sins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; and that sin of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed damns all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. 10. Sins of Omission bring a man into bondage to Satan as well as sins of Commission, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be charged at that day. 11. Sins of Omission argue a daring spirit against God, and tempt God as well as sins of Commission, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 19,22,41,42,56. 12. Sins of Omission cause the Name of God to be blasphemed, as well as sins of Commission, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 21—24. 13. Sins of Omission defile the Conscience as well as sins of Commission, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15,16. 14. Sins of Omission, if men be Professors, argue that they are Hypocrites, if they be frequent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 3,4,5. And therefore it is no wonder if they be charged upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see what a dreadfull thing it is to be guilty of sins of Omission, they will be charged upon them all, whoever they be, at the last day. 2. We see that Civil Morall men are in a poor case, and commonly dash at this rock, and split themselves, for they care not for omissions of duties so they keep themselves from gross pollutions. <hi>Paul</hi> was better then any of them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. 3. Wee see what great need we all have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail our sins of Omission, and to confess them before the Lord, that they may be forgiven to us, and so never charged upon us at that day, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. 4. We see the dangerous estate of all Hypocrites, that either make no Conscience of performing duties required in the first Table, or if they seem any thing to mind those, fail shamefully in omiting du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the second Table; for all hypocrites fail in the one or in the other. Their state is dangerous, for sins of Omission
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:000094_0136_0FA019FBF8B58848"/>
will be fadly charged upon them at that day. 5. We see what need we all had to beware we be not guilty of these Omissions in our severall places, and relations, as ever we desire, that they may not be charged upon us at the great day. 6. We see the greatness of these Sins of Omission in the Lords account, how lightly soever men esteem of them. 7. We see that they that make most Conscience of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming duties required, and are least guilty of Omissions, shall stand before the Judg with most comfort. 8. We see that if Omissions will be so charged at that day, oh where shall they appear that sin against the Holy-Ghost? <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4,5,6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 26,27,28,29. 9. We see how tender we should be of men of tender Consciences, that dare not omit any thing that they know to be their duty. 10.

To pitty those that we know to be grosly guilty in omissions, they are like to hear of it another day. 3. To all of us, to humble our selves for our omissions, and charge our selves with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. 4. To all such to repent of these sins as well as others, that they may not be charged at that day. 5. To abhorr Hypocrisie, for such as are Hypocrites, make light of Omissions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. 6. To the Saints to admire the mercy of the Lord, that he will not charge their Omissions upon them. 7. To fear before him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 3,4. 8. To rejoice, when any of ours are Conscientious, concerning duties to be performed. 9. To take heed of forsaking the publick Assemblies of the Saints, therein we should omit a great duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. 10.

            </p>
            <p>I shall handle the several Branches asunder, as I did before: and first begin with <hi>Unmercifulness to hungry and thirsty ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons</hi> why this shall be so deeply charged upon them at that day. 1. From the Nature of Hunger and Thirst. 2. From the Saints, whom they are unmerciful to in their hunger and thirst.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>From the Nature of Hunger and Thirst.</hi> 1. Hunger and Thirst both are intolerable evils, if come to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of them, they are of a killing nature; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was like to die with hunger, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 9. and <hi>Samson</hi> with thirst, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15. 18. and to be unmerciful to those that are in this case, is murther in an high degree; and therefore may well be charged home upon such at that day as are guilty of it. 2. Hunger and thirst bring a long and lingring deaths along with them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 9. and the longer and more lingring the death is, the more painful and sore it is: it is to die many deaths; and therefore it is that Famine is not called <hi>in Arrow,</hi> as the Pestilence is that kills quickly, <hi>Psal</hi> 91. 5. but it is called <hi>Arrows,</hi> and <hi>Evil Arrows,</hi> Ezek. 5. 16. as if there were many deaths in it. Now to inflict many deaths upon the Members of Christ, and to let them die wounded
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:000094_0140_0FA019FF3547E868"/>
with so many arrows, that's great unmercifulness indeed; and therefore such may well have that sin charged home upon them at that day. 3. Hunger and thirst in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of them, will make men and women unnatural to those they love most, yea sometimes to themselves, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 10. <hi>Ezek</hi> 5. 10. Now to refuse to give meat to them that are hungry, and drink to the thirsty, is to put them upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural courses, if God were not more merciful to them: and this sin must needs be charged upon them at that day. 4. Hunger and thirst make men look pale and ghastly, and so is to move men to pity. Now to be unmerciful to such whose countenances bespeak pity and compassion, that must needs be a sin that Christ will charge home at that day. 5. Hunger and Thirst-exhaust the very spirits, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 11,12. Now to refuse to give to those meat and drink, who are almost expiring, and breathing out their last, is great cruelty. 6. Hunger and thirst are warl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

We see that unmercifulness, though it be not known to men, yet it is to the Lord, and he will one day reckon for it. 8. We see the truth of that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>The merciful man doth good to his own soul; but he that is cruel, troubleth his own flesh.</hi> 9. We see now exceedingly the Lord abhors a covetous unmerciful spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 3. 10. We see how tenderly careful the Lord is of the Bodies and lives of his Saints, that will charge it so home to them at that day, that have not fed them. 11.

            <p>
               <hi>From the nature of this sin.</hi> 1. It is want of Humanity; such men do un-Man themselves, forget that they are men: now to be without Humanity, so far to degenerate as to loss the nature of man, must needs be deeply charged upon men at that day. 2. It is want of natural affection, which is an Heathenish sin, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 31. and that is very unbesceming Christianity. 3. It is a manifest breach of Rule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 2. and how then should it be otherwise, but that it should be charged home upon those that are guilty of it? 4. It is that they would be unwilling should be done to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to do that to others, that men would be loth should be done to themselves, is to despise the Law, and the Prophets, and the Law of Christ himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 8. 5. It is great cruelty, and argues much hard-heartedness; <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 18,19. and will not the Lord be severe to such, and reckon sore with cruel ones? 6. It comes cross to the practise of holy men, <hi>Abraham, Lot,</hi> that good old man, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 20,21. <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Job</hi> chap. 31, 32. and many others. 7. It is worse then Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 2,7,10. 8. It is that that is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to the spirits of good men <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 51,52,53,54. and though they were too hot, which Christ rebukes them for, yet the sin was great, and very provoking, although the sweet disposition of Christ would not then punish it. 9. It is a confluence of many sins, and the very sink that they come from, and run into, Pride, Covetousness, Careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Senslesness of others conditions, Barrenness, Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness, Unbeleif, and these the Lord abhors. 10. It is the highest degree of ingratitude to Christ, for his bounty in outward things bestowed upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Saints in this condition;</hi> 1. They are very precious in the right of the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38. and not to entertain such must needs be that that will be deeply charged upon men at that day. 2. They are in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loss of health, and life, in such a condition, and therefore not to be received then, must needs provoke the Lord to lay his charge heavy upon such as have been this way

They are such as bring God the Father, and Christ Jesus the Son, and the holy Spirit with them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. and not to entertain such, is to shut out these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>First, <hi>From the Nature of this Sin:</hi> 1. It is that that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth them to perishing, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 19. and thereby such are guilty of Murther, and therefore it is no wonder if Christ will so deeply charge it upon wicked men at the last day. 2. If it should not rise so high as Murther, yet it exposeth them to suffer much by reason of cold, which sometimes is so extream that it cannot be born, <hi>Psal</hi> 147. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. and the extremity of cold causeth many sicknesses, some of which are as painful, and bitter as death it self: see <hi>Job</hi> 24. 7. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. 3. If neither of these should come, yet it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Saints to uncomeliness; for to be naked, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of clothing, is very uncomely: and the Lord would
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:000094_0145_0FA01A068B1B4EB8"/>
have us go comely, &amp; looks at it as a sin in those that cause others to go naked <hi>Job</hi> 24. 10. 4. It is that that godly men reprove in those that they think are guilty of it, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 6. It's true, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> missed the mark, when he charged <hi>Job</hi> with this; but yet it holds out, that he thought he was guilty, and chargeth it home upon him. Much more will Christ charge it deeply upon them that he knows to be guilty, at that day. 5. It is Inhumanity; and God would have us, as in other cases, to shew our selves men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 8. 6. It is contrary to the Rule of the Gospel, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 11. 7. It comes cross to the practice of the Saints, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>Job</hi> 31. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 39. 8. It breaks the Law of Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 10. 9. It spoils the most Spiritual of all our Duties, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 3,4,6,7. 10.

               <hi>From the Nature of this sin.</hi> 1. It argues that such men have forsaken the fear of the Almighty, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 14. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no wonder that such shal be charged with it at that day. 2. It argues that such men are not sensible of the afflicted estate of such sick ones, and that's a manifest breach of Rule, <hi>ibid.</hi> 3.

It argues that they have no love to the Brethren, for love would come off with a visit chearfully, and willingly, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. 6.

It argues that they dream of the Continuance of their own healths, and that they shall not be sick.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Saints in that condition.</hi> 1. They cannot help themselves; and to deny a visit to such, must needs he great Cruelty. 2. They need visiting for the comfort both of outward and inward man; and we are bound to attend both, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 14. 3. They do even beg of pity, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 21. and to be denied pity when they desire it of us, is sad, and will be reckoned for. 4. They are such as the hand of God has touched, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 21. and therefore we should be touched with the sense of their condition. 5. They are lonesome and disconsolate, and cannot well want company. 6. They are such as Satan is apt to take advantage against; for when the Saints are most alone, and weakest, then he bestirs himself most, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1,2. 7. They
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:000094_0148_0FA01A08BA5522D0"/>
are such as God sometimes withdraws himself from, as he did from <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Isa. 38. 13. 8. They mourn in that condition, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 14. and to be denied a visit at such a time, as it is grievous to them, so the Lord cannot but reckon for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see that the Lord has respect to his sick Saints, and dearly tenders them himself, seeing he will charge it so home upon wicked men at the last day, that they have not visited them in that condition. 2. We see that if they that visit not Christs sick Members shall be so severely judged, Oh what will be the condition of those that are glad at such a Calamity, and hope they shall never come out of it! <hi>Psal</hi> 41. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35. 15. 3.

               </gap>o repent of such unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to charge this sin upon themselves, by confessing and bewailing it, that they may not be charged with it at that day. 4. We see that Sickness are no arguments of Gods rejecting of his Saints, for he is tender of them in that condition, and cannot endure that any should be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted toward them. 5. We see a reason why God orders it in his Providence, that such shall not be visited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when sick: for he distastes them so, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> will charge it upon them at that day. And this is a token of his displeasure against them. 6. We see that surely such as are sick of love for Christ <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 8. shall be very much tendred by them, and he will not endure that any should be cruel to them. 7. We see how careful we should be so enquire who are sick amongst us, and go and visit them, as ever we desire to escape this severe charge of the Lord Jesus at the last and great day. 8. We see that all such as have been guilty of this sin, must needs be troubled in their Consciences for it, when they think seriously of it; for it will be charged home upon them at the last and great day. 9. We see what need we had to look after those that are sick of sin, and to tender convinced sinners, as Christ does. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 11,12. 10. We see that if the non visitation of sick ones will be so deeply charged upon men at that day, then surely cruelty to sick ones in other kinds much more.</p>

            <p>We are now come to the last Branch of the XXXVI.</p>
            <p>Doctrine, and that is this, <hi>That unmercifulness to Christs imprisoned ones, shall be deeply charged upon the Wicked at the last and great Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the nature of this sin. 2. From the Saints in this condition.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>From the Nature of this sin of not visiting Christs Prisoner:</hi> 1. It is an high contempt of Christ himselfe, for he saves, <hi>he is in Prison when they are;</hi> and will not such a sin be charged home at that day? 2. It is great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedness and cruelty; For no men in the world need more pitty then sometimes Prisoners do; they endure great trials, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 36. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. and this is a great plague, <hi>Exod</hi> 9. 14. to be hard-hearted. 3. It is inhumanity; and such a sin whereby men put off humanity, must needs be charged deeply upon them at that day. 4. It is worse then Barbarism; for even Barbarians have been kind to some of the Lord's Prisoners, as to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was a Prisoner, <hi>Acts.</hi> 28,2,10. 5. It is worse then Heathenism; for some Heathens have been kinde to the Lords Prisoners; as we see in <hi>Iosephs</hi> Keeper, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 21. so <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 2,16,31. 6. It is that by which men resemble the very Devil; for he casts the Saints into Prison, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. and would have them there to have no mercy. 7. It is altogether inconsistent with
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000094_0150_0FA01A0A37823868"/>
the love of God, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 17. 8. It is a Trangression of that Commandment that we have from God, that <hi>He who loveth God, love his Brother also,</hi> 1 <hi>Iab.</hi> 4. 21. 9. It is that that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable to God, Angels, and all good men: for all these visit these Prisoners, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 6,7,8. 10. It is that that a man will loath himself for, if ever he repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Saints in that condition:</hi> 1. They are in a lonesome condition, and therefore stand in need visiting. 2. They are under manifold temptations; and others visits would help them in such a condition. 3. They are sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; we read of the sighs of Prisoners, <hi>Psal.</hi> 79. 11. and others visits would help to alleviate those sighs. 4. They are dying men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 79. 11. and not to visit dying men must needs be charged upon those that are guilty of it. 5. They are meanly provided for in the Prison, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22. 26,27. and not to visit them, to minister something more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable for them for their Diet, is sad, and will be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. 5. They have mean Lodging; many times a little straw, or it may be a Pair of Stocks, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 24. 7. They are sometimes pined, and have no meat at all, <hi>Jer</hi> 38. 9. 8. They are starved with cold; as Mr. <hi>Latimer.</hi> 9. They are tortured sometimes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. 10. They continue long in this condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see that the Lords Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners are very dear to him, in that he will charge unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones so deeply at that day, for not visiting them in this their afflicted condition. 2. We see that he will surely charge it home upon them, that have without cause put them into Prison, and have dealt cruelly with them there, by Pining, Starving, Torturing of them. 3. We see that surely the death of such Prisoners is very precious in his sight. If the death of every Saint be precious, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 15. then much more precious is the death of these Saints, that are Sufferers for him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 16. He will charge the wicked's not visiting them, upon them; and therefore when they shed their Blood, it shall be costly to them: He will have a price for that Blood. 4. We see that the Saints may be content to be put in Prison, and to suffer the Cruelty that sometimes they there meet with; for Christ takes notice of it, and will deeply charge it upon unmerciful ones. 5. We see that the closest Prisons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exclude Christ, nor shut out his love from his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38,39. 6. We see that if there he so much iniquity in a non-visit of Christs Prisoners, that it shall be so charged; Oh what is there in the Slaughter of so many as have been stain for Jesus sake in all Ages! 7. We see
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:000094_0151_0FA01A0BE0AA1368"/>
that the worst state of the People of the Lord, even a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-condition, is better then the best of hard hearted wicked men, for these last must be accountable for their Neglects of poor Prisoners. 8. We see that omissions of small kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to men in misery, though we think not of them as any great matter, yet will be made so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Why they would excuse their unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at that day. 2. Why their excusing themselves shall be of no avail for them.</p>
            <p>For the first: <hi>They would Excuse themselves</hi> 1. From the Pride of their hearts, whereby they think better of

A bold audacious fellow, though he be guilty of some foul fact, yet will frame many excuses, to do what he can to clear himself before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see the greatness of the folly of wicked men, that think that their poor Excuses will stand them in any stead at the great day, after the Sentence is passed: What folly like this? 2. We see that wicked men will take hold of, and catch at any thing, though never so feeble, to shift off and avoid punishment. A man ready to drown, will catch hold of sticks and straws, that can no way help them: So here. 7. We see how loth wicked men are to come to punishment, they would fain escape it and fly from it. 4. We see that there's no dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Christ at that day: Men may sometimes be put off with Excuses, but the great judge will not. 5. We see that wicked men's Confidence will deceive them, <hi>Joh</hi> 18. 14. it will be a broken Reed to them in that day. 6. We see how necessary it is to get the Judge to be our friend now in the day of Grace, for no Excuse will serve the turn at that day. 7. We see how vain it is to make Excuses for sin here, for the day is coming when no Excuse will stand in stead before the great Judge. 8. We see the Impudence of wicked men, that dare charge the Judge himself with untruth at that day. 9. We see what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief there is in sin, when no Excuse will exempt men from punishment. 10. We see how dreadful it will be to see the face of the Judge at that day, who will not be put off with vain Excuses. 11. We see how good it is here to make supplication to our Judge. 12. We see how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable the Judge will be at that day; it will be too late then to speak.</p>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> XXXVIII. is this, <hi>That wicked men do not know how farre their Unmercifulness to the Saints reacheth: it reacheth to Christ himself, but they know it not.</hi> There is a greater guilt upon them then they are aware of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From themselves. 2. From the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self 3. From Satan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From themselves.</hi> 1. From that natural Stupidity and Blockishness that is in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Hence they are so often called <hi>Fools</hi> in Scripture, <hi>and without understanding.</hi> 2. From their Madness, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17. and men that are out of their wits know not what they do. 3. From the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they have in this sin; for that like a Bribe blinds their eyes, that they cannot see into the mischief of it, and how farre it reacheth. 4. From their want of considering how near the Saints are to Christ: for did they consider that, they could not but know that their unmercifulness to them would reach to Christ himself. 5. From the willing igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. 6. From the false Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings that they use to colour and cover their sin with; as, that <hi>they are Idle,</hi> and to give to them, would maintain them in their Idleness, and they may want themselves, and have others lye upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Lord Himself.</hi> 1. He in Judgement shuts their eyes, <hi>John</hi> 12. 39,40. <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 18. 2. He is not bound to give them more understanding; he is free to impart it where he will, and to deny it to whom he will. 3. He has reserved them for wrath, 2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Ioh</hi> 21. 30. and in this way he lets them go to this sad journeys end. 4. He has ordained them to destruction: so the Text; and so leaves them to go hood wink'd to their Ruine. 5. He came into
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:000094_0155_0FA01A10B500AA20"/>
the world for Judgement, that some that see might be made blind, <hi>Iotn</hi> 9. 39. 6. He reserves something to tell them at that day to their cost, if they would not understand it here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From Satan:</hi> 1. He blinds them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3,4. 2. He keeps them in the dark, knowing that that is the surest way to deceive them: he is the graud deceiver, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9. and this way deceiveth them. 3. He hides the danger and the hook, and shews only the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. 4. He is a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, and cruel Spirit, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. and therefore useth all wayes to draw men to cruelty and unmercifulness; and that he may effect this, hides the danger of this sin from them, and keeps them from knowing how farre it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see the misery of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful men, they know not the greatness of the guilt that is upon them; their sin reacheth further then they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, they think it is onely against men, but Christ will tell them another thing at the great day. 2. We see what a dangerous thing it is to be ignorant of the nature and extent of sin, for it will be discovered in the full latitude of it at that day. 3. We see that ignorance will be no sufficient Plea or Excuse for wicked men at the great day, but will leave them altogether inexcusable before the great Judge. 4. We see that unmercifulness shall never hide it self under any shadow; but that that unmerciful men think to be a shelter to them, shall wet them to the skin at that day: for they know not the extent of it, yet they shall know how far that sin went, at that day. 5. We see that those sins that men count little, are great sins in the Lords account. 6. We see how hateful the sin of unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulness should be to us, that wicked men make so little reckoning of; for there's more in it then they are aware of. 7. We see how miserable their state will be that know that unmercifulness reacheth Christ himself, and yet go on in that way. 8. We see the great patience of Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unmerciful men, that though their sin reach him, yet does forbear them in this world, 9. We see that mens condition being evil, if they know it not, is so much the worse to them. 10. We see what a judgement of God it is to be blinde, and not to see the extent of the danger of this sin. 11. We see that the greatness of some mens sins is not discovered to them till the day of Judgement. 12. We see that they that will not know their sins here, shall know them to their cost at that day.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From Himself. 2. From the Wicked. 3. From the Sentence passed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From Himself.</hi> 1.

From his Majesty and Glory; his words will daunt them and confound them. Look as the words of Kings have power going a long with them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 4. so his words much more. 3. From the Rightness and Integrity of his words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 6,7,8. and right words are of great force: <hi>How forcible are right words</hi> when men speak them? <hi>Ioh</hi> 6. 25. much more his right words, which he will speak at that day. 4.

<pb n="144" facs="unknown:000094_0157_0FA01A11B735D9A0"/>
that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 16 10. <hi>A Divine Sentence</hi> (saith <hi>Solomen</hi>) is in the lips of the King; <hi>his mouth transgresseth not his judgement:</hi> And if so, then surely this Kings mouth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredeth not in Judgement: and such a mouth speaking to them, must needs stop all their mouthes. 6. From the End of his Coming to Judgement, which is a thorow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of all ungodly men, <hi>Iude</hi> ver. 14,15. 7. From his power in his Ordinances, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 11,12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Wicked.</hi> 1. From the feebleness of their Pleas: weak Arguments and pleas are easily overturned; and such will be theirs at that day. So the Text. 2. From their Consciences, which will be their Accusers, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against them, and Condemn them, for if their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences do all this sometimes here, much more at that day, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 20 <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15,16. 3.

Because as in the Natural Body, the <hi>Head cannot say to the Foot, I have no need of thee,</hi> 1 Cor 12. 21. So here. 3. Because every Saint receives Influence and Nourishment from Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. 4. Because every Saint is knit to Christ, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.19. 5. Because every Saint, yea the least and meanest is an ornament and support to the Body; as the little Finger, the little Toe in the Natural Body: so here. 6.

We see that great is the price that Christ sets upon his least Saints. 8. We see that the lowest condition, and most despised in this world, is no stop or barre to Christs love to his people: His love is great to the least of his. 9. We see that one of Christs Brethren, yea one of the least of them, is of more worth with Christ Jesus, then all the wicked men in the world. 10.
