            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IT is a very great mortification to the gentlemen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,—your not permitting Miss <hi>Flourish</hi> to go to the Assembly.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I mean it as such Mr. <hi>Runt</hi>;—if your sex are so weak and undiscerning, as to prefer the fading, short lived, perishable trifle beauty, to the noble exalted, mental accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which only are of intrinsic value, Mr. <hi>Runt</hi>;—it is fit they should be mortified.— O why has Heaven permitted our passive sex to be so long deceived and misled by the idle and ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> less opinion of the superior wisdom of the male sex!—in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal strength I grant their superiority;—and I have found some capable of pleasing; —but few—very few indeed capable of informing me.—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Runt.</speaker>
               <p>But madam you will be pleased to consider, that few ladies are so accomplished as you are allowed to be.</p>

               <p>Say no more Mr. <hi>Runt</hi>;—I am almost sick at the bare mention of the word;— it is so horribly prostituted and misapplied upon almost all occasions.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is very cruel treatment; and it is a wonder if we don't suffer for it in the end; I never could learn the cause madam.</p>

               <p>The <hi>French!</hi> The cursed <hi>French!</hi> Mr. <hi>Runt,</hi> are the cause of all our misery:—This Rebellion would have been crush'd long before this, but for them—We could not have held out much longer, when they step'd in; but must have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to such terms as our gracious sovereign would have conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to offer; which all who know his goodness Mr. <hi>Runt,</hi> are convinced would have been just and merciful</p>

               <p>Your observations are very just madam, and I am entirely of your opinion:—And as to the <hi>French</hi>—every body says they are a treacherous crew:—I know when I was in <hi>England</hi> it was the general opinion there; and that they never would fight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I don't despair but Old <hi>England</hi> will give them a drub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing yet.—But as to us, I think we are in a worse box than ever;—out of the frying-pan, into the fire; and all this for a trifling duty on tea.</p>

               <p>Well we must wait with patience Mr. <hi>Runt</hi>; I have still hopes, notwithstanding what Mr. <hi>Turncoat</hi> says;— I never thought him much of a politician.—It was rather unfortunate for him, that he would not even suffer his daughters to go to a Whig-Assembly as it was called the winter before last; and now so warmly to engage in it; because these people are very apt to remember; and may possibly assign this miraculous change to the true motive.—</p>

               <p>O Mr. <hi>Runt,</hi> I am exceeding glad to see you; I wanted to ask you a thousand questions:—What sort of an assembly had you?—Who was there?—Were the ladies very much dress'd?—How did the <hi>He-Bears</hi> (as Miss <hi>Doggril</hi> calls them) behave?—How did they handle their paws?—Could you keep your countenance?</p>

               <p>Stop! stop! stop! Miss Volubility,—not quite so fast; who do you think can answer so many questions at once?— Now Mr. <hi>Runt,</hi> can you think it possible, after all this seeming contempt for the company, that this girl cried a whole day because I would not let her go to the assembly?—Assembly! Good Heavens! It is a burlesque upon the name of an assembly:— I have no patience when I think of it:—Yet there's my sister is fool enough to go; tho' she told me she would not dance, because she could not bear to give her hand to such cattle.</p>

               <p>Ha, ha, ha!—Why I'll tell you <hi>Aid</hi>—I was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the other evening with that pretty set; tho' by the way some of them are really pretty: But <hi>Entre nous Aid</hi>—They are a damn'd set!—It is unnecessary to repeat the conversation; suffice it to say it was upon the old topic; which they handled with so much ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and indecency, sparing none of us; and so very lavish of their encomiums, on the British officers;—that I confess I felt not a little vexed; and in revenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—as well as to divert the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—proposed, their making each two shirts a week, for the continental soldiers.</p>

               <p>As I intended; faith!—it operated so violently on <hi>Tab,</hi> that I expected nothing short of an hysteric fit; her efforts to contain her rage must have been excessive, if one may judge by her horribly distorted countenance.</p>

               <speaker>Aid,</speaker>
               <p>Why I dare swear <hi>Careless,</hi> it was her natural look, which you took for such an horrible distortion</p>

               <speaker>Careless.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, <hi>Aid,</hi>—Though we all agree she is dam'd ugly at best, yet I never saw her look quite so much like the devil before. But at last she was relieved by opening upon me.—Heavens and Earth what a volley!—I stood the shock for some time; at length I pretended to be very sorry, and begged their pardon. Then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing Tab—I had no thought of giving the least offence, said I, my dear <hi>young</hi> lady; but was really simple enough to think, that while the gentlemen were fighting, bleeding and dying for their country;—that the ladies could do no less than I proposed:—Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, convinced by the force of your arguments I give up the point.—I had scarce finished before I saw symptoms of another explosion from the same quarter:—and seeing not one advocate in the room; but on the contrary, every countenance deeply tinged with the irascible; I thought it best to decamp; which I did leaving them not a little chagrined.</p>

               <p>I am very glad of it.—for between you and I <hi>Careless,</hi> I begin to be sick of such company; though I think what they say is of very little consequence.</p>

               <speaker>Careless,</speaker>
               <p>It is of so much consequence in my opinion; that I think it the duty of every whig to discountenance such indecent raillery and abuse, at all times and upon all occasions.</p>

               <p>Ridiculous, or not; was I to continue here for anytime I should not hesitate to treat them with the neglect and contempt they deserve. Such a conduct invariably pursued, by those whom they

               <p>I believe you are right Careless: I wish to Heaven the experiment was tried—O how I should glory in seeing the poor despised, neglected, solitary devils, looking and longing in vain for a bow or a smile, to cheer their drooping spirits.</p>
