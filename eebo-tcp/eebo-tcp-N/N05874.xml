            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A REMONSTRANCE.</head>
            <p>I Think it is evident, beyond all Reaſon of Controverſy, that no Order, Office or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion among Mankind, hath been treated more roughly, and with more ſatyre and Sarcaſm, by the <hi>Independent Reflector,</hi> in his Weekly Eſſays, than the Clergy; yet I, who am a Clergyman, and beſides, one that openly accepted the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flector's</hi> Challenge, not from a Spirit of Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſs and Contention, but to take away the Reproach from the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> do, notwithſtanding, condole the <hi>Reflector's</hi> Fate; nor could I have imagined his Cataſtrophe would have been ſuch, as the Event hath aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; I thought an Author of ſo maſterly a Pen, who beſides is ſo zealous an Advocate for Liberty, would have met with more Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and better Encouragement, than that his own Printer ſhould find it his Intereſt to caſt him off. For my Part, I had my own Reaſons, for not making any Encomiums upon his Performances, though at the ſame Time
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007457_0003_102D92C9DEB1BE08"/>
I could not help admiring them, which, I think, in Point of maſterly Writing, have not hitherto been equalled by any in the Province, if in the Land: I do therefore, ſincerely acknowledge both the Delight and the Improvement I have received by them, and heartily wiſh he may again reſume his Theme, where he broke it off. I have heretofore confeſſed, that I thought him not ſo independent in his ſecular Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, as in his religious Rhapſodies, and am of Opinion, it is Pity, the Public ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Reflections, notwithſtanding ſome of them prove very unwarrantable in Point of <hi>real Religion:</hi> I ſay, real Religion; for as to the Arminion and Latitudinarian Scheme, it is ſo notoriouſly countenanced and preached up, even by ſome of the Clergy in this Land, that the <hi>Independent Reflector</hi> cannot poſſibly ſay worſe; nor have I ever diſcovered any Thing in him, more diametrically contrary to the Tenor of holy Scripture, and more directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> than I have ſince found in the Writings of ſome Clergymen in our Parts of the World; wherefore, as the Fear of his broaching falſe Doctrine and Hereſy, was the chief Reaſon, which conſtrained me to attack the <hi>Reflector,</hi> and as he has now been ſilenced almoſt a Year, I could wiſh he would begin again: I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have heard when I was in <hi>Holland,</hi> that
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007457_0004_102D92CD4CC7D1F0"/>
when a Miniſter of our Church, publickly teacheth any erroneous Doctrine, the Claſſis to which he belongs, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Synod, behave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in this Manner: They firſt ſilence him, for the Space of ſix Weeks, then permit him to preach again; if he deſiſt from his Error, all is well; but if he ſtill perſiſt therein, he is ſilenced for a longer Time; and at length, after much Admonition, in vain, is depoſed, when he is judged quite incorrigible. Ain't it then too hard, that the <hi>Reflector</hi> ſhould be at once ſilenced and depoſed for ever? 'Tis true, he is no Clergyman; what then? We know very well, the old Engliſh Law, relating the Benefit of the Clergy, was of ſuch vaſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, that it included all thoſe who could read Latin; <hi>Legit ut Clericus,</hi> ſaid they; and it was enough: And I dare ſay of the <hi>Reflector, Scribit ut Clericus,</hi> which I am ſure is more; beſides, who knows, but the <hi>Reflector</hi> may have ſeen his Errors, and may have heartily repented of them? Or if he has not as yet, who knows but he may in Time to come? Indeed, when I conſider, what a Bleſſing he might be to this Land, if he was really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and become a new Creature of God, my Soul is inſpired with Tenderneſs towards him; and methinks, I ſee already by Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, him throwing away that arrogant and opprobrious Title of <hi>Independent;</hi> (for the Lord
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007457_0005_102D92CF422EC6E0"/>
knows, we are all poor dependent Creatures, did we but know it too!) contenting himſelf with commencing <hi>Reflector</hi> only, and beſides his Reflections on ſecular Affairs, pleading the Neceſſity of Regeneration, Converſion and Holineſs of Life, in order to obtain eternal Salvation. Oh! if this ſhould happen, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we would be bleſſed with a <hi>Watts,</hi> a <hi>Doddridge,</hi> or a <hi>Hervey</hi> in our Land; nay, ſo ſanguine are my Hopes, that I even flatter myſelf, he would yet perhaps, enter into Holy Orders, and combat the Empire of <hi>Chaos,</hi> and ancient Night, from the Pulpit. I do then heartily wiſh, he may begin again, to ſet about his Reflections, after this Year's Meditation and Pauſe; but with this Proviſo, that the Preſs be free and open to all thoſe who think they diſcover any Errors and Hereſies in his Lucubrations, and that the Clergy eſpecially, who are the Watchmen on the Walls of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> keep a good Look-out, and have a watchful Eye over him.</p>
            <p>And while I am on this Head, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear putting my Reverend Brethren, in mind of their Duty, to watch over one another alſo. Our Land is at preſent, in a critical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture; we are preparing to reſiſt and repel our incroaching Neighbours; we are about erecting a College for the Education of Youth; the Doctrines that are taught among us, will
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007457_0006_102D92D0CB9B7368"/>
have a near Connexion with the good or bad Succeſs of both thoſe important Enterpriſes. I ſincerely thank the <hi>Reflector,</hi> that he hath been ſo watchful over the Public, as to point out in his Preface, ſome of the enormous Doctrines, that have been taught by Clergymen at h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e; and I moſt earneſtly entreat him, when he begins again, to be ſo good as to put up on that Score one lately come abroad in our Land, of which we may ſay, <hi>there is no Smith in</hi> Iſrael; and it is this: <q>As for you, who are yet under the Direction of others, if you behave ſo as to merit the Eſteem of your Parents, Inſtructors, and good Men, that you are converſant with, you need not doubt of meriting alſo the love of God in Chriſt. Thus, however early your Summons from Life maybe, you ſhall neither fall unprepared nor unlamented. If unſullied Innocence and Purity of Manners, be the Means of Happineſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine I take to be ſuch, that the bare Reading of it, muſt give ſome Shock to a pious Mind; wherefore, I am of Opinion it may met with a Reprehenſion, from the right Reverend Father in God the Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> for I am certain it has a worſe Tendency, than the rankeſt Enthuſiaſm, which is ſo often checked from that venerable See. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in the mean while, as the Word of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007457_0007_102D92D285A86CE0"/>
God is the Standard, by which we are to judge concerning thoſe Things, which lead to our eternal Peace, it may not be amiſs to open and unfold it a little, and then to compare it to holy Scripture, and to the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Contraſt may appear.</p>
            <p>The Perſons here ſpoken of, or ſpoken unto, are thoſe who are yet under the Direction of others, that is, the Youth in the Academy, and a Suppoſition is made, if they behave ſo as to merit the Eſteem of their Parents, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, and good Men they are converſant with, (which I think no one will deny, or can deny, they may do; nay, they hardly behave ſo ill as to forfeit the Eſteem of their Parents, Inſtructors, and good Men they are converſant with; for, who can forbear eſteeming them, if they are not guilty of any groſs Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?) and upon this Suppoſition, upon this Condition, and upon theſe Terms, they need not doubt of meriting alſo the Love of God in Chriſt; and that in ſuch a Manner, as however early their Summons from Life may be, they ſhall not fall unprepared. Was there any ſuch Thing (as there is not) of merting the Love of God in Chriſt, I believe the behaving ſo as to merit the Eſteem of our Parents, Inſtructors, and good Men we are converſant with, would come very far ſhort of it, and to expect to Merit the love of God in Chriſt, at this rate,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007457_0008_102D92D483421F28"/>
would be Sacrilegiouſly depreciating the ſame. But come on; let us look into our Bibles, and if I miſtake not, we ſhall find, beyond all Doubt, there is no ſuch Thing as meriting the Love of God in Chriſt. We read, <hi>Iſai.</hi> lxvi. 6. <hi>But we are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righteouſneſs are as filthy Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities, like the Wind, have taken us away.</hi> We alſo read, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxiii. 6. <hi>In his Days</hi> (that is, in the Days of the <hi>Meſſiah) Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely: And this is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> And, <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 10. <hi>So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall have done all thoſe Things which are commanded you, ſay, We are unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do.</hi> And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8, 9. <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved, through Faith, and that not of yourſelves: It is the Gift of God:</hi> Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt. For my Part, I cannot ſee how the Doctrine aforeſaid, can be ever reconciled to this Doctrine of holy Scripture, or be rendered compatible therewith; they appear to me dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite, and everſive of one another.</p>
            <p>Let us next ſee, what Account we ſhall find about the Doctrine, in the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which are very ſcriptural. The XI. Article contains theſe Words: <q>We are accounted righteous before God, only for the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007457_0009_102D92D7AAE9DED0"/>
Merit of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by Faith, and not for our own Works, or Deſervings. Wherefore, that we are juſtified by Faith only, is a moſt wholſome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort, as more largely is expreſſed in the homily Juſtification.</q> The XIIIth Article is thus: <q>Works done before the Grace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Inſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they ſpring not of Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> neither do they make Men mute to receive Grace, or (as the School Authors ſay) deſerve Grace of Congruity; yea, rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now behold how the Doctrine aforeſaid, agrees with the Doctrine of the Church! the one ſaith, (if you behave ſo as to merit the Eſteem of you Parents, Inſtructors, and good Men that you are converſant with,) you need not doubt of meriting alſo the Love of God in Chriſt; the other ſaith, we are accounted righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deſervings. The modern Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine teacheth, as for you, who are yet under the Direction of others, if you behave ſo as to merit the Eſteem of your Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you need not doubt of meriting alſo the Love of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007457_0010_102D92D9366848A0"/>
God in Chriſt. The Church teacheth, Works done before the Grace of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, foraſmuch as they ſpring not of Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo forth, as in the Article is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and ſurely, I think it can't be believed, that all thoſe who being yet under the Direction of others, behave ſo as to merit the Eſteem of their Parents, Inſtructors, and good Men they are converſant with, have received the Grace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Inſpiration of his Spirit: Conſequently ſome are ſo far from meriting the Love of God in Chriſt, that they are by meriting the Eſteem of Men, not ſo much as rendered mute to receive Grace, or deſerve Grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, but their beſt Works have the Nature of Sin: Which of theſe two widely different Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are we then to believe? It is poſſible we ſhould behave, and that without doubt, a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine ſet up in manifeſt Contradiction againſt the Oracles of ſacred and unerring Truth, and againſt the Articles of the Church? For my Part, I am ſo far from believing that upſtart Doctrine, that I doubt not in the leaſt but it is falſe, and beſides Soul deſtructive to thoſe who are ſo unhappy as to believe it: And as ſuch I complain of it; I remonſtrate, I proteſt againſt it, before God and all his Saints.</p>
            <p>O! it grieves me to the Heart, to ſee a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> run ſo
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007457_0011_102D92DB251CAFC8"/>
directly counter to holy Scripture, and to the Articles of his own Church, which he hath ſubſcribed, if not ſworn to: What muſt the World think of it? How many deſpiſe all Religion for it, and think it is all a Sham, a Farce? Pious and well grounded Minds, who have Truth inwardly, and are inbued with ſalutary Principles of Religion, will conſider that there muſt be Offences given, on the one Hand, that the faithful be made manifeſt; and on the other, that there be Stumbling Blocks for thoſe who walk not Upright; but Woe to them by whom they are given! I am not bigotted to the Articles of any Church upon Earth, ſo as not to recede from them, if I could diſcover them, to be falſe. But holy Scripture, the Nature and Fitneſs of Things, and the Dictates of my own Conſcience, aſſure me, the Love of God, in Chriſt, is free, undeſerved, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited; and from the contrary Doctrine, Good Lord deliver us!</p>
            <p>What ſhall we then ſay, of <hi>unſullied Innocence, and Purity of Manners, being the Means of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that is, of Happineſs after Death, or eternal Happineſs. I believe there is no ſuch Thing among the perverſe Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> as unſullied Innocence, Purity of Manners; they are all and every one guilty Mortals, polluted and defiled with Sin. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

for far greater Faults than any of them can well fall into? I fear this unſullied Innocence, and Purity of Manners, which is abſolved in meriting the Eſteem of our Parents, Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and good Men we are converſant with, (how amiable ſoever it renders our Character) will, if we confide therein, as the Means of our eternal Happineſs, in the End, prove a Shadow without Subſtance, an illuſory Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, an erring Metior, an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder us into the Paradiſe of Fools. O my God! my Soul is caſt down within me, to ſee ſuch mortal Poyſon and deadly Bane, dealt out with an unſparing Hand, to poor unwary dear Souls, who are ſo very eager to ſwallow the fatal Bait! Let me believe the Doctrine of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that whoever will be his Diſciple, muſt deny himſelf, take up his Croſs, and follow <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Save thine Elect, O Lord, from giving Credit to falſe and ſoul-ruining Doctrines, and let as many as are choſen unto eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, be brought to experience the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and converting, the renewing and regenerating Operations of the holy Spirit, working in them Faith and Love, that they may confeſs;

No, I take Heaven to Witneſs, the Reluctance with which I make this Remonſtrance. I ſympathize in the Loſs of that lovely Youth; every tender Paſſion thrills my Breaſt: I wiſh him Reſt; a happy Place among the eternal Bleſt! I hope he has built upon a better Foundation, than the Eſteem of Men, or his own unſullied Innocence, and Purity of Manners; upon the Rock of Ages, the Merits of the Lord our Righteouſneſs, may he have reſted his dear Soul! I condole with the Tutor; eſteem his excellent Talents; I admire the greateſt Part of his Performance; did not the Love of my God, the unfeigned Zeal for his Cauſe, the Deſire for the eternal Happineſs of precious immortal Souls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain me to bear my Teſtimony againſt Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of ſuch pernicious Conſequence; this my Writing had been ſilent as the Grave. But while we are in a Land of Liberty, in which the moſt enormous and quite monſtrous Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are broached without Controle, I will fight againſt them the Battles of the Lord. I ſhall beſpatter no Man's Character: I war not againſt the Perſons, but againſt the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. What halt we any longer between two Opinions? If <hi>Baal</hi> be God, let us ſerve him;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007457_0014_102D92E1931D5F20"/>
but if the Lord be God, let us ſerve him. That by meriting the Eſteem of Men, we do not merit the Love of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo as not to fall unprepared by Death; that unſullied Innocence, and Purity of Manners, will not do, to thoſe who are wiſe, to venture upon into Eternity; I take upon me, in the Fear of the Lord, diffident of my own Strength, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, againſt the contrary Doctrine. I will preach, I will write, I will remonſtrate, I will proteſt, without Regard to Perſon, or Merit, or Genius, or Station, or Office, while God ſhall enable me ſo to do; about Opinions which have no Connection with our eternal Concerns, <hi>trahit ſuaquemque doluſſtes,</hi> let every one think as he liſts, for aught I care; but here let us ſtand with undaunted Courage and Magnanimity of Soul, glowing with the Love of Truth, until I either conquer, or am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; which laſt ſhould it happen, I ſhall not be wanting to aſcribe its true Cauſe, my own Weakneſs and Incapcity; for though I fall, Truth will ſtand firm and unſhaken for ever; and if it ſtands, I care not whether I ſtand or fall. I hope an abler Hand and a ſtronger Arm from among my faithful levitical Brethren, will ſucceed me: And if we who perſevere yet to worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are not a Match for them, who are gone aſtray after the Golden Calves, erected at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>

I wiſh the <hi>Independent Reflector,</hi> may come over to us as our Auxiliary. And after all, and in fine, I leave the whole to the Father of Lights, moſt humbly beſeeching him, to lead us into his Truth, and to ſave us from Soul deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Error and Deluſion.
