            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>I have fought a good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which the</hi> LORD <hi>the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that Day.</hi>—</q>

the Prieſts, concerning the Levites. They divided the Country into Villages, Cities, Provinces, and marked the Bounds of every Tribe. At the Sight of theſe Things a By-ſtander would have been ready to ſay, that all their Battles were finiſhed, and now they had nothing to do but to enjoy the Fruit of their Victories.—Nevertheleſs, Arms are precarious, Battles are doubtful, and Succeſs gain'd to Day is not always a ſure Proof of future Succeſs: Hence aroſe that wiſe Proverb of the Ancients, <hi>Let not him that g<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

A corrupt Heart, a ſubtle Devil, and a deceitful World, are more dangerous Enemies than <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Baſhan.</hi> Nevertheleſs, in our Text we have a Chriſtian Soldier on this Side the Heavenly Canaan, ſtill ſurrounded with ſpiritual Foes, and ſtill combating with Fleſh and Blood, arrived to a firm Aſſurance of compleat Victory, and ſinging a Song of Triumph, e'er the Fight with his ghoſtly Adverſaries was finiſhed: No wonder! for the Angel of the LORD fought for him, and had ſaid unto him, <hi>Go up, for I have given you the Land.</hi> Now he was certain that he ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005877_0004_102736D9D16BE660"/>
triumph over all Temptations; and ſo ſuperior was his Virtue, that he was infallibly ſure of eternal Glory, in the Preſence of his Divine Maſter. <hi>The Time of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was at hand, and he was juſt going to be offered up.</hi> When the cruel, the bloody, the diabolical <hi>Nero</hi> ſhould exerciſe his helliſh Fury upon him, and offer him a Sacrifice to his heroic Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, he knew his Courage and Conſtancy ſhould not fail amidſt all the ſhocking Trials he was to undergo; and that after his Martyrdom, he ſhould poſſeſs an incorruptible Crown of Glory on High.</p>
            <p>—<hi>I have fought, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis not long ſince that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Hero, whoſe juſt Praiſes we feebly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed in this Deſk<note n="†" place="bottom">In a Sermon, entitled, <hi>The Character of a True Patriot.</hi> Sold by <hi>D. Henchman.</hi>
               </note>: Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is to be applauded. <hi>Moſes</hi> converſed with the SON OF GOD forty Days on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> till his Countenance became all radiant and ſhining: But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into the Third Heavens, and there converſed with the SON OF GOD, and <hi>heard unſpeakable Words, which it is not poſſible for a Man to utter.</hi> No wonder then, if our Apoſtle under the New Teſtament, exceed <hi>Moſes</hi> under the more ancient Diſpenſation of GOD towards his Church. His Character in the Text lies in four Articles, A brave Soldier, a fine Racer, a firm Believer, and a glorious Triumpher.</p>
            <p>Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>brave Soldier.—I have fought a good Fight.</hi>—All the World knows a Chriſtian's Life is a Warfare. From the Moment we name the Name of CHRIST, become His Diſciples, we engage with the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil, in a Combat, which is to endure, without Intermiſſion, as long as Life
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005877_0005_102736DE4407D088"/>
endures.—Well, Conſider our Apoſtle in every Station, in every Period of Life; and who ever fought more valiantly than he, when once enliſted under the great Captain of our Salvation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Adverſity</hi> he behaved well, brave as an Hero. What the trying Temptations of Poverty are, <hi>Agur</hi> was well ſenſible of, when he addreſs'd the great JEHOVAH, ſaying, <hi>Give me not Poverty, leſt I ſteal, and take the Name of my GOD in vain. Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9. But to ſuch Poverty was our Apoſtle once reduced, notwithſtanding his Power of working Miracles for the Relief of others, that he was obliged to follow the Tent-maker's Trade; and thereupon ſays to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20. 34. <hi>Theſe Hands have miniſtred unto my Neceſſities, and to them that were with me.</hi>—But of all Conditions turn to his own Catalogue, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23,—27.—<hi>In Labours more abundant: in Stripes above Meaſure; in Priſons more frequent; in Deaths oft. Of the Jews five Times received I forty Stripes, ſave one: Thrice was I beaten with Rods: Once was I ſtoned: Thrice I ſuffered Shipwreck: A Night and a Day I have been in the Deep. In Journeyings often, in Perils of Waters, in Perils of Robbers, in Perils by mine own Country-men, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the City, in Perils in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, in Perils in the Sea, in Perils among falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: In Wearineſs and Painfulneſs, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirſt, in Faſtings often, in Cold and Nakedneſs.</hi> Amazing! What a Life! And yet do you find the leaſt whiſper of Murmuring? No, but like a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, he endured Hardneſs, and poſſeſs'd his Soul in Patience. Once, when his Friends, full of Concern, would with Tears have diſſuaded him going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where Bonds and Impriſonments awaited him, he breaks forth in that Divine Language, <hi>What mean ye to weep, and to break mine Heart? For I am ready, not to be bound only, but to die at Jeruſalem, for the Name of the Lord Jeſus,.</hi> Acts 21. 13.</p>

Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Proſperity</hi> he behaved well, brave as an Hero. 'Tis hard, hard vanquiſhing the Temptations of a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous State. Let a Man carefully examine the Religion of CHRIST JESUS, he will ſoon find, that worldly Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and true Piety are almoſt inconſiſtent, almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible: Every outward Bleſſing carries a mortal Poiſon with it, which uſually infects the Poſſeſſor. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has taught us, that Pleaſures ruin Chriſtian Moderation, that Riches inſpire Men with Covetouſneſs, and that Pride is begotten by Grandure and Authority. The Temptations which Proſperity plunges a Man into, are infinitely harder to vanquiſh than thoſe to which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity expoſes us. Many a one that has triumphed over Tyrants and Perſecutors, has ſunk beneath Pride, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Intemperance, when Objects proper to inflame thoſe Paſſions have been ſet before his Eyes. When a kind GOD fills up our Days with Delights, ah me! how little Pains do we take about ſecuring a better Life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after! 'Tis natural to love the Habitation where we find Satiſfaction and Charms. When the Dove flies forth from the Ark, and finds the Winds boiſterous, the Waves foaming, and the whole Earth buried beneath the Waters, gladly ſhe returns to the Ark, the Place of her Refuge: But when ſhe finds the Heavens ſerene, the Waters aſſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Campaigns flouriſhing, there ſhe alights, there ſhe reſts.—Oh my Soul, here's thy Picture, here's the Image of what thou thyſelf art! When the World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thee Wealth, Proſperity, Grandure, thou harkneſt to the Voice of the Enchantreſs, and ſuffereſt thyſelf to be ſurprized by her Charms: But, when thou findeſt in the World, Poverty, Diſtreſs and Miſery, thou turneſt thine Eyes towards Heaven, there to ſeek for Happineſs in its Center.—Our Apoſtle had the Trials of a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Condition, and how divinely well he paſt through it, let his own Words teſtify, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. <hi>I have learned in whatſoever State I am, therewith to be content.

to</hi> ABOUND. <hi>In all Things I am inſtructed; both to be</hi> FULL <hi>and to be hungry; both to</hi> ABOUND <hi>and to ſuffer need: I can do all Things through CHRIST that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> Supernatural Strength in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Degree, is requiſite to keep us entire and upright, in the dangerous Conflict with the pleaſing Temptations of the World; and that Strength the Apoſtle derived from CHRIST, and obtain'd it by humble, fiducial Prayer.</p>
            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Death</hi> he behaved well, brave as an Hero. To know what it is to die, and not be afraid to die, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt exalted Degree of Perfection, which the human Soul is capable of attaining to in this Life: 'Tis the higheſt Pitch of Felicity that can be enjoyed in this Vale of Tears.—To defy Death, to ſcorn it, to brave it out in a dying Hour, without knowing what it is to die, is the very Height of Madneſs, 'tis the higheſt Pitch of Miſery.—The Pagan World afforded <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who were under no Dread of Death; but then they did not know what it was to die: They viewed Death in a falſe Light: They imagin'd that at Death Men were either reduced to nothing, or appeared before a chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tribunal, or enter'd upon an imaginary Happineſs.—<hi>Commanders of Armies</hi> in the Days of Heatheniſm, have been ſeen to brave Death, and defy all its Terrors: But they knew not what it was to die: They look'd upon Death crowned with Laurels, illuſtrious in Trophies, and renowned in future Hiſtory.—Even <hi>Libertines and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchees</hi> have been ſeen to make light of Death: But they knew not what it was to die: Their Tranquility in the laſt Moments of Life aroſe from Ignorance; and their Stoutneſs was the Effect of Stupidity.—But the Man who views Death in its true Form, and is under no Dread of Death, but meets it with a calm Soul, that Man has moſt ſurely arrived to the utmoſt Bleſſing that Mortals are capable of enjoying upon this Earth: And this Bleſſing our Apoſtle had arriv'd to. If the Words of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005877_0008_102736E597982558"/>
our Text are not a ſufficient Proof of this, only turn to the Eighth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he makes uſe of that inimitable Language, <hi>Who ſhall ſeperate us from the Love of</hi> CHRIST? <hi>Shall Tribulation, or Diſtreſs, or Perſecution, or Famine, or Nakedneſs, or Sword? Nay, in all theſe Things we are more than Conquerors, through Him that loved us. For I am perſuaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things preſent, nor Things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Creature ſhall be able to ſeperate us from the Love of GOD, which is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>our Lord.</hi> Ah! how difficult a Thing is it to ſtand out againſt violent Pains! Amidſt grinding Tortures the Soul loſes Sight of itſelf: Entirely filled with the Violence of its Agonies, it cannot ordinarily bear Reflection: And in the near Approaches of Death, how often do thick Clouds intercept the Beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs! But, all theſe does the Apoſtle brave: United to the SON OF GOD in indiſpenſable Bands of Love, he defies them. Thus the Chriſtian Religion, all manly and ſublime, forms its Votaries to true Heroiſm. The wiſe Man, and the brave Hero, whom <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaw only in Idea, the Chriſtian Religion ſees in Practice and Reality: That brings to paſs what neither Philoſophers, by their falſe Maxims, nor the Bravadoes of the Age, by their affected Courage, nor the Libertine, by his Ignorance and Obſtinacy, could ever bring to paſs: That brings to paſs what the whole Univerſe could not; and while it inſtructs the Chriſtian what it is to die, it raiſes him above the Fears of Death, and cauſes him to ſing amidſt the Horrors of Diſſolution, <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? Thanks be unto GOD, who gives us the Victory through our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST.—Who then would not ſtudy this Divine Religion? Who would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully meditate therein Day and Night? Who would not aſſent to its heavenly Truths? And, who would not practice its noble Precepts, when the Iſſue of all is, an

undaunted Encounter with the King of Terrors, and a final Conqueſt of the laſt Enemy of Mankind? May each one of us be found in the happy Number.</p>
            <p>We go on and ſay,</p>
            <p>II. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>a fine Racer.—I have finiſhed my Courſe.</hi>—Often do we meet with Alluſions to ancient Heathen Cuſtoms, in the Writings of our Apoſtle, who was certainly an excellent Scholar, as well as a great Divine. We are taught even from early Youth, in our Schools, that Running was one of thoſe Exerciſes which were much in Vogue at the <hi>Olympic Games</hi> among the <hi>Grecians:</hi> Theſe Games paſſed from <hi>Grece</hi> over into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> People were ſo fond of them, that one of their Hiſtorians ſays, <hi>Two Things will ſatisfy the</hi> Romans, <hi>namely, Bread and Public Shows.</hi>—Among theſe various Plays, that of <hi>Running</hi> was very remarkable: The Place where they uſed to run was laid out with the utmoſt Accuracy: There were Lines ſtretched along, and if a Racer ſtept over them he was judged to have run uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and in vain: Nay, it was even dangerous to ſtep aſide; for at <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Tiber</hi> was the Line upon one Side, and a deep Ditch with pointed Swords upon the other, ſo that if a Perſon ſtept aſide, he was in Danger, either to be drowned, or pierced to Death.—This is the Emblem the Apoſtle refers to in the Text. Chriſtianity is a Race, a lengthy Race. Oh the vaſt Diſtance there is between Virtue, ſuch as it is in its firſt Beginnings, and that ſame Virtue conſidered in all the Perfection, to which it might be raiſed upon Earth! Had we arrived at as high a Degree of Holineſs, as any meer Man on Earth ever did, yet how far ſhould we have ſtill to run, e'er we had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the higheſt Perfection poſſible!—In this lengthy Road it was that our Apoſtle ran, that ſo he might obtain an incorruptible Crown. The Time once was when the Apoſtle looked upon himſelf as having a great Way to run in the Chriſtian Race; ſays he, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>&amp;c.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005877_0010_102736ED5C3D7248"/>
Not as though I had already attained,</hi> reached the Mark, the Goal; <hi>either were already Perfect:</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Word here uſed was peculiarly conſecrated to thoſe Racers, who came off Victorious at the <hi>Olympic Games.</hi> The Apoſtle then would let us know, that he looked upon himſelf at a great Diſtance as yet from that happy State, when like a conſummate Racer in the Art of Running, he ſhould ſee himſelf crowned with the Prize deſtin'd to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; but adds he, <hi>I follow after,</hi> I purſue with Ardour and Earneſtneſs, <hi>if ſo be I may apprehend,</hi> I may ſeize upon the Crown e'er long; for which Reaſon alſo <hi>I have been apprehended,</hi> ſuddenly ſeized upon, <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in a quick miraculous Converſion to him.—He goes on, <hi>Brethren, I count not myſelf to have apprehended,</hi> I am perſuaded I have not as yet reached the Mark: So an humble Soul, ever pondering upon its own Faults, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and Failures, does not diſcover thoſe Virtues in itſelf, which ſhine with a ſuperiour Luſtre in the View of others!—<hi>But,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>This one Thing I do, forgetting thoſe Things which are behind me, and reaching forth to thoſe Things which are before me, I preſs towards the Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling,</hi> the heavenly Calling, <hi>of GOD in</hi> CHRIST JESUS. No Difficulties in the Road, neither the Length of the Race he had to run, could diſcourage him: On the contrary he haſtned away the faſter, and would not loſe a Moment's Time: Like a true Racer, he left Places and Things far behind him, and got forward ſo ſwiftly that he inſenſibly loſt Sight of them. He made ſuch Progreſs towards Heaven, that he every Day left behind him the Follies and Vanities of the World, and more and more loſt the View of them: He fixed his Eye upon the Reward before him, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the Way of Virtue from the Proſpect of that Happineſs which GOD, through CHRIST, will beſtow upon all his perſevering Saints. The Reward of being crowned as a Conqueror, not with an <hi>Olive-Leaf,</hi> which at <hi>Olympia</hi> was valued above Gold or Rubies, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Poſſeſſor the utmoſt Reſpect all his Days; but
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005877_0011_102736F036078718"/>
crowned with the Love and Applauſe of his Creator, and the immortal Honours of the Heavenly Kingdom, thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Eternity.—And now in the laſt Moments of Life, he breaks forth with Exſtaſy of Soul and ſays, <hi>I have finiſhed my Courſe,</hi> my Race is run, I have reached the Goal. The Maxim I ever went upon was, to account nothing done, while there remained any thing to be done; nothing accompliſhed, 'till all was accompliſhed.—Happy, Happy we, my Brethren, if animated by his Example, and like him, relying upon JESUS our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner for Strength, we ſo run as to obtain; make ſuch Progreſs in the Ways of Religion, as that like him we may be able to ſay at Death, <hi>I have finiſhed my Courſe.</hi>—We have begun well: Let us not be affrighted in this Matter of Progreſs in Virtue. The Degree of Holineſs we have arrived to has coſt us much Struggle, Difficulty and Pain; but be not diſcouraged, the more tedious Part is over; 'tis the eaſier remains: The Way to Heaven is narrow, but it becomes large and ſpacious to him that continues running therein; eſpecially when we eye the Poſſeſſion of CHRIST, as our ſupreme Recompence at the End of our Race: This Thought, that every Step we take, brings us nearer to the Enjoyment of CHRIST, the infinite and the eternal Good, may well animate us to make ſwift Progreſs in our Chriſtian Courſe.</p>
            <p>We haſten and ſay,</p>
            <p>III. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>a firm Believer.—I have kept the Faith.</hi>—Stedfaſt, unſhaken he perſevered in his Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. A flighty Temptation overſets us; but nothing ever ſhook him: From the Moment he bowed the Knee to the SON OF GOD, whom with his bodily Eyes he beheld ſeated at the right Hand of the Majeſty in the Heavens, clothed with Glory inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to mortal View, from that Moment he abode ſtedfaſt in his Chriſtian Profeſſion; nor could all the Wiles of Earth or Hell turn him aſide: No wonder, for GOD loved him, and he himſelf was careful to depart from all
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005877_0012_102736F30059D030"/>
Iniquity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. True Believers are the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD: As ſuch they ſtand ſure, for GOD knows them, GOD loves them as his Children; and it is their diligent Endeavour to avoid all Sin, which is the only Thing diſpleaſing to GOD, and fatal to Men.—By an Election from Eternity GOD loves them that are His: He has choſen them and ſet them apart for Himſelf in a peculiar Manner. No Reaſon can be given for this Love, becauſe it is not founded upon any Quality of thoſe whom GOD chooſes: No other Cauſe can be found but his own good Will;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dr. Boſc.</hi>
               </note>—and, to them the Love of GOD is invariable. GOD never ceaſes to love them whom He has placed his electing Affection upon: It is not with GOD as it is with Men. Nothing more fickle than the Friendſhip of Mortals; it is like a Fire of Chaff, eaſily kindled, but which goes out uſually of itſelf: 'Tis like a Flood, which at firſt runs with vaſt Impetuoſity and Noiſe, but which anon dries away, ſo that the Places which it moſt overflowed ſhow no Marks of it: 'Tis like the Lightning ſhut up in the Boſom of a Cloud, but ſoon loſt in the open Air. The Love of GOD is of a quite contrary Nature; never does that alter, never does that diminiſh, never does that grow cold: Nothing can cauſe a Change of his Love:—Not his Intereſts, for he does not love us for his own Advantage, but for our's: Our Goodneſs aſcends not to Him, but his Goodneſs deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends abundantly upon us.—Not for any Defect in our Perſons, or any Change of good Qualities, for He loves us with a Love of Fore-knowledge, which preceeded all Foreſight of Good in us. As the Foreſight of our Imperfections and our Vices did not hinder his Love in Eternity, ſo the Sight of our Failures in Time does not interrupt it. It is a Love which is founded upon GOD alone. He loves us becauſe He has willed to love us: The Reaſon hereof is only in Himſelf, and the Motive in his own Will: And, ſince GOD is ever the ſame, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005877_0013_102736F5F00DDD58"/>
his Will abſolutely unchangeable, it follows neceſſarily, that his Love muſt be unchangeable. Well then may true Believers be compared to the Mountains, which remain firm upon their ancient Foundation, while the moſt ſtately Buildings, and the moſt magnificent Palaces of Emperors fall to ruin.—But further,—</p>
            <p>A ſecond Seal upon the true Believer, is, <hi>He departs from Iniquity:</hi> No marvel then that he is ſtedfaſt in his Faith and Profeſſion; for, certainly the Reaſon why the Deſerters of the Goſpel do not perſevere in the Communion of CHRIST, but abandon his Doctrine, is really this, that they are Workers of Iniquity, vicious Perſons, whoſe Heart is good for nothing. Read Volumes of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, conſult all the Annals of Chriſtianity, and you will ever ſee, that Apoſtates unto Infidelity, were Perſons who led a vicious Life. As the firſt Deſertion from Chriſtianity began with a <hi>Judas,</hi> who was a notable Thief, poſſeſſed with the Devil of Covetouſneſs, ſo the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages ſaw Chriſtianity forſaken by Men of the ſame Stamp; ſuch as breathed after Vanity and Licentiouſneſs. Will that Man, think you, be careful to obtain Salvation in the Way of a true Faith, that does not fear Damnation in the Way of Sin? 'Tis an eaſy Paſſage from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Heart to a debauched Mind; and Corruption of Manners is the high Road to Corruption of Faith.—But how ſtood the Caſe with our Apoſtle? His Appeal to <hi>Felix,</hi> before a large Clan of moſt virulent Perſecutors, teſtifies for himſelf, <hi>Herein,</hi> ſays he to that Governor of his Nation, <hi>Herein do I exerciſe myſelf, to have always a Conſcience void of Offence towards GOD and Men.</hi> And as he lived at a Diſtance from Sin, whether ſecret or open, nothing aſtoniſhed him, nothing overturned him, nothing could root Religion out of his Heart, or ſtifle it in his Mouth:—Neither Threats nor Dangers could terrify him, becauſe he feared GOD more than Men, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Torments of Eternity more than the Sufferings of Time:—Neither Promiſes nor Advantages could dazzle him, becauſe he eſteemed the Reproach of CHRIST,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005877_0014_102736F78E1817E0"/>
greater Riches than all the Treaſures of the Earth, and the Glory of Heaven rejoyced him more than all worldly Proſperity. In a Word, neither Paſſions nor Vices could corrupt him, becauſe he kept under his Body, and bro't it into Subjection, and was daily crucifyng the Fleſh, with its Affections and Luſts.—Verily, my Hearers, would you be firm and ſolid Stones in the Building of the Church; would you never fall away from your Faith and Profeſſion, after having taſted the good Word of GOD; would you perſevere invariably in the Communion of JESUS CHRIST, here's the infallible Secret, here's the ſure Way to ſucceed, <hi>Depart from all Iniquity;</hi> Here's all the Preſervations of the World in one, here's all the Counſels, here's all the Inſtructions; yea, here's all the Books that can be deſired on ſo important a Point: Here they are all in one Word, <hi>Depart from Iniquity.</hi> For, If once you are really reformed in your Manners, if once you baniſh the Sentiments and Habits of Sin, ſurely you ſhall abide firm in the Communion of your Saviour, the Love of CHRIST ſhall render you abſolutely inſeparable from it: The ineffable Treaſure of Piety in your Heart, ſhall cauſe you to deſpiſe every Thing in Compariſon of your Dear Redeemer; the ſure Hope of Heaven ſhall make you intrepid; the Peace you ſhall feel in your Conſcience, you ſhall prefer above all the Pleaſures of the Univerſe, and upon the immoveable Baſis of a good Life, nothing ſhall overturn you; but in the near Proſpect of Death you ſhall be able to ſay, with our Apoſtle, <hi>I have kept the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We paſs briefly to ſay,</p>
            <p>IV. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>glorious Triumpher.—Henceforth there remaineth for me a Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge will give me at that Day.</hi>—Here it is that he moſt apparently ſhines in his exalted Character: Here it is that he moſt flamingly appears to be an incarnate Seraph.—'Tis the happy
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005877_0015_102736FBC23F2648"/>
Privilege of ſome of GOD's Saints to arrive at ſuch high Degrees of Piety and Virtue, as to be entirely aſſured of the future eternal Bleſſings. They carry in their Souls the Witneſs of the Spirit of GOD, which aſſures them of their eternal Salvation: This Teſtimony is a kind of Demonſtration ſuperior to any in human Sciences: 'Tis a Proof unknown to Philoſophers, and whoſe Author is the infinite wiſe GOD. This internal Teſtimony is, <hi>A lively Senſe of our good Eſtate, excited by the glorious</hi> JEHOVAH <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Saurin.</hi>
               </note> 'Tis an Effect of that almighty Power, which <hi>right Reaſon</hi> attributes to GOD, upon the Senſations of our Souls, and according to which He may raiſe in them Joy or Sorrow, as ſeems good in his Sight: 'Tis the Right of a Chriſtian, founded upon that Promiſe of the ſacred Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit himſelf beareth Witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of GOD:</hi> The glorious Effects of which Promiſe we ſee in thoſe Believers, who while they live in Poverty and Want, taſte thoſe Pleaſures which all the Grandeurs and Riches of this World cannot afford: We ſee them alſo in thoſe dying Perſons, who in the View of their immediate Diſſolution, experience ſuch Joys, as turn their Bed of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into a Field of Triumph: In a Word, we ſee them in thoſe Martyrs, who on Racks and Gibbets have found themſelves more happy than Princes ſurrounded with all their Courtiers.—Oh my Hearers! There is doubtleſs no Condition ſo happy as that of a Man, who with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Firmneſs, is waiting for that future Glory, to which he has a juſt Title: Such a Man may ſatiſfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that there is no Bleſſing, except that of glorified Saints, ſuperior to his; and that he has arrived at the higheſt Pitch of Felicity which can be attained in this Vale of Tears: What more happy, than, in the midſt of the empty Pleaſures and the numerous Afflictions of Life, to be able to look into Heaven, as the aſſured Place of our eternal Abode! Eſpecially, what more proper than
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005877_0016_1027370236391E68"/>
this to ſupport us againſt the Fears of Death, mortal, dying as we are; in a Condition, wherein the leaſt Alteration in our Body, preſents us with the horrid Image of Death: What can we wiſh for more agreeable to our Wants, than to find in the firm Expectation of future Glory, a Buckler to repel the Enemy, and a Sword to pierce him! In this deſireable Situation the LORD grant we may all be found.</p>
            <p>But, 'tis Time we haſten to a Concluſion,</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place then,—Your EXCELLENCY will permit me on this joyful Day, the Monument of ancient, <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty, to congratulate your EXCELLENCY upon the Smiles of Heaven on your mild, your juſt, and your wiſe Government: Where's a Ruler happier in his People, Where's a People happier in their Ruler, than <hi>SHIRLEY</hi> and his <hi>Province?</hi> When <hi>their</hi> Captain-General gives forth the Command, chearfully they obey, and thus the feeble Fortreſs of <hi>Annapolis-Royal</hi> is ſaved from the Hands of her Enemies, and the now-impregnable Fortreſs of <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> is put into our Poſſeſſion: SHIRLEY'S Troops know how to Pray, and SHIRLEY'S Troops know how to Fight, ſo as perpetually to engage the GOD of Armies on their Side, who crowns their noble Attempts with Succeſs and Victory: Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> lifts up his Hands to Heaven, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> purſues the flying <hi>Amalekites.</hi>—Let one then, whoſe Eyes beheld the charming Virtue and the undaunted Courage of a <hi>New-England</hi> Army, raiſed by your EXCELLENCY'S Command and Vigilance, congratulate You on the Reduction of <hi>Cape-Breton:</hi> Happy Conqueſt! How muſt it ſtrike the haughty <hi>Gallic</hi> Prince with Aſtoniſhment, and fill his proud Soul with Regret and Indignation! The Greatneſs of his Loſs none but himſelf can be fully ſenſible of: He himſelf, whoſe Coffers have been often and deeply drained to commode, to adorn, and to fortify that important Place. And, that the Place ſhould be reduced

Ah me! What are all the Treaſures, the Pomps, the Poſſeſſions of human Life! <hi>Death</hi> makes all Things equal. The Man who pil'd Riches upon Riches, and laid Heap upon Heap, <hi>Death</hi> confines him to a narrow Coffin and three Paces of Earth.—The Man whoſe Projects were mighty, whoſe Deſigns were vaſt, and whoſe Deſires were boundleſs, <hi>Death</hi> daſhes them to Pieces on the fatal Shelve of human Things.—The Man whoſe Titles were magnificent, whoſe Inſcriptions were pompous, and whoſe Genealogies were lengthy, <hi>Death</hi> confounds them all in the ſame Pit of Corruption.—The Man whoſe Eyes ſparkled with Courage, <hi>Death</hi> covers with a dark Night;—and whoſe valiant Arm decided the Fate of Nations, <hi>Death</hi> lays beneath the Clods motionleſs, lifeleſs. Such is <hi>Death,</hi> ſuch are its Triumphs.

To You, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> of the ancient and honourable <hi>Artillery-Company,</hi> let me next addreſs myſelf.—As you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> have ſeen good to pitch upon me, the leaſt of all my Brethren in the Miniſtry, to ſtand this Day in the Deſk, that ſo you might do Honour to that Gallant Army of your Countrymen, who reduced <hi>Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> under the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government; and to whom there can ſcarcely be too much Honour done: I aſſure you, it was no ſmall Motive to me to appear here this Day, that I might mention to you their manly Piety and their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bravery, of which I myſelf was an Eye-witneſs: Piety and Bravery which you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> will copy after, whenever GOD ſhall call you to play the Men in the Cauſe of Liberty and Virtue.—From You there went forth the Great and the Good in the late Campaign at <hi>Louiſbourg:</hi> And from whom, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> can we more juſtly expect <hi>Heroes</hi> than from You, the Flower of our Land, the Glory of our Country? In You is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, as it were in a direct Line, that Divine Ardour, and that Godlike Zeal for the Maintenance of the Rights of Truth and Juſtice, which our Fore-fathers were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with: Men whoſe Character ſhines with endleſs Glory, eſpecially in their martial Exploits againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſavage Foe. And ſhall we their Sons ever prove a degenerate Race? Shall we tremble when Cannons roar, when Bullets fly, and when all the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Inſtruments of Deſtruction ſtand apparent before us? No, never ſhall it be ſaid, that the Troops of NEW-ENGLAND were backward to ruſh upon the Sword, or afraid to face the Mouths of Cannon; at the Call of the LORD OF HOSTS.—You will remember, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that from You, as from a Nurſery, our Land is ever to be ſupplied with Officers perfectly ſkill'd in the Art of War, and who ſhall train up our Forces to an Expert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in military Exerciſe equal to any of his <hi>Britanic</hi> Majeſty's: This, under GOD, will be the beſt Defence of our Land. Wherefore now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> to your Poſts, and carry this Truth along with you, <hi>He that would fight couragiouſly, and die happily, muſt live virtuouſly.</hi>

In fine, Let us all, both Laity and Clergy, ſtudy the Art of War, and ſtrive to be expert in it. And now that the Providence of Heaven invites and commands us to enter the Field of Battle in the ſpacious Country of CANADA: Let us go forth with a reſolute Mind and chearful Soul. What tho' the Field of Battle prove our Grave, has not JESUS our Redeemer gone down into the Grave, and diſpell'd all the Horrors of it? In the Grave of Nature we view a diſmal Dungeon, and a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Night; but in the Grave of JESUS we view Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over our laſt Enemy, and an open Paſſage to the immortal Honours of the heavenly Kingdom. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Chriſtian Brethren, and gallant Countrymen, diſmiſs every anxious Thought: If you fall by the Sword, the Clouds which Satan form'd ſhall vaniſh; the Vail which covers Eternity ſhall be drawn; your Mind ſhall be ſettled, your Heaven ſhall be revived, your Deſires ſhall be enflamed, and the Field of Blood ſhall become a Field of Triumph: And, in the laſt Day, when the Foundations of this Earth, ſhall ſink beneath your Feet, you ſhall riſe above the Ruins of <hi>this</hi> World, and become Inhabitants of the Regions of Immortality and Glory, with JESUS, who has redeemed us by his Blood, and has made us Kings and Prieſts unto GOD and his Father, with whom we ſhall Reign forever and ever: To whom be aſcribed all Honour and Dominion, World without End.</p>
