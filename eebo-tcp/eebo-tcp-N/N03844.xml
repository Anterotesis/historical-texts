            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I thank, not only the dear People of my Charge, but thoſe alſo of other Places, and eſpecially you, that are in your Youth, for aſſembling your ſelves ſo readily into the Houſe of the LORD, and coming to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip toward His holy Temple, and ſit under the Droppings of His Sanctuary on this Day, <note n="†" place="bottom">General Election at <hi>Boſton.</hi>
               </note> which you uſed to devote to Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vain and too often ſinful Diverſion. And while I ſee ſo large a Congregation, and eſpecially ſuch Numbers of young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple around me; how might it animate me (if Poſſible) to ſay ſomething on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to you, that might indeed profit your Souls.</p>
            <p>Depending on divine Help, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to offer to your Conſideration, ſome plain and ſerious Truths from the Text now read, <hi>Rejoice,</hi> O <hi>young Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this excellent Sermon written by King <hi>SOLOMON,</hi> under divine Inſpiration, the Point to be demonſtrated was, that all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments, carnal Pleaſure, Wealth, Honour, and even humane Wiſdom and Learning, are Vanity of Vanities; unworthy of any Eſteem or Regard, when compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Enjoyment of the Favour of God, the true Pleaſures of Religion; and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004727_0006_100DCDFF9D04B9E8"/>that ſpiritual Wiſdom, which is expreſſed in the filial Fear of God, and Conformity to His Will.</p>
            <p>This Aſſertion our divine Preacher has proved, by an Induction of Particulars; and when he is come near to the cloſe of his Sermon, he makes, what we ſhould call, in an humane Author, an handſome Addreſs to the Youth, in our Text and onward. And applys what he had ſaid to them, to us who are in our Youth; as to thoſe that are moſt prone to be led aſtray by the Vanities of this World: And for them to neglect the moſt ſolid and valuable Enjoyments, offered to the faithful Servants of the <hi>moſt High.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Text begins this Addreſs, and giveth us a Rule by which to meaſure our purſuit of this World's Enjoyments, and our indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Pleaſure, viz. <hi>The weight that all our Actions ſhall reſpectively have at the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rejoice, O young Man, in thy Youth—but know thou that for all</hi> theſe Things <hi>GOD will bring thee into Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if he has ſaid, "O young Man, or Woman, who takeſt moſt delight in the vain Pleaſures of this Life, go on to rejoyce therein while in thy Youth, <hi>and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth;</hi> let nothing hinder, but every thing conſpire to promote
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004727_0007_100DCE01A1B17530"/>this youthful rejoicing; let thy Fancy and brisk Imagination chear thee, with the moſt pleaſant Repreſentation of all Things around you; thus adding to the rejoicing that even a Youth could otherwiſe indulge. <hi>And walk in the way of thy Heart;</hi> whatever way for worldly Pleaſure, your youthful Heart and lively Imagination ſhall dictate to you, readily go in that Path, never fail of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Tract. — <hi>And in the ſight of thine Eyes.</hi> If your Eyes diſcover any Object that your Heart deſires; purſue and obtain it: Let your outward Senſes, lively Fancy, youthful Briskneſs and merry Indulgencies all increaſe the Pleaſures of your early Years: But know it for a certainty, that all theſe Things muſt be called over again, at the great Day of Accounts. It may be, many of your early Pleaſures are concealed from the view of Men; but the great GOD will bring them into Judgment, will publiſh them all in open Day, before all the Worlds of Men and Angels; and will ſentence you according to their ſtrict Demerit." Know it, O young People, that hear me, that all your youthful Pleaſures, chearful Amuſements merry Days and Nights and Hours, ſhall be remembred then, and have their juſt weight in the Sentence of <hi>that Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004727_0008_100DCE03359B1178"/>
This Text is therefore, a <hi>ſerious Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the Youth, to take the Comfort of their Life, and the Pleaſure proper to their Age; only to regulate even their chearful Seaſons, by a due Remembrance of <hi>the Day,</hi> when they muſt appear at the Bar of CHRIST, and render an Account of all theſe things among others. And the wiſe Man then tells us, we may have much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in youth: But that it muſt be ſuch as will bear the Light of that awful Day.</p>
            <p>Or, the Text is a <hi>cutting Sarcaſm,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the meaning is directly oppoſite to the literal Senſe of the Words. And becauſe King <hi>SOLOMON</hi> knew that young Perſons are exceeding fond of carnal and worldly Pleaſure, he bids them rejoice and chear themſelves in it, to the utmoſt that their Heart could wiſh. "Be merry, O young People, as you pleaſe, as you can; but be ſo at your Peril: Know that the great GOD ſees you, will bring you to Judgment, and paſs a Sentence infinitely juſt upon you; for <hi>all</hi> theſe things. This Laſt, ſeems to me the true Senſe of the Text. But be it either; the Words naturally afford us this</p>
            <div type="observation">
               <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That young People ſhould indulge themſelves, in no more Chearfulneſs and Merriment, than they can give a good Account of, to the great</hi> JUDGE.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004727_0009_100DCE0660AB6740"/>
It is equally true, that no Perſons of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Age, ſhould indulge themſelves in any ſort of Pleaſure of which they cannot give a good Account at the great DAY. But becauſe the Text is, as I ſaid, an Addreſs to the Youth, and the Occaſion, and the Numbers of the Age in this Aſſembly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine me to expreſs the Obſervation as above: For the Word of the LORD is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, O young People, in ſpecial: For <hi>each</hi> of you: and therefore let me beg, and let me have, your moſt ſerious Attention.</p>
               <p>The general Propoſition is directly prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Text: Rejoice — but go no further in your rejoicing than you can, when under the full and proper Senſe, that it muſt ſoon be accounted for. Here,</p>

Becauſe it is abſolutely certain, that <hi>there is a Judgment Day approaching.</hi> This is an Article of the Chriſtian Faith, plainly revealed and abſolutely aſſerted in our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. In the Text particularly, <hi>Know thou that for all theſe Things God will bring thee into Judgment.

And I ſaw a great white Throne, and him

And I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great ſtand before GOD; and the Books were opened: And another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life, and the Dead were judged out of thoſe Things which were written in the Books according to their Works. And the Sea gave up the Dead which were in it; and Death and Hell delivered up the Dead which were in them: and they were judged, every Man according to their Works. After theſe Texts you do not deny the Certainty of the Day of Judgment; you dare not deny it.</p>

Becauſe all the Kinds &amp; Degrees of Men's rejoicing and chearfulneſs, <hi>ſhall be brought into Judgment.</hi> They ſhall be reckoned for, Eccl. 12.14. <hi>For God ſhall bring every Work into Judgment, with every ſecret Thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> And if every Work, with every ſecret Thing, then certainly, every cheerful, every merry Day and Hour; yea, and Minute; all the Circumſtances, Kinds and Degrees thereof. O young People, You think perhaps this Conſideration is very ſerious. It is ſo: But not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004727_0012_100DCE0D6CB01BF8"/>ſhall be called over at the great Day of Accounts.

Go, I ſay, Go, O vain Youth, with them; but maintain this Thought continually, That GOD's Eye is upon you, when you go, while you are there, and when you return; and obſerves every Tho't, every Word and Action, and He will bring you into Judgment for <hi>All</hi> theſe Things. Be cheerful as you pleaſe, under a proper, regulating, Heart-deep Senſe, that every Degree of this Cheerfulneſs ſhall be accounted for at the Bar of CHRIST. Be profanely rude, or needleſly company with your vain Companions, if they are profanely rude, at your Peril; ſince all the Circumſtances of your Merriment muſt be in full recounted by you before the great Judge, when Time ſhall be no more. And this ſurely is a weighty Reaſon, why the King &amp; Degree of your Cheerfulneſs ſhould be ſuch, as you can then give a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of.</p>

If only the moſt powerful Men, or even the higheſt Angels in Heaven, where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to bring <hi>Perſons</hi> into Judgment for theſe Things, <hi>they</hi> might imagine a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of eſcaping that Trial.

Indeed, Angels may be improv'd as Inſtruments, to gather all Nations, and every individual Perſon, to that great Aſſembly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41, 42.

               <p>Is it as we have heard, That our Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſhould be of ſuch a <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Degree, as we can give a good Account of to the great</hi> JUDGE? Hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How <hi>ſtrange,</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtent with this Rule,</hi> hath been the Conduct of the beſt Men among us! Who of us can ſay before the Heart-ſearching GOD, That, in our Days and Hours of Amuſement, we have kept the Temper of our Soul, and all our Words and Behaviour under ſuch Regulation, and ey'd ſo ſteadily the Glory of GOD, and the valuable Ends of Diverſion, as now to be able to give a good Account of all thoſe Things to the infinite Judge? Doubtleſs, not One. And is it not ſtrange, that good Men, who in ſome meaſure know the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of eternal Things, ſhould act ſo inconſiſtent with this Rule?

Are there not many of you that have ſpent many an Hour, many a Night, in ſuch Behaviour, as exactly anſwers the Deſcription in ſome of theſe laſt Clauſes? And that deſire ſtill to practice the ſame: indulging no other, than carnal, ſenſual Gratifications? Now, how amazing is it, that you can go on in ſuch Conduct, when you know that our Text, and theſe laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhall look you full in the Face at the laſt great Day, and you muſt be judged by them! Verily, you go after your Pleaſure, <hi>as an Ox goeth to the Slaughter, or as a Fool to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Stocks;</hi> you are in extream Danger, that <hi>a Dart will ſtrike thro' your Liver.</hi> How amazing is it to ſee rational Creatures, as your are, haſting to your carnal, ſinful Pleaſures, <hi>as a Bird haſteth to a Snare;</hi> when indeed, it is for your <hi>Life,</hi> for the Life of your Soul. The Houſe of ſuch Pleaſure is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004727_0017_100DCE1B67C33AD0"/>the Way to Hell, going down to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.22, 23, 27. One would almoſt think, That altho' you have read it ſo often in your Bibles, <hi>That the Dead are there;</hi> and <hi>that her Gueſts are in the Depths of Hell,</hi> ſtill you know it not. But you, O young People, do know it, but you do not ponder it, while you go on to indulge ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleaſures, for which you muſt give an Account; and yet can give no good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What if it doth as the Objection ſays?</hi> Think ſeriouſly, O young People, on a few Things. Is it not a Reality that there is ſuch a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Day coming? You do not, nor dare you deny it. By going on careleſs and free in Sin, you might perhaps keep the Tho'ts of that Day out of your Mind a little while: But is it not better, much more prudent and ſafe, to act agreable to the real Nature of Things? Or had you rather go on in vain Courſes, taking your fill of carnal Pleaſures, as in a Dream, fancying that there will be a Reckoning-Day, when all theſe Things ſhall be brought into Judgment; but not realizing it, till you ſhall be ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by that Day? Would you chooſe this? Can you think this ſafer, than to be deprived of your carnal, vain Delights? Or even of all that you call Pleaſure in this World?</p>
               <p>Is not the Sentence to be paſſed on <hi>every One</hi> at that Day for Eternity? And is it not reaſonable then, that in your Diverſions you ſhould be ſo far impreſſed with a Senſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004727_0022_100DCDB1B1DC9660"/>of that Day, and that Sentence, as to keep you from acting, what you cannot then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count well for; altho' it might at preſent deprive you of your Comfort? Think cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this Queſtion; and ſee if there is not great weight in it. Is it not better to be deprived of Comfort a Minute, than to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Torments of Hell a Thouſand Years, for the ſinful Pleaſures of a Minute? You muſt grant, it is. And you know that if you ſo act here, as you cannot give a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, nor obtain a favourable Sentence at laſt, you muſt ſuffer as many Millions of Ages in Hell, as you enjoyed ſingle Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of Pleaſure on Earth: And then be no nearer the End of your Miſery, than at the firſt Moment it began. The Argument is very plain. Conſider then whether this <hi>Objection</hi> againſt the foregoing Arguments has any Weight in it, ſuppoſing the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection it ſelf were true. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Objection it ſelf is <hi>falſe &amp; groundleſs.</hi> For infinite Wiſdom it ſelf aſſures us that the Ways of Wiſdom are Ways of Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that <hi>All</hi> her Paths are Peace. And Experience has ever witneſſed to the Truth of this Obſervation <note n="†" place="bottom">The penitential Perſon, as his Tears are the Joy of Angels, ſo they are the Joy of his Heart, and the ſolace of his Soul; the ſalter his Tears, the ſweeter his Comforts; the deeper his Sighs, the fuller his Joy; the Beams of Conſolation always ſhine into this Houſe of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that his Soul is in travel with a <hi>Barnabas.</hi> and his Labours bring forth the Fruits of Peace; inſomuch, that I may truly ſay, To mourn for Sin, is to weep for Joy. Theſe pure and pleaſant Streams of Conſolation, (which is the Worldlings Wonder) that flow and run in thoſe Chryſtal Rivers of eternal Pleaſures, at GOD's Right Hand, they come from a weeping Spring. Why then is the Mouth of Wickedneſs opened againſt the Way of Holineſs? As if Grace were the <hi>Calvary</hi> to entomb Joy, and Impiety the very Womb to bring forth Felicity; but if Experience may be heard, my Soul hath felt both, and I find ſuch Damps of Spirit in worldly Pleaſures, and ſuch refreſhing of Soul in the Depth of godly Sorrow, that I ſhall eſteem one Drop of ſpiritual Joy better than an Ocean of their carnal Mirth." <hi>Divine Breathings.</hi>

When the weary Soul finds reſt in CHRIST; and receives the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, breathes a Child-like Temper to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his heavenly Father, and feels his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his deareſt Saviour manifeſting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfection and divine Love unto him. And when he taſtes heavenly Joy in the ſweet Incomes of divine Grace; even the Joy of the HOLY GHOST, when his Soul is filled with the Love of GOD, Oh! how far doth this exceed all the Pleaſures of Sin?

               <p n="2">2. Perhaps you may not have <hi>Time</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>after the preſent Day, You</hi> know you are
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004727_0026_100DCE30970FC348"/>uncertain, whether your Soul ſhall not be required of you this Night. And if it ſhould, will it be Time enough hereafter to repent and turn from all Sin to GOD? You will indeed have an Eternity to repent in, but then your Repentance will be in vain, there ſhall then remain no more Sacrifice for <hi>your</hi> Sins, <hi>who</hi> have not repented till the Decree has brought forth againſt you.</p>

Pſ. 95.7, 8. and, <hi>That it is time</hi> (this Day) to ſeek the LORD. Hoſ. 10.12. And will you ſay, hereafter is Time enough to repent of your Sins and effectually to ſeek the LORD? dare you impudently think or ſay, it will be Time enough for you to turn and ſeek the LORD, when you have had one Frolick more, when you have gone on in Sin a few Days, Months, or Years more? Knoweſt thou, O vain Youth, better than the alwiſe GOD, when is the <hi>beſt Time</hi> for you to repent and turn —? You ſay, No; but your <hi>Practice</hi> proves, you think you do, if you go on any longer in Sin, pleading that hereafter is Time enough for you to become ſtrict and hearty in Goſpel-Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Or <hi>it</hi> plainly ſays, with <hi>Pharoah, who is the LORD that I ſhould obey him,</hi> it is Time enough to obey him hereafter, as much as I

               <p>Now in order this,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>You muſt be deeply convinced of your</hi> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>and</hi> Actual <hi>Sins.</hi> Of indwelling Sin, and it's out-breakings. Of the Danger you are in of eternal Death and Miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of your Vileneſs and Pollution in the ſight of an Holy GOD. On theſe Accounts you muſt be deeply humbled, <hi>weary and heavy-laden.</hi> Mat. 11.28. You muſt find and feel that you have deſtroyed, but cannot help your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>You muſt</hi> hate <hi>and</hi> forſake <hi>every falſe Way.</hi> Every Sin; of Thought, Word and Deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Sin as dear as a right Hand, or a right Eye, muſt be hated and forſaken. Forſaking Sin and outward Reformation will never prove your Title to divine Joy and Pleaſure, unleſs you inwardly hate <hi>Sin.</hi> And we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

Yea, and grieve for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, natural Diſpoſition to Sin. Rom. 7.23, 24. Mat. 6.24. <hi>No Man can ſerve two Maſters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve GOD and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> And, by Conſequence, ye cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the Pleaſures of Sin and have the true Joys of Religion.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>You muſt really receive &amp; reſt upon CHRIST alone for Salvation, by a true Faith.</hi> You muſt become really willing to take the LORD JESUS CHRIST, to be your Prophet, to teach you by his WORD and SPIRIT: your great High-Prieſt to make Attonement for your Sins, to procue the acceptance of your Perſon and Services with GOD, by His Merits and Interceſſion; your King, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due you to Himſelf, to reign over, aſſiſt and defend you, to judge and reward you. And when your Heart it melted into a true <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, thus to take CHRIST on his own Terms,</hi> and to devote yourſelf wholly to Him, (as is <hi>therein</hi> implied) the Soul indeed chooſeth Him, and cloſeth with Him: And when you have ſo done, actually depend upon His
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004727_0029_100DCE3754A391C0"/>Love, Righteouſneſs and Strength daily; and more evidently and explicitely in every religious Duty, in every Hour of uncommon Service, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Temptation and Trial.</item>

               <p>Thus do, O young Man, and thou mayſt rejoice in thy Youth; thy Heart may chear thee, in the Days of thy Youth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. Therefore being juſtified by Faith, <hi>we have Peace with GOD</hi> thro' our LORD JESUS CHRIST: By whom alſo we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by Faith into this Grace wherein we ſtand, <hi>and rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of GOD.</hi> v 3, 4, 5.

               <p>Come then, and lay your Heart to the great and leading Article of true Religion, viz a cloſing with CHRIST as your beloved and al-ſufficient Saviour; and take Him in very deed to be your LORD and SRVIOUR.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye careleſs and unawakened Sinners,</hi> let me call upon you, to <hi>awake and ariſe from the Dead, that</hi> CHRIST <hi>may give you Light.</hi> You ſee the DAY is approaching when you muſt give an Account of <hi>all</hi> your Conduct.

O give not over ſeeking, until you have obtained both theſe Bleſſings. For obtain you muſt, or periſh E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, you that are careleſs in your Sins, and not others for you.</p>
