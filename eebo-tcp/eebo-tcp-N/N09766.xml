            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>HEBREWS, Chap. 1. V. 1.2.</bibl>
                  <p>God who at ſundry Times, and in divers Manners, ſpake in Time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, Hath in theſe laſt Days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</p>
               </q>

            <p>THE Words I have now read to you, ſhew the Apoſtle, the Author of them, to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Divine, as well as a perfect Maſter of Addreſs.</p>
            <p>You all know, this Epiſtle out of which the Text is taken, was written to the Hebrews, who acknowledged, that God had revealed himſelf to that Nation, by Moſes and the Prophets. But then many of them denied that God had ſpoken to them by his Son Jeſus Chriſt: In order to rectify this Error, the Apoſtle in the Beginning of the Epiſtle, aſſerts a Fact which was neceſſary to be believed by all the Jewiſh Nation; as he was now ordered by God, to aboliſh all the Jewiſh Rites, which as yet had not been done by any Revelation from Heaven: and the Jews were bound to obey the Law given from Heaven, 'til ſuch Time, as that Law was ſet aſide by the ſame Authority which gave it at firſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Year 52— We find in Acts 15—that the Gentile Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, were orderd to abſtain from Meats offered to Idols, from Blood, from Things ſtrangled, and from Fornication. But it does not appear that the Jews were exempted from obſerving the Law of Moſes, till the Year 64—they were to obſerve the Law of Moſes, together with the Laws of Chriſt, till they received an Order from Heaven to ſet aſide the old Law. This was the Difference between the Jewiſh and Gentile Chriſtians, till this Epiſtle to the Hebrews was written.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the Epiſtle to the Hebrews the Apoſtle allows what the Jews contended for, that God had revealed himſelf, not only to the Jews, but to many, even before Moſes.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012428_0005_0F89985078FF4348"/>
At <hi>Sundry Times</hi> God acquainted the World, that the Soul was immortal; by Enoch, by Noah, before the Flood: and Abraham <hi>taught his Children the Commandments of the Lord,</hi> after the Flood. And Jacob, <hi>by prophecying to his Sons of Things to come,</hi> ſhewed that he had a Revelation from Heaven. Then, Moſes taught the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael during their Pilgrimage through the wilderneſs. And after they came into the Holy Land, they were taught by Deborah, Samuel, and the other Prophets, in the Time of the Judges. By Nathan, in the Time of David and Solomon. And by Iſaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; in the Time of the Kings. By Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, in, and after the Captivity.</p>
            <p>And theſe Revelations were made to them <hi>in divers Manners</hi>; that is, ſometimes in a Cloud, ſometimes in a Fire ſometimes in a ſtill ſmall Voice; at other Times, by Viſions, Dreams, and a Voice from between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims: and by the holy Spirit ſpeaking in the Prophets.</p>
            <p>As ſure as God had taught the people in theſe various Ways, and Methods, ſo ſure it was, that the ſame God now taught them by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, who was the very Perſon, to whom all the former Diſpenſations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly pointed.</p>
            <p>Before the Time of Moſes, Mankind were taught by Tradition of what had been revealed, and by immediate Revelations. After Moſes, they were taught partly by written Revelation, and partly by the Diſpenſation they were under; and partly by Prophets and holy Perſons, who were inſpired to teach them in thoſe Points in which, their written Revelation was deficient, or imperfect.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Will of Heaven, was exhibited in theſe Periods of the Church of God, in various Ways, and different Methods. But after Chriſt came, the whole Scheme of our Redemption by a crucified Saviour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and all committed to writing, by which, all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are to regulate their Faith and Practice. Now, all the <hi>Evidence</hi> for their Faith, and all the <hi>Rules</hi> for their
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012428_0006_0F8998512F3FE6C8"/>
Conduct, are to be found in the ſacred Volume. There fore we read, That <hi>Chriſt brought Life, and Immortality to Light through the Goſpel.</hi> (2 Epiſtle to Timothy 1.10) This Expreſſion, is not to be underſtood as if the Doctrine of the immortality of the Soul, was not believed before Chriſt came; but only to intimate, that all the Evidences for it, were not contained in the written Rules given to the Jews. The Prophets were to teach the Jews in many Things not contained in the written Law, ſaying, <hi>know the</hi> Lord in <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>other particulars</hi>; but under the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Meſiah, <hi>All ſhall know him from the greateſt to the leaſt.</hi> That is, all the Evidences for Chriſtianity, for the Immortality of the Soul, and for our Conduct as Chriſtians, are contained in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. There we may be fully acquainted, how we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, that the Divine Aſſiſtance is afforded to all who ſeek for it, to help them to find out the Truth; and after they have found it, to enable them to practiſe all Goſpel Obedience, which will qualify the Soul to enjoy the Happineſs of Heaven: and that Chriſt will intercede in Right of his own Merits, that all who have believed in him, and acknowledged him as their Lord and Maſter, and obeyed his Laws, ſhall be put in poſſeſſion of that Degree of Happineſs, of which, their Goſpel Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has rendered them fit to be Partakers.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle, in the Text, takes it for granted, that God was the Author of ſeveral former Diſpenſations; and I ſhall do the ſame now,—and only exhibit the Proof that the Chriſtian Religion came from God, with all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Importance of the Caſe required.</p>
            <p>Neither the Time allowed me, nor your Patience will admit that I ſhould mention all the Evidences contained in the Scriptures, as a Proof, that the Chriſtian Religion came from God. Therefore, I ſhall, at this Time, inſiſt upon only one ſingle Evidence, out of many,—that is, the Reſurrection of Chriſt, as a full Proof in the Caſe. If the Reſurrection is proved by inconteſtable Evidence, then
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012428_0007_0F899852D0ED2140"/>
the Chriſtian Religion muſt have come from God: If that cannot be proved, all the Evidences muſt be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſignificant. <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your Faith is alſo vain,</hi> (1 Corinthians 15.14.</p>
            <p>The Reſurrection of Chriſt is a Matter of Fact,<note n="*" place="bottom">Every rational Being is as good a Judge of a Matter of Fact, as the greateſt Man upon Earth.</note> ſaid to be done upwards of ſeventeen Hundred Years ago: therefore the Evidence for this Fact muſt be taken from the Hiſtorians of that Age, in which, it is ſaid Chriſt aroſe from the Dead.</p>
            <p>Let only the ſame Credit be given to the Authors of the New Teſtament, that is allowed to other Hiſtorians of that Age in which they lived, and the Matter is put out of all Diſpute.</p>
            <p>Friends and Enemies all agree that Chriſt was dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was taken down from the Croſs. Pilate did not conſent that Chriſt ſhould be taken from the Croſs till he was ſure that he was dead: The Soldiers did not take him down from the Croſs, till they had <hi>with a Spear pierced his Side, and forthwith came thereout Blood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">There is no Water in that Part of the Body, but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Pericardium; if that is broken it is inſtant Death.</note> (John 19.34.)</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that Chriſt was dead; let us ſee if there is any Evidence that he was alive after this. For the Evidence of this, we muſt have recourſe to the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of that Age.</p>
            <p>The eleven Apoſtles declare, that they ſaw and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Chriſt after he roſe from the Dead, at ſeveral Times, within forty Days after he roſe. Not only ſo, but he appointed the Time when, and the Place where he would appear to them.</p>
            <p>And 'tis alſo affirmed, that five Hundred Perſons ſaw him at one Time, after he roſe from the Dead.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles upon all Opportunities declare that they were Witneſſes of his reſurrection; and they affirmed this, at the Peril of their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:012428_0008_0F899853CF27CA90"/>If this was not true; the Conduct of the Apoſtles can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted for, upon any rational Footing. For there was no <hi>Advantage</hi> could ariſe to them in <hi>this</hi> World, but much <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> and <hi>Danger,</hi> for aſſerting what they did. And as to the other World, for they believed the Immortality of the Soul, they muſt expect nothing but Puniſhment, if they perſiſted in declaring that to be true, which they knew to be abſolutely falſe.</p>
            <p>Let the Conduct of the Apoſtles be ever ſo unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in aſſerting that Chriſt was riſen from the Dead; yet if there are other Hiſtorians, of equal Character with them, who lived at the Time when it was ſaid, that Chriſt roſe from the Dead, and declare that he did not riſe; and that they could produce Numbers beſides themſelves, who ſaw his Body liveleſs and unanimated, lying in the Market at Jeruſalem, at various Times for forty Days; and not only ſo, but five Hundred People ſaw it there, in this lifeleſs State, at one Time; and that the greateſt Part of theſe People were alive when theſe Hiſtorians aſſerted theſe Facts, and that they died for aſſerting of them: Were this the Caſe, it would greatly weaken the Apoſtles' Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Matter of the Reſurrection. That is, if we conſider the Apoſtles' Evidence as only human, as I do for the preſent, this contrary Evidence would go near to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy what had been affirmed by the Apoſtles.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is allowed that the <hi>onus probandi,</hi> lies on the affirmative Side of the Queſtion: Yet it is but juſt to call for Evidence hereof from the other Side; as it was in the Power of thoſe who denied the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a poſitive Proof, by producing the Body of Chriſt if he was not riſen.</note> But is this the Caſe? Is there ſo much as one Hiſtorian, who aſſerts that he ſaw the Body of Chriſt dead, after the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles declare it to be alive? Were not the Jews and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans as much concerned to prove the Falſehood of the Apoſtles in this point, as they were to ſupport their own Characters? Were they not warned beforehand, that Chriſt had ſaid he ſhould riſe the third Day? Did they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012428_0009_0F899854313E1FF8"/>
not upon this Information take the Charge of the Body of Chriſt, after it was laid in the Tomb,<note n="*" place="bottom">As the Tomb was cut out of a ſolid Rock, there was but one Way for the Body to come out; ſo it was eaſy to guard it and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Cheat in the Caſe.</note> in order, to prevent any publick Deception? If the Body was gone, were not they who took the Charge of it, anſwerable for it to the Publick?</p>
            <p>All Power, civil and military, was in the Hands of the Jews and Romans, at that Time. They could eaſily have confuted the Apoſtles, if what they aſſerted was not true. The Magiſtrates could have ſearched and ranſacked every Corner in the whole City.</p>
            <p>But there was no Need of ſo great a Search as this; for if his Body was left in the Hands of any, except Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they would readily deliver it up, in order to expoſe the Cheat. Accordingly if the Body was in Jeruſalem in a lifeleſs State, it might eaſily have been found, and no doubt would have been found, and laid in open View to all the Inhabitants of the whole City.</p>
            <p>If this had been done, it might have put an End, to all the Apoſtles had to offer in the Caſe. Men would have ſeen with their own Eyes, that the Fact which the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles aſſerted, was all at the very beſt, but a mere Deluſion.</p>
            <p>Was this done? Or was it even attempted to be done? No! And what Reaſon can be given why they did not attempt it? Only this—that they were conſcious Chriſt was riſen, and they could not produce his Body to the People. Otherwiſe they would certainly have taken this Method, and ſtifled the Error, if it was an Error, even in its very Birth</p>
            <p>If they had ſearched for the Body and found it, this would have had the Effect, to have entirely eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Prudence and Sagacity of the Enemies of the Chriſtian Religion, and confounded all thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to believe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012428_0010_0F899854EFCBCF30"/>But this they could not do: his Body was not to be found by them. It could not be detained even by Death, nor all the Powers of Darkneſs, for <hi>it was not poſſible it could be holden by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be aſked by ſome, why Chriſt did not appear to the Unbelievers; and convince them, that he was riſen from the Dead;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that he did appear to ſome; for it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that all the five Hundred Perſons to whom he appeared were Believers, before he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them. And we are abſolutely certain that St. Paul was an Unbeliever till after Chriſt appeared unto him.</p>
            <p>Indeed none of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> believed the Article of the Reſurrection, as one of the Characters of the Meſſiah, till after he appeared to them. When the Women told them that Chriſt was riſen, <hi>it ſeemed to them as idle Tales,</hi> and <hi>they believed them not.</hi> When the two Diſciples told them that he was riſen, and they had ſeen him, the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles <hi>believed it not.</hi> Thomas abſolutely refuſed to believe the Apoſtles, in this Point, till he ſhould be convinced by his own Senſes.</p>
            <p>Indeed it appears, that not one of his Diſciples believed that he was to riſe from the Dead, till after he appeared to them. But then, they immediately became Witneſſes to the World, that he was riſen from the Dead. Thoſe that were <hi>beſt</hi> acquainted with his Perſon before he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, were the <hi>fitteſt</hi> Perſons for Witneſſes of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: and no others were qualified to be Witneſſes in the Caſe. For if they did not know him <hi>before he died,</hi> how could they know him <hi>after he was riſen</hi>? Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, his Diſciples were the beſt qualified to be Judges in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>And beſides all this: God is the proper Judge of his own Diſpenſations, and beſt knows what Evidence, is moſt likely to prove effectual to produce a Belief in Mankind: and therefore hath given that Evidence in Scripture, which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012428_0011_0F899855B1026300"/>
is moſt powerful to bring us to a Belief of the Truth.</p>
            <p>It may be aſked, why there is not ſome Miracle wrought in every Age, and Country to convince People of the Truth of Chriſtianity?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, the very Thing deſired, God has been pleaſed to do. Perhaps, there is not a Government upon Earth, where there is not a Jew to teſtify the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. Every Jew we behold is a Miracle; for nothing leſs than the Divine Interpoſition in a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Way, could have preſerved that Nation diſtinct, when they lived amidſt all other Nations; deteſted and perſecuted by them for ſeventeen Hundred Years.</p>
            <p>Where are the ancient Romans now? Can any Man point out the Deſcendants of that once numerous and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent People? And yet that Nation was in the Meridian of its Glory, at the Time, when the Jews were diſperſed among all Nations. But to return,</p>
            <p>The Evidence of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, which proves that God hath ſpoken to us by his Son, or given a new Diſpenſation under the Government of the Meſſiah, is ſo clear and evident, that we muſt renounce the very Faculty of Credibility, and all Faith in Hiſtory, before we can ſet aſide the Evidence which God hath given for the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>All the Evidence is on the Side of Chriſtianity, there is none on the other. Though the Enemies to Chriſtianity have ranſacked all the Records of Time, they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo much as one Man, that has ſaid he ſaw the Body of Chriſt confined under the Power of Death, after the Apoſtles declare he was riſen from the Dead. Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then, that Men who make Evidence the Standard of their Belief, ſhould heſitate a Moment about the Truth of Chriſtianity? There is ſufficient Evidence offered in the Scripture, for the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, to <hi>ſatiſfy</hi> a rational Enquiry, whatever it may be to <hi>ſilence</hi> a uſeleſs Curioſity.</p>
            <p>The true State of the Caſe lies thus: The eleven
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012428_0012_0F89985670BCF590"/>
Apoſtles declare at the Hazard of their Lives, and died for aſſerting of it, that Chriſt roſe from the Dead. They declare that they <hi>ſaw</hi> him, <hi>handled</hi> him, and <hi>eat</hi> with him, after he <hi>died,</hi> and <hi>roſe from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other Side, there is not the leaſt diſtant Hint given by any Hiſtorian, even of the loweſt Character, that any Perſon ſaw the Body of Chriſt dead, after the Time, that the Apoſtles declare that he was riſen.</p>
            <p>Now which Man acts the moſt conſiſtent with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a rational Being,— he who believes eleven Men, who aſſert a Matter of Fact, that they were Ear and Eye Witneſſes of; or he who refuſes his Belief? And yet there is not one Perſon who aſſerts the Contrary to be true, that is, not one Perſon who though he had it in his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to detect the Error, were it an Error, that ever has ſaid the leaſt Thing that could invalidate the Evidence, the Apoſtles have laid before the World.</p>
            <p>If Men will be determined by plain Evidence in the Caſe, they muſt embrace Chriſtianity; for it is true, that Chriſt roſe from the Dead; it is alſo true, that he has given us a Religion which we <hi>ought</hi> and are <hi>bound</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practiſe.</p>
            <p>I have laid the Evidence before you, to prove that Chriſt roſe from the Dead; and till ſuch Time, as that a Number of Hiſtorians, of equal Character with the Apoſtles, can be produced, that ſaw his Body dead, after the Time the Apoſtles declare it to be alive; the Evidence in favour of Chriſtianity is ſo clear, that no Man who makes Evidence the Baſis of his Conduct, can poſſibly withhold his Aſſent to the Truth of our moſt holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe there is not one preſent, that is willing to be governed by any Thing that is unreaſonable; that is to ſay, if ſufficient Evidence is laid before you, you will give your Aſſent accordingly.</p>
            <p>In the Caſe of Chriſtianity, you ſee, that the Evidence is clear, and eaſy to be found. And conſequently, that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012428_0013_0F899857300814E0"/>
our Belief is rational and and manly; founded upon ſuch Motives as we are able to juſtify, before God and Man.</p>
            <p>The next Thing, after we believe the Record which God has given of his Son, is ſincerely to take the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity upon us, according as Chriſt has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; then to regulate our Lives by that Law, which our Saviour who roſe from the Dead, hath given for a Rule for his Church in every changing Scene in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant World.</p>
            <p>In order, that we may make a right Uſe of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we enjoy by a Goſpel Revelation; let us ſet an high Value on the holy Scriptures, and make them the <hi>ſole Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> They contain the whole Evidence of our Religion, and all that Chriſt <hi>has done, is doing,</hi> and <hi>will do for his Church,</hi> together with the whole that Chriſt requires us to do for ourſelves, with that Aſſiſtance he has purchaſed for us, and beſtows upon all thoſe who ſincerely ſeek for it, in the Ways of his Appointment.</p>
            <p>If we would form a juſt Notion of Chriſtianity, free from all the Corruptions which were brought into it by deſigning Men, we muſt make the Study of the Scriptures a Part of our Religion. It would have been very happy for the Chriſtian Church, if they had made the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures all along the Rule of their Conduct. Then they would not have fallen into thoſe groſs Corruptions in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline, which have cauſed ſuch unchriſtian Diviſions in the Church, which have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated much Coldneſs in Religion. However, theſe Errors cannot be charged to our Religion, as contained in the Bible; if we forſake the Scriptures for a mere Whim of Men's diſtempered Brains, we muſt expect to embrace Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity. But if we take the Evidence for Chriſtianity from the Scripture, we are always ſafe; for our Faith then will not be changed according to the Faſhions of the Times, but be placed and <hi>built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner Stone.</hi> (Epheſians 2, 20.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:012428_0014_0F899857EFA7A948"/>Chriſtians who adhere to a written Revelation, have this Advantage, that by impartially conſulting it, the Deviations from it may be detected, and their Religion be brought back to its original Standard.</p>
            <p>Are we in doubt concerning the Truth of Chriſtianity? The Scriptures contain that Evidence in Favour of it, which is convincing to every Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is determined by the Force of Evidence.</p>
            <p>Are we in doubt about any Doctrine? The Scriptures are clear, as to all Points of Doctrine that were deſigned for this Period of the Church.</p>
            <p>Are we at a Loſs what was the antient Diſcipline of the Church? The Scriptures will inform us exactly, how the Apoſtles governed the Church in their Time; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Laws how the Church is to be governed to the Conſummation of all Things.</p>
            <p>Are we under deep Concern to find out what is our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Open your Bible; there you may find it, in legible Characters.</p>
            <p>Are we ſenſible we are Sinners, and have thereby loſt all Intercourſe with the pure and holy Father of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? The Scriptures acquaint us, <hi>That we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> (1 John 2.1, 2.) That though we are Sinners, yet we may obtain Pardon and Mercy upon the Goſpel Offer; that our Religion is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Mercy,</hi> not of <hi>Merit</hi> in us: and accordingly we may be accepted through the Merits of Chriſt, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>Are we under Trouble and Affliction of any Kind? The Scriptures are a ſovereign Remedy to allay our Grief; for they acquaint us, that God puts under, his everlaſting Arms, to ſupport the Feeble, and holds out his Mercy to encourage the deſponding Soul, and alleviate the Grief of the Mourner.</p>
            <p>Are we groaning under a Load of Infamy, becauſe our Characters are unjuſtly taken from us? The Scriptures
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012428_0015_0F899858AF30F690"/>
inform us, that it will not be long to the Time, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhall appear before the Tribunal of Heaven and Ear<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and then our Characters will appear in their true, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Colours.</p>
            <p>Are we labouring under any bodily Pain or Sickneſs? The Scriptures aſſure us, that after a little Time, we ſhall be poſſeſſed of a Reſurrection Body, in which, there will be no Pain or Sickneſs. For as Chriſt roſe from the Dead, being the firſt Fruits from the Dead, ſo will he alſo <hi>raiſe us from the Dead.</hi> I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the human Heart in all its Windings, Diſguiſes, and Corruptions.</p>
            <p>To accompliſh this Deſign effectually, I muſt make a ſolemn Appeal to the Conſcience of each individual Soul here preſent, to ſit as Judge in this Affair. The Rule, by which, you are to judge, <hi>is the Word of the ever-living God.</hi> The Things you are to paſs Judgment upon, are your own inward <hi>Characters, Principles, Springs of Action, and Conduct in Life.</hi> No human Creature beſides your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, can paſs a juſt Sentence in the Caſe. And yet it is of infinite Concern to you that ſuch a Judgment be formed. The habitual Tenor of your Life muſt be carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: your Conduct muſt be arraigned, interrogated, and tried by the ſacred Rule of God's Word. In Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, you will ſtand condemned, or acquitted, not by him that now ſpeaks to you, but by one who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better qualified to judge in this Matter; even by a Sentence which you have paſſed upon yourſelf, having the <hi>Word of God</hi> in <hi>one Hand,</hi> and a <hi>true Knowledge of your own Heart,</hi> in the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is there, that believes future Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, can ſtand by, as an unconcerned Spectator, when Things of ſuch infinite Moment await him? Are you fit for Heaven, or are you not? Or have you never made any inquiry about it? If you have not, how is it poſſible you can be eaſy one Moment? Do you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a Day coming, how ſoon you know not,

I ſhall ſee you all there; and may I ſee you at the Right Hand of the bleſſed Jeſus, ſhouting forth Praiſes for the Mercies of Redeeming Love. In that Day, we ſhall <hi>all</hi> hear the Sentence pronounced upon us, which will put us in Poſſeſſion of everlaſting Bliſs, or conſign us over to eternal Woe.</p>
            <p>At this Tribunal the Conduct of every Soul will be tried by the Word of God. They who have made the Scriptures the Rule of their Life, and thereby are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to enjoy the State of the Bleſſed, will by the Merits of Chriſt, hear this enraviſhing Sentence pronounced upon them, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the other Hand; they who would not have Chriſt to rule over them, but ſet up Rules of their own in Oppoſition to the Divine Law, ſhall nevertheleſs be judged by the ſacred Scripture, and hear this awful, and tremendous Sentence pronounced upon them in terrible Accents, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> How dreadful, how amazing will it be, to hear ſuch a Sentence paſſed by that loving Saviour, that moſt kind merciful Redeemer; who had ſuch a mighty Love for Mankind, as to come into an ungrateful World, and ſuffer, ſweat, bleed, and die, to put Mankind <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>If we can be perſuaded to realize this laſt Tribunal, it would be the very beſt Expedient to ſilence all Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Religion; and excite Mankind to the faithful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of every Duty.
