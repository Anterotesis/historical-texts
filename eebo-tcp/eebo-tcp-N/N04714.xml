            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Scripture Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Predeſtination, Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Scripture ſaith, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ephſ.</hi> i. 4.</note> 
               <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt, before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy, and without Blame before him in Love.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Saints, <note n="(b)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Elect according to the Fore-knowledge of God the Father, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, unto Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith unto them, <note n="(c)" place="bottom">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> ii. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>God hath from the Beginning choſen you to Salvation, thro' Sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and belief of the Truth; whereunto he hath called you by our Goſpel, to the obtaining of the Glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From all theſe Places of Scripture, it is plain that God hath choſen ſome to Life and Glory, before or from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dation of the World. And the Wiſdom of all Chriſtians is, to labour that their Judgments may be informed herein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture. And to that End let us conſider the Manner of God's ſpeaking to the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. iv. 17. <hi>As it is written, I have made thee a Father of Many Nations before him whom he believed, even God who quickeneth the Dead, and calleth Things that are not as tho' they were.</hi> Obſerve, God ſpeaks then, at that preſent Time, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Abraham</hi> was not at that Time the Father of one Child, but <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> How then muſt we underſtand <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle tells us plainly, it was ſo, <hi>Before God, who calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were.</hi> And ſo he calleth <hi>Abraham, The Father of many Nations,</hi> tho' he
<pb facs="unknown:005881_0003_102758EBB6643990"/>
was not as yet; tho' he was not as yet the Father even of <hi>Iſaac, in whom his Seed was to be called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. God uſeth the ſame Manner of Speaking, when he calleth Chriſt, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> xiii 8.</note> 
               <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World;</hi> altho' in Deed he was not ſlain for ſeveral thouſand Years after. Hence therefore we may eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he ſpeaketh of <hi>Electing us from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. God calleth <hi>Abraham a Father of many Nations,</hi> tho' not ſo at that Time. He calleth Chriſt, <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> tho' not ſlain till he was a Man in the Fleſh. Even ſo he calleth Men <hi>Elected from the Foundation of the World,</hi> tho' not elected till they were Men in the Fleſh. Yet it is all ſo before God, who knowing all Things from Eternity. <hi>Calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. By all which it is clear, that as Chriſt was called <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> and yet not ſlain till ſeveral thouſand Years after, till the Day of his Death; ſo alſo Men are called <hi>Elect from the Foundation of the World,</hi> and yet are not elected perhaps till ſeveral thouſand Years after, till the Day of their Converſion to God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And indeed this is plain, without going farther, from thoſe very Words of St. <hi>Peter, Elect, according to the Fore-knowledge of God, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, unto Obedience.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>If the Elect are choſen thro' the Sanctification of the Spirit, then they were not choſen before they were ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd by the Spirit. But they were not ſanctify'd by the Spirit, before they had a Being. It is plain then neither were they choſen from the Foundation of the World. But <hi>God calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. This is alſo plain from thoſe Words of St. <hi>Paul, God hath from the Beginning choſen you to Salvation, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:005881_0004_102758ED43F29308"/>If the Saints are choſen to Salvation, thro' believing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Truth, and were called to believe that Truth by the hearing of the Goſpel, then they were not choſen before they believed the Truth, and before they heard the Goſpel, whereby they were called to believe. But they were choſen thro' Belief of the Truth, and called to believe it by the Goſpel. Therefore they were not choſen before they believed; much leſs before they had a Being, any more than Chriſt was ſlain, before <hi>he</hi> had a Being. So plain is it, that they were not elected, till they believed; altho' <hi>God calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Again, how plain is it, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that they whom <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>God did predeſtinate, according to the Counſel of his own Will, to be to the Praiſe of his Glory,</hi> were ſuch as did <hi>firſt truſt in Chriſt?</hi> And in the very next Verſe, he ſaith, that they <hi>truſted in Chriſt, after they heard the Word of Truth</hi> (not before.) But they did not hear the Word before they were born. Therefore, it is plain, the Act of Election is <hi>in Time,</hi> tho' known of God before; who, according to his Knowledge, often ſpeaketh of the Things <hi>which are not, as tho' they were.</hi> And thus is the great Stumbling-Block about Election taken away, that Men may <hi>make their Calling and Election ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. The Scripture tells us as plainly what Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is: It is, God's fore appointing obedient Believers to Salvation, not without, but <hi>according to his Fore-knowledge</hi> of all their Work, <hi>from the Foundation of the World.</hi> And ſo likewiſe he predeſtinate or fore appoints all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient Unbelievers to Damnation, not without, but <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Fore-knowledge</hi> of all their Works, <hi>from the Foundation of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. We may conſider this a little farther. God from the Foundation of the World fore knew all Men's believing or not believing. And according to this his Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he choſe or <hi>elected</hi> all obedient Believers, as ſuch, to Salvation, and refuſed or <hi>reprobated</hi> all diſobedient Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb facs="unknown:005881_0005_102758F1418FF2B8"/>
as ſuch, to Damnation. Thus the Scriptures teach us to conſider <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation, according to the Fore-knowledge of God from the Foundation of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. But here ſome may object, that I hold our Faith and Obedience to be the Cauſe of God's electing us to Glory.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, I do hold, That Faith in Chriſt producing Obedience to him is <hi>a Cauſe without which</hi> God electeth none to Glory; for we never read of God's electing to Glory, any who liv'd and died a diſobedient Unbeliever. But I do not hold, that it is <hi>the Cauſe for which</hi> he elects any: The contrary of this is eaſily ſhewn, thus:</p>
            <p>Suppoſe my Obedience is a Cauſe of my Election to Salvation, What is the Cauſe of my Obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> My Love to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But what is the Cauſe of my Love to Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> My Faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But what is the Cauſe of my Faith in Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Preaching of the Goſpel of Christ.</p>
            <p>But what is the Cauſe of the Preaching of the Goſpel to us? <hi>Anſ</hi> Chriſt's dying for us.</p>
            <p>But what is the Cauſe of Chriſt's dying for us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> God's great Love of Pity wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Thus all Men may ſee, that I do not hold God choſe any Man to Life and Salvation for any Good which he had done, or for any which was in him, before he put it there. And this I ſhall now ſhew more at large from the Oracles of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's great Love of Pity, wherewith he loved the Sons of Men, even while they were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, was the Cauſe of his ſending his Son to die for them; as appears from the following Scriptures; <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> iii. 16.</note> 
               <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the End that all who believe in him, ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting Life.</hi> For <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>when we were yet without Strength,
<pb facs="unknown:005881_0006_102758F5889065E8"/>
in due Time Chriſt died for the Ungodly.</hi> And, <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his Love to us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt's dying for our Sins is the Cauſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel's being preach'd to us, as appears from thoſe Scriptures, <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Goſpel's being preached to Sinners is the Cauſe of their believing, as appears from thoſe Scriptures, <note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="17">17 But for whoſe Sins did Chriſt die? Did he die for <hi>All</hi> Men, or but for <hi>Some?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſhall anſwer by the Scriptures, ſhewing 1. The Teſtimony of all the Prophets. 2 Of the Angel of God. 3. Of Chriſt himſelf. And 4 Of his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith thus, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> liii. 4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Surely he hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows; yet did we eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted. But he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities, the Chaſtiſement of our Peace was upon him, and with his Stripes we are healed. All we, like Sheep, have gone aſtray; we have turn'd every one to his own Way; and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquities of us all.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſheweth plainly, that the Iniquities of all thoſe who went aſtray, were laid upon Chriſt. And to him the Teſtimony of all the other Prophets agreeth: <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.</note> 
               <hi>To him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Witneſs, that thro' his Name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> The ſame ſaith that great
<pb facs="unknown:005881_0009_102759018883FA38"/>
Prophet, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>came to bear Witneſs of the Light, that</hi> all Men <hi>thro' it might believe.</hi> And again, <note n="(d)" place="bottom">v. 29</note> 
               <hi>Behold, ſaith he, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sins</hi> of the World. Thus have all the Prophets with one Conſent teſtified, that God <hi>laid upon Chriſt the Iniquities of all</hi> that were <hi>gone aſtray;</hi> that he is <hi>the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sins of the World;</hi> that <hi>all Men thro' him may believe;</hi> and that <hi>thro' his Name whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Angel of God teſtified the ſame Thing, ſaying, <note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Fear not; for I bring you glad Tidings of great Joy, which ſhall be to all People,</hi> which was, that there was <hi>born unto them a Saviour, even Chriſt the Lord.</hi> By this alſo it appears, that Chriſt died for all Men For elſe it could not have been glad Tidings of great Joy, to all People; but rather ſad Tidings to all thoſe for whom he died not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We come now to the Words of Chriſt himſelf, who knew his own Buſineſs better than any Man elſe; and therefore, if his Teſtimony agree with theſe, we muſt needs be convinced that they are true. Now, he ſpeaks thus, <note n="(f)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> iii. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life. For God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life. For God ſent not his Son to condemn the World, but that the World thro' him might be ſaved.</hi> Thus we ſee the Words of Chriſt agree with the Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; therefore it muſt needs be own'd that Chriſt died for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And now we will hear what the Apoſtles ſay concerning this Thing. <note n="(g)" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The Love of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005881_0010_10275903F7753460"/>
that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them, and roſe again.</hi> And to <hi>Timothy</hi> he ſaith, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>there is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be teſtify'd in due Time.</hi> Again, he ſaith to <hi>Titus,</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The Grace of God, which bringeth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Men, hath appeared.</hi> And yet again to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 9.</note> 
               <hi>that he, by the Grace of God, taſted Death for every Man.</hi> And to this agreeth St. <hi>John,</hi> witneſſing <note n="(d)" place="bottom">1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 2.</note> 
               <hi>He is the Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And again, ſpeaking of himſelf and the reſt of the Apoſtles, he ſaith. <note n="(e)" place="bottom">1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 14.</note> 
               <hi>We have ſeen and do teſtify that the Father ſent the Son, to be the Saviour of the World.</hi> Thus we have the Teſtimony of all the Prophets, of the Angel of God, of Chriſt himſelf, and of his Holy Apoſtles, all agreeing together in one to prove, that Chriſt died for all Mankind.</p>
            <p n="18">18. What then can they, who deny this, ſay? Why, they commonly ſay <hi>All Men,</hi> in theſe Scriptures, does not mean <hi>All Men,</hi> but only <hi>The Elect;</hi> that <hi>Every Man</hi> here does not mean <hi>Every Man,</hi> but only every one of the Elect; that <hi>The World</hi> does not mean <hi>the whole World,</hi> but only the World of Believers; and that <hi>the whole World,</hi> in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Words, does not mean <hi>the whole World,</hi> but only, The whole World of the Elect.</p>
            <p n="19">19. To this ſhameleſs, ſenſeleſs Evaſion, I anſwer thus:</p>
            <p>If the Scripture no where ſpeaks of a World of Believers or Elect, then we have no Ground, Reaſon, Pretence or Excuſe for ſaying, Chriſt died only for a World of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers or Elect. But the Scripture no where ſpeaks of ſuch a World. Therefore we have no Ground or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for ſpeaking thus.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Scripture is ſo far from calling Believers or elected Perſons, <hi>The World,</hi> that they are every where in Scripture plainly and expreſly diſtinguiſhed from <hi>The
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005881_0011_10275905AFDE7C70"/>
World.</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> xv. 19.</note> 
               <hi>If ye were of the World,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the World would love its own; but becauſe I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. But let the Scripture itſelf ſpeak, what World Chriſt died for. <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 6, 10</note> 
               <hi>When we were yet without Strength, Chriſt died for the Ungodly. While we were yet Sinners, Chriſt died for us. When we were Enemies, we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi> From all which we may clearly ſee, that Chriſt died for the <hi>World of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> for the <hi>World of Sinners,</hi> for the <hi>World of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> the Juſt One for the <hi>World of the Unjuſt.</hi> But the Elect, as Elect, are not unjuſt. Therefore he died not for the Elect, as Elect; but even for that World, St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſays, <hi>The whole World lieth in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. If it be ſaid, <q>The Elect were Sinners once as well as others;</q> I anſwer, True; but not <hi>as they are Elect in Chriſt,</hi> but as they were <hi>out of Chriſt, without Hope and without God in the World.</hi> Therefore, to ſay that Chriſt died for the Elect, as Elect, is abſolute Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and Confuſion.</p>
            <p n="22">22. To put this Matter out of Doubt, I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe following Conſiderations to all ſober-minded Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scripture ſaith, Chriſt <hi>came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Elect, as Elect, were not loſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the Elect, as or becauſe they were Elect; for that had been to ſeek and ſave what was found and ſaved before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture ſaith, Chriſt died for <hi>the Unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Elect, as ſuch, are not unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Chriſt died not for the Elect, as Elect; for that had been to juſtify them who were juſt before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>He came to preach Deliverance to the Captive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005881_0012_102759074FB69540"/>But the Elect, as Elect, are not Captive; for Chriſt hath ſet them free.</p>
            <p>Therefore he died not for the Elect, as Elect; for that had been to ſet them at Liberty who were at Liberty before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>He quickened them who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins ſuch as were without Chriſt, Aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and Strangers to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Promiſe, without Hope and without God in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Elect, as ſuch, are not <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> but <hi>alive unto God.</hi> Neither are they <hi>without Chriſt;</hi> for they are choſen <hi>in him:</hi> Nor are they <hi>Aliens from the Commonwealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſe</hi> But they are <hi>Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and the Houſhold of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the Elect, as or becauſe they were Elect. For that had been to quicken them that were alive before, and to bring them into Covenant, who were in Covenant before. And thus, by theſe Men's Account, our Lord loſt his Labour of Love, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed A SOLEMN NOTHING.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Thus having ſhewn the grievous Folly of thoſe who ſay, that <hi>Chriſt died for none but the Elect.</hi> I ſhall now prove by undeniable Reaſons, that <hi>he died for All Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe all the Prophets, the Angel of God, Chriſt himſelf, and his holy Apoſtles with one Conſent, affirm it.</p>

            <p n="24">24. I ſhall now briefly ſhew the dreadful Abſurdities that follow from ſaying <hi>Chriſt died only for the Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If Chriſt died not for All, then Unbelief is no Sin in them that finally periſh; ſeeing there is not any Thing for thoſe Men to believe unto Salvation, for whom Chriſt died not.</item>

yea reſolved that moſt Men ſhould periſh; elſe he would have died for them alſo.</item>
               <item>7. How ſhall God <hi>judge the World by the Man Chriſt-Jeſus,</hi> if Chriſt did not die for the World? Or how ſhall he judge them <hi>according to the Goſpel,</hi> when there was never any Goſpel or Mercy for them?</item>
            </list>
            <p n="25">25. But, ſay ſome, <q>If Chriſt died for all, why are not all ſaved?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>Becauſe they believe not in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> Becauſe God <hi>called, and they refuſed to anſwer; he ſtretch'd out his Hand, and they regarded not; he counſell'd them, but they would none of his Counſels;</hi> he reproved them, but <hi>they ſet at nought all his Reproofs; they followed after lying Vanities, and forſook their own Mercies;</hi> they <hi>denied the Lord that bought them, and ſo brought upon themſelves ſwift Deſtruction;</hi> And <hi>becauſe they received not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved, therefore</hi> (if you would know wherefore) <hi>God gave them up to believe a Lye,</hi> and to be damned. <hi>How often</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>would I have gathered you together,</hi> and ye would not? <hi>Ye would not.</hi> Here is the plain Reaſon, why all Men are not ſaved. For God promiſeth no Man Salvation, whether he will or no. But leaveth them to everlaſting Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who will not <hi>believe and obey the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">26. <q>O, then you are an <hi>Arminian!</hi> You are a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willer.</hi> You hold Free will in Man!</q>
            </p>
            <p>I hold nothing but what the Scripture ſaith; and that you ſhall give me Leave to hold. I do not hold, that any Man has any Will or Power of himſelf, to do any Thing that is Good; but by the Grace of God we may do all Things. I have already ſhewn, he hath given Chriſt for all Men. And <hi>he who ſpared not his own Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all Things?</hi> And what Man knoweth not, that if he make Uſe of all the Will and Power God hath given him, God will double his Talent, and give him more? If any therefore deſire to have more, let him faithfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005881_0015_102759122C9B20E0"/>
what he has. Likewiſe what Man is he, who doth not know that he is not condemn'd, <hi>for not doing what he could not do,</hi> but <hi>for leaving undone what he could have done if he would.</hi> Let any Man deny it if he can.</p>
            <p n="27">27. "What then, may all Men be ſaved if they will?"</p>
            <p>Before I anſwer this Queſtion directly, I ſhall ſhew that thoſe who aſk it, are themſelves compell'd to grant as much Freedom of Will, as we deſire to plead for.</p>
            <p>For 1. The Aſſembly of Divines, in their Confeſſion of Faith, c. 9. do expreſly ſay, <hi>God hath endowed the Will of Man with that natural Liberty, that it is neither forced, nor by any abſolute Neceſſity determined to do Good or Evil.</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in the Preface of his <hi>Call to the Unconverted,</hi> ſays, that <hi>Calvin as well as</hi> Arminius <hi>held Free-will,</hi> and that <hi>no Man of Brains denieth, that Man hath a Will that is naturally free; it is free from Violence, it is a ſelf-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Principle.</hi> Sure here is as much ſaid for Free-will, as any Man need to ſay, and perhaps more. For,</p>
            <p>The Difference between us, is this. They ſay, <hi>Man hath a Will which is naturally free.</hi> We ſay, <hi>Man hath this Freedom of Will, not naturally, but by Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We believe, that in the Moment <hi>Adam</hi> fell, he had no Freedom of Will left; But that God, when of his own Free Grace he gave the Promiſe of a Saviour to him and his Poſterity, graciouſly reſtored to Mankind a Liberty and Power to accept of proffered Salvation. And in all this, Man's boaſting is excluded; the whole of that which is Good in him, even from the firſt Motion of his Will, being of Grace and not of Nature. And now we come directly to the Queſtion, Whether All Men may be ſaved if they will?</p>
            <p n="28">28. To thoſe who have conſider'd what has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; I anſwer, 1. What ſhould hinder them if they be willing? For 2. God is not willing that any ſhould periſh; yea, 3. He is willing that all Men ſhould be ſav'd. And Chriſt is willing; for he <hi>came not to judge the World, but to ſave the World.</hi> And how did he weep over <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:005881_0016_102759168B612988"/>
How often would he have gather'd them together, even as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, but they would not? And now, what hinders Mens Salvation, but that ſame, <hi>they would not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">29. They would not, they will not come at Chriſt's Call, and hearken to his Reproof, and wait for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and receive Power from on high to live to him who died for them, walking in all his Commandments and Ordinances blameleſs, and following him whitherſoever he goeth. This Way i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo narrow that few care to walk therein; and therefore they are not ſaved, even becauſe <hi>they reject the Counſel of God againſt themſelves.</hi> They chooſe Death; therefore they periſh everlaſtingly.</p>
