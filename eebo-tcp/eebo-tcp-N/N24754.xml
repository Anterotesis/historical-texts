            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <q>I therefore, Priſoner of the Lord, beſeech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called: with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long ſuffering, forbearing one another in love. Endeavouring to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one ſpirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptiſm: One God and Father of all: who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</q>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. iv. 1—6.</note>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THESE words, or nearly theſe, were the expreſſions of one of the Apoſtles, which have taken hold of my mind ſince I laſt ſat down, and they have brought with them the remembrance of the unwearied labours of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive believers for the preſervation of the unity of ſpirit in the bond of peace; that there might be no rents or ſchiſms found among us, and that being called with the ſame hope as they were called, we all might be found one in him in whom they have believed. And I believe, my friends, that it ought to be the concern of every Goſpel Miniſter this day. Indeed I can ſay when my mind is moſt encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with hopes; the moſt ardent deſire that I feel is, that notwithſtanding there have many diviſions taken place, yet the Lord may again ſo reveal himſelf to his profeſſing viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, as to bring us all back into Unity of Spirit in the bonds of unſpeakable peace. And I have no doubt at all in my mind, but that every jot and tittle of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic declaration of the Lord's Servant will in due time be fulfilled; that the Church will at length be one, and her name one; they will all ſpeak the ſame language, and the watchmen will all ſee eye to eye.</p>
                  <p>And it may, my friends, be brought about by a variety of circumſtances, unfathomable to human wiſdom; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all human wiſdom is confounded in ſearching the things of God. But the glorious diſpenſation wherein we
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032807_0003_0FF529174874B028"/>
live, whenever and wherever it is ſubmitted to, produces the ſame effect as it did in the beginning, it confounds the wiſdom of the wiſe; it brings to nought the underſtanding of the prudent; ſo that no fleſh ſhall glory in the Lord's preſence; that no man might ſay that others teach him; but that, by God's holy ſpirit, he was enabled to ſearch the deep things of the myſtery of his glorious kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This is my faith; and it remains to be very evidently ſo. Human wiſdom is ſufficient in many reſpect for our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations through this temporary abode; it may keep us in ſome degree of rectitude; and amongſt men it may alſo conduce greatly to the happineſs of individuals; and if cloſely attended to, it may be of ſervice to nations and kingdoms. But when we ſpeak of it, as fathoming the everlaſting myſtery of God's kingdom, I believe we ſhall always be ſhort.</p>
                  <p>It is not—it cannot be, that through the fallen wiſdom of man, he can take in the knowledge of things divine and ſpiritual. It was not ſo in the primitive Church, though Paul was a great man, who was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel; and was ſkilful in all the learning of his times; it was not this learning that made him a miniſter of the Goſpel; for by this, and while he continued merely ſubject to, and under the dominion of this wiſdom, he was a perſecutor of thoſe that preached, and lived in the faith, as it is in Jeſus Chriſt. And what made him a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter then? Why; when it pleaſed GOD, ſaid he, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his Son, Jeſus Chriſt, he was not diſobedient, he was not gainſaying to the will of God; but when he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf called in this manner, he went forth, but not with the enticing words of man's wiſdom; but in the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of the Croſs. For though he was a great and learned man, he was firſt, before he could be a great man in the promoting of the truth of the goſpel upon earth, he was firſt to be reduced, he was firſt alarmed; and the firſt leſſon which all ought to learn is, If any man will be wiſe, let
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032807_0004_0FF528E4B05590D0"/>
him firſt become a fool. If any man believe, or ſay, that he knows any thing, he knows nothing as he ought to know; for ſo ſays the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>Now, my friends, it may appear very extraordinary doctrine, at this time of day, but it was ſuch as the apoſtles preached, ſuch as they had approved, and by means of which they obtained the miniſtry of reconciliation, which they had received, and firſt were taught; that no man could know of the things that God had ſent, but by the ſpirit of God, who revealed it to them; this was the foundation of their learning in the School of Chriſt, and <hi>other foundation can no man lay than that which has been already laid.</hi> This I am perſuaded of in my own mind, that we muſt all, not only the miniſters, but all thoſe that would have a part in Chriſt, that would indeed enjoy an inheritance with him —they muſt all be taught of him and learn of him; they muſt lean upon his arm, the glorious and bleſſed deliverer of his people; they muſt have their exalted imaginations caſt down; they muſt know and feel the power of his word, to bring them into humility, that they may be taught of him. And I believe there is an aſſent to the truth of this in many ſolid ſeeking minds that are now preſent. Though human learning and ſcience in itſelf, when properly applied for the purpoſes which it is fitted and deſigned for, are by no means to be deſpiſed; nay when thoſe who are qualified with what is called a liberal education, are, by the influence of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, brought down into a true Chriſtian ſtate, they may be eminently qualified for the promoting of truth and righteouſneſs in their day. So that I would not have you miſtake. We make a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is true: but when the Lord unites them, when he lays his hand upon thoſe that have many advantages in the world, he may make them greater inſtruments in his hand. But I may alſo ſay, that ſome of the greateſt ornaments that ever I have known in the church of Chriſt, who I believe were qualified for the preaching of the goſpel in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032807_0005_0FF528F34A3EF490"/>
of the ſpirit and of power, have been even among thoſe that have had little advantages of this kind. As it was in the beginning, the ſame eternal power reigns; the God that commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs having ſhone in their hearts, they dwelled and abode in thoſe vocations wherewith they were called, and they have become ornaments in the church, and dignified mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt. But, my friends, what I moſt want is, to ſee the people brought back again in eſſential matters; (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that many of all denominations believe in the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit of the God of peace) and to inſtruct them in the way to everlaſting peace, and to wait for it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. There are many ſheep, as Chriſt ſaid, who hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, though they may be little known of the world. "My ſheep they hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I will give them eternal life, and none ſhall be able to pluck them out of my hands. My father who gave them to me, is greater than all, and none ſhall be able to pluck them out of my heavenly father's hands." O! that you my dear fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low pilgrims and chriſtians of every rank, and of every name, may experimentally know that you have need of Chriſt, then though you may be hidden from the world, yet the Lord knoweth, the Lord heareth your prayers, the Lord will magnify his power for your redemption and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; and no other arm can deliver you from the power of death and hell. This I believe: and let us, my friends, be laying aſide all controverſies about thoſe things which have ſo long oppreſſed Chriſtianity by contention, needleſs and unprofitable contention. I think you will unite with me in ſaying this has been the caſe. O! how much need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unprofitable contention there has been in the church of Chriſt, in the profeſſing church of Chriſt; for if it had been true and ſolid—the foundation in Chriſt—there would have been no ſuch contention; this is my faith; they would have been united in the bonds of peace and union for ever; they would have harmonized; the ſame divine ſpirit would
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032807_0006_0FF528D4AC12DE10"/>
have ſpoken nearly the ſame language in all; there would have been no room for contention; there would have been no neceſſity for contention, if the Church of Chriſt had kept hold of the foundation which God laid in Sion; and if they had remembered the rock upon which he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he would build his Church, there would have been a different appearance. Now I believe the ſame divine Lord is offering, in everlaſting mercy to all men, to bring them back again into this bond of fellowſhip, to put an end to all rents and diviſions, to all contradiction, and perſecutions to the end of the world. And what I deſire very much, is, that all people may have faith in God, and in the revelation of his ſpirit, ſo as not to let us depart from the ancient doctrine. It is here the Church of Chriſt has been erring; by departing from this ancient doctrine which never was, by all that we can find in the whole New Teſtament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be changed. There never was to be another way, nor another diſpenſation to after ages, than was granted and given to the primitive believers. This I am bold to declare.</p>
                  <p>There was to be no new way into the ſheep-fold, but that way Chriſt himſelf declared. "I am the door into the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. By me, if any man enter, he ſhall go in and out and find paſture." Well then, it is for this we ſit down and wait in ſilence, that we may know the promiſes which are yea and amen for ever; that we may know the fulfilling of that which Chriſt has promiſed; to be with his church to the end of the world. "Lo I am with you alway—to the end of the world." And for the fulfilment of this promiſe there are many, I am perſuaded, that not only wait ſeriouſly in ſilence, but are waiting and meditating upon God, and that be of the ſame opinion that I am, it being the way, the moſt effectual way, to be taught of this glorious myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which God, in the riches of his mercy, teaches to all thoſe that love him. But men are carried away too much with practices they have been long accuſtomed to; we
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032807_0007_0FF528A68FC67B90"/>
are more filled with prejudices; and we have a great deal leſs charity about us than ſome would ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have. We do not judge with that candour and impartiality we ought; nor think of things even of the higheſt importance as we ought to do; as wiſe men and wiſe women, as heirs of immortality and eternal life. Now I believe here is a large number preſent, who really are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after the truth, and who are ſolicitous that they may know the truth and be eſtabliſhed in it, more than they are to be of any names or forms.</p>
                  <p>Well, I believe there are thoſe who are God's favourite children, under a variety of forms and obſervations, that I for my own part feel by no means to be eſſentially neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to believe of any importance, nor poſitively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be continued. For when the ſoul is in love with God, has found the living and eternal ſubſtance of all the ſhadows, and all the figures that ever were in the world, it has no need of elementary things; why, my friends, there were many types and figures in former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations that were commanded for a time, and they are ſaid to be a ſchoolmaſter to bring to Chriſt, who nailed the hand-writing of ordinances to the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>But let every man be perſuaded in his own mind; let every man attend to the light of Chriſt in his conſcience; and follow the dictates of it fully and faithfully. If thou believeſt with all thine heart that it is thy duty in the ſight of GOD to be plunged into water in the name of the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, according to thy faith ſo be it to thee, let no man condemn thee. Nevertheleſs, I believe that when the ſubſtance of all types is fully found and felt, when he reigns in his kingdom of the heart, when he ſeats him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there, and when we have to partake of that bread which came down from heaven, we have no need of elementary things; for that is ſufficient for the ſoul to nouriſh it up to eternal life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:032807_0008_0FF528FB30EECF48"/>There were in the beginning many of the primitive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who continued for a ſeaſon in abundance of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; they were even loth to renounce the diſpenſations that were paſſed away by the coming of Chriſt; and even when Chriſt's Kingdom was come into the hearts of them that received it, and when he had finiſhed his work his Father had given him to do, and brought in the glorious diſpenſation, by which men might draw nigh to God; even then, there were ſome of the Apoſtles that thought it was neceſſary to uſe circumciſion; they could not leave off education, they could not leave all at once thoſe forms they had been accuſtomed to. Not ſo when it was brought to the Council at Jeruſalem; they, according as they felt and underſtood matters, reaſoned concerning them; they heard one another in the great council of Jeruſalem. But what was the reſult of this council? why it clearly came to almoſt an end of all theſe things; and the day of Chriſt, it appeared, was advanced; they did not think theſe things neceſſary. They ſaid, it ſeemeth good to lay upon you no greater burden than that ye abſtain from fornication, from things offered to idols, from things ſtrangled, and from blood; theſe were all the council at Jeruſalem laid upon believers—to obſerve no greater burden; and ſome of which at this day are not accounted to be any more neceſſary than the waſhing of one another's feet was; though our Saviour did do this to manifeſt though he was Lord of all, he was even in the form of a Servant of all, and condeſcended in the depth of humility to waſh his diſciples feet. Here was a great example and pattern. "And he commanded them ſtrictly (if we literally take the expreſſions of Scripture,) as I your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ſo waſh ye one another's feet."</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, I believe theſe were outward ſigns, and manifeſted Chriſt's humility, which he wiſhed them to pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern after in the whole of their conduct, and tenor of their lives; not confined to waſhing of feet only, but that they
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032807_0009_0FF528B49C8E41C8"/>
might be ſervants one to another. "Let him that will be great amongſt you be the ſervant of all." O that ye, my friends, may ſet aſide all the contentions concerning theſe things; let every man be perſuaded in his own mind. But let us come to eſſential things, thoſe things without which no man can be ſaved; let us ſearch more after things that are certain, great, and fundamental points of doctrine, which I believe not only thoſe that profeſs a faith in Chriſt, but that all men, of all nations, of every kingdom, tongue, and people—people that have the feweſt advantages amongſt the race of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet they have had this one advantage. The Lord has written his Law in their hearts, he has fulfilled his promiſe that he declared to his prophet, "I will write my law in their hearts, I will place it in their inward parts;" ſo that when we talk of men as of different nations, we ſhall find that they all agree, if they are men really ſeeking after the truth, and after that foundation which will bear them out when they come to put off mortality.</p>
                  <p>All men will acknowledge that the work of righteouſneſs is peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs, is quietneſs to the ſoul, and aſſurance for ever. <hi>All men acknowledge this.</hi> I have been amongſt ſome men that have been called the moſt barbarous names, as ſavages. I have ſpent a great deal of time with them; aye, <hi>ſome months,</hi> and I found they had not been inſtructed, they had not had the great advantage that we have. The preaching of the Goſpel was little known amongſt them; yet clear outlines of what the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Jeſus Chriſt requires, were written upon their hearts; they could ſay in terms of equal importance, verily there is a reward to the righteous, verily there is a God that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the earth, verily we are accountable beings, verily there is a ſtate of immortality; there is a bleſſed and happy one for thoſe that, according to the beſt of their knowledge, ſerve the great Spirit in this world; who do no wrong to their neighbour, who live in God's fear, who lift up their
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032807_0010_0FF528D64509F290"/>
hearts to him and implore his aſſiſtance. Theſe are the ſentiments the wild inhabitants of America are taught, whom we are pleaſed to call barbarians: ſo that (I believe) if men would keep to the foundation, if they would not ſcatter hither and thither after a variety of non-eſſential things, they would ſooner be brought into greater harmony and union. For there is but one GOD over all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all? Aye, may ſome ſay, is he in us all? Why, there is nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually enforced upon us, in all the Doctrine of the New Teſtament than God and Chriſt in us the hope of Glory; and I believe this is not a time for thoſe who have the benefit of reading the Scriptures to deny this; it is a great benefit, a peculiar advantage which God has favoured us with, who profeſs the name of Chriſt; it would be a great advantage to ſome of you, my young friends, were you more acquainted therewith, if there was more delight in reading the Scriptures than there is in the preſent generation, and leſs delight in reading thoſe things that make a jeſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell, of GOD, and all things ſerious; I believe it would be a great advantage to many of the riſing youth.</p>
                  <p>I know that I for many years ſo abuſed my time in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing novels, romances, plays, and a variety of trumpery of this kind, that I had no reliſh for the Scriptures; and when I was brought to read the words, they were a ſealed book to me; I ſaw nothing in them, I had no delight in them; I would take them up and lay them down, and knew nothing of their value.—So it is with many; it it ſo with an abundance, both in Europe and America; much time is ſpent upon trifles; upon thoſe things that, inſtead of giving any real ſolid enjoyment, only tend to baniſh all thoſe rational and well-founded pleaſures and enjoyments which the Chriſtian experiences.</p>
                  <p>This is my teſtimony, becauſe I <hi>know</hi> what I <hi>ſay.</hi> I was for a number of years a ſlave to them: I know where they led me <hi>to,</hi> and I know where they led me <hi>from.</hi> But
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032807_0011_0FF528BFC5F5D160"/>
thanks be to God, there is ſomething which all men may experience, that will ſet their ſouls at reſt; that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them from an anxiety after every burden of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hour.</p>
                  <p>A man that loves to contemplate, (and it is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the dignity of a rational being, that is here for a few years, and preſently makes his exit and is ſeen no more) a man that can devote his leiſure hours, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the nobility of his rank in creation, the majeſty and greatneſs of that adorable Being who created all things by the word of his power, and who can contemplate that glorious ſcene that awaits the righteous, has more real en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment than all the pleaſures uſhered into the world. And this I am perſuaded of, that a private ſober meditation, and an evening's walk of a wiſe man, thus informed, is indeed the higheſt gratification that noble and rational beings, as we are, can enjoy. And that in wherein I want you, my young friends, to ſet out right. In the early part of your youth, Search the Scriptures; they are books of ineſtimable value. One of the great men of this nation, who ſome ages ago was preparing to die, when he came to lay down his head upon his bed of ſickneſs, and ſaw the awful hour of death was come—What were his lamentations and expreſſions? Why he ſaid, O! that I had ſerved my GOD as faithful as I have ſerved my king; it would have been better for me now! He had been a great and famous ſtateſman. Now, my friends, this was his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and it may not be incompatible with the Chriſtian. Another of the ſame kind, whom I do not now recollect, but it was another man of eminence, that ſaid, if he had his time to go over again in this world, he would ſpend much of it in reading David's Pſalms and Paul's Epiſtles. And I wiſh you, my young friends, in this employ. Then you would find for yourſelves that the doctrine therein contained would lead you to God's kingdom. You would find indeed that God was <hi>nigh</hi> unto you. He is not, "ſays
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032807_0012_0FF5291148F04CB0"/>
Paul, afar off from any one of you, for in him ye move and have your being." This was their conſtant teſtimony. Nay, before the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his divinity. And ſhall we go back and ſay it is no ſuch thing?—Did not Socrates and Seneca, and many others, acknowledge the divinity was he that led them, that ſhewed them that they were immortal, and cauſed them to aſpire after thoſe things that would recommend them to the notice of God, and to great and everlaſting peace? O! my friends, there are a cloud of witneſſes from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation that the Lord has raiſed up in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to declare to the people, that He it was, and He it is, who is the true teacher of all wiſdom, of all that wiſdom which cometh down from him, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated, full of mercy, full of good fruit; and it is by this wiſdom that we ſhould be brought into the harmony that I have been ſpeaking of. O! that men would wait for it, that they would aſk for it, and that there were more who practiſed retirement in the world, and more ſincerity of heart even in our prayers! for what is it to be ſaying, "Lord, Lord," from the cradle to the grave? If we are not deſirous to be taught of him, and to do his will, what will it ſignify? Many in the hurry of life do not conſider him ſufficiently, but when they are brought to lay down upon a ſick bed; O! how changed do things appear, in how different a point of view. I have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many at death; I have viſited the chambers of thoſe that have been penitent; I have heard their expreſſions; many a time have I ſeen the work of the Lord upon them: How it hath changed them! One of the brighteſt young men that ever I knew, I may ſay, the delight of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; yea the pride of all gay company, who was the life, or as ſome ſay, the ſoul of every place he viſited; for his gaiety, humour, and wit—O! the Lord in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did not ſuffer him to remain in this way, but laid his hand upon him; and laid him upon a ſick bed, and when he was there, ſuch was the ſtate of this bright young man,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032807_0013_0FF528C15B5102F0"/>
that, when he was brought to ſee that he had not many days to continue in this ſtage, he required to ſee ſome whom he thought were Religious, and when he ſaw them, O! how his heart was tortured! and what were his expreſſions? why upon this wiſe, "I, (ſays he) have ſeen abundance; I know men and things, I have paſſed through and been at different Courts, I have taſted a great deal of what the world calls enjoyments in this earth; I have been educated in ſome religious principles; but I ſaw that they were too narrow for me, they confined me too much, there was not room and liberty enough for me; I read BOLINGBROKE, HUME, and PAINE, and I had almoſt encouraged myſelf therein. But now it has pleaſed the Lord to bring me upon this bed of ſickneſs; I know I have a Phyſician, but no medical aid can help me now, my friends." I went to him, I found him wet with tears; he told me his former companions neglected him; and he ſaid, if they had not neglected me, they would have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me no comfort; they would have been ſtings to my conſcience, and as daggers to my heart, becauſe I have been in their ſtate. Now, ſaid he, what would you have me do in this ſituation? O, ſaid he, I want to believe, but I have been ſo dark, and encouraged theſe principles ſo long, that I cannot believe as I ought to do. Well, this was truly a ſorrowful and affecting ſcene to me, and ſo it would have been to many if they had been preſent. The Lord, no doubt, is rich in mercy, and I truſt he viſited his ſoul, even the laſt few days of his life; and to him I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. I cannot ſay that infinite Love did not even at that late hour accept him. But O! my friends, let us, while we have ſtrength and liberty, let us with all our hearts apply them to thoſe things which will be ſomething to lean upon in ſuch an hour! For this indeed is the end of all Religion, talk of it as long as we may; ſo to live as not to be afraid to die; that we may ſo die when it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to ſeparate us from this body that we may live before him for ever!</p>

                  <head>The ſecond Diſcourſe of W. Savery.</head>
                  <p>There are certain obligations that are the ſame in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Countries; and I would not have you believe, my friends, that when I ſpoke of the outward and typical things, ſuch as waſhing, ſuch as abſtaining from blood and things ſtrangled, which are not obſerved in the preſent day by a large number of Chriſtians, that I meant to cenſure any part of the moral Law. No: I believe it never can be diſpenſed with; but the whole of thoſe things that the councils of Jeruſalem forbad, are forbidden in all nations as an eternal decree. I thought I might ſo far explain upon this head, as I do not know, my dear friends, when it may pleaſe the Lord to bring me with you again. I feel my heart bound in affection to many of the Citizens of London, I wiſh their everlaſting welfare; I ſeek not you, nor any thing that is yours to myſelf; but all men and my own ſoul alſo, to God; that we may with reverence of ſoul ſeek him if happily we may find him; that thoſe that are convinced by the light of Chriſt in their conſciences, of what their duty is to God, may, with child-like ſubmiſſion and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his holy will, conform to it in all things; for if it has pleaſed God to enlighten thee in any matter or thing, as ſoon as he is pleaſed to ſhew thee what thou oughteſt to do, and thou neglecteſt thy duty therein, then thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeſt condemnable before him; no man will be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that which God hath not ſhewn him; but I believe it is poſſible for men to neglect the means of obtaining the knowledge of the will of God. Not being ſerious enough, not ſeeking it in the way it is to be found. Not aſking wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of him who gives liberally to all men and upbraideth none. Our all is at ſtake. If I am an enthuſiaſt in theſe things, the Lord preſerve me an enthuſiaſt to the end of my days. I believe that the whole world, and all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that any can obtain, will be indeed as the ſmalleſt duſt in the balance againſt the ſalvation of the immortal foul: therefore it is that I am ſerious, and concerned for my
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032807_0015_0FF52944E80A07D0"/>
own ſoul and for thoſe of others. And I believe that if thoſe who are convinced of the ways of Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, if they with ſimplicity of ſoul acknowledge the truth, and live in the truth of the divine law, they will not only have a gladdening hope of a glorious immortality in the world to come; but they will alſo be favoured with an hundred fold of peace and joy in this life. I think I know it from ſome degree of experience, I never knew what true and real enjoyment was in the Lord's temporal bleſſings, till it pleaſed him to touch my heart and bring me to a ſenſe of my ſtate, and of obedience to him. I am firmly perſuaded that the way the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has caſt up for thoſe that will finally be heirs of his kingdom, is neither gloomy, nor improper for a reaſonable, ſenſible, dignify'd mind to walk in; there is liberty enough, there is room enough; we do not want to rob you of any thing; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did your Redeemer and Saviour, that was truly valuable even in the enjoyment of the preſent world, not of any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſing which God has granted; the true and ſolid enjoyment of them is found only by a truly religious mind. O! the glorious liberty there is in the truth as it is in <hi>Jeſus!</hi> What are all the opinions of men in compariſon of it? how trifling, how light, their ſenſeleſs contradictions; they are ever changing! There is, my friends, a glorious and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberty in the truth as it is in Jeſus, that I would to God all men might enjoy; that ſo his Church might once more put on her beautiful garments: that all thoſe uncharitable diſpoſitions which are harboured by ſome, though I hope in this enlightened day, not by a great many, may be removed; God is doing them away, ſeeking thus his own work; he is aboliſhing thoſe things which kept us ſo long at a diſtance ſecretly, and will bring them to nought; this is my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and more and more charity will prevail: let us cheriſh, let us with one accord be willing to live in it, and to die in it; then indeed ſhall we embrace one another as brethren. There will be no ſuch thing as hurting, or doing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an injury: the peaceable kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt our
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032807_0016_0FF528D96587CDA8"/>
Saviour, being eſtabliſhed and ſet up in the hearts of men, would put an end to WAR, and all the horrors append<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it in the world. O! that men might once more embrace one another as brethren, and enjoy the glorious liberty of children of one common family.</p>

                  <p>I hope it will not leſſen the Solemnity, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in this meeting, by expreſſing the deſire which attends my mind upon the behalf of viſited minds that are preſent; which is, that they may bear in remembrance the declaration of an experienced ſervant of Chriſt; that, that which is to be known of God, is manifeſted in man; for God hath ſhewed it unto him. Now this, according to my apprehenſion, points to the neceſſity of withdrawing our dependance from all inferiour objects, and waiting upon God, that we alſo may attain to the experience of being inſtructed by him. And the more we become inſtructed of him; the more we ſhall be guarded againſt thoſe, and looking after thoſe, againſt whom our bleſſed Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cautioned his viſited followers; when he declares that many would come in his name, calling their attention outward; "lo, (ſays he) I have told you before, many ſhould come in my name, and ſay, lo here is Chriſt: and others, lo there is Chriſt: but I ſay unto you, Go not forth after them." Here is doctrine, my friends, do not look <hi>out</hi> for that which is to be known <hi>within.</hi> "Go not forth after them;" for, (ſays he) "the kingdom of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you." Now here is a number preſent, I have no doubt, who are often addreſſing him in words, and repeating over and over again, "Thy kingdom come:"—But where are we, my dear friends, looking for his kingdom? Cannot you believe him who has thus declared, "The Kingdom of God is within you?" It conſiſts in the government of his Spirit. And therefore when ye ſay, "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done upon earth, as it is in heaven," are ye ſincerely
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032807_0017_0FF529580958FD78"/>
deſirous of having your minds and affections brought under the government of his holy Spirit? Do not you remember, when he was about to be taken away from his diſciples and followers, in the time of his outward appearance, where he ſays, "If I go not away the comforter will not come; but if I go away, I pray unto the Father, and he ſhall ſend another comforter, even the ſpirit of Truth. And when that ſpirit ſhall come, he ſhall reprove the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs and of judgment." Now this is what we wait for in our times of retirement, "When he the ſpirit of truth ſhall come, he ſhall bring all things that I have told you to your remembrance; and will lead you and guide you into all truth." Now my dear friends, look at theſe things, and bear them in remembrance in your hours of retirement, when ſeparated one from another. Do not look outward: remember that which is to be known of God is manifeſted in man: for there God will reveal it to you in his own way and in his own time. And let your obedience keep pace with your knowledge; for the kingdom of God conſiſts not in meats and drinks, and in outward ordinances, but in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; for the work of righteouſneſs is peace, and the effect of it will be at laſt quietneſs and aſſurance with God for ever.</p>

                  <p>THE preſent is an age of many uncommon events, and the curious obſerver will not be inattentive to what they tend; and indeed many are filled with conjectures where theſe things will end. It is a day alſo, wherein men of ſcience have been exceedingly curious in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches; they have brought up ſome new and before unheard of things to view: and probably ſome of them may be turned to advantage to their country, in ages to come, though they are not now altogether uſefully employed in the world.</p>
                  <p>But I have been thinking, my friends, of one Science worth them all; for if men were even to poſſeſs the power of counting all the luminaries of heaven, and to meaſure the magnitude of all the heavenly bodies, even of thoſe that lay beyond the reach of the preſent obſervers; if they knew all the hidden arcana of nature, what would it avail, if they were deſtitute of the knowledge of God and themſelves?</p>
                  <q>Know ye not your own ſelves<note place="bottom">2 Corinthians, xiii. 5.</note>?</q>
                  <p>So ſaid the Apoſtle. A great leſſon: One of a later time had this reflection upon it,
<q>"Man know thyſelf, enough for man to know."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I conceive, my friends, here is a wide field unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by many; and wherein I am convinced the richeſt treaſure is to be found; the moſt worthy of all knowledge; viz. the knowledge of God and ourſelves. Yea "to know Thee the only true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent, is life eternal." Jeſus the Son and Sent of GOD. Well, my friends, there is no doubt but that there are a number preſent, who at times have been employed in this moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and ſerious enquiry. But there are many men who can ſpend day after day, and year after year, in labour and ſearch almoſt indefatigable, without being weary, in things that concern only this ſhort and uncertain ſtate of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032807_0020_0FF52918E21A2210"/>
being; who are not patient enough, to devote the ſame time, the ſame attention, the ſame dedication of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and powers which God has given them to the moſt important and enriching of all ſciences.</p>
                  <p>And this is, my friends, what I have been lamenting both in my own country and in this. For I believe, as ſurely as the great Creator and Ruler of the univerſe has granted us powers and talents for the moſt glorious and dignified pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, ſo, I believe, that one day all men will be brought to an account of their ſtewardſhip. The infidel in time of health ſmiles at this! "But, (this I acknowledge) though men may live fools, yet fools they cannot die." Men, while they are diverting themſelves, in the paſſing enjoyments of the preſent life, however vain and little, and below the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their nature, may be ſo amuſed, and ſuffer them ſo to take up their faculties and powers, that they may never be in a capacity to think and feel ſufficiently after the moſt ſolid and important thing. Certainly, my friends, this is a cauſe of ſorrow to every thinking mind; and I know that it is, and ever muſt be, a cauſe of real affliction to every goſpel miniſter; who believes in the ſacred and unchangeable truths which have every confirmation, that reaſonable minds could dare to aſk, or that was neceſſary for the wiſe and beneficent GOD to give. (this is my faith) Thus miniſters, I am perſuaded, under every name, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtianity, muſt behold with ſorrow their fellow pilgrims travelling towards an endleſs eternity; involved in things below, and unfit for thoſe that they ought to be employed in, laying up a foundation againſt the time to come; that ſo they may lay hold of eternal Life. For I conceive there are very few, perhaps none at all, that could entertain a belief that they are not immortal.
<q>"If Man is not immortal, GOD'S unjuſt,"</q>
ſo ſaid one, a pious writer, "to ſend him in this world in the condition that we ſee him, even in his beſt eſtate." For verily, as ſaid one of the ancient Scripture
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032807_0021_0FF528C2F1CE7148"/>
writers, "Every man in his beſt eſtate is vanity," take him in whatſoever condition of life you may. Thoſe that are in the enjoyment of ſo much of this world's goods that they can compaſs every pleaſure (falſely ſo called) that the world and all its auxiliaries can give, know they no moments of ſadneſs? my perſuaſion is they have many. A man of <hi>pleaſure</hi> is a man of <hi>pain:</hi> this may appear a paradox, but it is no more than true. Thoſe that are lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, more than lovers of God, are in every condition of human life, men of pain. The infirmity of a man's body the ſpirit of a man can bear, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear? There are many who can ſupport with much fortitude and patience, lingering pain of body; they can meet death with ſome apparent degree of compoſure and fortitude, provided always that the ſting of death be drawn, not elſe; if a man is in his rational underſtanding. For the common infirmities of a man, the ſpirit of a man can bear; but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</p>
                  <p>Well, my friends, it is in great mercy that the Lord wounds us: it is not thou that woundeſt thyſelf. An houſe divided againſt itſelf can never ſtand. Doſt thou thine own ſelf condemn thyſelf? No: it is as clear as any axiom in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid; it cannot be, it is impoſſible; an houſe divided againſt itſelf can never ſtand. What is it that condemns, what is it that diſquiets, what is it that unſettles and confuſes the mind of thoſe that have been guilty of enormous crimes? What is it that cauſes the murderer to fly from country to country, and find no reſting place for the ſole of his feet; no bed ſoft enough for him to repoſe upon? I ſay it is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> What is CONSCIENCE? The voice of GOD, I ſay, in thy ſoul: this is conſcience.—The ſame voice that called to Adam, when he had tranſgreſſed the commandment of his Creator; "Adam, where art thou?" Adam was weak enough to conceive he could conceal himſelf from Him that had even made the earth, the ſea, and the fountains of waters! "Adam, where art thou?" Why be knew that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032807_0022_0FF528F99C82B8A8"/>
he had tranſgreſſed the command of God, and he was afraid: "I heard thy voice, and was afraid." Well, ſo may every ſinner, great or little; and know this is the cauſe of their fears: "I heard thy voice and was afraid." It is in vain, I conceive, for men to talk of the principles of their education; thoſe things are as women's tales; they are old as the creation of the world we live in; and will remain, I believe, until the firmament ſhall be diſſolved as with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat, and earth and all that are therein again diſſolve. This is my faith: and all the wiſe and all the good have borne teſtimony ſimilar to this; that have written, and that have ſpoken in the various ages of mankind; they have borne teſtimony to the Law of God written in their hearts. How futile, how weak for men to talk of diviſions and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſions in theſe things! to ſpeak of natural conſcience; and the ſame futility in their arguments, in their leſſons, and in thoſe convulſions that there are when we ſee the great, awful and tremendous works of God that appear in the earth; to ſay it is Nature!—</p>
                  <p>How futile, for men not to look up through nature to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's GOD, to confuſe and confound themſelves and one another. This is my faith, and I do not want you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it any further than it may coincide with the beſt light and knowledge which God in his mercy has granted you. I do not want you to pin your faith upon mine. No: we ſeek not man's ſilver, nor gold, nor applauſe, nor any thing that is their's: we call not the people together to amuſe them with fine words, and fine ſpeeches, but with that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthrophy which ever ought and ever muſt accompany the mind of a true goſpel miniſter; and will induce him (if he has really been benefited by the knowledge of GOD himſelf) to deſire with ardour of ſoul that all men may come to the ſame experience. I have reaſon to ſay, God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for me who was in darkneſs as thick as any of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, concerning God, and the things of God, ſwallowed up in inticing pleaſures, and vanities of this life,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032807_0023_0FF528A4B594F6F8"/>
as much as many of you, and perhaps moſt of you, and as far from the knowledge of that peace which paſſes all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon and underſtanding of men, as any could be. Thanks be to God, who is wiſe, who never leaves any of us in this ſtate, without compunction of ſoul, from ſeaſon to ſeaſon: who follows us in the night revels, who follows us into the halls of licentiouſneſs, who follows us in the midſt of our gay career with our companions, and wounds our moſt joyful ſcenes—this I am clear of: ſo that in the midſt of laughter I can freely acknowledge, I have been ſtill ſad —becauſe my heart was ſad. "I heard thy voice and was afraid."</p>
                  <p>Well, my friends, there is a great deal ſaid about religion in the world; men have (ſhall I ſay) hewn out a variety of ſyſtems, that have been ſtrong in their inventions, and various in the powers which God has given them, to reaſon upon, each one upon their own ſyſtem. It is not ſyſtems nor opinions—It is neither high church nor low church that I am ſpeaking about now. There is but one true and living church, the whole world over. Men may call themſelves what they pleaſe: the world calls me a <hi>Quaker</hi>—and thee a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> in another form—and thee a member of the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Church</hi>—But what is all this? My friends, theſe are names, they are diſtinctions amongſt men: but are they diſtinctions with God? Does he know <hi>high</hi> church, and <hi>low</hi> church? Does he deſcend to inquire whether thou art a <hi>methodiſt</hi> or a <hi>preſbyterian,</hi> thou a <hi>baptiſt,</hi> thou a <hi>roman catholic?</hi> No: But is thy <hi>heart</hi> right? Art thou ſincere in thy deſires to know him and to ſerve him? This is the great point: to know him, and to know thine ownſelf; the ſituation in which he has placed thee, who is the Author of thy being; the reaſon he has given to thee that <hi>Being,</hi> and the glory which he propoſes to crown it with, if thou wilt, with ſimplicity of heart, live in his counſel, and in his fear, and avoid thoſe things that are repugnant to God's purity, with
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032807_0024_0FF5293EA4892A28"/>
a pure and truly enlightened mind. Men have too long been toſſed about thoſe things, I am perſuaded of it; and a day, I am glad to hope, is ſpeedily advancing, when there ſhall be little heard of it in the world. The ſword of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is in a great meaſure (through the Lord's mercy) ſtaid; and yet there is room for it to be more cloſely ſheathed. I believe men are coming back to think for themſelves; to feel for themſelves as they ought to do; to inquire after the truth; not of leaders of ſects or parties, and of men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for to lead them in a certain way—but to inquire after it wiſely—independant one upon another—and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant only, in this point, upon God, the fountain of all wiſdom and knowledge. (This is my belief.)</p>
                  <p>So that, my friends, as I ſaid before, I am not come among you to gather you to <hi>my</hi> party; but that all men may become ſo inquiſitive for themſelves, that they may be joined to GOD and CHRIST in their part. For there are, I am perſuaded in my own experience, men that I have found both in this country and in my own country, (where all men are free to poſſeſs and believe whatever they pleaſe, as to opinions of religion) I ſay there are thoſe among the various profeſſors, whom I can embrace as children of one great and univerſal Parent, in the truth, as it is in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>So that it cannot be—it would be contrary to charity that I ſhould ſeem to be bigoted to any party upon earth; but I want that all men ſhould ſearch and ſee for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh unto you as he did in the primitive ages to the primitive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. He was known of the patriarchs; He was known of the prophets; He was known of the apoſtles; they knew that He was in them; they knew His power created all things; they knew He filled all things; "He is not far (ſays the learned Paul) from any of you, for in Him ye live, move, and have your being." But He perceived the learned Athenians, who were exceeding wiſe in their day, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that when he paſſed by their altar how dark they
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032807_0025_0FF528BE2C44BF98"/>
were in the moſt eſſential of all ſciences. "For (ſays he) I perceive that in all things ye are too ſuperſtitious:" for as I paſſed by your altar, I ſaw this inſcription upon it— "TO THE UNKNOWN GOD"—and "that God, whom ye ignorantly worſhip, declare I unto you." This was the buſineſs of the apoſtle amongſt both Jew and Gentile; they were not aſhamed to confeſs their opinion, yea even in the Athenian courts among the great philoſophers. Yea many philoſophers, even before the coming of Jeſus Chriſt in the world, declared to the ſame divine principle, that I believe would unite all men in the ground and bottom of one ſubſtantial ever-enduring felicity.—They declared (we may read divers of them)—they ſpoke of the Divinity that there was ONE that enlightened their minds to know good from evil, and that inſpired them to do things that were worthy of their dignity as men and immortals.—They frequently teſtified to that holy principle, which, after all, is the ground-work of all religion in every ſort of people; even in idolatrous nations. For JESUS CHRIST came not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to enlighten one, and no other part: He was "The Word that was in the beginning; that was with God, and that was God"—and that was afterwards made fleſh, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of the father, who could as eaſily have ſent him in that body to every corner of the world (we may readily ſuppoſe) and a thouſand times more ſo to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conceptions, for all things are eaſy to him as the Creator of the world, and all things that are therein. But I ſay he came to enlighten the world with a greater degree of light than ever was before—to bring light and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality more abundantly to life in the world. And a great and eſpecial favour I account it to be. And I believe the more we are acquainted with the Scriptures, the more we ſhall all be made to acknowledge, they are a ſpecial favour of God to mankind: containing, in the ſimplicity of their doctrine, the moſt deep and heavenly myſteries; and ſublime beyond all the writings of any philoſophers in the world, be they ever ſo great; or any that are called divines: yea,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032807_0026_0FF5292B008A7168"/>
they are ſimply, and virtually in their doctrines, truly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime beyond all the ſoaring opinions of men! I want the preſent generation therefore to read for themſelves. Search the Scriptures for yourſelves: let no man come unto you, and ſay, "I have ſtudied them for many years—I have ſeen them in many languages—and I can inſtruct you better than you can be otherwiſe inſtructed;" for depend upon it, they have ſome end to anſwer, let them come and ſay what they may. Becauſe the ſame eternal Spirit that gave all the myſteries that ever were revealed to mankind, to the prophets or the apoſtles, or any of the miniſters whatever, remains to be reſorted to this day, the ſame as in that day; and the ſame eternal Spirit muſt open the Scriptures that gave them: for nothing inferior to the power that gave the glorious and bleſſed doctrine of the New Teſtament, can reveal and open them to thy underſtanding and mine; not all the men of ſcience in the world, I am perſuaded: for we ſee it really and truly fulfilled, the Lord has confounded the wiſdom of the wiſe, and brought to nought the underſtanding of the prudent, when they have meddled with theſe things. One ſaying, this is the true interpretation; and another ſaying, that is the true interpretation; and another ſaying as it were, I am wiſer than thou. Oh, what confuſion has happened amongſt the poor profeſſors of Chriſtianity, wherever this has been the caſe! Now here are ſome with the Scriptures in their hands (and, indeed, there is one got over into my nation, where I live, that is leading the people by the ear, with the Scripture in his hand, endeavouring to prove things diametrically inconſiſtent with the very book that he holds forth!) My friends, how is it, or where ſhall we find TRUTH? I ſee the people are ſcattered exceedingly by it; ſome run for a ſeaſon after one man, and they ſay, "This is the man; and now (ſay they) I have found him; I never heard one before like this man:" and in a few months (they being unſtable as water) they are caſt another way:—and then another comes and ſays abundance of fine things, who is very learned and very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032807_0027_0FF529295F2ABAB0"/>
and they ſay, "This man is come to this place, we will go and hear him." Alas, alas! how this is deſcending from the dignity in which we were created, and from the reſource which God has granted; for "God is Light, and in him is no darkneſs at all;" he is the light of the world, and the life of men; the light that has enlightened, and will enlighten, every man and woman that cometh into the world." So that the prophets before the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, could ſay in confidence, beholding the glorious days in which we live, and which ſome of them deſired to ſee, for many prophets and righteous men have deſired to ſee one of theſe days which ye ſee, but could not; yet with an eye of faith they beheld it afar off: "Abraham ſaw my day (ſays Chriſt) and rejoiced:" Why, how could Abraham ſee his day, but through the inſhining of that glorious light which gave him to ſee the things which God, in the riches of his mercy and wiſdom, was deſigning to do in the earth? This is the ſpirit of prophecy.</p>
                  <p>Well, my friends, have we all received a meaſure of this light? "If any man ſays that he has not the ſpirit of Chriſt, then he is none of his. That which is to be known of God is manifeſted in man," ſays the apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>How plain, how ſimple are theſe doctrines! Is it any wonder that the prophets and the apoſtles, who were inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, ſhould ſpeak in this manner of the goſpel day: That we have no need that any man teach us—that "we have no need that any man ſhould ſay to his brother, or to his neighbour, know thou the Lord; for all men ſhall know HIM from the leaſt to the greateſt of them." For "I will write my law in their hearts, I will place it in their inward parts; they ſhall be my people, and I will be their GOD."</p>
                  <p>Now this is the doctrine, my friends, which the apoſtles preached—and it is the faith which we contend for. We have no new doctrine to preach unto the world, but the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032807_0028_0FF52882DBC563E8"/>
ſame that has paſſed the teſt of many ages, the ſame that the holy men of God continued to declare both before and after the apoſtles, and that has been confirmed throughout all the Scripture. This is the faith that the apoſtle ſpoke of, when he made mention what faith it was that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for. He ſaid he had no need to ſay, "who ſhall aſcend up into heaven, that is, to bring Chriſt down from thence, or who ſhall deſcend into the depth, that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead. The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: and this is the word of faith that we preach;" and no other word of faith can ever be preached conſiſtent with the goſpel of Chriſt; and this adhered to, my friends, would be ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all the contradictory differences that are in the world. They would be taught one and the ſame thing— it would put an end to all evil cenſuring one another. It would put an end to all perſecutions; to all prejudices one againſt another; to all boaſting one againſt another, as though I was more holy than thou; as if my ſyſtem was better than thine, and I was nearer the kingdom of heaven than thou art—all being taught of this divine, eternal, all-ſufficient WORD. The people would ſpeak the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: this I am perſuaded of. But while they remain to be in the manner that many are, ſaying, "I am for Paul, I am for Apollos, and I am for Cephas," and are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be gathered to be of Chriſt—for, as ſaid the apoſtle, "Was Paul crucified for you?—Is Chriſt divided?" Can there be any diviſions in his church? No; I conceive not. There can be no rents and ſchiſms; Chriſt and his church being united, they are one in him. And where they are one in him, a glorious and bleſſed unity will ſubſiſt, for "one is your maſter, and all ye are brethren."—Then there would be no contention for ſuperiority in the church: no ſuch thing; it would be impoſſible. For if any one of you would be the greateſt of all, let him become the ſervant of all. This would be the way to be great in the church of Chriſt. For it remains to be the ſame now that it was in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032807_0029_0FF5287DD28EABE0"/>
the days of Chriſt's fleſh; the way to be the greateſt is to be the moſt humble; to be the moſt virtuous; to be full of love and charity towards our fellow-creatures and our fellow-probationers. I ſay, this is the only true way to ſeek dignity in the Church. There would be no aſpiring after great places and employments in it. Though I have charity to believe that even ſome who have been called dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries of the Church (for indeed the Lord bears with many of our weakneſſes and infirmities) have been zealous and honeſt contenders for the Faith, as far as it pleaſed HIM to enlighten them. But I am confident of this in my mind, that the day is haſtening, wherein there will be one Shepherd, and one Sheepfold, the whole world over. For this is the true nature of the goſpel diſpenſation. But, oh, alas! what does it appear to be in this day?—How different from the primitive ſtate, when it was declared, that, "By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, <hi>if ye have love one to another."</hi> Well, look over Chriſtendom at this day: Does the Mahometan behold our light as it ſhines? When they take the Teſtament in their own hands, they are as wiſe to diſcern as we are; they are men of the ſame powers, and poſſeſs the ſame faculties to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare things as we do. Well, what would an honeſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan ſay? "Thou endeavoureſt to convert me to be a Chriſtian: but for what purpoſe? Are the Chriſtians wiſer—Are they better—Are they more virtuous than an honeſt Muſſulman? Give me an inſtance of it. Do they love one another better than the Mahometans?"</p>
                  <p>Well, my friends, do not be afraid of this inquiry, it is the way to truth; it is the way we muſt examine things; and, as I ſaid before, it is a day of inquiry: let us not be afraid of inquiry. Men have been afraid of bringing things to the teſt. But I believe it will not be ſufficient to think ſo long: and I invite you that are men of freedom, of independent minds, ſearch for the truth for yourſelves. Let no man lead you in thoſe things which God is ſufficient to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032807_0030_0FF5288D8DA506D8"/>
direct and lead you into himſelf, who is the Fountain of all wiſdom and knowledge; who has given thee powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to diſcern thy way, and to judge what he has called thee into exiſtence for; what is thy buſineſs in thy paſſing through the preſent tranſient ſtate of being, ſo that thou mayeſt inherit eternal life.</p>
                  <p>O Chriſtendom! thou oughteſt to be a light to enlighten the Heathen, and a glory; aye, the glory of GOD, to the ends of the earth! How they muſt look upon us! For even the Mahometans, having the New Teſtament in their hands, how muſt they ſtand amazed, when they come to compare theſe things with that our great Leader ſaid: "By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, becauſe ye love one another." And are there any people more at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord?—Are there any more at variance either in a private or in a publick national capacity?—O! how this has wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me!—bear with me, my friends, I do not wiſh to hurt any mind preſent by any means whatever. If thou thinkeſt not as I think, thou wilt not be judged by my conſcience; but by the light thou haſt received thyſelf. And if thine heart condemn thee not, then wilt thou have faith and hope towards God; and I condemn thee not neither: but while we are endeavouring to ſeek after truth, do not let us be afraid of coming to the knowledge of it.</p>
                  <p>But, my friends, let us ſee whereabouts we are—If the foundation of God ſtands where it uſed to be; whether <hi>we</hi> are really upon the ſame unchangeable foundation which the apoſtles were? And if we are, then we may be in the ſame glorious and holy confidence which they were; we may rejoice with a hope that will not fail us in the hour of death; and that we ſhall receive a crown of immortality, if we are building as they built; and if we are adhering to the ſame ground of faith which they did. Well then, ſome may ſay, they have examined theſe things. It will not do us any hurt to examine them over and over again. TRUTH is precious, and no matter how much time is ſpent
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032807_0031_0FF52892ACDD36D8"/>
in inveſtigating of it. For, ſure I am, if the goſpel ſpirit had been continued to this day, thouſands and ten thouſands that have fell in the field of battle would not have died in that way, and the carnage and devaſtation that deſolated ſo many parts of Europe would have been prevented. O the cry of the widows and the tender orphans in the ſeveral countries of Europe! Ought this to have been? Or would it ever have been, if men had kept to the principle which taught them not only to love their brethren, but to love their <hi>enemies;</hi> to do good to them that perſecuted them, and that deſpitefully uſed them; that ſo they might be the children of their heavenly Father, who cauſeth the rain to deſcend, and the ſun to ſhine, both upon the juſt and the unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>"Why (ſome may ſay) Do not talk of things impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Is it poſſible for a man to be brought into ſuch a condition as not to revenge injuries and inſults?" I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is; and that it is the diſpoſition that every Chriſtian ought to be brought into—not to revenge injuries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, but to bear them with patience.</p>
                  <p>Some may here ſay, "What wouldſt thou have us to be <hi>cowards?"</hi> No; but <hi>heroes</hi> in the LAMB'S army. And who is there that needs be aſhamed to be in the LAMB'S army, to gain the victory? It would be a thouſand times more magnanimous indeed to put up with little injuries, one with another, than to reſent them in anger; it ſhows a low and little mind to do that; great minds are above it. And the Chriſtian ſees a ſtate exalted far beyond this, and that we are even called to it, the very form of our prayer teſtifies: "If thou forgiveſt not thoſe that treſpaſs againſt thee, (our bleſſed Lord ſaid) neither will thy Father which is in heaven forgive thee." Theſe are ſolid and unſhaken Truths, that all the ſophiſtry of men will never be able to invalidate.—<hi>"Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us"</hi>—Who then can ſay this prayer, and ſtill continue in a ſpirit of revenge; and ſay to his brother, an eye
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032807_0032_0FF5296239297FC8"/>
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; thou haſt injured me, and I will injure thee? Well, then thoſe ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon what terms they lay their ſalvation; for the Lord is here preſcribing the very terms in his excellent prayer, "Forgive us our treſpaſſes, only as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us: this is the true meaning of the prayer. No further prayeſt thou when thou uſeſt the prayer given by our bleſſed Lord himſelf. But, my friends, though I do not want to enlarge a great deal, I want to ſee the peaceable ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of righteouſneſs exalted, both in this nation and in all the nations of the earth; and that the ſpirit of perſecution and deſtroying of one another might be entirely done away, by all being brought down into the meek ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and be, in ſome meaſure, as he was, when he was perſecuted even to death on the croſs. (O how meekly he bore it for our ſake!—And ſhall we not bear with one another? I truſt all will confeſs we ought to do.) He ſaid in the depth of his agony, "Father forgive them:" though he could have called down legions of Angels to thoſe corrupt and wicked men; yet he ſaid in meekneſs (which I believe many have partook of, in a meaſure, ſince this day) "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." And the next martyr, Stephen, when he was brought to the gates of the city, and was ſtoned to death, he followed his Lord in the ſame diſpoſition; he kneeled down when in the midſt of them, and ſaid, "Lord lay not this ſin to their charge." Having lifted up his eyes to heaven, and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his Saviour to receive his ſoul, he at laſt ſaid, "Lord lay not this ſin to their charge:" and ſo ſaying, he fell aſleep in the arms, no doubt, of his glorious Lord and Maſter, whom he followed even to death.</p>
                  <p>Now, my friends, there is no new law; there is no new diſpenſation. Many of the martyrs were of the ſame faith, which they had attained through God's mercy, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Spirit upon theirs; and the ſame diſpoſition of mind alſo. So that when they were led forth in the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032807_0033_0FF5288F256516F0"/>
days of perſecution, which the church was perſecuted with, O how meek did ſome of them deliver up their ſouls to God, and their bodies into the hands of their wretched perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors! There were ſome hundreds of them fell a ſacrifice for their faith and belief in God. How pious, how calm did they go out of the world! Not reviling becauſe they were reviled: By no means. Not giving abuſe for abuſe, but contrariwiſe, bleſſing their perſecutors. This was the condition of thoſe, knowing (as the apoſtle ſaid) they were thereunto called, that they might alſo inherit a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Well, my friends, theſe are ſo many monuments of God's adorable mercy and power: and the ſame God reigneth over all in this day; and he is as able to ſupport us in the faith once delivered to the Saints, as he was in that day: and I truſt thoſe that are earneſtly concerned to inquire after it, will know it to their comfort, without the aid or aſſiſtance of any man whatever. GOD is as ſufficient for theſe things now as he was in all the generations that are paſt. It only wants application of mind—Serious ſolemn meditation, and contemplation upon the things of God; then all would know the Truth, and abiding in it, they would all be made preachers of Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs in their ſeveral ſituations in the world. Aye, one of thoſe that was perſecuted, when ſhe was brought before her perſecutors to anſwer for her faith, was nevertheleſs furniſhed with that wiſdom which confounded the wiſdom of the wiſe that was amongſt her perſecutors; ſo that they thought ſhe had anſwered wiſer than them all. And a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little maid, when many were brought forth to the ſtake, was brought before her perſecutors, they ſaid to her, "And what can you ſay, my little maid, for your faith?" Why, ſaid ſhe, "I am not able to contend for CHRIST; but I am able to do more: I am able to ſuffer for Chriſt." Now, my friends, I am perſuaded this would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all of us; by inward, ſolid, reverent inquiry after
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032807_0034_0FF529704016DF78"/>
it. Then you would not be aſtoniſhed to ſee people ſit down in ſilence, either in their own houſes, or in the Aſſembly of God's people; ſo that God would condeſcend to be with them, and enlighten their minds. For "if any man lack wiſdom, let him aſk of God, who giveth liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth none." O may the God of all mercy, wiſdom, and power, haſten this day; enlarge the love of profeſſors of Chriſtianity one towards another: throw down all the walls of oppoſition, which were built up in the day of departure from the fountain of living water; and bring us again to drink at Shiloh's ſtream; that all the heritage may drink at the fountain itſelf; and the world once more rejoice in knowing him to reign and to rule over all; whoſe right it is, and ever will remain.</p>

                  <head>The Prayer before the Sermon.</head>
                  <p>O THOU great adorable Being, who art exalted in Goodneſs, and Majeſty, and in Power, beyond all finite comprehenſion, who dwelleſt in the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto none can approach thee, but as thou art pleaſed in thine adorable mercy to open an acceſs to us; and though Heaven is thy Throne, O God, and Earth is thy footſtool, yet we remember that thou haſt promiſed that thou wilt condeſcend to look down upon the poor, and upon the contrite, and thoſe that tremble at thy word.</p>
                  <p>O Thou, unſearchable in holineſs, and glorious in power, we pray thee to look down upon the preſent congregation this evening, with an eye of compaſſion and divine pity. Thou beholdeſt all men whereſoever they are ſcattered upon the face of the whole earth, with an equal eye of mercy, and thou heareſt the prayers of all thoſe who draw nigh unto thee with ſincerity. Be pleaſed, O God, to cauſe thy animating preſence to be with us, to bring the minds of all the people into an holy ſolemnity before thee. We know, O God, that no man can promote thy glorious Cauſe of Truth and Righteouſneſs in the earth, but as thou art pleaſed to be with him, and to furniſh him with the neceſſary qualifications for the great and important work whereunto thou art calling thy ſervants and miniſters. O bleſſed Father, forſake them not, but be pleaſed, as in generations that are paſt, to pour forth thy Spirit upon thy miniſters, that, in that wiſdom which thou art pleaſed to grant from ſeaſon to ſeaſon, they may go forth in thy name, with the Word of Reconciliation and Faith.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, Thou haſt many ſouls that are wandering up and down this great and populous country, who are ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after thy glorious and bleſſed reſt, which thou alone canſt lead them into the enjoyment of. We humbly and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032807_0037_0FF5296473158B90"/>
reverently pray thee, O God, to draw the minds of the people more and more off from thy miniſters to thyſelf. O gracious God, unſeal the fountain whereat thy prophets, thy apoſtles, thy ſervants, in all generations, have ſo freely drank and been filled. Cauſe thoſe that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs to be more and more filled at thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful table; that ſo, Father, there may be among all ranks of the people more of the knowledge of thee, and more of an increaſe in following after thee in the way to everlaſting reſt.</p>
                  <p>O God, thou ſeeſt how weak we are; how ſurrounded with infirmities, how blinded with prejudices, how turned aſide by a variety of fluctuating opinions; cauſe, we pray thee, thy holy uniting Word to be read more and more in the hearts of the people. Sound the alarm, we pray thee, yet louder and louder to them that are at eaſe and forgetful of thee: that ſo, Father, there may be many more brought to drink at the fountain of thy Goodneſs and Mercy, and with reverence of ſoul to acknowledge that thou art good, and worthy to be worſhipped here, and to be obeyed and ſerved by all the workmanſhip of thy hands. O gracious Father, proclaim a ſign in this aſſembly, while with one accord, in humility of ſoul, which thou haſt granted us, we may draw nigh unto thee, and offer up at this time for all thy former mercies, and for thy preſent mercies; and gather us together in this manner, O Father, aſcribing unto thee glory and honour, thankſgiving and praiſe, which are thy due, both now and for evermore.</p>

                  <p>THERE are ſome weighty and intereſting expreſſions which we find in the Revelation of John<note n="*" place="bottom">Revelations xiv. 7, 8.</note>, that appear to be my duty, ſince I laſt took my ſeat, to mention in this aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And I (John) ſaw another angel fly in the midſt of heaven, having the everlaſting goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>"Fear GOD</hi> and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come; and worſhip Him that made heaven and earth, and the ſea, and the fountains of waters.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now John, we find, calls this <hi>the everlaſting goſpel;</hi> which ſeems to be compriſed in a very ſhort and compendious manner; which no man in all this congregation, I truſt, can be at a loſs to underſtand. And though, my friends, we may he ſomething various in our opinions concerning modes, manner and forms of worſhip, yet I believe there are very few of God's rational creation any where, either amongſt thoſe who are profeſſing the name of Jeſus Chriſt, or thoſe that have not been favoured to be acquainted with the goſpel as we are, but are ſenſible that To God belongs glory, honour, and worſhip; who behold him as the great and univerſal parent, the glorious, bleſſed and all-wiſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect of the univerſe, and all things that are therein, and that ſuſtains all things by the word of his invincible power; for the ſame almighty creating word that brought all things into the glorious order in which we ſee them, that ſaid, let there be light, and there was light—No man can diſpute but he at his pleaſure alſo could again ſay, let there be darkneſs, and there would have been darkneſs: Again, let the heavenly luminaries depart from their appointed ſpheres,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032807_0039_0FF52890BB4DF9F0"/>
and let all things reſort to their primitive reſt, and it would undoubtedly have been done. So that he is not only the cauſe of all things, but the gracious ſupporter, daily and hourly ſuſtainer of all that he has made, without whoſe bleſſed providence there is not an ear of corn or blade of graſs could poſſibly be produced. So that, my friends, a daily dependance upon that GOD who created us— all his creation calls for, and with every ſolid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting mind it will naturally produce, an offering of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, adoration, and praiſe; and I am glad in believing, my friends, that here are in this large multitude a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number who worſhip GOD in ſpirit and in truth; though differently educated, and of various opinions in things of little importance, but in the great, important, and eſſential point of every man's duty, ſpeak the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and I believe, my friends, this is the caſe both with the nations that are called <hi>refined,</hi> and with thoſe that are termed <hi>barbarians.</hi> GOD has placed his law in the hearts of all men; he has written there the great and eſſential duty which he requires at our hands, and under every name and in every nation <hi>"they that fear God and work righteouſneſs</hi> (ſo ſaid the apoſtle) <hi>are accepted of him."</hi> So that, my friends, he makes no ſuch diſtinctions as many of us poor, finite and weak creatures are apt to make; he does not confine acceptable worſhip to this nation, to this particular ſect or opinion, nor to this particular Iſland: but I believe there are prayers aſcend to him as ſweet incenſe before his Holy Altar, both in the wilderneſs of America, and in the dark abodes of Africa, and in all the corners of the earth, wherever there are ſincere and upright ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Well, my friends, this muſt certainly ariſe from ſome extenſively and univerſally diffuſed principle in the ſouls of men, that with one common conſent they agree in the great fundamentals of all Religion; this muſt be ſomething more —even the infidel, if he conſiders, muſt allow it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more—than human policy. Well, what is it then?
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032807_0040_0FF528B16AD220B0"/>
What is it that prepareth the heart thus acceptably to offer unto GOD!—What is it that teacheth all men that HE ought to be worſhipped? Why, it is nothing more, nor any thing leſs than the ſame eternal all-creating word, who fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all things, and is as intimately near to and independent of us as the very air we breathe; "for, (ſaid the apoſtle) He is not far off any one of you; neither can he be; for in him we live, move, and have our being." Therefore it was that he exhorted them to <hi>"ſeek the Lord, if haply they might find him."</hi> Well, my friends, this is the great buſineſs of every Goſpel miniſter; to labour to bring people here—to ſeek for themſelves; to ſeek the Lord, if haply they may find HIM—Who is not far off any one of you; who is both with you, and in you, and without whoſe animating power thou couldſt not exiſt one moment; neither could any man think a good thought or do a good action, except the Lord be with him. This is my faith. So that, my friends, it has taught me to get rid of all thoſe narrow diſtinctions which many have been making, and which ſome are yet induſtriouſly endeavouring to build up between even the followers of the bleſſed Jeſus; who ought always to be unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed —always in harmony—always ONE, IN HIM. But, for my own part, having now for a number of years endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſeek the Lord impartially for myſelf, I have known him in this way; I have learned the Goſpel in this way. For I have been clear in my opinion that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and works of men, by their fallen wiſdom, have only ſcattered the ſpiritual ſheep in Jacob and divided them in Iſrael; and have ſplit the chriſtian church into ſo great a variety of names, and ſo great a variety of forms. For indeed we find many of them are rooted in prejudice one againſt another, Therefore the inquiry of this day ſeems to be, not ſo much, is it THE TRUTH that theſe men hold; but is he of <hi>my</hi> name?—or what <hi>name</hi> does he hold? this ſeems to be the fooliſh inquiry of many who can accept little or nothing except it comes from thoſe who are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the ſame opinion, and within the bounds which
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032807_0041_0FF5289E68616AE8"/>
                     <hi>they</hi> have built, and called after their own name among men. But, my friends, my belief is, that the Lord is ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the earth to put an end to theſe diviſions and diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his church; to bring down all thoſe who have been exalted in their imaginations in ſuppoſing that they <hi>only</hi> were the people of GOD, in <hi>their form</hi> and in <hi>their manner,</hi> and reject all others.</p>
                  <p>O! how far off from that benevolence of ſoul which the chriſtian religion inſpires, appears faith of this kind!— And yet there are ſome remaining even in this enlightened day, who ſuppoſe and believe that without the pale of their particular church there can no man be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>But whence come theſe opinions? why I believe the Lord originally ſowed good feed in his church, but while men have ſlept in carnal eaſe and ſecurity, an enemy has entered, ſcattered and divided them; and ſown tares among them. Now, for my own part, it appears to me to be the great work of every diligent ſhepſherd of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to labour to bring all men back to the foundation— to the one true and overlaſting fold. To remove all thoſe opinions that have kept the world at variance ſo long—even in thoſe that have loved God with ſincerity of heart in their different profeſſions among chriſtians. O! how ſhy they have been of one another—how afraid of coming into the company of one another—how they have ſhunned one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! Aye, my friends, can this be agreeable to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dignified goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt that we profeſs? No: I truſt no man will believe it can. Well then, the <hi>great</hi> inquiry ought to be, is there not one univerſal guide —one holy, divine, and unchangeable principle, by which we may all again be gathered into unity? Is there no ſuch thing as TRUTH in the earth? I believe there is; and that all men may find it too, who are ſtudiouſly deſirous ſo to do —who prefer the knowledge of the truth to all things elſe— who are making every ſecondary conſideration give way to their obtaining it; and when they have found it, to live in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032807_0042_0FF528B305E46088"/>
obedience to it. This is the ſincere heart's enquiry among all the various names; that GOD will be pleaſed to teach them the way of TRUTH, and eſtabliſh them in it. So that they ſhall all ſpeak the fame language, that there may be no diverſity of opinion in the ground and foundation of their belief. For this holy principle is <hi>one</hi>—it teaches plain, ſimple, and eaſy doctrine; compriſed within a narrow compaſs, it does not confound and confuſe the world with variety of myſtical opinions, which are hard, or which if is impoſſible to comprehend. But the TRUTH upon which glory, immortality, and eternal life depend, is plain, free, and ſimple: <hi>"To know</hi> THEE <hi>the only true God, and</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>whom thou haſt ſent, is life eternal."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, my friends, how ſhall we know this?—where ſhall we find it?—how ſhall we be aſſured that we are really in this knowledge—and in this faith? why, I think, if men—I ſpeak now in much charity, for I do not boaſt of my own attainments, but what I feel and believe to be true from my own experience, and which appears to me to be conſiſtent with the doctrines both of the Old and New Teſtament, that I am not aſhamed to declare, though it were to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands; for I ſay from the very beginning there was an ETERNAL PRINCIPLE—there was an holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flattering and unchangeable GUIDE placed in the ſouls of men, which if they had attended to, all men would have been led ſafe. "It is ſhewn to thee, (ſays the prophet) O man, what thou ſhouldſt do, and what the Lord thy God requireth at thy hands; to do juſtice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God."—It is ſhewn to thee what is good.—Theſe are the forcible expreſſions—to "DO JUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICE, to LOVE MARCY, to WALK HUMBLY WITH THE GOD."</p>
                  <p>And here I believe is the ground work and foundation of all religion. Can any man ſay it is not ſhewn to him, without the aſſiſtance of miniſters, or any human learning, without the aſſiſtance of men learned in the ſchools, men of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032807_0043_0FF528D1DED9E360"/>
ſcience, men of many languages, or men of profound edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation —we can attain the knowledge of theſe ſaving truths, which are ſo eſſential for us to know, believe and practiſe? So that no man has any occaſion, by any means whatever, to go inquire of his neighbour, or of his brother, concerning theſe things. So that, my friends, though indeed we have invited you here, and are glad of your company to ſit down in this manner, we ſeek not any thing that is yours, but <hi>you</hi> only; to GOD, not to ourſelves—not to this and that opinion; but that all men may come to the divine, eternal, and unchangeable <hi>principle</hi> in <hi>themſelves,</hi> that would teach us in all things, the ſame that is ſpoken of in a variety of paſſages in Scripture; and yet in this day ſo much neglected; the ſame that our Saviour promiſed ſhould be with his followers to the end of the world; even his own eternal Spirit, the Spirit of GOD and of CHRIST. This is the Ruler, the Director, the glorious and bleſſed Regulator of all things. Without it the Scriptures could never have been given. Becauſe by it all the men of God were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to behold the light God had granted them concerning the things thereof; and by it all men are enlightened, more or leſs. For JESUS CHRIST is "the true LIGHT that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth," not only thoſe that have read the hiſtory of his life, death, and ſufferings; his glorious and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled Miracles and divine doctrines; but alſo thoſe that have never heard of the name of CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>So enlarged is my opinion concerning the equality of God's ways. And the Scripture amply and fully juſtifies this opinion; for Chriſt is called, not only the <hi>light</hi> of his own followers who believed on him, but the <hi>true</hi> "light, that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world;" be they of what name, of what diſtinction, or nation they may. And this <hi>light,</hi> (ſays the Evangeliſt John) is come into the world: But the reaſon why men continue under condemnation is this, (ſays he) <hi>"light</hi> is come into the world, but men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032807_0044_0FF52915A1B2EC30"/>
their deeds are evil:" they are not willing to bring their deeds to this glorious touch-ſtone, this teſt that would try all manner of actions—Chriſt IN you, the hope of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory; in which the primitive believers were ſettled, and found here their reſt.</p>
                  <p>Here, from the beginning, the Church of Chriſt was built; upon this Holy of Holies, and everlaſting word of Chriſt and of God; ſpeaking, directing, teaching, and leading them, whereſoever they ſhould go. And if men had abode under this, it would have taught them all the ſame thing; it would have preſerved thoſe that have called themſelves Chriſtians, as well as all other men, in harmony and unity. It could have made neither rents nor diviſions. No; no ſuch thing: It would not have told thee one thing, and me another. By no means. But this is the language it would have proclaimed in thy heart and in mine, that "The work of Righteouſneſs is peace, and the effect thereof is quietneſs and aſſurance for ever." Now is not this written upon every man's conſcience? Yes, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it is. And I have heard the wild inhabitants of America declare this was <hi>the truth;</hi> and they found it inſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their hearts (according to their own expreſſions) by the finger of God's ſpirit himſelf, namely, that the work of Righteouſneſs is peace, and the way to be happy in this preſent life, and to be eternally happy in the world to come, is, to obey his voice; to work Righteouſneſs; to be upright in heart; to do thoſe things which, by his law written in them, he had made known to them they ought to do: and this divine principle I want more to come unto. But men have been too long bewildered in following one another in darkneſs and confuſion: this is my faith, and I believe no man among us can ſay but this is the caſe.</p>
                  <p>We muſt (if ever we are brought back) come to the foundation and corner-ſtone whereon the firſt Church was built. We muſt go to Chriſt; we muſt leave our depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon man, and come to the <hi>Fountain.</hi> For the ſame
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032807_0045_0FF52881424705E8"/>
declaration may indeed be put to thee, and the expreſſion will hold good with reſpect to far too many in this day, that was expreſſed concerning the Jews,—"My people have committed two great evils, they have forſaken me the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living waters, and they have hewn out to themſelves broken ciſterns that can hold no water." Well, my friends, I am aſſured that many of you aſſent to this, that of all the ſyſtems and inventions of men, be they ever ſo ſpecious, or maintained with ever ſo much pomp or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, theſe do not nor cannot bring one ſoul to Chriſt. It muſt be ſomething beyond all the powers of men; it muſt be by his own eternal power, if ever we are brought to experience the glorious and bleſſed reſt prepared for thoſe that love him. For no man can come to the Father but by Chriſt; and "no man (ſaid he) can come to me except my Father draw him." If Noah, Job, and Daniel were here, they could ſave neither ſon nor daughter's life; they could only, through God's grace, and attention to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking word, be inſtrumental to ſave their own ſouls.</p>
                  <p>For no man can either do the work for another, or by any means direct him after ſafety, but this holy, internal, unchangeable guide alone. Are there any perſons preſent who ſay, "this is ſtrange doctrine?" Well, my friends, if it is ſtrange doctrine, it has this to recommend it at leaſt, that it is not <hi>new;</hi> it is as old as the Apoſtles days, and as old as the Prophets days, in former diſpenſations. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve life and immortality were in a more marvellous manner brought to light by the revelation of God, through Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore we need go no further back than the New Teſtament; for by the doctrine therein contained, we hope and believe we are to be ſaved. Is not this the caſe? Yes, I believe it is. Well then, my friends, let us ſee whether we live up to this doctrine. Let us ſee whether we really are what the primitive churches were. Let us find whether our belief is rightly founded, or whether we depend merely upon hear-ſay. 'Tis not upon the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032807_0046_0FF5287FA8049930"/>
                     <hi>hear-ſay</hi> opinions of men; 'tis not from the works of the learned, nor from the ſpeeches of eloquence, but upon ſomething that we feel within. For I believe this muſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be the caſe, if ever we are prepared to join the hoſt of heaven, the redeemed and ſaved of God. We muſt know the truth in ourſelves. Chriſt is the way, the truth, and the life; and he told us this before he left the world. He told us plainly that he that is with you ſhall be in you. Is there any doctrine more clear than this. "He that is with you ſhall be in you: and lo I am with you to the end of the world. And if I go away, I will pray the Father, and he ſhall ſend another comforter:" that is, in another form, He ſhall ſend the Spirit of Truth, who ſhall lead and guide you into all truth. Well, here is a ſafe direction, and an unchangeable directory too. He ſhall ſend you another comforter, even the ſpirit of truth; who ſhall lead and guide you into all truth; who ſhall take from me, and ſhew it to you, and ſhall bring all things to your remembrance. Can there be any plainer doctrine than this? I believe many of you, my friends, aſſent to the truth of this, and that this is the way in which we ought to inquire after the Truth as it is in Jeſus; we ought to come to Him himſelf: we ought to retire to that holy uniting Word which we have received: (for as ſaid the Apoſtle) ye have no need that any man teach you. Why then are there ſo many teachers in the world; and maintained at ſo vaſt an expenſe? Why do ſo many take ſo much pains to qualify themſelves to be teachers of the flock of Chriſt, if this is really the caſe? And I truſt, my friends, you will be candid enough to ſay, Certainly it is. You have no need that any man teach you, but as this ſame uniting Word teaches you, which is truth. I truſt I am ſurrounded with many tender hearts, and many charitable Chriſtians, who have been ſeeking the truth for many years; why then, my friends, you muſt come to this divine teacher before ever you can be favoured with the knowledge of the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="unknown:032807_0047_0FF528E2E686C330"/>I verily believe no man will ever come to the knowledge of the truth in any other way. Thou may'ſt explore volumes after volumes, and ſpend much time in reading of many pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous books, and experiences of many favourite men of God. I do not deſpiſe inferior helps. The Scriptures are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent: they are much more ſo, and worthier to be held in greater eſtimation than all the books in the world. But the Scriptures point only to that holy all-powerful Word which indeed gave all the Scripture. The whole tenor of the Goſpel doctrine is to bring men there—to ſettle them upon that foundation; where they may build with ſafety— to the teachings of the holy and bleſſed ſpirit of God within them. I know this is a doctrine too much exploded. How unjuſt! how derogatory to the goodneſs and mercy of God, to ſend thouſands and millions of thouſands into this world, with powers and faculties to conceive that there is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and to believe that there are glorious rewards in the world to come, if he had left us no other guide to go by.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome will ſay, "We have the Scriptures to go by." Do we not ſee enough of this? Truly the Scriptures do direct us to this glorious principle within us, yet how do men turn them to every purpoſe! one learned man ſtarts up in one quarter of the nation, and he ſays, "here is a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, and I aſſure you it means ſo and ſo;"— and another declares with equal learning, with a great deal of ſtudy, and with abundance of eloquence, "my friends, it is ſo and ſo, this way you muſt believe:" and there is one even gone over to the country of my nativity, who with the New Teſtament in his hands, is laying the axe by his arguments as much as is in his power to the very root of the Chriſtian Religion. This is my faith, that he is deſtroying the foundation whereon it is built, and yet pretending to bring his doctrine from the Scripture. But what will not ſophiſtry do?—What has it not done?—O! the evils it has produced in the world.

nor any other, will ever be able to ſap that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which God has laid in Sion, nor to rob you or my own ſoul of that glorious hope and bleſſed conſolation in the redemption and mediation of our dear Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,—God forbid it ſhould: and I truſt it will not. —The Lord will by his own light and power diſpel every cloud and darkneſs that ſhall ariſe to caſt up a miſt before the eyes of the profeſſors of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>But to return. I want you, my friends, it is my moſt earneſt labour whereſoever it may pleaſe God to take me, throughout his vineyard, to get people if poſſible to build upon a foundation that thoſe various opinions of men will not be able to ſhake. I know that there is a foundation where all thoſe various and contradictory opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men may butt againſt the honeſt and ſincere-hearted pilgrim's dwelling, and not be able to ſhake it. This I am perſuaded of. Verily there is a Reſt for the people of God; there is ſomething whereon we may build ſafe; that is, in Chriſt: "CHRIST IN YOU the hope of glory." O! that you may ſeek to him! God is no reſpecter of perſons: He will teach all men himſelf; he will manifeſt his mercy equally to all men: he rejects none: he makes none of the diſtinctions of high and low, rich and poor, that we poor weak beings do. No: he is equal in his ways and juſt in all his doings: and thoſe that come to him he will in no wiſe caſt out. For "there is no difference (ſays the Apoſtle) between the Jew and Greek; for one God over all, is rich unto all that come unto him;" rich to all that ſeek him; and ſo he remains to be.</p>
                  <p>O my friends, were you to adhere to theſe plain and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple truths, it would prevent a great deal of confuſion in the world; it would bring about a different face and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance among the profeſſors of chriſtianity, from what we now behold in Europe; it would put an end to all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions; it would put an end to all envying one another; to all falſe, to all evil ſpeaking, and even evil thinking
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032807_0049_0FF528EFD20071B8"/>
one of another. This I am confident of, if it was adhered to. For Chriſt and his glorious diſpenſation, is not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of ſtrife and diſpute: for when he came, there was even uttered by the Songs of Angels, <hi>"Peace on Earth, and Good-will to Men."</hi> And he declared that, "By this ſhould all men know that ye are my diſciples—if ye love one another." And ſo we may as reaſonably conclude, that by this ſhall all men know that ye are not Chriſt's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ye if hate, devour, and deſtroy one another. It is as clear to me as the Sun that ſhines in the firmament. He was the Prince of Peace; of whoſe Government the Prophet Iſaiah declares there never ſhould be an end. O my fellow Chriſtians, let us with all our ſouls draw nigh unto, and ſeek for his holy power to influence our hearts; that he may bring us into the bond of chriſtian charity, and of holy and bleſſed union one with another; that He may deſtroy all that ſeeks to blow up nations and kingdoms into confuſion—and that ſeeks to bring diſtreſs upon individuals, nations and countries! Do not we behold the ravages of WAR? what has it done even in this nation, where the ſound of WAR has only been heard, how many weeping widows? how many tender parents has it lately deprived of their ſupport. It never would have been ſo, I am perſuaded, if the profeſſors of chriſtianity had kept to their firſt principle. No man can believe it, I think, with the Bible in his hand: which forbids in our Lord's expreſs words our ſaying in this glorious day, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." Yet alas! Is it not the language too much uſed among us?—"Thou haſt injured me and therefore I will injure thee:—thou haſt ſpoken evil of me and I will ſpeak evil alſo of thee." But ought it to be ſo? —Ought we not rather to ſuffer injuries, as the primitive believers did, without murmuring; without complaining? They received them all with meekneſs, as their holy and bleſſed Redeemer did before them; who even when he was about to quit the body by the hands of cruel men, did not he ſet us a glorious example, even towards his laſt moments, "Father, forgive them, ſays he, for they know not what
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032807_0050_0FF529483822AAA0"/>
they do!" He that had power to call legions of angels at his command, meekly in this manner addreſſed his father."</p>
                  <p>"Well: (but ſome may ſay) Is it really poſſible to come into this ſpirit of forgiving of injuries—to bear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, without even returning and retorting again?" Why yes: I verily believe the Goſpel Spirit would lead us into all this. "Why then, (ſome may ſay) Wouldſt thou have men to be cowards?" No, by no means. Cowards where they ought to be cowards, to be ſure—afraid to do evil; but magnanimous heroes, under the ſervice and in the ſervice of the glorious King, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! Becauſe the LAMB and his followers will finally obtain the victory. O then, my friends, let us with one accord add to our faith, works. It is a glorious and bleſſed faith: But if thou add not to thy faith, works, is there a probability that thou wilt reap the glorious reward? O what is it that our bleſſed Lord pronounced to thoſe that diſtinguiſhed themſelves with works of mercy, with works of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and works of peace, who lived in the peace of his divine and holy religion, which he had given them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, "Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you before the foundation of the world. I was ſick, and in priſon, and ye viſited me. I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ye fed me. I was naked, and ye clothed me. I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in, to comfort me. Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world."</p>
                  <p>Now it is this kingdom that I want you, my friends, all to inherit. To be ſo prepared againſt the awful ſummons, which is approaching to us all, that we may look forward without diſmay; that we may be favoured with that hope, which will be as an anchor to the ſoul, both ſure and ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, for whatever we may have promiſed to ourſelves, in a moment that thou knoweſt not, "the Son of man cometh;" thy days here may be few; <hi>"duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return!"</hi>

                  <head>The Second Diſcourſe of W. Savery.</head>
                  <p>MY Religion teaches me this—and it is the grand ruling and fundamental point upon which I deſire to reſt my ſalvation: that is, to endeavour to have <hi>"a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence, both towards God and Man."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire not to offend any of my fellow-travellers in the way to the kingdom; far be it from me. I know that there is great indulgence neceſſary one towards another. We have been variouſly educated, we have had various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices in our minds, and nothing but the divine illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power can make them ſubſide ſo as we might have charity one towards another. I believe there are ſome of the Lord's true Church in every name and among every nation; and that there are not only theſe who are profeſſing the ſame faith with me, and who worſhip God in ſilence as I do, but alſo in other profeſſions there are thoſe who in ſincerity of ſoul offer up their prayers to God. This I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to believe wherever I may be.</p>
                  <p>I am here in this Iſland at preſent: but am going to the continent of Europe. I ſeek not my own, the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; nor the applauſe of men, nor any thing that they can give; but a quiet and peaceful conſcience: and that I may be made in ſome ſmall degree inſtrumental to induce ſome to enter into that holy bond of everlaſting union and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which ſhall go with us beyond the grave. This is the great and moſt important work that I have now to do among you—aye, it is all—and for which I have left my peaceful home, and my endeared connections—that ſo if poſſible I might be an inſtrument of uniting my fellow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. O! then, that we may look upon one another with that charity which ever ought to diſtinguiſh all the followers of Chriſt: for I believe there may be followers of HIM in many forms that I have not particularly heard of at preſent. But through the divine mercy I believe I have found him who was typified by all the types and figures
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032807_0052_0FF52946A3D86440"/>
that went before HIM, Jeſus Chriſt, the Son and Sent of God: and that all men may find him to their comfort here, their peace, their ſettlement of mind, and their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting rejoicing in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Seek him then my friends impartially: enter into your cloſets: do as the noble Bereans did, when they heard the doctrine which the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt delivered to them, they ſearched the Scriptures diligently to ſee whether theſe things were ſo; and the apoſtle ſaid "theſe were more noble than thoſe of Theſſalonica, becauſe when they heard the truths of the Goſpel they ſearched diligently;" they did not let them paſs by unnoticed, as it were in at one ear and out of the other, but ſearched diligently to ſee whether theſe things were ſo.</p>
                  <p>I believe that if this were the caſe with ſome that are now preſent, they would indeed be made wiſer than ſome of their teachers: though I believe I have fellow-labourers in the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, among the various profeſſors, under every chriſtian name, yet I believe, and with all the charity I can attain, that there are far too many who have entered into Chriſt's church with ſiniſter views; that are making it a living and a competency for ſupport in this life, more than preaching the Goſpel for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake. Yet I ſay, I believe I have ſome faithful brethren in the miniſtry, who labour with all their powers to exalt the glory of God upon the earth; and to bring people into that condition whereon they may lay hold of the kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, my friends, let no man judge me as a ſectarian. I wiſh your everlaſting happineſs: I wiſh all our increaſe in that wiſdom which is from above; that ſo as we advance in years and the time draws nigh wherein we muſt lay down this mortal and periſhing body, we may through the mercy of God be gathered to himſelf, and through his love which is unſpeakable, be with the Saints and Angels, glorifying and praiſing his Name, for ever and ever, world without end.</p>
