         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How cautiouſly then ought <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Elders, &amp;c,</hi> to walk in all godly Fear and Circumſpection, as Enſamples to the Flock, not only in <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but in that which ſpeaks the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and convincing, in <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Converſation,</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> giving no juſt Occaſion of Offence to <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Gentile,</hi> nor to the Church of Chriſt, to ſpeak Evil of Dignities, or the Dignity of our holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? I ſay, it highly behoves <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to be <hi>blameleſs in all Things,</hi> walking conformably and conſiſtent with the Doctrines of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, adorning the Goſpel in all Things; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are not properly qualified to example, exhort, counſel, caution, reprove and rebuke, with all Authority, the Backſliders, Gainſayers and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in the Church; for whom it hath long been the earneſt Travil of my Soul, Night and Day, that they might come to witneſs Redemption from the Spirit of the World, by which they have been ſo long held in Bondage: And in a particular and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Manner hath my Spirit in great Fervency been engaged, that the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> might be <hi>blameleſs;</hi> that thoſe who have a Diſpenſation of the Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, might be preſerved faithful in every

Branch of our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Teſtimony, kept by the Direction and Leading of the Spirit of Truth in the holy Way of Truth, and out of all Error; that they might act conſiſtent with the Dignity of their high and holy Vocation, forbearing to do any Thing againſt the Truth, but every Thing for its Promotion and Honour, whether in eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cloathing, buying, ſelling, marrying, or given in Marriage, building Houſes, and furniſhing the ſame; that all and every Action of our Lives might glorify God, or at leaſt, in all theſe Things that we be careful not to diſhonour him. In ſuch a Caſe, I am perſuaded the Goſpel Power would run and be glorified; Men would ſay, <hi>God is with us of a Truth;</hi> and the Uncircumciſed in Heart and Ear would hear, if Practice and Example ſpoke more generally in thoſe who think themſelves more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed than others; There would be now, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, many taking hold of the Skirt of the true <hi>Jew,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Now we believe;</hi> not becauſe we have heard the Doctrines of the Goſpel preached by you, but the powerful Influence of your truly <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Practice we cannot reſiſt; we are now ſenſible you believe the Truths of the Goſpel, for the Work's Sake which accompanies your Faith. In ſuch a Caſe, the People would not retort as now they do, <hi>Such a one,</hi> ſay they, <hi>preached to himſelf this Day.</hi>—Another we hear crying, aye! <hi>So ſay, ſo do.</hi>—A Third, look at <hi>the Pride in their Families.</hi>—A Fourth, obſerve <hi>ſuch and ſuch. Grandeur.</hi>—A Fifth, look at <hi>their Love of the World, and earneſt Purſuit of Riches.</hi>—With many more ſuch like Retortions, which proceed from the Mouths of many of the Members of our own Society.</p>
            <p>And here let us give a little Attention, and hear the World ſpeak; for neither will they believe our Report: Says one, <hi>Now you</hi> Quakers <hi>have convinced us your Principles are right, you are leaving them</hi>

               <hi>yourſelves: Where's your Contempt of the World? How can you ſpeak againſt the earneſt Purſuit of Riches; for who more earneſt to accumulate Wealth than your People? Where's the Self-denial you pretend to? Don't you gratify the Luſt of the Eye, and Pride of Life, though plain, yet in rich and coſtly Silks, and the fineſt of Linen? Do you call this Self-denial?</hi> And then, <hi>what Time do you take to dreſs yourſelves in your plain Nicety and Exactneſs? We are not half ſo long putting on our Finery.</hi> Again, one aſked, <hi>How we could pray that the Vanities and Glories of the World, might be ſtained in the Eyes of the People,</hi> which ſhe heard pray'd for in a Meeting, and when ſhe came out made this Remark; <hi>You both make and ſell theſe Vanities.</hi> Another ſaid, <hi>We have no Scruple about thoſe Things; but how you that have, and yet make and ſell them, is a Wonder to us.</hi> Another, purchaſing ſome vain Things, looked with Admiration on the plain Friend that could ſell ſuch Things. With many more ſuch Obſervations on our Inconſiſtencies in other Things, too numerous to relate.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> how we are reproached now, not for <hi>reforming,</hi> but <hi>conforming</hi> to the World in many Reſpects; and though there has been ſo much Labour beſtowed to convince the World of our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Principles, and what great Self-denial they lead to, we can't deny that they have abundant Reaſon to ſay as they do of many; <hi>They are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting them themſelves.</hi> And now, <hi>dear Friends,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſay, while by Practice any of us thus do, whatever our Station be in the Church, whether pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private, both Profeſſion and Preaching will be vain; the People it is to be feared, will remain in Unbelief. And I farther add, I do not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate theſe Things to you with any other View, than that of a long wiſhed for Reformation in our poor declining Society; that thoſe by whom Offences come, might no longer offend againſt the Light, the

ſacred Rule we profeſs to walk by, which you know is no leſs than the <hi>Direction and Leading of the Spirit of God.</hi> And allow me further to ſay, which I do with Regret, that there ſhould be any Cauſe for it, Many ſee and ſay, that this wiſhed for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt begin in MINISTERS, ELDERS, RULERS, and all ſuch as appear outwardly in Plainneſs: The Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and others mention'd, muſt be purify'd: I mean, ſuch of theſe who have contracted too much of the Duſt of the Earth, and Spots of the World; for, in this Senſe, the Head is <hi>partially</hi> ſick, which is the Cauſe the Heart of the Faithful faints; and they are greatly ſtraitned till the fiery Baptiſm is throughly accompliſhed in ſuch who are but <hi>partially</hi> waſhed, or at leaſt have been again defiled by turning to, and loving this preſent World: And on this Occaſion the <hi>faithful Miniſters</hi> are weeping as between the Porch and the Altar, ſaying, <hi>Spare the People, O Lord, who were called by thy Name;</hi> and are offering daily the Sacrifice for themſelves as well as for the People, fervently petitioning the God of Knowledge to try and ſearch them throughly, and if any Iniquity remain, by his, cleanſing Power he would do it away: And that every one who profeſs the bleſſed pure Truth, may have not only their Feet, but their Head and Hands throughly purify'd, that they may walk in, Integrity and Equity before the People, as was ſaid of the Houſe of <hi>Levi, My Covenant, ſaith the Lord, was with him of Life and Peace, Iniquity was not found in his Lips, he walked with me in Peace and Equity, and did turn many away from Iniquity:</hi> But when he departed out of the Way, be cauſed many to, ſtumble at the Law, which he had been, partial in, and ſo corrupted the Covenant.</p>
            <p>And again, that we might be of <hi>upright Minds</hi> land <hi>ſound Judgments,</hi> always remembring that we are to judge for God, and not for Man: that we may <hi>ſhut our Eyes from ſeeing of Evil,</hi> which, 'tis to

And that we may alſo make our Hands from <hi>holding of Bribes,</hi> ever refuſing to be bribed againſt the Truth, either from our own Hearts Luſts, or from Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Friends or Relations, remembring, in the Caſe of <hi>Idolatry</hi> under the Law, <hi>a Man was not to know his neareſt of Kin, when acting for God's Honour:</hi> Then the <hi>Idolater</hi> was not ſpared; but under the more linient Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, the <hi>Idol</hi> only is to be deſtroyed.

            <p>O <hi>dearly Beloved,</hi> my Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God is, that he would enlighten, more and more, every Eye that may be blinded with the Love of the World, that they may ſee theſe Bribes, and refuſe this Gain of Oppreſſion, which ever did, and ever will oppreſs and choak the Seed of the Kingdom;

                  <q>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the primitive Times lived excluded from all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Magiſtry, and did neglect thoſe Studies neceſſary for civil Truſts and Employments; and becauſe Sophiſters and Philoſophers were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Enemies of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they were diſguſted at all Philoſophy, and ſeverely cenſured all manner of florid and polite Learning: They condemned Tragedies and Comedies, and other poetical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, being the main Part of human Learning, and thinking they did not conduce to ſolid Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, being full of Wantonneſs and Obſcenity, as alſo Promptuaries of fabulous Idolatries.

Hence it was that <hi>Celſus</hi> upbraided them as a Communion of <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Slaves.</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo objected unto the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> their rude Stile, harſh Language, calling them <hi>Ruſticks</hi> and <hi>Clowns.</hi> Clemens enjoyned <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> to abſtain from all Books of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for what have you to do with ſtrange Diſcourſes, or Laws, or falſe Prophets, who ſeduce weak Men from the Truth?

               </opener>
               <p>IN the Feeling of that Love that hath viſited our Hearts, do I deſire to ſalute you: Since I had the Occaſion to ſee ſome of your Faces, you have been often before me in that which deſires the Proſperity of the good and holy Work of Truth, that our God in his Mercy hath begun in and amongſt us, and honoured us to be as a firſt Fruits unto himſelf: Therein I feel this Concern increaſeth, ſo that I could not ſafely forbear, but in Obedience to that which raiſed this Concern in my Heart, do I write unto you as followeth:</p>
               <p>Since the Lord our God hath been pleaſed to take from among us many of our ancient Brethren and Siſters in the Truth, who had a great Concern on them for the going on of this Work in the Purity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Faithfulneſs of Heart in their Rooms, in this our Day of God's Love to us. O you Elders in the Truth, and Parents of Children, my Call is unto you; ſtand up in the Authority that God giveth you, in the Meekneſs and Wiſdom of God, and in your Places acquit yourſelves as becomes you, in Obedience to God, and therein anſwer your Duty towards your Youth. We know that God's Power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> near, that giveth to know, and enableth us to anſwer our Duty in all Things, as we keep in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010337_0028_0F7E8099F543E128"/>
our Minds to it; ſo let us all be careful in our Places to keep to the Power, that therein we may be good Examples to one another, laying aſide, and keeping out of all [<hi>Superfluity</hi> or] Superfluous Things; for we know that in Mercy we were brought in at the right Door: And there was no leſs called for at our Hands, in our firſt Viſitation of God's Love and Light, than to come out of all Superfluity. So in the ſame pure Way muſt we hold on, and have weighty Care to train up our Youth therein, to go on with us in it, that we and ours may be given up to the Lord, (who hath viſited us in his Love) for we and ours are the Offering due to our God, and he requires it of us. O my <hi>dear Friends,</hi> let no leſs be our Offering to him <hi>than our All.</hi> This is the preſent Breathing of my Heart before him. For what is or can be our Children to us, but as they are in the Truth, that brings forth a ſober and ſerious Converſation in it? Therein only can they be a Comfort to the upright in Heart. So let this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern be more and more weighty on us Parents, School-maſters and School-miſtreſſes. I feel it in my Heart in that which deſireth I may be kept in the Concern myſelf, and in Obedience to that Power that raiſeth this good and weighty Concern, <hi>my Call is unto you all</hi> who have the Occaſion to be concern'd in this weighty Work of bringing up Youth; have a ſpecial Care that you anſwer your Duty in it, in the firſt Place to God, and next to the Youth you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with. I feel there is a great Matter of this Work lieth in your Hands, Parents, School-maſters and School-miſtreſſes: O you have Need to know and keep your Watch continually, in the pure Spring of Life and Wiſdom, that you may know, and make a thorough Difference between the <hi>needful</hi> and the <hi>needleſs</hi> and ſuperfluous Things, either in Meats, Drinks and <hi>Apparel; and in that which ye teach them for the Employment of their Hands.</hi>

                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:010337_0029_0F7E809A907BC9A0"/>
I charge you in the Sight of that Power that ſearches the Depths of our Hearts, <hi>that you neither teach, allow nor ſuffer the ſuperfluous or vain Thing amongſt you:</hi> For your Families ought to be as young Nurſeries to the Lord, and then your Endeavours with them ſhall be known for Good, in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies they fall to be in.</p>
               <p>And O you Youth! how ſhall I eaſe my Mind concerning you! for your Sakes, and on your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, am I often as one who hath her Hands upon her Loins, and as in Pain for your Sakes, that you may more and more come forth out of that which hinders you from ſerving God in your Generation in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Heart; for a Profeſſion alone will not do, or ſerve. Therefore ariſe in Uprightneſs of Heart, and ſhake yourſelves from that which hinders and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Mind as to its following God in Obedience: And, as wiſe Virgins in a chaſte Mind to God, let us both Old and Young wait more and more to feel in his Virtue and Power our Light increaſed, and we, as Lamps, fill'd with the Oil of the Goſpel; that therein we may know a putting on of the Wedding Garment of true Holineſs, which will make us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the Sight of our God. And as the Mind comes weightily to be concern'd that it may be ſo with us, it will make it eaſy to us to part with all the ſuperfluous Part, either in Food or Raiment, and in every ſtep of our Converſation or Converſe: Yea the ſuperfluous Words alſo muſt be laid aſide; for in the Reſignation that is known in the ſilence of Mind before the Searcher of Hearts, is our Preſervation witneſſed. O that thoſe of us, both Old and Young, that in Mercy are made ſenſible that it is ſo, may be in a weighty Care to hold on in the daily Practice and inward Enjoyment of it, and that therein we may bring forth the Godly Converſation, in which we may be ſerviceable to one another, and may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the good Way of Truth to the Beholders of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010337_0030_0F7E809FE3B66CF0"/>
our Converſation in it, is the earneſt Breathing of my Heart, who deſires the Proſperity and going on of this bleſſed Work, both in the Particular and in the General, in which I deſire to remain your Friend and Siſter in the Truth,</p>

and ſhe ſignified, on her firſt teaching them, ſhe was very uneaſy in her Mind; but taking Counſel of one ſhe prefer'd in Judgment, ſhe was advis'd to continue to teach them. I don't at all know the Friend or Friends who thus counſel'd her, but it appears to me to be a Caſe parallel with that we read of, where the old Prophet turn'd the Younger out of the Way, and cauſed him to diſobey the Lord.</p>
               <p>I viſited another Boarding-ſchool, and ſpoke to the School-miſtreſs on the ſame Subject; ſhe allow'd it was not agreeable to Truth to teach theſe Things in Friends Schools; but alledged, their Parents would have them ſo taught. But ought not faithful Friends to make a ſtand againſt them, and thus query, <hi>How can I aſſiſt in making Proviſion for the Fleſh to fulfil the ſinful Luſts thereof?</hi> This faithful Teſtimony would have a Tendency to open the Eye which the God of this World hath blinded in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am inform'd, the Schools of ſome, called Friends, make for Sale Childbed Linen with laced Seams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Value of five, ſix or ſeven Guineas a Suit.

               <hi>Epiſtle from the General-meeting in</hi> Dublin, 1671. "As there was rather a going back by many into the dark Cuſtoms and never-ſettled Faſhions, into the Liberty and Spirit of the World, both in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel and ſuperfluous adorning of Houſes with thoſe Things which at beſt do but feed the Luſt of the Eye, and therefore muſt needs miniſter unto Vanity, and not adorn the Goſpel of Chriſt; the Lord hath put it into our Hearts to write theſe Lines."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In an Epiſtle to the Men and Womens Meetings throughout</hi> Ireland <hi>in</hi> 1684, <hi>I find Elders concern'd to reſtore the Youth, and others among Friends, who had gone into a falſe Liberty diſhonourable to Truth; and among other Things complain'd of, I find this lamented;</hi>"—Alſo, that ſeveral who have Hair enough on their Heads, cut it off and get ruffling Wigs, and others who may have ſome Neceſſity, do get ſuch Wigs as are ſuperfluous, in Length and otherwiſe."</p>

and good Men; this Supply of Hair being uſed till natural Hair grow again, and then be well laid aſide.—But if Pride, or without any juſt Occaſion, do cut it off, becauſe it is not faſhionable or modiſh, or that it don't curl enough, or is not of ſuch a Colour as they like; this is not right in the Sight of God, and an evident Token that divine Wiſdom is ſlighted and undervalued, by thoſe who are not contented with ſuch Sort and Colour of Hair as he hath ſeen ſit to beſtow, as if they would alter the Work of Providence, and mend what God hath made.—I felt a Concern on my Spirit from the Lord to give a ſhort Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt this Exceſs, ſeeing, to my Sorrow, many both old and young run into unneceſſary Wigs, and have found that it hath given Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Offence in divers Places."</p>
            <p>And I here add, That Truth is one in all, and it calls to Humility and Self-denial in all, as appears by divers Teſtimonies formerly given forth againſt Pride, by ſeveral Members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And I find in the Articles of Viſitation, when the Biſhops viſited their Dioceſſes, they were to enquire among other Things, <hi>Whether the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were ſober, and examplary in their Hair?</hi> And one (call'd a dignify'd one) amongſt them, writes thus: "There have been Books written about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs of Men's wearing long Hair, the Subſtance of which were too much to tranſcribe here.—That which ſeems commended to us as the Will of God in this Matter is, That Men and Women ſhould ſo order their Hair, as to preſerve the Diſtinction of Sexes, (as well as in their Clothes) that they ſhould not wear it curled or tricked up about their Heads, as the Women; which ſpeaks too much of an unmanly eſſeminate Temper; and much more, it was what became not <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And if this be forbidden Men, as

            <p>And here let the Prophet and Apoſtles have place; and I would, <hi>Brethren,</hi> it might have place in your Hearts alſo.—And firſt, the Women's well-ſet Hair is produc'd by the Prophet as a Mark of their Pride; and among their Implements ſerving the Purpoſes of Pride, is enumerated the <hi>Criſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins;</hi> which an old Tranſlation ſays, were <hi>Pins to curl their Hair, or to keep it in that Form.</hi> And next, let us give Attention to the Apoſtle's Advice, which plainly amounts to a Prohibition; <hi>that</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Women ought not to plait or broider their Hair;</hi> which the Biſhop's Bible calls <hi>curling the Hair:</hi> Forbid, I ſay, as it was not becoming the Humility, Solidity and Gravity of Women profeſſing Godlineſs, no more than wearing Gold and coſtly Array: And here we may obſerve Religion concern'd in theſe Things, tho' many deny it.—I might here enlarge on this Subject, but for Brevity's Sake I ſhall only recommend to you, <hi>Brethren,</hi> to conſider and judge of this Matter yourſelves; judge ye then: Does all this well-ſet and curled Hair you adorn yourſelves with, become Men profeſſing Godlineſs, yea, the higheſt Degree thereof, <hi>Perfection?</hi> Again, does the Hair of a Youth of ſeventeen Years anſwer the Appearance we ſhould ſee in Seventy? And if Neceſſity is pleaded, why muſt Men have borrowed Hair ſo different from their natural Covering? which not only may differ in Colour, but in its lank, mean and unpleaſant Form.—Well, is the Time come, or approaching, wherein the Children is to teach the Fathers? Inſtead of the Fathers, muſt we look to the Children, to be made Princes in all the Earth, to give Laws and Example to Mankind? O beloved <hi>Brethren,</hi> if any are out of your Places in this Matter, reſume your

               <hi>Preface to</hi> William Crouch<hi>'s Works.</hi> pag. 12. "As to the Things of this World, he eſteem'd them, as they are in themſelves, periſhing Enjoyments, and therefore placed not his Affections on them; he looked not on himſelf as a Proprietor, but a Steward of them; ſo he was a Benefactor to ſome of all Opinions, counting that Perſon his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that ſtood in Need of his Bounty, declaring the Love of Money the Root of all Evil, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Covetouſneſs is a Sin, which wiſe Men in all Ages condemn, yet moſt Men have been more or leſs in Love with it. That Covetouſneſs is a Sin, yea, a grievous Sin, who is there that denies it? But then the Diſtinctions about it, the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and Excuſe made for it are ſo many, and ſo ſubtilly contrived, that tho' no Sin is ſo general and apparent, yet there are very few among the vaſt Number of Delinquents, that will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves guilty.—He made ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of it, that notwithſtanding all the Cunning of its Advocates and Abettors, and the various fair Colours they put upon it, 'tis ſtill whatever it was, an odious Monſter in the Sight of God and good Men, <hi>a complicated Evil, that carries in its Bowels the Seeds of all Iniquity." See his Treatiſe on the</hi> enormous Sin of Covetouſneſs detected.—<hi>"We read not of any good Man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in all the Hiſtory of Scripture, or of the primitive Times, that was covetous, and it is a Shame that any that do now pretend to the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Religion ſhould degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> He was clear himſelf in this Matter, as
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010337_0044_0F7E80AB795FD9D8"/>
credible Perſons, who knew him, unanimouſly agree, that his Treaſure was in Heaven; the Treaſures of the World he put no Value on them any further than to be his Servants for neceſſary Uſes, and for charitable Acts towards others, for even Strangers in Diſtreſs went not empty handed from his Gate; he viſited the Fatherleſs and Widow, and kept himſelf unſpotted from the World; he did Juſtice towards all Men; 'tis one of the firſt Leſſons Truth teaches her Diſciples. Now as doing juſtly or righteouſly is a certain Proof of being born of God, ſo 'tis in vain for any Man to conceit he is ſo born, in whom the Fruits of Equity or Righteouſneſs are not conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous; and whoſoever Acts as a new Creature, and feels a Neceſſity upon him to keep his Word, perform his lawful Contracts, pay his juſt Debts, and do to all Men as they would have them do to him.—This was the Rule this Friend walked by, and was bleſſed in his Deeds."</p>
            <p>Rutty<hi>'s Hiſtory of Friends in</hi> Ireland, <hi>pag.</hi> 199. "When the Fear of God prevailed in our Hearts, and we hated Pride and Covetouſneſs, then were we ready to anſwer Chriſt Jeſus our Captain, that called us to follow him in a ſpiritual Warfare, under the diſcipline of the daily Croſs and Self-denial; then the Things of this World were of ſmall Value to us, ſo that we might win Chriſt; and the goodlieſt Things of this World were of ſmall Value, and were not near us, ſo that we might be near the Lord; and the Lord's Truth outballanced all the World, even the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Part of it.—Then great Trading was a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, great Concerns a great Trouble; all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Things, fine Houſes, rich Furniture, and gaudy Apparel was an Eye-ſore; our Eye being ſingle to the Lord, and the Inſhining of his Light in our Hearts, which gave us the Sight of the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010337_0045_0F7E80ABF04EAF18"/>
Knowledge of the Glory of God, which ſo affected our Minds, that it ſtained the Glory of all earthly Things, and they bore no Maſtery with us, either in Dwelling, Eating, Drinking, Buying, Selling, Marrying, or giving in Marriage; the Lord was the Object of our Eye, and we were all humble and low before him, and Self of ſmall Reputation; Miniſters and Elders all in ſuch Caſes walking as good Examples, that the Flock might follow their Footſteps, as they follow'd Chriſt in the daily Croſs; and this anſwer'd the Lord's Witneſs in all Conſciences, and gave us great Credit among Men, till there came a Spirit among us, that began to look back into the World, and traded with the Credit which was not of their own purchaſing; ſtriving to be great in the Riches and Poſſeſſions of the World: And then great fair Buildings in City and Country, fine and faſhionable Furniture, and Apparel equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, with dainty and voluptuous Proviſions, rich Matches in Marriages, exceſſive cuſtomary uncomely ſmoaking Tobacco, under Colour of lawful and ſerviceable, far wide from the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of the Miniſters and Elders the Lord raiſed up and ſent forth in his Work and Service at the Beginning, and far ſhort of the Example our Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt left us, when he was tempted in the Wilderneſs with the Offer of all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them, and he deſpiſed them; and <hi>Moſes,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Daughter, but rather choſe Affliction with the Lord's People, having a Regard to the Recompence of Reward. And the holy Apoſtle writes to the Church of Chriſt, both Fathers, young Men and Children, and adviſes againſt the Love of the World, and the Faſhions thereof: And it is working, as the old Leaven, at this very Time, to corrupt the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:010337_0046_0F7E80AC9E8A4878"/>
Heritage of God, and to fill it with Briars, Thorns, Thiſtles and Tares, and the Grapes of the Earth, to make the Lord reject it, and lay it waſte. But the Lord of our Mercies is lifting up the Standard of his Spirit againſt the Enemy in the Hearts of many, to ſtand in the Gap which this floating, high, worldly, libertine Spirit hath made, that is gone from the Footſteps of them that followed Chriſt as at firſt, and knew him to keep them within his Bounds; and not their own Will and Time to lay hold on Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Opportunities that may offer to get Riches, which many have had and refuſed for Truth's Sake, and the Lord hath accepted it as an Offering, and rewarded to their great Comfort, and the Praiſe of his great Name."</p>
            <p>On the foregoing Page we may obſerve, that with the Declenſion ſo much lamented, came in a Deſire of <hi>rich Matches in Marriages,</hi> which occaſioned many Advices from Yearly and other Meetings, to Parents who have Children to diſpoſe of in Marriage, not to make their firſt Care to obtain large Portions for their Children, and Settlements of Marriage; but rather careful that their Children be joined in Marriage with Perſons of religious Inclinations, ſuitable Diſpoſitions, Temper, Sobriety of Manners, and Diligence.—And is not this Advice neceſſary at this very Day to Miniſters and Elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome of whom, it is to be feared, make their firſt Motive of their Change of Life, the Worldly Poſſeſſion of the Party they addreſs; tho' in many other Reſpects, as above mentioned, inſtead of being equally yoaked and Help-meets for their Furtherance in Religion, they become Snares, and perhaps cauſe them alſo to worſhip their ſtrange Gods, as did the Wives of one of old, once greatly favoured of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Rutty<hi>'s Hiſtory of Friends,</hi> &amp;c. "After the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſucceeded a Time of great Plenty;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010337_0047_0F7E80AD61DACF20"/>
and as the Time of great Loſſes had been experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, before the Time of great Riches came on, and many eagerly purſued them, which proved very injurious upon ſeveral Accounts, eſpecially to Friends Children, who perceiving their Parents Fulneſs, rely'd on them, and grew conceited and finical, many giving way to Idleneſs, and many Parents indulging them, and gratifying the vain Mind that goes after the Faſhions of the World; and for want of timely Care, ſome grew ſo hardy, that their Parents could not deal with them; and theſe Things added great Exerciſe to the Sincere, and great Endeavours were uſed to put a Stop to this eager Purſuit after the Things of this World.—And from many Men and Womens Meetings, Admonitions, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Warnings, were ſent forth to the Body of Friends, to keep to the Limits of Truth. <hi>And further, continues the Hiſtory,</hi> "This Concern of the Elders is no leſs a ſtanding Evidence of their true Wiſdom and Forecaſt, with Regard to the Preſervation of ſucceeding Generations, which ſeems to be expreſſed in thoſe Terms, <hi>Laying God's Heritage waſte;</hi> and indeed, that great Deſolation in reſpect to the Poſterity of Friends, hath been the natural Tendency of this inordinate Purſuit of Riches and Grandeur in Parents, as hath been amply verify'd by the Obſervations of ſucceeding Times.—<hi>Not all the Perſecutions,</hi> ſaid a certain eminent Elder, <hi>not all the Apoſtates, nor all the open or private Enemies we have ever had, have done us, as a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Society, the Damage that</hi> Riches <hi>have done.</hi>—In Fact, we ſee ſcarce any Thing more frequent than this, that when the laborious and frugal Father has amaſs'd a great Eſtate, and left it to his Children, they grow too high to ſtoop to thoſe Singularities, and Inſtances of Self-denial, wherein they have been educated; the <hi>Quakers</hi>

Religion becomes a Burden, and perhaps thrown off for that which is moſt in Faſhion.—The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this Affair was ſuch, that in the Year 1698, a Province Meeting was held, conſiſting both of Men and ancient concerned Women, in order to wait on the Lord for Counſel, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper Bounds of getting and right uſing the lawful Things of this World; and they teſtify'd that the Glory of the Lord covered their Aſſembly, and their Hearts were melted in his Preſence; and under this Influence, the Perſons that conſtituted that Meeting did by unanimous Conſent, one by one, offer themſelves to be ſubject to the Province Meeting, or any Elders appointed by that Meeting, with Regard to their outward Callings, Holdings, Trading or Dealing among Men, <hi>If any Thing ſhould be judged to exceed the Bounds of Moderation."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Evil of Covetouſneſs is ſo dangerous, that our Lord redoubles his Caution againſt it; <hi>Take heed, and beware of Covetouſneſs;</hi> an Evil, though frequently diſguiſed under the Cloaks of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Induſtry and Frugality, yet engroſſes the Affections as much as the Luſt of the Fleſh, or other more infamous Sins, and as effectually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from the Kingdom of God.—And as this Sin of Covetouſneſs is ſo frequently, juſtly, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently condemned and teſtified againſt, as it is the <hi>Root of all Evil;</hi> and among many unlawful Means it puts People on to gain this End, is that of buying and ſelling uncuſtom'd Goods.—And among many Advices from Yearly-meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let us hear and take this of 1719. <hi>"Dear Friends,</hi> as our Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony hath ever been and ſtill is againſt defrauding the King of any of his Cuſtoms, Duties or Exciſe, buying Goods reaſonably ſuſpected to be run, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Wool or other Goods prohibited by Law, or doing any other Thing whatſoever to the Injury of the King's Revenues, or of the common Good,

by the Plague.—They minded no ſuch Thing as Modes and Faſhions, nor did any new Habit or Ornament, that came up, intice them to Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Decency was their Rule, and Modeſty the Standard of their Habit and Converſation.—They wore nothing about them that was coſtly or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.—Their Study and Contrivance was, how to make them ſit for the Marriage of the Lamb.—Their Garments was either Linen, Woolen, Furr or Sheepſkins, and their Furniture mean and homely.—They were deſpiſed for their Meanneſs. and were looked upon as unſociable, People of pitiful Spirits, Strangers to the Art of Converſation, melancholy Wretches, Brethren of Worms, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Idleneſs they had an Averſion to. The great Men and Women would do ſomething, that the Needy might be the better for. She that had been the greateſt Lady, did not diſdain to ſpin, ſew and knit for her diſtreſſed Neighbours.—Like Bees, they were ever employed for the common Good.—The Love of the World was Death to theſe <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> they thought it a certain Sign that they had no Portion in Chriſt, if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſerve God and Mammon.—<hi>To be in the World, and not of the World,</hi> was their <hi>Motto.</hi>—They ſeem'd to be prophane, becauſe they did not worſhip the <hi>Heathen</hi> Gods; but were more devout to the true God.—Not a few left their great Dignities, high Places, and ſwelling Titles,

to become <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and choſe to be low and contemptible in the World, that they might have no Impediment in their Way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Chriſtians</hi> mainly inſiſted upon this, That the Arts of curious and coſtly Dreſſes were injurious to God, and a Diſparagement to his Workmanſhip.—Says <hi>Tertullian,</hi> we are not to ſeek after Neatneſs and Finery beyond what is ſimple and ſufficient, and what pleaſes God; againſt whom they offend, who are not ſatisfy'd with his Workmanſhip.—<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> commends <hi>Olympias,</hi> a Woman of great Birth and Eſtate, for the incredible Modeſty and Meanneſs of her Attire.—The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were ſo far from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of Bravery in rich and coſtly Things, that they thought they never could ſeem mean enough.—<hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſays, The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we ſhould wear ought to be mean and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and that is the beſt which is fartheſt from Art and Curioſity.—The Ancients cenſured Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, but, ſays <hi>Clemens,</hi> not to be compared with a nice, curious Study of Fineſs.—They cry'd out not only againſt the Coſtlineſs of their Clothes, but the Arts to add greater Handſomneſs than God had beſtow'd upon them.—But ſome of theſe Times pleaded Riches; to which <hi>Cyprian</hi> anſwers, They are truly rich who are rich towards God, and the World ought to be deſpiſed with its Pomps and Delights, which we renounced when we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily turn'd to God; and Riches are to be govern'd by juſt Meaſures. For the Apoſtle commands all Women, how rich ſoever, <hi>to adorn themſelves in modeſt Apparel, not with coſtly Array;</hi> and ſhews a more excellent way to beſtow their Eſtates, <hi>to relieve the Hungry and feed the Poor.</hi>—This was the beſt Art of improving Riches."</p>

And with the ſame Parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may it be here added, that provided they deny'd themſelves of gay and gaudy Cloathing, they might indulge an extravagant Diſpoſition in that that is plain and grave, as if the Pride lay in the Colour only, and not in the Quality of the Garment; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the Apoſtle's Prohibition of coſtly Array, as well as Gold and ſuperfluous Ornaments: And alſo forgetting the many Changes of Raiment, or changeable Suits of Apparel, the ſine Linen, the Glaſſes, and curious Things which we find in the Catalogue of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Womens Pride and Dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This minding of high Things, purſuing great Riches, and purchaſing coſtly Things, don't ſeem at all conſiſtent with the Lip Acknowledgment of many, and the great Expreſſions of Humility, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing ourſelves below the moſt abject of all Beings, as weak, ſhort-ſighted, imperfect, unworthy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Worms and not Men; Vanity, and leſs than nothing. And to ſee the Coſtlineſs of Apparel, and Furniture in Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the impious Nicety and Curioſity, as <hi>William Penn</hi> juſtly ſtiles it, among ſome of the plainer Sort in the Society, is

moſt aſtoniſhing, and would almoſt induce one to think, that provided they conſider'd themſelves in this humble Situation in the Sight of God, the ſupream Being, they might be indulged in their imagined Superiority and Diſtinctions which their Riches have made between them and their fellow Creatures.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:010337_0073_0F7E80CCD339AD38"/>
found a Reſtriction laid upon him, and a conſcientious Scruple in doing ſuch like Things: Howbeit, for ſome Time, through Reaſoning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> permitted his Servant or Servants that wrought with him to have ſome hand in the doing of it. He did not at the firſt renounce all thoſe Superfluities, and the Profits that might ſeem to ariſe therefrom, but the Light ſhone brighter and brighter, and diſcovered Things further and further; and as he ſat in a Meeting on a certain Day (<hi>the Power of the Lord ſeized him</hi>) he was ſo remarkably affected, that his Hands were drawn together, the Uſe of his Limbs taken from him, and he fell down on the Floor, where he laid for ſome Time, to the Admiration of the Spectators. After this <hi>Viſitation,</hi> which he took to be a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the righteous Judgments of the Lord, for his being inſtrumental in ſetting on of Lace on Womens Apparel, and other Superfluities of the Times, which frequently occur'd in his Buſineſs, he was ſweetly favoured with an immediate Succeſſion pf refreſhing Conſolation, ſo that he could ſing of Judgment and Mercy. From that Time he never <hi>durſt</hi> ſet on any Lace, or other ſuperfluous Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or gratify the proud Minds of Men and Women in the vain Faſhions and changeable Modes of the Times, neither with his own Hands, nor the Hands of his Servants, what Diſadvantage ſoever it might be unto him: But the Lord proſpered what he put his Hand to; he was with his Servant, and is with all the Faithful that follow his Leadings and Drawings of the Light and Truth, even to the giving an hundred Fold in this World, and in the World to come Life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, he was ſent for by a great Man to make ſome very fine Clothes; when he ſaw the Work was to be wrought with many Superfluities, which for Conſcience-ſake he durſt not undertake, upon his Refuſal they told him, he might let his

Man do them; but he ſaid he durſt neither permit his Man to do them, nor aſſiſt him; then they ſaid they muſt employ another. He was willing to loſe all rather than his Peace with the Lord: He freely turn'd his Back of all that worldly Intereſt: And Providence ſo favoured his conſcientious Care, that he got plan Work enough, and his Wages increaſed; as he was faithful in a little, the Lord made greater Things manifeſt unto him, for in the Families in which he had been light, airy and wanton, he was now made to reprove Vanity, and bear a living Teſtimony to the everlaſting God in Word, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, Life and Converſation; and it pleaſed the Lord to diſpenſe to him a Gift or Talent in the free living Miniſtry of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which through his Bleſſing he improved to God's Honour and the Comfort of Souls.

the Lord hath manifeſted to me his Diſpleaſure againſt my being concerned in making any <hi>figur'd and gaudy Stuffs,</hi> whoſe End and Service was chiefly to ſatisfy the vain and proud Minds of Men and Women, that live in Diſobedience to God; and that thoſe Things have their Riſe and Beginning, and are invented by Man, whoſe Heart and Mind is gone aſtray from the Counſel of the Lord, and therefore by ſuch as come to yield up unto him, and take Counſel of his holy Spirit, they are to be deny'd and turn'd from; and we are not to reaſon with Fleſh and Blood about theſe Things, ſaying, <hi>If I leave this Way, I know not how I ſhall get ſuch a Maintenance for my Family as I now can; and if the Lord would make, out a Way for me in other Things, I could willingly part with this.</hi> And ſo are prefering their preſent Proſperity in this ſhort and tranſitory Life, before their Peace and eternal Comfort and Felicity with the Lord for ever: O, <hi>my Friends,</hi> it is better to have inward Peace with the Lord, and the Seal and Teſtimony of Faithfulneſs born Witneſs unto us, and in us, though we do ſuffer in the outward, than to enjoy outward Comfort for a little Seaſon, and want inward Peace.—<hi>My Friends,</hi> it is the Lord hath given unto me, that thoſe that are obedient unto him, and bear a faithful Teſtimony for his Truth, againſt that Spirit of Pride and Wickedneſs, that ſo much abounds in this our Age, they ſhall not want that which is neceſſary for their Support in the outward; and on the contrary, they that refuſe to obey the Lord and anſwer his Requirings, and think by continuing in that which grieves his holy Spirit, to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and increaſe in Riches, the Lord is able to blaſt all their Increaſe when he pleaſes; therefore let all be perſuaded to be faithful to the Lord, and turn their Hearts and Minds to ſeek him

               <p>STAND in the eternal Power of God, Witneſſes for the eternal God againſt the Devil and his Works, and the World, and the Luſts and Pomps and Vanities thereof; which World the Devil
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010337_0077_0F7E80CFE9632378"/>
is God of. Now there is a Saying by the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, ſo called, that they do promiſe and vow, <hi>&amp;c. to forſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of the wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> and vow for Children <hi>that they will not follow nor be led by them, but forſake them all.</hi> And do we not ſee many run into them all, or many of the Luſts and Pomps and Vanities of the World? And are not ſuch offended at ſuch Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that cannot trim their Clothes and Apparel according to the Pomps, Luſts and Faſhions of the World, which paſs away? But ſuch Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as ſtand Witneſſes in the Power and Truth of God, and connot fulfil Peoples Minds in the Luſts and Vanities of the World, I ſay, they are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them.</p>
               <p>"But did God make Man and Woman with theſe Pomps and Vanities, and Luſts, or how came they into them? No, God did not make them with theſe Luſts and Vanities; but when Man and Woman forſook the living God, and diſobey'd him, and followed the Serpent Satan, the Devil, then he filled them with the Pomps, Luſts and Vanities of a Wicked World, which he is God of: So they fell from the Righteouſneſs, Holineſs and Image of God, and tranſgreſſing the Command of God, and following the Serpent, he hath filled them with Pride, Malice and Hatred, and with the Luſts and Vanities of the World.—And ſome are grieved and vexed if they cannot have ſuch Vanities as others have, and think much at ſuch who are in Pomp and Pride above them, and the Luſt the Devil begets in them, in Man and Woman in the Fall.—So it had a Beginning in Man and Woman, and muſt there have an End, if ever they come to God.—So they that ſtand faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for God againſt the Pride, Pomps and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the World, they cannot pleaſe nor ſatisfy

them, <hi>though it bring them much Gain.</hi> For the Apoſtle faith, <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and Pride of Life, is not of the Father;</hi> [mark, <hi>not of the Father]</hi> not of God the Father, the Creator of all, that takes Care of all, who is Lord of all.—If theſe Luſts be not of the Father, who are they of then, but of the Devil, the God of this World? So theſe Tradeſmen that are God's Witneſſes, cannot fulfil theſe Luſts of the Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are of the Devil, whom Chriſt deſtroys and his Works; and are ſealed and certain Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in God's eternal Power, <hi>againſt all which is not of the Father,</hi> but of the Devil. And they are alſo Witneſſes for <hi>that which is of God the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and for his Glory, and for his Honour and Praiſe.</p>
               <p>"But they that are in the Pomps and Vanities of a wicked World, and Followers of the God of this World, and his Works, <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and Pride of Life,</hi> they hate and perſecute them that ſtand Witneſſes againſt ſuch Things, and will hardly employ ſuch who ſtand Witneſſes againſt their Pride. So theſe Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can hardly get any Trading while they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for God, the Father's Power and Truth, againſt thoſe who are in the Pomps and Vanities which is not of the Father. But in ſo doing they know they keep clean Conſciences to God, and know and are aſſured that his Bleſſing reſt upon them, who will bleſs them with Bleſſings from above and beneath, as they are Witneſſes for God, who hath his upper and nether Springs to refreſh them, which enables them to ſtand faithful Witneſſes for the living God their Father, to whom be Glory for ever, whoſe Glory is over all the Works of his Hands, who is worthy to be ſerved, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and honoured for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

"And therefore 'tis good for all to wait patiently upon the Lord, for ſome of you do know, that when Truth firſt broke out in <hi>London,</hi> many Tradeſmen could not take ſo much Money in their Shops as would buy them Bread, becauſe they withſtood the World's Ways, Words, Faſhions and Cuſtoms; yet by their patient waiting on the Lord, in their good Life and Converſation, they came to anſwer the Truth in Peoples Conſciences; ſo there aroſe a Belief in People, <hi>that</hi> Friends <hi>would not wrong them in any Thing;</hi> ſo at laſt the Lord did increaſe his Bleſſings both inwardly and outwardly upon his People: Therefore let none murmur nor complain, but wait in <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> upon the Lord, who is both. God of Heaven and Earth; all is the Lord's, who can fill you both with his ſpiritual and temporal Bleſſings; therefore all walk worthy of them in Truth and Righteouſneſs, and that whatever ye do in Word or Deed, it may be done to the Praiſe and Glory of God.</p>
