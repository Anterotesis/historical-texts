            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>BRETHREN, AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:</hi>—</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS day is rendered illuſtrious in the annals of our country, by giving birth to a citizen, whom it has pleaſed GOD to honor with diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed honors, and to render uncommonly acceptable to the multitude of his brethren.</p>
            <p>The early preſages, which he gave of martial bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſkill, and prudence, have been more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, in his ſucceſsfully leading the armies of his country to repel her aggreſſors, ſecure her rights, and eſtabliſh her in the enjoyment of peace and independence. The country that he defended, at the head of a band of heroes, he reſcued from confuſion and imbecility, at the head of a band of patriots, by conciliating their affections, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining their intereſts, in a conſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, in its operation, has juſtified the eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of ſpeculation, and rendered our country, probably, the freeſt and happieſt in the world.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037063_0004_100C3FA8443894E8"/>
Nobly diveſting himſelf of all civil or military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, he retired to the walks of private life, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a triumph in ſelf conqueſt, that few mortals have obtained. But the unanimous ſuffrages of his country drew him, reluctant, from his retreat, and placed him at the head of the adminiſtration of our government. In this novel ſtation, during an eight years preſidency, at an epoch, moſt momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to America, in its foreign relations and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſts, he proved himſelf the wiſe politician, the diſcerning, firm, and diſintereſted patriot, the inviolable friend of his country, and guardian of her rights.</p>
            <p>National gratitude and affection have for ſeveral years influenced the citizens of America to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the birth-day of ſo illuſtrious a Benefactor, by feſtive celebrations and ſentimental tributary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. But, alas! this mode of celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no more! Neither dignity nor uſefulneſs exempt from death. The Sovereign LORD of life, a few weeks ſince, ſummoned from his intercourſe with mortals, this Father of his country, our ſhield in war, our pride in peace.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme council of our nation, in token of reſpect to the memory of the deceaſed, and to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our attention to the voice of Providence, have ſeperated this anniverſary to national mourning,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037063_0005_100C3FAAE5348170"/>
and devotion. In obedience to their ſummons, we are aſſembled to mingle our tears and condolence, to humble ourſelves at the feet of unerring wiſdom and righteouſneſs, to unite our ſupplications and thankſgivings to him who gives and who takes away, earneſtly begging that the hand that has broken, would bind us up, and cauſe a harveſt of national bleſſings to ariſe from a nation's tears.</p>
            <p>I have ſincerely hoped that ſome municipal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement would have excuſed me from a part in this day's exerciſes; that we ſhould have been favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the efforts of other talents; this I have the rather hoped, as I have already mingled my mite with the offerings of the rich, which the partiality of friends has drawn from its obſcurity.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the duties of the day, I have been utterly at a loſs as to what would be proper or expedient. The voluntary tributes of reſpect, that have flowed from the higheſt ſources, have left ſcarce any thing to be added on this anniverſary; 'and what can the man do that comes after the king.' My firſt reſolution was only to have read on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that admirable addreſs of our late worthy Preſident, poured forth with ſuch parental affection and ſolicitude, in the dignified attitude of diſrobing himſelf of the inſignia of office, and retiring to the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037063_0006_100C3FACD8F83640"/>
rank of a private citizen. My reſolution is changed, not from an apprehenſion that any thing can be offered you ſo worthy your attention, but from the reflection that this is already in the hands of moſt, and will be peruſed and reperuſed, with leiſurly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, while a ſpark of enlightened patriotiſm warms our boſoms. Relying upon your uſual, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and patient attention, I have concluded to attempt an illuſtration of a ſubject at all times intereſting, at the preſent, peculiarly ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Religion and Righteouſneſs are the Baſis of National Honor and Proſperity, and the ſureſt mean of National Security and Peace.</hi> Will ſuch a ſubject, be deemed altogether foreign to the deſign of the day? It harmonizes with the principles, ſpirit, and letter, of our invaluable political legacy; and if our deceaſed patron retains a wiſh for his country, I doubt not it is, that it would diſtinguiſh itſelf as much by its piety and righteouſneſs, as it has been diſtinguiſhed by the favor and benediction of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For he now perfectly knows what, while liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſublimely taught, That "OF ALL THE DISPOSITIONS AND HABITS WHICH LEAD TO POLITICAL PROSPERITY, RELIGION AND MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALITY, ARE INDISPENSABLE SUPPORTS."</p>
            <p>The portion of ſcripture ſelected as the theme of our diſcourſe, is a part of the charge of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037063_0007_100C3FAF05270010"/>
Moſes, that venerable patriot, and leader of the children of Iſrael; when he viewed his diſſolution at hand, and would make every effort to ſecure to the people whom he loved, national honor and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The words you will read</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>DEUTERONOMY, IV. 6.</bibl>
Keep therefore and do them, for this is your wiſdom and your underſtanding in the fight of the nations which ſhall hear all theſe ſtatutes, and ſay, ſurely this great nation is a wiſe and underſtanding people.</q>
            <p>THE ſtriking reſemblance, in a great variety of particulars, between this renowned leader of Iſrael and the venerated character whoſe loſs we this day deplore, has been happily made the ſubject of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary reſpect to the memory of the latter.</p>
            <p>In nothing, does there appear a more ſtriking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, than in the diſintereſtedneſs of their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm, and their concern that the people of their charge ſhould be proſperous and happy after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe. The illuſions of fancy and affection aſide, the palm muſt be given to Moſes in every reſpect, for he had ſupernatural intercourſe with Heaven, was cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with commiſſion and power from on high, and on trying emergencies had ſenſible teſtimonies and aid from GOD. But if our beloved WASHINGTON, from ſimilarity of circumſtances, was lead to make this Jewiſh leader his pattern, he has been a moſt hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable and dignified copyiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:037063_0008_100C3FB08BA2AB10"/>
When Moſes perceived his diſſolution at hand, he ſummoned the tribes of Iſrael around him, and addreſſes them upon their national hopes and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects—gives a general ſummary of their hiſtory ſince they came out of Egypt, repeats the ſtatutes and judgments that GOD had given, charging them to keep and do them if they would be wiſe, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, or happy. If the terms uſed by this Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Legiſlator are not perfectly ſynonimous, ſtatutes may refer to their religious obligations, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their civil and political, in the ſacred ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of which they ſhould ſecure proſperity at home, and renown abroad among the nations. <hi>For Religion and Righteouſneſs are the ſureſt Baſis of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Honor and Proſperity, and the direct means of Tranquillity and Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To national honor and glory, a due proportion of eminent talents, and of laudible acquirments in knowledge and virtue, are neceſſary. And they will excel, who have the moſt brilliant talents, happily united to moſt unſophiſticated integrity. Though men's talents are not originally of their own chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet what they are to ſociety, is generally the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of education.</p>
            <p>If there were no object of religion, and no moral government exerciſed over the world, yet the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and effects produced upon the human mind
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037063_0009_100C3FB231EB0D80"/>
and heart, by the belief and contemplation of infin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite perfection, have a natural, and almoſt mechanic tendency, to form the human character to great and noble conceptions, and to ſtimulate to worthy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and achievements. The mind in contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elevated and enlarged objects, is, from principles inſeperable from our nature, itſelf elevated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. The univerſe of being affords no object worthy to be compared, in elevation and dignity, with him whoſe name alone is JEHOVAH, and the only object of religious homage. The exerciſes and affections which the due contemplation of his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perfections, excite, ſtrengthen and invigorate the faculties of the man, repreſs and regulate the diſorderly propenſities, and form a baſis for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed mental and bodily exertions.</p>
            <p>If to a ſpeculative belief of the exiſtence of a GOD, be added a conſciouſneſs of a ſtate of friendſhip and reconciliation with him, and of intereſt in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the force of motive to virtuous deeds, and of reſtraint from vicious ones, is complete. What ſacrifices have been made, what dangers have been hazarded, what feats of valor have been achieved, for the benefit of nations, in the belief of the approving ſmiles of heaven, and in the hope of rewards which GOD only can beſtow? That in the nature of things, religion, as it conſiſts in the belief of a GOD, and in exerciſes and affections that ſuch a belief excites,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037063_0010_100C3FB58EB146B8"/>
forms inſtruments of national honor and proſperity, and is calculated to ſecure thoſe objects ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and important to any people. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the ſentence of an inſpired pen upon the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſenſual indulgencies, is, in its meaſure, true of every ſpecies and degree of impiety and immorality, 'They take away the heart.' They enervate and unman the body. They effeminate and debaſe the mind. They bring on premature decrepitude and death. In the vortex of ſenſuality, luxury, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, moſt nations have firſt ingulphed their nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al honor, ſtrength, and valor; and then their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional exiſtence.</p>
            <p>The natural tendency of religion to promote the honor and proſperity of a people, and to ſecure their peace and tranquility, receives infinite occaſion by its ſecuring to them the ſupernatural influence and benediction of heaven.</p>
            <p>Whatever attempts have been, or may be made, to obliterate a ſenſe of Deity, or efface impreſſions of his exiſtence from the human mind, the proofs of his exiſtence are, and ever will be, as numerous as the creatures that exiſt. "The inviſible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head." God's providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial inſpection and government are the neceſſary reſult of his exiſtence and perfections; which gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037063_0011_100C3FB715E210E8"/>
muſt be accommodated to the nature and capacities of its reſpective objects. As man is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and moral agent, the providential government of GOD, as it reſpects man, muſt be of the moral kind. And as nations exiſt, in their ſocial and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional capacities, only in this world, ſo the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of heaven towards them will be influenced by their religious and moral character and conduct. "Thoſe, who honor GOD, he will honor, but thoſe who deſpiſe him, he will lightly eſteem." The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of virtue, piety, and righteouſneſs, in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſecure the favor of him, whoſe it is to build and to plant, whoſe it is to make great, and give ſtrength unto all. His favor is life to a nation, no leſs than to an individual, and his loving kindneſs is the ſource of their honor, proſperity, and peace. "They, whom he bleſſes, are bleſſed;" and none can diſannul it. They, upon whom he frowns, muſt wither; for none can arreſt, or divert the effects of his diſpleaſure. So juſt and natural are theſe deductions and concluſions of reaſon, that a moſt eminent, correct and judicious writer has thought it proper to put the following expreſſions into the lips of a heathen: "If there's a power above us, and that there is, all nature cries aloud in all her works.

by explicit declarations from the ſource of unerring truth, of which innumerable might be adduced, ſimilar to theſe: "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry; but the face of the Lord is againſt them that do evil." "Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation; but ſin is the reproach of any people." Nay JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH himſelf has condeſcended to publiſh to us the rule of his adminiſtration towards nations. By the prophet Jeremiah, we hear him ſaying. "At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, to pull down, and to deſtroy, if that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, I will repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them." If this rule of adminiſtration was more appropriate to the nation to whom GOD gave his oracles direct, yet the terms in which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed forbid our confining it to them, and the hiſtory of GOD'S dealings with the nations of the earth; ſo far as it can be collected from authentic data, juſtifies its univerſal application.</p>
            <p>In the hiſtory of GOD'S ancient people, flowing from an inſpired ſource, we find a ſcrupulous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037063_0013_100C3FBAAABDD560"/>
of this rule. While they regarded the laws, ſtatutes, and ordinances of the Lord, "He ſuffered no man to harm them, yea, he reproved Kings for their ſakes; ſaying touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harm." "He gave them reſt on every ſide, made them to ride up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high places of the earth; he fed them with the fineſt of the wheat, and cauſed them to abound with all rich treaſure." Their renown went forth among other nations, and diſpoſed them to ſay, "What nation is ſo great, that hath GOD ſo nigh them." "What nation is ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgments ſo righteous." But on the other hand, when they forſook GOD, and bowed down to idols; when they diſregarded his ſtatutes, tranſgreſſed his commandments, and neglected his ordinances, wild and portentous clouds darkened their political hemiſphere, their ſtrength withered, the neighboring nations exacted upon them, and the ſword, the famine, or the peſtilence beſpoke the diſpleaſure of heaven, and called upon them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider from whence they had fallen, to repent, and return to the LORD. No part of the Jewiſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in any period of their exiſtence, is deſtitute of illuſtrations of theſe remarks: But the times of the Judges afford the moſt ſtriking comment upon the words of our text, and the fulleſt confirmation of the truth of our propoſition: That religion and righteouſneſs are the ſureſt baſis of national honor and proſperity, and the direct means of tranquility and peace.</p>

Happy would it be for every nation, who, to the law that was given by Moſes, have ſuperadded the grace and truth that came by Jeſus Chriſt, to revive an attention to this ſubject, and regard the charge of this renowned leader of Iſrael, to the people, who were to him dear as his own ſoul. Thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py would it be for the people of this land, who in various reſpects reſemble GOD'S ancient Iſrael, over whom the arm of power and mercy has been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly diſplayed, to harmonize their views, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and feelings in an enlightened belief, and ſacred regard of this inſpired charge, this incontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible maxim of ſound policy.</p>
            <p>An unpleaſant diverſity of ſentiment and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of opinion have ariſen in this country reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the line of political conduct, moſt directly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſecure our national honor, proſperity, and peace. National antipathy, and paſſionate national attachment have doubtleſs had their influence in originating and cheriſhing this ſtate of public ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the principal ground of hope to our enemies, of fear and anxiety to the diſintereſted patriot; which, the diſcerning eye of our revered Preſident foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his faithful tongue hath thus addreſſed us. "Inveterate antipathies againſt particular nations, and paſſionate attachments for others, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and in the place of them juſt and amicable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which indulges towards another an habitual
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037063_0015_100C3FBF0E45D2E8"/>
hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome degree, a ſlave. It is a ſlave to its animoſity or affection, either of which is ſufficient to lead it aſtray from its duty and its intereſt." Upon which ſubject our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſage continues to diſcourſe in ſentiments and expreſſions which deſerve to be indelibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on all our memories. While not perfectly harmonious in our views and apprehenſions, which in this ſtate of imperfection, is hardly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>It is a pleaſing and promiſing conſideration that the advocates of the reſpective opinions equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be warmed by the fire of patriotiſm, to be animated by a love to their country, and a deſire to ſecure and promote its beſt intereſt. If this be ſo, the unhappy diviſion is only the reſult of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſuch prejudices as are conſiſtent with integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and which time and reflection, candor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion will remove.</p>
            <p>But however accurate our ſentiments, or juſt our views, reſpecting the line of political conduct that this country ought to purſue, it is a truth, ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by experience, and confirmed by the voice of GOD, that it is only by combining with them reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and righteouſneſs, a ſacred regard to GOD and his authority, that we ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our name and praiſe among the nations of the earth: In contempt or neglect of theſe, no line of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037063_0016_100C3FC124E528F0"/>
policy, can procure for us, or ſecure to us, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary requiſites to national proſperity and glory. How accurately, upon this ſubject, thought and ſpake our beloved WASHINGTON. "Of all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to political proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, religion and morality are indiſpenſable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who would labor to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connections with public and private felicity.—And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined education, on minds of a peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail, in excluſion of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles."</p>
            <p>"It is ſubſtantially true that virtue or morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or leſs force to every ſpecies of free government. Who that is a friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to ſhake the foundation of the fabric."</p>
            <p>If then our boſoms glow with the ardor of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, if we are animated by a love of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037063_0017_100C3FC2CB955CD0"/>
and a ſincere deſire to promote her proſperity and glory—let us loſe all party feuds, animoſities, and contentions, in a conſcientious veneration of the great object of worſhip, and an exemplary obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all his precepts, and let the only conteſt among the enlightened citizens of America be, who ſhall excel in rational piety and exemplary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſo rival his competitors in exalted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm. "They who thus honor GOD, he will honor". "The meek he will guide in judgment, the meek he will teach his way." And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any err in judgment, under the ſecret influence of prejudice or affection, he will in time reveal it to them.</p>
            <p>A vicious, wicked and unprincipled man, who caſts off the fear of GOD, and ridicules the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of religion and righteouſneſs, though he may rejoice in national proſperity and peace, roils the fountain head of their exiſtence, and poiſons the channel through which they are conveyed. The pious fearers of GOD and workers of righteouſneſs are the chariots of a nation and the horſemen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The piety of Joſeph in the houſe of Potipher, and in the court of Pharaoh, procured to that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and nation a train of providential bleſſings. The impiety of Manaſſeh pulled down upon the nation of Iſrael tokens of divine diſpleaſure for ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations. Had there been but ten righteous perſons in the land of Sodom, for their ſake its awful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction would have been averted.</p>

While theſe remarks apply to all nations of the earth, they have a ſpecial emphaſis and energy with reference to our own. The manner in which Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was ſettled; the character, principles and views of our anceſtors, impoſe upon us ſpecial obligations to regard the ſtatutes and judgments of GOD. The purity in which GOD has preſerved his revealed religion to us, the extenſive religious, as well as civil privileges that he has indulged us; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable anſwers of prayer that he has given to his people in their exigencies, and manifeſtations of his power in their mounts of difficulty, would greatly aggravate their guilt, ſhould they turn from the Lord, and deſpiſe his ordinances: and our folly as well as guilt would be without a parellel, if, with the inſtructive admonition of the effects of infidelity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nations of Europe before our eyes, we ſhould ruſh head-long in the career, which has pulled down ſuch accumulated vengeance on their heads.</p>
            <p>A ſpirit of infidelity, diſplayed in a ſtudied en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to looſen and diſſolve the obligations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed religion, has long infected the nations of Europe, originating probably in high ſtation, it has deſcended through every grade, and has more or leſs leavened the whole lump. If ſome nations have been more active or zealous in the attempt, yet, according to the deciſion of the Savior in anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caſe, no one in this could have a face to caſt a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037063_0019_100C3FC74AC81DD8"/>
ſtone at his neighbour. Had we an inſpired hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who, while relating and deſcribing events as they have ariſen, could alſo declare the ſecret moral and remote cauſes of them. I doubt not, we ſhould hear him addreſſing the nations of Europe, under the awful calamities that threaten their exiſtence, in language like this "Have you not procured th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe things unto yourſelves, in that you have forſaken the LORD your GOD, and have deſpiſed his ſtatutes and contemned his ordinances, your own wickedneſs corrects you, and your backſlidings reprove you; know therefore and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter that you have forſaken the LORD your GOD."</p>
            <p>While we ſee little attempt in national humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, penitence, or reformations to remove the cauſe of the LORD'S controverſy, we may juſtly tremble at the probable iſſue, for when GOD contendeth, he will overcome. Nor is their any counſel, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or might, againſt the LORD. But we ſhould be more anxiouſly concerned, and feelingly alive to prevent or remove a ſimilar cauſe of divine controverſy with ourſelves.</p>
            <p>The ſeeds of infidelity have been long ſcattered in our country, a variety of cauſes have conſpired, within a few years paſt, to manure and cheriſh them, and they have ſprung up and ſpread with threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſpect. No longer confined to the retreats of

ſpeculation, nor to the amuſement, of the diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious circle; the principles have infected almoſt every rank, and ſhed a baneful practical influence. But with ſo ſolemn an example as the dreadful ſtate of Europe before our eyes; and with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated tokens of GOD'S diſpleaſure in peſtilential deſolations, heightened by the late ſudden removal of eminent characters; ſhall we not receive warning? ſhall we not be awakened to conſideration, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to return from whence we have apoſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſed, and recover the priſtine American veneration for GOD and his government, and practical regard to that glorious ſyſtem of truth and duty which he hath given and preſerved to us? This would be our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, this would be the means of our renown among the nations of the earth; and, what is more, it would ſecure to our riſing Republic, the guiding care, and protecting benediction of him whoſe it is to make great and give ſtrength unto all.</p>
            <p>May we not be encouraged to this duty by the fond, and, I would flatter myſelf, not enthuſiaſtic hope, that GOD deſigns America as the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſupporting his banner againſt the flood of infidelity that has deluged ſo great a part of the civilized world. Do not the views and principles with which this country was ſettled; its ſituation with reſpect to the nations of Europe; The remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpenſations of Heaven towards it with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037063_0021_100C3FCB34915238"/>
to her religious, as well as political intereſts, give rational ground for this hope? Is it not ſtrengthened by the reflection, that GOD reſerved an aſylum here for rational and conſtitutional liberty. He honored and ſucceeded the bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of freemen to ſecure their rights in a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of laws of their own making, adminiſtered by men of their own chooſing, and will GOD ſuffer the moſt eſſential prop of ſuch a government ſo ſoon to fail? Without a prevalence of virtue, republics cannot exiſt; without religion, virtue cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; and no religion affords ſo firm a baſis, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits ſuch animating motives, to the prevalence of virtue as that which brings life and immortality to light, and holds forth rewards and puniſhments ſtamped with eternity. If we retain any reverence for revelation, we muſt believe that GOD will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Church in the world. He may remove it from one place, but it ſhall ſettle in another. The gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. "The Kings of the earth may ſet themſelves and the rulers take counſel together, againſt the LORD and againſt his anointed, they may, preſumptuouſly ſay, "Let us break their bands aſunder and caſt away their cords from us:" but in the inimitable language of ſcripture, "He that ſitteth in the heavens will laugh, the LORD ſhall have them in deriſion; then ſhall he ſpeak to them in his wrath, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

not the friend of religion, of good order, of liberty and of righteouſneſs, encourage a rational hope that GOD will yet maintain his throne among us, and diſplay his banner, becauſe of truth, and may not every ſuch dignified patriot be encouraged in every rational exertion to revive a practical regard to the ſtatutes and judgments of the LORD our GOD.</p>
            <p>Let it not then be thought a vain repetition, if I again exhort my enlightened and reflecting fellow-citizens, to ſoften all their unpleaſant feelings, and emboſom all their party views in a united veneration for GOD and his government; and in a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and exemplary obſervance of his laws and inſtitutions. Thus ſhall we prove, that though we are men, and liable to err under the impreſſions to which humanity is ſubject, yet we are indeed the friends of our country, and would do every thing in our power to ſecure to it the ſhield and benediction of him, "who can make a little one to become a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong nation."</p>
            <p>If then there is any confidence to be placed in the deductions of reaſon, or any credit to be given to the declarations of ſcripture: We learn, from this ſubject, who are the true friends of any country, and the mean of ſecuring to it national honor and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. They are thoſe who, rationally and devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reverence, adore, and fear GOD, who keep his righteous judgments, and conſcienciouſly walk in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037063_0023_100C3FCF256E2358"/>
his ſtatutes and ordinances. I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to inſinuate that men void of religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and even contemners of religious duties, may not have an attachment to their country, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for its civil and political proſperity and glory; nay, they may expoſe themſelves to great dangers, and make great ſacrifices to accompliſh theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But by their impiety and profaneneſs they weaken the energy of thoſe inſpiring principles that ſerve to ennoble, invigorate, and enlarge the mind, and introduce practices that enervate and corrupt. They take away the heavenly defence and ſecurity of a people, and render it neceſſary for him who ruleth among the nations by righteous things in judgment, to teſtify his diſpleaſure againſt thoſe that deſpiſe his laws and contemn his ordinances. One ſinner deſtroys much good, and may be the occaſion of incalculable evil. In the preſent ſtate of the world Fleets and Armies are a neceſſary mean of ſecurity and defence; but they will eventually prove a broken reed to the nation that deſpiſes the GOD of armies, and pours contempt upon his authority. "There is no counſel, underſtanding or might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the LORD." He can diſappoint the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed plans of the wiſe Ahithophels, and ſhroud their flattering proſpects, in wild confuſion. The true fearer of GOD, and worker of righteouſneſs is the friend of his country and the mean of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and when ſuch is the character of the rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037063_0024_100C3FD11F18B950"/>
of any nation, her renown will go forth among her neighbours, and ſhe may calculate upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional honor, and proſperity.</p>
            <p>This ſubject directs the honeſt, independent, and patriotic citizen, in the exerciſe of his high birth-right as a freeman, in giving his ſuffrages for civil rulers. This, though a natural right of man, is enjoyed but by a very ſmall proportion of our race. They, who are dignified by the high privilege, ought to honor themſelves by a dignified exerciſe of it, and not careleſsly deſpiſe their birth-right, much leſs ſell it, at a leſs premium, than a meſs of pottage, to anſwer the purpoſes of pride, or paſſion; of envy or ambition.</p>
            <p>The character of a nation is juſtly decided by the character of their rulers, eſpecially in a free and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective government. And they have a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in confirming or changing the character of a people. If the rulers of a people are men of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, who fear GOD and obſerve his ſtatutes, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be owned in this approving light by him who ſuperintends the affairs of nations, and it will give a train to his providential diſpenſations. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery friend to his country, in the choice of civil rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ought to have his eye upon the faithful of the land, upon ſuch as fear GOD and regard his ſtatutes. It is to be expected, other things being equal, that we ſhould give our ſuffrages for men, whoſe political

            <p>Our Conſtitutions of Government have happily formed no religious eſtabliſhments, nor excluded any man of honorable integrity, from office; yet by their invariably inſtituting oaths as introductory to offices and qualifications for them.
