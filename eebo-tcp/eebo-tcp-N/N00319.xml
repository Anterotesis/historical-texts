            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Solomon being a man full of wiſdom was very obſervant of the Providences of God which hapned in the Place, and in the Age wherein he lived. He doth in this Chapter give us an account of ſome of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations that way. There is one ſpecial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in this Context <hi>viz.</hi> in the 15 verſe of this Chapter, where we have the <hi>wiſe man</hi> ſaying, <hi>There is a Juſt man that periſheth in his righteouſneſs, and there is a wicked man that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth his life in his wickedneſs.</hi> Now leſt any one ſhould abuſe this Doctrine of the juſt mans <hi>periſhing</hi> in his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and the wicked mans <hi>prolonging his life</hi> in his <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> He proceeds to a double exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He doth exhort to beware of Errors on the right hand <hi>ver.</hi> 16. where there are two Errors on the right hand mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Over much Righteouſneſs, <hi>Be not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous overmuch.</hi> Not that it is poſſible for any man to have more of real Goodneſs in him than he ought to have: but he may be more righteous in his own conceit, then he ſhould be, and he may be Superſtitious, he may add
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000394_0003_0FA5A898D1F4EC80"/>
to the Word of God which is the <hi>Rule</hi> of Righteouſneſs; Men may likewiſe be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in puniſhing offenders than the Rule does allow of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Corinthians did ſometimes err on that hand. And that is to be righteous over much.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Overmuch Wiſdome, <hi>Neither make thy ſelf overwiſe</hi>: Which muſt be underſtood as the former particular; A man may be wiſer in his own eyes then he ought to be, he may be wiſe above what is written, He may pry into the ſecrets of the Almighty, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to trace him whoſe wayes, are paſt finding out, and whoſe Footſteps are not known.</p>
            <p>And this Exhortation is urged from the Conſideration of the woful Effect of this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Wiſdom and Righteouſnes <hi>viz.</hi> Self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Why ſhouldſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?</hi> As the Moth that will venture too near to the Light, deſtroyeth it ſelf, ſo they that will be over-wiſe, and will needs know more then God would have them to know, deſtroy themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other Exhortation is againſt Errors on the <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Druſis Annot. in locum.</note> Left hand; of which there are two mentioned in this verſe &amp; in the words which have been read in oppoſition to the 2 former ſpoken of in the verſe immediately foregoing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be not overmuch wicked.</hi> q. d. though you muſt not be righteous over-much, yet take
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000394_0004_0FA5A89B931767C8"/>
heed of erring on the other extream, which our nature is moſt prone unto. The Hebrew word is [<hi>do not wickedly much.</hi>] not that the Preacher does allow of any wickedneſs at all, only his deſign is to ſhow the evil of all <hi>exceſs</hi> in wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Error on the left hand is Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs: <hi>Neither be thou fooliſh.</hi> Heb. <note n="*" place="bottom">Noli eſſe ſtultus. <hi>Hieron.</hi>
               </note> [<hi>neither be thou a fool.</hi>] becauſe all wickedneſs is <hi>folly,</hi> and ſinners are fools, as afterwards we ſhall ſhew. And this exhortation is likwiſe preſſed by an argument taken from the miſerable end that ſuch ſinners come to at laſt. God in his righteous Providence does many times ſo order that they dye before their time. <hi>Why ſhouldſt thou dye before thy time?</hi> It is as if it were ſaid, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Tametſi ut improbi in ſuis ſceleribus conſceneſcant, tamen <hi>epi to polu</hi> fit ut improborum brevis et contracta vita fit, <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> in loc.</note> Though it be ſo that here and there a wicked man doth prolong his life in his wickedneſs, yet for-any one thence to-imbolden himſelf in ſin, is the greateſt folly imaginable; for uſually it falls out otherwiſe, that wickedneſs doth <hi>ſhorten</hi> the dayes of thoſe that are guilty, of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> therefore from the words is,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That the Providence of God doth oftentimes ſo diſpoſe, as that an</hi> untimely death <hi>ſhall be the portion of him that hath been wicked over much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Doctrinal handling of this Truth,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000394_0005_0FA5A8A04A4F6F50"/>
Three Things may be attended; 1. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how any one may be ſaid to <hi>dye before his time.</hi> 2. What <hi>Over-much wickedneſs</hi> that <hi>is</hi> which is uſually followed with untimely death, or when one may be ſaid to be wicked <hi>over-much.</hi> 3. The Reaſons of the Doctrine, why God in his Providence doth often ſo diſpoſe as that an <hi>untimely</hi> death ſhall be the Portion of ſuch as have been wicked over-much.</p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>How can one be ſaid to dy before his time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Not in reſpect of the</hi> Decree <hi>of God.</hi> No man ſhall dye before the time which the Lord hath determined be fulfilled. The time of every mans death is appointed. Hence <hi>Job</hi> ſaith <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.14. <hi>All the dayes of my</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>time will I wait till my change come</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the 15 verſe of that Chapter it is ſaid, <hi>Seeing his dayes are determined, the number of his months are with thee, th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſt</hi> appointed <hi>his bounds that he cannot paſs.</hi> Not only the years but the moneths, nay the <hi>dayes</hi> which every man ſhall live are determined by the Lord, ſo as that he ſhall not live a <hi>day</hi> longer, nor die a <hi>day</hi> ſooner than was before appointed. But a man may be ſaid to dy before his time,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of his own expectation.</hi> He may die before ever he doth expect death; Hence ſinners are ſaid to die <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> 1. Theſ. 5.3. <hi>When they ſhall ſay peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them, as travel upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi> Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sudden
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000394_0006_0FA5B78D4695A758"/>
deſtruction cometh upon ſinners, i. e. not only which is in it ſelf ſudden, but as to their expectation ſo. Thus in the <hi>Parable</hi> concerning the wicked ſervant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.48, 49, 50. <hi>If that evil ſervant ſhall ſay, — my Lord</hi> delayeth <hi>his Coming,—the Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day when he looketh</hi> not <hi>for him, &amp; in an hour that he is not</hi> aware <hi>of.</hi> So doth he die before his time wherein he expected death is come. It is often ſo with them that have been very wicked and fooliſh; wherefore it is ſaid in the parable concerning the Fool when he thought he had many years to live <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>God ſaid unto him, thou Fool this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee.</hi>— Hence,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſinner may be ſaid to dye before his time, in reſpect of his preparation for a dying hour.</hi> Death may come upon him before he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to encounter with that enemy: and then he dyeth indeed, <hi>In dying he ſhall dye,</hi> if death find him unprepared, the <hi>ſecond</hi> death taketh hold on that ſoul. The Devils ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us before our time</hi>? Truly ſuch a ſoul go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the place of Torment before the time There is many a ſinner that death finds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, there is ſome ſin that he hath not repented of, nay it may be he hath not <hi>truly</hi> repented of ſo much as <hi>one</hi> ſin, and then he is not prepared to dye. It had been better for him that he had never been
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000394_0007_0FA5B78DB4A42688"/>
been born, than that he ſhould dye and go out of the world in that condition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A ſinner may dye before that time be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which according to the ordinary courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he might have lived.</hi> And this is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intended here in the Text, <hi>why ſhouldſt thou die before thy time?</hi> Hebr. <hi>and not in thy time,</hi> that is to ſay before that time which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary courſe of nature thou mighteſt have lived, be expired. Many times the Divine Providence doth ſo order as that they who have been wicked over-much ſhall not live out <hi>that</hi> time. Thus concerning the world of the ungodly which lived before the floud, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>Haſt thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden, who were cut down out of time</hi> Job. 22.15, 16. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Caryl on Job. <hi>22.16.</hi>
               </note> According to the ordinary courſe of nature, they might have lived a long time, but they were cut down by the ſtroke of Death. Wicked men never dye before they are ripe in ſin, but they often dye before they are ripe in nature. They are carried and chaſed out of the world by ſome violent death.</p>
            <p>Sometimes this is brought to paſs by the Lords immediate hand. If men be generally wicked over-much, the Lord ſends publique deſtroying Judgements whereby Thouſands dye before their time: So on the old world,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000394_0008_0FA5B78EB4AC0628"/>
ſo on Sodom and Gomorrha, in the morning they were well and likely to have lived many a fair day, but dead and damned before night. Thoſe ſore Judgements of Famine, Plague, and Sword, come and ſweep away multitudes before their time, when a people are become wicked over much. And particular Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do hence come upon partiular Perſons, whereby they are cut off before their time. There was that wicked <hi>Er,</hi> and his wicked brother <hi>Onan,</hi> did commit abominable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſs in the ſight of God, and therefore the <hi>Lord ſlew them</hi> that they <hi>dyed before their time.</hi> So <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were wicked over much, and there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they dyed before the Lord. <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices, <hi>wickedneſs was amongſt them and in their Dwellings,</hi> and as the Pſalmiſt (alluding to that very Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſpeaketh, <hi>Death ſeized upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they went down quick into hell.</hi> Pſal. 55.15. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were wicked over much when they committed Sacriledge, and alſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and lyed in a Church Aſſembly, where there is a ſpecial preſence of the Spirit of God and thence became guilty of Lying to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, wherefore firſt the one of them fell down, &amp; gave up the ghoſt, &amp; then the other, and thence were both caſt into one grave, and this before their time. The Scripture is full of awful Inſtances to this purpoſe. Again,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000394_0009_0FA5B79151761F90"/>
ſometimes Gods Vicegerents are improved as his executioners of his wrath and juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch ſinners. The Magiſtrate beareth not the Sword in vain, but is the Miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Hence <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes ſaying, <hi>I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off the wicked doers from the city of the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 101.8. I will early deſtroy them, in the Original it is <hi>in the morning</hi> I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, becauſe in thoſe times Malefactors were executed in the Morning, and thats his meaning, that he would ſee execution done upon Capital Offenders. Thus <hi>Saul</hi>'s curſed poſterity was cut off by the hand of Juſtice, becauſe of the Murder which their Father had committed, and no doubt but they had been ſome way acceſſary, in conſenting or aprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not duly bearing witneſs againſt that iniquity.</p>
            <p>Sometimes again, The Lord in a Judicial way giveth up ſuch ſinners to the power of Satan and their own Corruptions, ſo as that they become their own executioners, as we ſee in Judas, who after he had brought himſelf under the guilt of inocent bloud, went to the Halter to let out his wretched ſoul.</p>
            <p>But thus much may ſuffice to be ſpoken to the firſt enquiry.</p>
            <p>We come to the ſecond thing propounded,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Murther</hi> is a great and horrid Wickedneſs, and ſo Capital as that whoever has been guilty of it may in no caſe be pardoned by man. <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.30 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

The Jews have a Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Lamech</hi> killed Cain and a young man that was with him hunting in the woods; To this purpoſe ſome underſtand that place (our Verſion doth evidently favour that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation) <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Lamech ſaid I have ſlain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

            </p>
            <p>Many other inſtances are recorded in Script<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure and in humane writings all confirming the truth of this. Yea, God from Heaven doth

How often have the Fowls of heaven, and the dumb Beaſts of the earth brought Murther to light!</p>
            <p>The Story <note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch.</note> is ancient and famous concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Beſſus,</hi> who had murthered his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſometime after the ſwallows making a noiſe in the Chimney (as it is the manner of thoſe birds to do) His guilty Conſcience was affraid they had told of him, whereupon he goeth to kill the Swallows, and being asked the reaſon, why (ſaid he) the ſwallows do nothing but ſay <hi>Beſſus hath kill'd his Father, Beſſus hath kill'd his Father</hi>: Whereby he was ſuſpected, and upon Examination confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fact.</p>

            <p>Again, <hi>Rebellion</hi> is a Crime which they that are guilty of are <hi>wicked over much.</hi> When in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors ſhall wickedly riſe up againſt Superiors.

            </p>
            <p>So when Children ſhall rebel againſt their Parents their wickedneſs is <hi>exceſſively great</hi>: And ſuch Children do uſually dye before their time, witneſs the fifth Commandment where it is ſaid, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> Therefore they that break this Commandment may expect that their days ſhall not be long, but they <hi>ſhall dye before their time.</hi> We ſee it in Abſolom, he was a rebellious Child, and what came of him? was he not hang'd at laſt? and three darts thruſt through his heart while he was yet alive: Travellers report that in the ſame place where Abſolom was buried, there is now a vaſt heap of ſtones which is come to paſs by this means; It is cuſtomary for every one that paſſeth by that place, to throw a ſtone upon Abſolom, uſing theſe words, <hi>Thus ſhall it be done to the ſon that rebells againſt his Father,</hi> Thus ſhall it be done to the Child that riſeth up againſt his Parents.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When a man ſhall multiply tranſgreſſion</hi>; then he may be ſaid to be <hi>wicked over much.</hi> When he ſhall commit the ſame ſin over and over again. Once is too much, but many times is <hi>over much</hi> indeed. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Though a

            <p n="4">4. <hi>They that are incorrigible in the waies of ſin,</hi> are <hi>wicked over much.</hi> Who ſin againſt all meanes that can be uſed to reclaim them.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000394_0017_0FA5B796AC74C878"/>
evidence a deſperately wicked man. It is ſpoken concerning a man that is beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wicked, that he doth <hi>run upon the thick Boſſes of the Buckler of the Almighty</hi> Job. 15.26. What is the Buckler of the Almighty? It is the Word of God. And what are the thick Boſſes of that Buckler? They are the Threatnings and Sanctions annexed to that Word. When ſinners ſhall tranſgreſs in a Land where there are Lawes eſtabliſhed and regulated according to the Word of God, and thoſe Lawes faithfully executed, they <hi>run themſelves upon the thick Boſſes of the Buckler of the ALMIGHTY,</hi> and therefore are deſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately wicked. And there are that ſin againſt the Light of the Goſpel and repoofs adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Word and Name of God: ſuch are <hi>wicked over much,</hi> and have cauſe to fear that they ſhall <hi>dye before their time.</hi> witneſs that awful Scripture <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reproved and hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deſtroyed and that without remedy.</hi> And there are that deſpiſe reproofs, inſtructions, admonitions, exhortations, privately adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in Families, by Maſters, Parents; ſuch are alſo <hi>wicked over much,</hi> and do often <hi>dy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time</hi>: Witneſs the ſons of <hi>Eli,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>they hearkned not to the voice of their Father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25.

to him? This is a ſign that <hi>the Lord will ſlay thee.</hi> Remember thoſe proud and prophane young men, the ſons of <hi>Eli</hi> they regarded not what their Father ſaid to them, and therefore they dyed before their time. This cometh of not hearkning to the voyce of a Father.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>They that mind nothing but the things of this world and the vanities and luſts thereof, are wicked overmuch.</hi> Even they that live like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts <hi>without God in the world.</hi> And this laſt particular ſuits with the ſcope of this Context. For as they are <hi>righteous over much</hi> who under pretence of Religion neglect their particular Callings; So they are <hi>wicked</hi> over much who neglect duties of Religion out of reſpect to the world. There are that live in continual neglect of God and of their own ſouls and Salvation; Hence no prayer it may be not ſo much as in the <hi>Family,</hi> no Reading of the Scriptures, no Meditation, no ſelf-Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How do men live as if there were no world but this! as if there were no God to ſerve, and they had no ſouls to ſave!

            </p>
            <p>And thus have we done with the ſecond thing propounded in order to the clearing of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> before us. We come to the <hi>third</hi> Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> To enquire into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Doctrine,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:000394_0019_0FA5B79830FA6420"/>Queſt. 3. <hi>Why doth God in his Providence oftentimes ſo diſpoſe as that an</hi> untimely death <hi>ſhall be the Portion of him that hath been wicked over much?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Anſwer, we ſhall only mention two <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> breifly.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>The Lord doth this that He may manifeſt his righteous Diſpleaſure againſt ſin.</hi> Hab. 1.13. <hi>He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity,</hi> that is to ſay with aprobation, or without deteſtation and Indignation againſt ſin. The Bleſſed holy God doth bear an infinite deteſtation and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Sin. Hence He leaveth <hi>Marks of his Diſpleaſure</hi> upon the ſinner. As God ſet a Mark upon Cain's forehead; ſo He ſets a Mark of Diſpleaſure upon notorious Tranſgreſſors. Yea ſometimes when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth the ſin, yet he doth viſit with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral vengeance, that ſo the world might ſee that ſin is odious and abominable in the ſight of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence ſuch ſinners as the Text ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, muſt <hi>dye before their time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reaſ. 2. <hi>That ſo others may thereby be warned and deterred from the Commiſſion of the like evils.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife, ſhe dyed before her time, that ſo others might be warned by her Example, to beware of becoming guilty of the ſame ſin, which ſhe was ſo awfully puniſhed for: therefore Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.32. <hi>Remember Lot's wife</hi>: meaning
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000394_0020_0FA5B798DCC900D8"/>
               <hi>ſo</hi> remember her, as that you may for ever take heed of doing as ſhe did. She was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a <hi>pillar of Salt,</hi> that others might be ſeaſoned thereby and preſerved from the like evil. God is wiſe and wonderful in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and knoweth how to order the death of <hi>two or three</hi> ſo as to prevent the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>many</hi> thereby. Hence He has appointed that Juſtice ſhall be <hi>executed</hi> in a <hi>Solemn</hi> way upon <hi>Capital offenders,</hi> that others may hear and fear and none may doe any more ſo wickedly. We find the Lord Himſelf giveth this reaſon of this matter <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.8,— 11. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hearken unto him neither ſhall thine eye pitty him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare, but thou ſhalt ſurely kill him: And all Iſrael ſhall hear &amp; fear and ſhall doe no more any ſuch wickedneſs as this is among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come now to apply this Doctrine. There are two Uſes to be inſiſted on, 1. by way of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> or <hi>Information,</hi> 2. by way of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Information.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inform. 1. <hi>We may ſee by this, that Sin is the greateſt Folly in the world.</hi> Well might <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay as in the Text, <hi>neither be thou fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> For to ſin and doe wickedly, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fooliſhneſs that ever was or can be. Sin is a Departure from the Rule of Wiſdome. For a man to part with his life for <hi>nothing?</hi> is
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000394_0021_0FA5B79DC606C920"/>
not that monſtrous Folly? And thus doth a wretched ſinner doe. Mens ſins are unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of darkneſs. <hi>What profit had you of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> Sin is the moſt unprofitable thing in the world: It is good for nothing, neither for body, nor Soul, nor Name, nor Eſtate, but brings Death and Ruin upon all. A man by Sin (eſpecially ſome ſins) looſeth his Name. <hi>A wound and diſhonour doth he get, and a reproach that ſhall not be wiped away.</hi> And he looſeth his life, and that <hi>before his time</hi> as the Text ſheweth; yea and without Repentance will loſe his ſoul for ever. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me wrongs his own ſoul.</hi> The Impenitent Sinner brings ruin upon his own ſoul. Therefore Sin is folly, and the more ſinful the more fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh: The greateſt ſinners, are the greateſt <hi>Fools</hi> in the world. Wherefore it is ſaid <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.3. <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is full of evil, and madneſs is in their heart while they live, and after that they goe to the dead.</hi> Yea to the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! Oh what horrible madneſs is it, for any man, that ſo he may enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, to venture the eternal Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his precious and immortal ſoul.</p>
            <p>Inform. 2. <hi>It follows from hence, that Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of dayes is in it ſelf a Judgement.</hi> For it is threatned as a puniſhment or wickedneſs. It is a fruit of ſin, and of the curſe: If Adam had
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000394_0022_0FA5B7A090424EC8"/>
not ſinned there would have been no ſhort lives, none of his Poſterity ſhould have had their lives ſhortned. And in the times of the Reſtitution of all things, when the Curſe ſhall be removed, it will not be as at this day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. <hi>There ſhall be no more death.</hi> To be ſure there ſhall be no more ſuch <hi>untimely</hi> death as our eyes do with ſadneſs behold this day. Look, as <hi>long life</hi> is in it ſelf a bleſſing, and therefore is promiſed as ſuch in the Scripture <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.16. <hi>With long life will I ſatisfie him,</hi> Prov. 4.10. <hi>Receive my ſayings, and the years of thy life ſhall be many</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 10.27. <hi>The fear of the Lord prolongeth dayes.</hi> Whatever any true believer hath done or ſuffered for, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, whilſt he was in the world, ſhall come in upon the account at the laſt and great day, a glorious reward of mercy ſhall be given for it; thence is it ſo great a mercy to live long. So on the other hand, Short life is a great Judgment, and is often threatned as ſuch in the Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.27. <hi>The years of the wicked ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> Eccleſ. 8.13. <hi>Neither ſhall be prolong his dayes.</hi> And it is mentioned as an heavy imprecation, Pſal. 109.8. <hi>Let his dayes be few.</hi> For when a wicked man dyeth (dying in his ſins) he is undone for ever: when once his body is <hi>gone down into the pit</hi> of the grave, and his ſoul is <hi>gone down into the pit</hi> of eternal Darkneſs, he cannot hope for the mercy of God, he cannot
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000394_0023_0FA5B7A2C5035340"/>
hope for pardon of his Sin, he cannot hope for the ſalvation of his ſoul. Therefore ſhort life is in it ſelf a judgment. Only as to the Elect of God it is turned into mercy. As Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are in themſelves evil, and fruits of the Curſe, but to Believers they become the greateſt bleſſings: So an untimely death is in it ſelf a great evil, but to one that belongs to the Election of Grace, it becometh a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mercy, for it haſteneth his eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory.</p>
            <p>Inform. 3. <hi>Hence it likewiſe follows, that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is the way to obtain Long Life.</hi> If Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bring untimely death, then <hi>Righteouſneſs will deliver from death.</hi> There is no righteous man but ſhall live in this world ſo long as life ſhall be good for him to enjoy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome one will ſay, do we not ſee that good men dye when they are <hi>young</hi> as well as others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very true: As there are ſome that are <hi>too wicked to live long</hi>; So there are others that are <hi>too</hi> good <hi>to live long,</hi> in ſuch an evil wretched world as this. Jeroboam's godly Son dyed in his youth. Joſiah a moſt eminent ſervant of the Lord, dyed in the midſt of his dayes. Enoch, though the beſt man, and the beſt Miniſter of God in all the world in his time, was taken out of the world before he had lived half ſo long as men in thoſe dayes
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000394_0024_0FA5B7A36C4E3190"/>
were wont to live: but then it would not be good for them to live any longer. God is <hi>only wiſe</hi> and faithful, and therefore He takes his ſervants to himſelf when he ſeeth that life will not be beſt for them. Beſides, a man may live <hi>long in a little time</hi>: It is ſaid <hi>the child ſhall dye an hundred years old</hi> Iſa. 65.20. Tho' a child in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of years, yet he ſhall have the grace &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, the wiſdom and knowledg of a man that has liv'd an hundred years. And indeed that is moſt deſirable. It is a great Mercy in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, to be freed from the prevailing Infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of old age, and therfore to live <hi>long</hi> in a <hi>little time</hi> is moſt deſirable. As I remember Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in an Epiſtle which he hath prefixed to one of Mr <hi>Norton</hi>'s <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr Cotton's Epiſtle before Mr. Norton's Orthodox Evangeliſt.</note> Books taketh notice of it with reſpect to Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> that it was <hi>his conſtant deſire affectation and expreſſion, that he might live long in a little time,</hi> and the Lord grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him his deſire of heart therein. Some live longer in ſeven years, than others do in <hi>ten</hi> times ſeven years. They <hi>doe</hi> more for God, and more for his People in ſeven years, than others doe in twenty, forty, threeſcore, or in fourſcore years. Moreover that promiſe of <hi>long life</hi> will be fulfilled to the righteous in the life to come. As indeed all promiſes (and threatnings too) are fully accompliſhed in the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000394_0025_0FA5B7A42859CDB0"/>
world to come. <hi>There</hi> the righteous ſhall <hi>live for ever.</hi> It was promiſed to Chriſt, that he ſhould be ſatisfied with long life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. <hi>ult.</hi> And that he ſhould <hi>prolong his dayes,</hi> Iſa. 53.10. Yet we know that Chriſt was not in this world much above two and thirty years: how then did he prolong his dayes? in the other world his dayes are prolonged to <hi>Eternity,</hi> according to the Scripture <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.4. <hi>He asked life of thee, and thou gaveſt it him, length of dayes for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Let it be a word of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Here is a <hi>general</hi> word of Exhortation, 2. more particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us all be exhorted to make a right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſuch awful Providences as the Text ſpeaks of.</hi> There is ſuch a providence before us this day, which has occaſioned me to ſpeak from theſe words at this time: For truly I think God would not have us ſuffer ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn awful Providences as theſe to paſs away without taking ſpecial notice of them, and making ſome good improvement thereof.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, <hi>But what uſe ſhall we make of this awful Providence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>It ſhould cauſe us humbly to reflect upon our own vile natures.</hi> Have we been kept from the like Evils that others have been guilty of? no thanks to our own hearts, for we have the <hi>ſame</hi> nature that they have, and if God had given us up to our own hearts luſts, we ſhould
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000394_0026_0FA5B7A4EE4083E0"/>
have been as bad as they, or as any of the Children of men that ever were in the world. Wherefore the Apoſtle in the third Chapter to the Romans, diſcourſing of the ſtate of men by nature, ſaith, <hi>Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood</hi> ver, 15. Why; is every natural man a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer? Truly he hath a <hi>murderers heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him,</hi> and he would quickly ſhed bloud, he would actually commit murder, if God did not reſtrain him. How ſhould this thought humble us and make us vile in our own eyes! As I remember it is ſtoried concerning that <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Bradford.</note> Bleſſed Martyr, that if he did hear of any that were condemned or accuſed on the aceount of Witchcraft, Murder, Robberies, or any other Impiety. He would ſmite upon his breaſt and ſay, <hi>In this breaſt of mine, is that which would have cauſed me to have been guilty of the ſame evil if the Grace of God had not prevented me.</hi> And it is recorded of one of the Ancients <note n="†" place="bottom">Bernard.</note> That he was never told of any great wickedneſs committed by others, but it did him ſome good. It made him the more diſtruſtful of his own heart; He would ſay, <hi>Ille heri, tu hodie, ego cras: He</hi> committed that ſin yeſterday, <hi>thou</hi> diſt commit the ſame ſin to day, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall commit it to morrow, if the Grace of God do not reſtrain and prevent me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Uſe which we ſhould make of this awful Providence is, <hi>To Conſider ſadly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000394_0027_0FA5B7A5A2C9A7A8"/>
whether there be not ſome prevailing evil, that the Lord doth hereby rebuke and ſeek to humble us for.</hi> I fear there is ſuch an evil, I mean with reſpect to thoſe woful breaches of the <hi>fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which are to be found amongſt us. This is a prevailing evil, we may ſee it every where. How do inferiors riſe up againſt Superiors! Look into the Common wealth, and we ſhall find that Magiſtrates are not honoured and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in their places as ought to be. Look into Churches, and how do ſome carry it there as if the Scripture were <hi>Apochrypha!</hi> even that Scripture <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. where it is ſaid <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves for they watch over your ſouls.</hi> Look into Schools, and how do children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and deſpiſe and diſobey their Maſters, contrary to the fifth Commandment! Look into Families, and Oh what diſobedient child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O what unruly ſervants may we find there! Nay Look into the ſtreets, and there we may find and obſerve (I have ſometimes beheld it, not altogether without greif and ſhame) <hi>the Child behaving himſelf proudly againſt the ancient, and the baſe againſt the honourable</hi>: ſo that in this reſpect <hi>New-England</hi> is in a great meaſure become degenerate from the GOOD MANNERS of the <hi>Chriſtian world</hi>: If there be any prevailing iniquity in <hi>New-eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> this is it. And therefore no marvel that ſuch an awful Providence doth come to rebuke
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000394_0028_0FA5B7A6853CAAF0"/>
&amp; humble us: that ſervants have conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to kill their Maſter. There has been no ſuch deed done or ſeen in our Iſrael before now. And mark what I ſay, If ever New-Enland be deſtroyed, this very ſin of diſobedience to the <hi>fifth Commandment</hi> will be the ruin of this Land.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Uſe we ſhould make of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicence is, <hi>to beware of thoſe ſins which do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times end in untimely death.</hi> Pride is one of thoſe ſins. <hi>Corah</hi> was a proud man, he could not bear to be ſubject to that order neither in Church nor Common-wealth, which God had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and He <hi>dyed not the common death of all men. Haman</hi> was exceeding proud &amp; high minded, and his pride brought him to the Gallows at laſt. But what need we go far for Examples? One of theſe poor condemned Creatures that is here ſtanding before the Lord this day, ſaith that he thinks his pride has been his ruin: I asked him the other day in the Priſon, what ſin it was that he thought in his Conſcience God was provok'd with him for, ſo as to leave him to that which has brought him under this Condemnation? He told me he thought it was for his Pride.
<q>For he thought much of it that ſuch an one as <hi>He</hi> ſhould be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</q>
(and he ſometimes uſed ſuch words as theſe)
<q>I am fleſh and bloud as well as my <hi>Maſter &amp;</hi> therefore I know no reaſon why my Maſter ſhould not obey <hi>me</hi> as well as I obey <hi>him.</hi>
               </q>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:000394_0029_0FA5B7A757E59590"/>
did he ſay, and now we ſee what his Pride hath brought him to: therefore beware of that ſin.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Idleneſs is a ſin</hi> that doth bring many to a miſerable end at laſt. It was one of thoſe ſins which cauſed Thouſands in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi> to <hi>dye before their time</hi> in a dreadful manner. As for one of thoſe poor condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creatures, <hi>Idleneſs</hi> hath been his Bane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would not diligently follow the Calling which he was ſet in, but lived an Idle vagrant life, and what is he now come to! Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of that ſin.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Diſobedience to Parents</hi> is a ſin that is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en puniſhed with <hi>untimely death.</hi> (as was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated before) One of theſe that are to be executed this day, doth confeſs that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his Parents has provok'd the Lord to bring this miſery upon him. He ſaith that when he was a child his father gave him good inſtructions &amp; prayed for him, but he regarded it not, His father would have had him gone to School, but he would not, his father would have had him gone to a Trade but he would not, and after his Father was dead he would not be ſubject to thoſe that had the care and Charge of him, but ran away from them, and ſince that from time to time has run away from them that have been his Maſters. And now behold what all this Diſobedience hath brought him unto! All you <hi>diſobedient children</hi> that are here before the Lord this day, hearken to the word of the Lord, there is a Scripture
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000394_0030_0FA5B7A9F4518E00"/>
which methinks ſhould ſtrike terrour &amp; tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into your ſouls, it is that <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17. <hi>The eye that mocketh his father and deſpiſeth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his mother, the ravens of the valley ſhall pick it out &amp; the young eagles eat it.</hi> The <hi>eye</hi> that mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his father. Stuborneſs and contempt is to be ſeen in the eye, therefore the meaning is, that he that is ſtubborn and rebellious againſt his father ſhall be ſo dealt with. Well, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath many times that Wiſdom and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with him that the child dare not diſobey <hi>him,</hi> but he careth not for his <hi>mother</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's added, <hi>he that deſpiſeth to obey his mother.</hi> You children that diſobey your mothers, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to this, the Ravens are like to feed upon you: that is to ſay ſuch ſinners ſhall come to an untimely death, and it may be not have a decent honourable burial: it is to be fear'd that ſuch children will come to the Gallows, and be hang'd up in Gibbets for the Ravens &amp; Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles to feed upon them if they will. And it is greatly to be obſerved, that the moſt of thoſe that dy upon the Gallows, do confeſs that they have been guilty of diſobedience to Parents. Yea, God is ſo provoked with ſuch wicked children, as that he does ſometimes leave them againſt nature to deſtroy themſelves, as a juſt puniſhment of unnatural diſobedience. There was an awful example of this, which hapned in this Countrey about fifteen years agoe: I was not my ſelf in this Land at that time, but I have had an account of it from thoſe that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000394_0031_0FA5B7AA5BB5E710"/>
that knew it. A young man * drowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but before he did that he left a writing directed to his Father, wherein he had ſuch words as theſe, <hi>O Father, I have kept my ſoul as long as ever I could, my ruin was the pride &amp; ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs of my tender years, which ſhould have been fetch'd out with ſharp Correction: and evil counſel and company has been my undoing. I have a youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that follows my ſteps, he is going the wide way to deſtruction, I beſeech you take pains with him, and</hi> correct <hi>him as well as counſel him, that he may not be undone ſoul &amp; body as well as I.</hi> Words to this purpoſe did that periſhing young man (tho' the ſon of a Godly Father) write when he was going into Eternity. You <hi>diſobedient children,</hi> think of it. And the Lord ſtrike it home to your hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is a ſin that often brings thoſe that are guilty of it to a miſerable end at laſt. A vile creature it may, be when he is drunk, he will goe and drown himſelf, and his ſoul go down into eternal darkneſs in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or he will commit ſome horrid ſin, for which the Sword of Juſtice will cut him off. When he is drunk he will commit Adultry, or a Rape it may, Alas we hear that ſuch a Vill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any hath been commited of late, in a Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not far off; Or in his drink hee'le kill a man, and ſo <hi>dye before his time.</hi> Therefore beware of that ſin.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Coveteouſneſs</hi> is a ſin, which many times
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000394_0032_0FA5B7ADAC1D26E0"/>
brings <hi>untimely: death,</hi> it did ſo upon <hi>Achan.</hi> The <hi>love of Mony is the root of all evil.</hi> This has occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned many a bloudy yea <hi>unnatural</hi> Murther. <note n="‖" place="bottom">v. Clarks Examp. vol. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>458.</hi>

            <p>A few Conſiderations and Directions let me ſpread before you. Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That you have been wicked over much.</hi> The ſin which you are now to die for is <hi>exceeding great,</hi> even <hi>Murther</hi>! the Scripture ſays that <hi>no murderer hath eternal life.</hi> And again, that <hi>Murderers ſhall have their part in that lake which burns with fire &amp; brimſtone which is the ſecond death.</hi> And no doubt you have bin guilty of many other grievous ſins, which have provoked the Lord to leave you unto the commiſſion of this horrid <hi>murder.</hi> This <hi>murder</hi> alſo is exceedingly <hi>aggravated</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>perſon</hi> whom you have ſlain, even <hi>your maſter</hi>! O how have you riſen up in rebellion againſt the glorious Image of God, not only in that you have <hi>ſhed the bloud of a man</hi> who was <hi>made after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God,</hi> but <hi>ſuch a man</hi> as had <hi>peculiar domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over you,</hi> in that reſpect you have offered fearful violence to the ſacred <hi>Image of the bleſſed God.</hi> So that you have tranſgreſt the 5<hi>th</hi> and 6<hi>th Commandments</hi> at once in the higheſt degree that you could doe.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000394_0035_0FA5B7AF5CE1A958"/>
and ſince your <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> yea <hi>conviction</hi> &amp; <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, you have told many lies</hi> (at leaſt one of you, it is to be fear'd both of you) <hi>againſt your conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider that <hi>now you muſt die before your time.</hi> eſpecially one of you a poor <hi>young</hi> creature that has hardly liv'd 20 years in this world, and muſt this day be turned out of it: yea both of you <hi>dye before your time.</hi> You might according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of nature have lived many a year. You muſt be <hi>cut off</hi> by a violent and dreadful <hi>death.</hi> For indeed the anger of the Lord would fall upon this whole countrey where your ſin has been committed, if you ſhould be ſuffered to live.</p>

And know that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God, came to ſave the</hi> chief <hi>of ſinners.</hi> There is merit &amp; righteouſneſs enough in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>He was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> &amp; <hi>wounded for our tranſgreſſions.</hi> The wounds of Chriſt can make amends for <hi>thoſe wounds</hi> which you gave your Maſter, when you ſlew him.

There's no repenting in the Grave, no believing in <hi>Hell.

            <p>By way of <hi>Direction</hi> I ſhall ſpeak 2 or 3 words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Do what you can that God may have glory by you, that little time that you have to live.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee that you ſolemnly warn others, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>young ones</hi>) to take heed of thoſe evils which your conſciences tell you have <hi>made way,</hi> for your deſtruction. And ſee that you be ſincere &amp; inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous in making Confeſſion of your ſin. The Scripture ſaith <hi>If we confeſs our ſins,</hi> i. e. with a penitent broken heart, deſirous never more to Commit them, <hi>God is faithful to forgive them</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And again, <hi>He that confeſſeth &amp; forſaketh ſhall find mercy, but he that hideth his ſin ſhall not proſper.</hi> I charge you in the Name of God, as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it by and by before his Judgement ſeat, that you do not deny or diſown what you know is truth: &amp; <hi>I</hi> urge this the rather, becauſe you have not been ſo ingenuous in confeſſing your evil as God and men have expected from you. You ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and impeach one another. The one of you ſays, that the other kill'd his Maſter, and you only ſtood by and did not ſtrike one blow, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000394_0038_0FA5B7B41FDAF010"/>
ſo doth the other ſay; you accuſe him and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes you. But deceive not your ſelves, if you deny what you know is truth, tho' God be moſt merciful, yet God that made you will not have mercy on you, and tho' Chriſt be a Saviour for great ſinners, He then will not ſave you. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil has brought your bodies to ruin, and now his great deſign is to deſtroy your ſouls; He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if he can perſwade you not to give glory to God by <hi>confeſſing,</hi> he ſhall have your ſouls for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I tell you truly if you now diſown the truth, when once your ſouls are out of your bodies, they ſhall ſuffer the Vengeance of Eternal fire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Look up to God in Jeſus Chriſt, that he would give you Repentance</hi> &amp; <hi>Faith unfeigned.</hi> You cannot convert your ſelves, but God can do it: therefore look up to him for that end, and cry mightily to him as for your lives. If the Magiſtrate ſhould ſay to you (they may not ſay ſo, for then the diſpleaſure of God would come upon them &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this people) that if you would cry earneſtly for your lives you ſhould have them, O how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt would you be? Behold the God of Gods ſaith to you this day (and in his Name I proclaim it) that if you ſeek unto him with all your hearts, it is poſſible that the ſentence of <hi>eternal</hi> death which is upon your ſouls may be revoked. Oh then pray for the lives of your ſouls. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is ſtoried of a poor woman that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, as ſoon as the ſentence was paſt, ſhe fell a crying and ſhrieking in a lamentable

manner, the Judge rebuked her and bad her hold her peace, but ſhe replied <hi>O my Lord it is for my life, it is for my life.</hi> So I ſay to you, O cry to the Lord for Grace and pardoning Mercy, it is for the lives of your <hi>ſouls,</hi> yea it is for the lives of your <hi>Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further to Awaken hereunto,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Think ſadly of Eternity.</hi> O ETERNITY ETERNITY! It is an Amazing Meditation. There was a man that ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">Mentioned by Dr. <hi>Preſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on <hi>the Attributes, Page.</hi> 165.</note> 
               <hi>If I were to endure the wrath of God for a Thouſand years only, methinks of could bear it; but when I think of ETERNITY I am Amazed.</hi> I Beſeech you think ſeriouſly of this. I might Charge you, and I do ſo in the Name of God, but I alſo <hi>beſeech</hi> you, though you are poor, vile, Condemned Creatures, yet as I ſaid to you in the Priſon, ſo I ſay in this ſolemn Audience. <hi>I could be content to lye down at your feet, upon condition that I might be Inſtrumental of good to your ſouls.</hi> So greatly do I deſire (God is witneſs) your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Therefore I pray you for the <hi>Lord's ſake,</hi> I pray you for your immortal <hi>Souls ſake,</hi> that you would by theſe things to heart, and we will once more cry unto the Lord that He would have Mercy and Compaſſion upon thoſe precious and immortal ſouls of yours.</p>
