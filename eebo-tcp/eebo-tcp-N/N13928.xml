            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOUR account of our friend's ſtate of health, gives me much concern; the more, as I cannot approve the change he has made of a phyſician. You ſay, the Doctor, under whoſe care he is at preſent, has employed his mind ſo entirely, in medical reſearches, that he ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplays a grain of common ſenſe, when the converſation turns on any other ſubject; and that, although he ſeems opinionative, vain, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious in his profeſſion, and full of falſe and abſurd ideas, in the common affairs of life, yet he is a very able phyſician, and has performed many wonderful cures. Be aſſured, my dear Sir, that this is impoſſible; for medical ſkill is not like the rod of an inchanter, which may be found
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017607_0009_0FA1DAAD6D70A508"/>
accidentally, and which transfers its miraculous powers indiſcriminately, to a blockhead, or a man of ſenſe. The number of weak, goſſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping men, who have made fortunes by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, do not prove the contrary. I do not ſay, that men, of that kind, cannot make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; I only aſſert, they are not the moſt likely to cure diſeaſes. An intereſt with the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, nurſes, and a few talkative old ladies, will enable them to do the firſt; but a clear underſtanding, and a conſiderable ſhare of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſagacity are qualities eſſentially neceſſary for the ſecond, and for every buſineſs which requires reflection. Without theſe, falſe inferences will be drawn from experience itſelf; and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will tend to confirm a man in his errors, and to render him more completely a coxcomb.</p>
            <p>The profeſſion of phyſic is that, of all others, in which the generality of mankind have the feweſt lights, by which they can diſcern the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of its profeſſors; becauſe the ſtudies which lead to it are more out of the road of

uſual education, and the practice more inveloped in technical terms and hieroglyphical ſigns. But I imagine the ſafeſt criterion by which men, who have not been bred to that profeſſion, can form a judgment of thoſe who have, is, the degree of ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and penetration, they diſcover on ſubjects equally open to mankind in general, and which ought to be underſtood by all who live in ſociety. You do not mention particularly what has been preſcribed by either; only, that the former phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian ſeemed to rely almoſt entirely on exerciſe and regimen, whereas the preſent flatters our friend with a ſpeedy cure, by the help of the Pectoral and Balſamic Medicines which he orders, in ſuch abundance, and which he declares are ſo efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in <hi>pulmonary conſumptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having lamented with you the mournful events which render the name of that diſeaſe peculiarly alarming to you, and knowing your friendly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude about Mr. —, I do not wonder at your earneſt deſire to know ſomething of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017607_0011_0FA1DAB074F9C868"/>
of a diſtemper with which he is threatened, and which has proved fatal to ſo many of our friends. But I am ſurpriſed that you have not choſen a more enlightened inſtructor, when you have ſo many around you. Though conſcious that I have no juſt claim to all the obliging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which your partiality to my opinion has prompted you to make uſe of, yet I am too much flattered by ſome of them, to refuſe complying with your requeſt. My ſentiments, ſuch as they are, will at leaſt have the merit of being clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. I ſhall obſerve your prohibition, not to refer you to any medical book; and ſhall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid all technical terms, which you ſo much abominate. With regard to your ſhewing my Letter to any of the faculty; if you find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo inclined, I have not the ſmalleſt objection; for thoſe who have the greateſt knowledge in their profeſſion, are beſt acquainted with its uncertainty, and moſt indulgent to the miſtakes or errors of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:017607_0012_0FA1DAB1732B7CC0"/>Alas, my friend! how is it poſſible that phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſhould avoid miſtakes? If the ableſt mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic were to attempt to remedy the irregular move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a watch, while he remained ignorant of the ſtructure and manner of acting of ſome of the principal ſprings, would he not be in danger of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harm inſtead of good? Phyſicians are in the ſituation of ſuch a mechanic; for, although it is evident that the nerves are the organs or motion and ſenſation, yet their ſtructure is not known. Some anatomiſts aſſert they are impervious cords; others, that they are ſlender tubes, containing a fluid. But what the nature of this fluid is; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſerves only to nouriſh the nerves themſelves, or is the medium by which they convey feeling and the power of motion to other parts, is not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained even by thoſe who argue for its exiſtence; far leſs is it explained in what manner ideas, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the brain, can, by the means of ſolid cords, or by a fluid contained in tubes, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate motion at pleaſure to the legs and arms. We are ignorant why the will, which has no influence
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017607_0013_0FA1DAB1E44026C0"/>
over the motion of an animal's heart, ſhould find the feet obedient to her dictates; and we can no more explain how a man can move one leg over the other by volition, or the mere act of willing, than how he could, by the ſame means, move Oſſa on the top of Olympus. The one happens every moment, the other would be conſidered as a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; but they are equally unaccountable. While parts ſo infinitely eſſential to life are not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, inſtead of being ſurpriſed that ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes baffle the ſkill of the phyſician, we have more reaſon to be aſtoniſhed that any can be alleviated or cured by his art.</p>
            <p>The pen of the ſatiriſt, no doubt, may be fairly aimed againſt the preſumption and ignorance of many individuals of this, as of every other profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but cannot with juſtice be directed againſt the art itſelf: ſince, in ſpite of the obſcurity which ſtill involves ſome parts of the animal oeconomy, many diſorders are relieved, and ſome of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt and moſt diſagreeable to which the human
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017607_0014_0FA1DAB29F028D88"/>
body is liable, are cured with certainty by the art of medicine.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for mankind, and in a particular manner for the people of Great Britain, the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary conſumption is not of the number.</p>
            <p>This diſeaſe may originate from various cauſes:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. An external bruiſe or wound.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. The diſeaſe called pleuriſy, including in that term an inflammation of the lungs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as the membrane which covers them.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. The burſting of ſome of the blood-veſſels of the lungs, independent of external injury, and owing to a faulty conformation of the cheſt, and the ſlenderneſs of the veſſels.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Certain ſmall tumours, called tubercles, in the lungs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:017607_0015_0FA1DAB362706800"/>The firſt cauſe I have mentioned is an external bruiſe or wound.</p>
            <p>An accident of that kind happening to the lungs, is more dangerous and difficult to cure, than when the ſame takes place in moſt other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; becauſe the lungs are vital organs, eſſentially neceſſary to life, and when their motion is impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, other animal functions are thereby injured; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of an uncommonly delicate texture, in which a rupture having once taken place, will be apt to encreaſe; becauſe they are in conſtant motion and expoſed to the acceſs of external air, both of which circumſtances are unfavourable to the healing of wounds, and becauſe the maſs of blood diſtributed to the whole body paſſes previouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the lungs, and conſequently the blood-veſſels of this organ are more numerous than thoſe of any other part of the body.</p>
            <p>When we conſider theſe peculiarities, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to conclude, that every wound of the lungs muſt neceſſarily prove mortal; but experience has
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017607_0016_0FA1DB2C458D0928"/>
taught the contrary. Many wounds of the lungs heal of themſelves, by what is called, the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The phyſician may prevent a fever, by ordering the patient to loſe blood in proper quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and he may regulate the diet; but the cure muſt be left to nature, which ſhe will perform with greater certainty, if ſhe is not diſturbed by any of thoſe balſams which the wounded are ſometimes directed to ſwallow on ſuch occaſions. But when the wound, either from injudicious treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from its ſize, or from the bad habit of the patient, degenerates into an ulcer, attended with hectic ſymptoms, the diſeaſe muſt be treated as if it had ariſen from any of the other cauſes.</p>
            <p>The pleuriſy, or inflammation of the lungs, is a diſeaſe more frequent in cold countries than in mild; in the ſpring, than in the other ſeaſons; and more apt to ſeize people of a ſanguine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution than others.</p>
            <p>Plentiful and repeated bleedings, fomentations, bliſters near the affected paſt, and a cooling, dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017607_0017_0FA1DB2D8719E2E8"/>
regimen, generally remove it, without its leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any bad conſequence. Sometimes, by the omiſſion of bleeding in due quantity at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſometimes in ſpite of all poſſible care, it terminates in an abſceſs, which, on burſting, may ſuffocate the patient; or, if the matter is coughed up, becomes an open ulcer, and produces the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The third cauſe of the pulmonary conſumption above mentioned, is, a ſpitting of blood, from the burſting of veſſels of the lungs, independent of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wound or bruiſe. People of a fair complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, delicate ſkin, ſlender make, long neck, and narrow cheſt, are more ſubject to this than others. Thoſe who have a prediſpoſition to this complaint, by their form, are moſt apt to be attacked after their full growth: women from fifteen to three-and-thirty; men two or three years later. In Great Britain, a ſpitting of blood generally occurs to thoſe prediſpoſed to it, in the ſpring, or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſummer, when the weather ſuddenly changes from cold to exceſſive hot; and when the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017607_0018_0FA1DB2FC9F06B18"/>
heat is ſuppoſed to ratify the blood, before the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids are proportionably relaxed from the contracted ſtate they acquire during the cold of winter. When a ſpitting of blood happens to a perſon who has actually loſt brothers or ſiſters, or other near relations, by the pulmonary conſumption, as that circumſtance gives reaſon to ſuſpect a family taint or prediſpoſition, the caſe will, on that account be more dangerous.</p>
            <p>Violent exerciſe, may occaſion the rupture of blood-veſſels in the lungs, even in thoſe who have no hereditary diſpoſition to ſuch an accident; it ought therefore to be carefully avoided by all who have. Violent exerciſe in the ſpring, is more dangerous than in other ſeaſons; and, when taken at the top of high mountains, by thoſe who do not uſually reſide there, it has been conſidered as more dangerous than in vallies. The ſudden diminution of the weight of the atmoſphere co-operating with the exerciſe, renders the veſſels more apt to break. Of all things the moſt pernicious to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017607_0019_0FA1DB302C4AB6F0"/>
prediſpoſed to a ſpitting of blood, is, playing upon wind inſtruments. Previous to the ſpitting of blood, ſome perceive an uneaſineſs in the cheſt, an oppreſſion on the breath, and a ſaltiſh taſte in the ſpittle; but theſe ſymptoms are not conſtant.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more inſidious than the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of this diſeaſe ſometimes are. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the lungs, which is ſo full of blood-veſſels, is not ſupplied ſo liberally with nerves; the lungs, therefore, may be materially affected before danger is indicated by acute pain. And it ſometimes happens, that people of the make above deſcribed, are, in the bloom of life, and generally in the ſpring of the year, ſeized with a ſlight cough, which gradually increaſes without pain, ſoreneſs in the breaſt, difficulty of reſpiration, or ſpitting of blood. A ſlow fever ſupervenes every night, which remits every morning, with ſweats. Theſe ſymptoms augment daily; and, in ſpight of early attention, and what is thought the beſt advice, the unſuſpecting victims gradually ſink into their graves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:017607_0020_0FA1DB3169F4A578"/>Thoſe who by their make, or by the diſeaſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in former inſtances appeared in their family, are prediſpoſed to this complaint, ought to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly attentive in the article of diet. A ſpare and cooling regimen is the beſt. They ſhould avoid violent exerciſe, and every other exciting cauſe; and uſe the precaution of loſing blood in the ſpring. If their circumſtances permit, they ought to paſs the cold months in a mild climate; but, if they are obliged to remain during the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Great Britain, let them wear flannel next the ſkin, and uſe every other precaution againſt catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colds.</p>
            <p>The fourth cauſe above enumerated is, tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the lungs.</p>
            <p>The moiſt, foggy, and changeable weather, which prevails in Great Britain, renders its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants more liable, than thoſe of milder and more uniform climates, to catarrhs, rheumatiſms, pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and other diſeaſes proceeding from obſtructed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017607_0021_0FA1DB32375880B8"/>
perſpiration. The ſame cauſe ſubjects the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Great Britain to obſtructions of the glands, ſcrophulous complaints, and tubercles in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the lungs. The ſcrophulous diſeaſe is more frequent than is generally imagined. For one perſon in whom it appears by ſwellings in the glands below the chin, and other external marks, many have the internal glands affected by it. This is well known to thoſe who are accuſtomed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen dead bodies. On examining the bodies of ſuch as have died of the pulmonary conſumption, beſides the open ulcers in the lungs, many little hard tumours or tubercles are generally found; ſome, with matter; others, on being cut open, diſcover a little blueiſh ſpot, of the ſize of a ſmall lead ſhot. Here the ſuppuration, or formation of matter, is juſt going to begin; and in ſome the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle is perfectly hard, and the colour whitiſh, throughout its whole ſubſtance. Tubercles may remain for a conſiderable time in the lungs, in this indolent ſtate, without much inconveniency; but, when excited to inflammation by frequent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs, or other irritating cauſes, matter is formed,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017607_0022_0FA1DB32E08AC7B0"/>
they break, and produce an ulcer. Care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention may prevent tubercles from inflammation, or may prevent <hi>that</hi> from terminating in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of matter; but when matter is actually formed, and the tubercle has become an abſceſs, no remedy can ſtop its progreſs. It muſt go on till it burſts. If this happens near any of the large air veſſels, immediate ſuffocation may enſue; but, for the moſt part, the matter is coughed up.</p>
            <p>From the circumſtances above enumerated of the delicate texture, conſtant motion, and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous blood-veſſels of the lungs, it is natural to imagine, that a breach of this nature in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, will be ſtill more difficult to heal, than a wound from an external cauſe. So unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably it is; yet there are many inſtances of even this kind of breach being repaired; the matter expectorated diminiſhing in quantity every day, and the ulcer gradually healing; not, ſurely, by the power of medicine, but by the conſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and tendency which exiſts in nature, by
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017607_0023_0FA1DB339A5CBBC8"/>
inſcrutable means of her own, to reſtore health to the human body.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to obſerve, that thoſe perſons whoſe formation of body renders them moſt liable to a ſpitting of blood, have alſo a greater prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition than others to tubercles in the lungs. The diſeaſe, called the ſpaſmodic aſthma, has been reckoned among the cauſes of the pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. It would require a much greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of confidence in a man's own judgment, than I have in mine, to aſſert, that this complaint has no tendency to produce tubercles in the lungs; but I may ſay, with truth, that I have often known the ſpaſmodic aſthma, in the moſt violent degree, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the moſt alarming ſymptoms, continue to harraſs the patients for a long period of time, and at length ſuddenly diſappear, without ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning; the perſons who have been thus afflicted, enjoying perfect health for many years after. It is not probable that tubercles were formed in any of theſe caſes; and it is certain they were not in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017607_0024_0FA1DB345DFB4B00"/>
ſome, whoſe bodies were opened after their death, which happened from other diſtempers, the aſthma having diſappeared ſeveral years before.</p>
            <p>Certain eruptions of the ſkin, attended with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, particularly the ſmall-pox, and ſtill oftener, the meaſles, leave after them a foundation for the pulmonary conſumption. From which ever of the cauſes above enumerated this diſeaſe takes its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, when once an ulcer, attended with a hectic fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is formed in the lungs, the caſe is, in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, dangerous. When it ends fatally, the ſymptoms are, a quick pulſe, and a ſenſation of cold, while the patient's ſkin, to the feeling of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other perſon, is hot; irregular ſhiverings, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere cough, expectoration of matter ſtreaked with blood, morning ſweats, a circumſcribed ſpot of a crimſon colour on the cheeks, heat of the palms of the hands, exceſſive emaciation, crooking of the nails, ſwelling of the legs, giddineſs, delirium, ſoon followed by death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:017607_0025_0FA1DB3537E791B8"/>Theſe ſymptoms do not appear in every caſe. Although the emaciation is greater in this diſeaſe than in any other, yet the appetite frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtrong and unimpaired to the laſt; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though delirium ſometimes comes before death, yet in many caſes the ſenſes ſeem perfect and entire; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in one particular, that in ſpite of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſymptoms, the patient often entertains the fulleſt hopes of recovery to the laſt moment.</p>
            <p>Would to heaven it were as eaſy to point out the cure, as to deſcribe the ſymptoms of a diſeaſe of ſuch a formidable nature, and againſt which the powers of medicine have been directed with ſuch had ſucceſs, that there is reaſon to fear, its fatal termination has been oftener celerated than retarded by the means employed to remove it! To particulariſe the drugs which have been long in uſe, and have been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the higheſt encomiums for their great efficacy in healing inward bruiſes, ulcers of the lungs, and confirmed conſumptions, would in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017607_0026_0FA1DB35D68ECF90"/>
many inſtances be pointing out what ought to be ſhunned, as pernicious, and in others what ought to be neglected as futile.</p>
            <p>Salt water, and ſome of the mineral ſprings, which are unqueſtionably beneficial in ſcrophulous and other diſtempers, have been found hurtful, or at leaſt inefficacious, in the conſumption; there is no ſufficient reaſon to depend on a courſe of theſe, or any medicine at preſent known, for preventing or diſſolving tubercles in the lungs. Mercury, which has been found ſo powerful in diſpoſing other ulcers to heal, has no good effect on ulcers of that organ;—though ſome phyſicians imagine it may be of ſervice in the beginning to diſſolve tubercles, before they begin to ſuppurate; but as there is no abſolute evidence, during life, of indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tubercles being formed, there can be none that mercury cures them.</p>
            <p>Various kinds of gums, with the natural and artificial balſams, were long ſuppoſed to promote
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017607_0027_0FA1DB36B4BBEC78"/>
the healing of external wounds and ulcers, and on that account were made the baſis of a vaſt variety of ointments and plaiſters. It was afterwards imagined, that the ſame remedies, adminiſtered internally, would have the ſame effect on internal ulcers; and of courſe many of thoſe gums and balſams were preſcribed in various forms for the pulmonary conſumption. The reaſoning on which the practice was eſtabliſhed, however, ſeems a little ſhallow, and is far from being concluſive; for although it were granted, that theſe balſams contributed to the cure of wounds, when applied directly to the part, it does not follow that they could carry their healing powers, unimpaired, from the ſtomach to the lungs, through the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of digeſtion. But more accurate ſurgery having made it manifeſt, that the granulations which ſpring up to ſupply the loſs of ſubſtance in external wounds, and the healing or ſkinning over of all kinds of ſores, proceeds from no active vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the plaiſters or ointments with which they are dreſſed, but is entirely the work of nature, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017607_0028_0FA1DB37560A0F30"/>
beſt performed when the mildeſt ſubſtances, or even dry lint only is applied; and that heating gums, reſins, and balſams, rather retard than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their cure; the internal uſe of ſuch remedies ought to be rejected now, on the ſame principles they were adopted formerly.</p>
            <p>No kind of reaſoning ought to have weight when oppoſed by fair experience. But phyſicians have formed contrary and oppoſite concluſions, with reſpect to the effect of the natural and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial balſams, even when they have laid all theory and reaſoning aſide, and decided on their powers from practice and experience only. This is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove, at leaſt, that their efficacy is very problematical. For my own part, after the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt trials and the moſt accurate obſervations, I have been able to make, I cannot ſay that I ever knew them of ſervice in any hectic complaint proceeding from an ulcer in the lungs; and I have generally found thoſe phyſicians, on whoſe judgment I have more reliance than on my own, of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:017607_0029_0FA1DB3BAB0FD1A8"/>It is far from being uncommon to ſee a cure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, not to ſay any thing ſtronger, by the means employed to haſten it; and phyſicians who found their practice on theoretical reaſonings, are not the only perſons to whom this misfortune may happen. Thoſe who profeſs to take experience for their ſole guide, if it is not directed by candour, and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by natural ſagacity, are liable to the ſame. A man may, for twenty years, order a medicine, which has in every inſtance done a little harm, though not always ſo much as to prevent nature from removing the complaint at laſt; and if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this medicine ſhould ever be attacked, he may bring his twenty years experience in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it. It ought to be remembered, that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the animal conſtitution is put out of order, by accident or diſtemper, nature endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore health. Happily ſhe has many reſources, and various methods of accompliſhing her purpoſe, and very often ſhe ſucceeds beſt without medical aſſiſtance. But medical aſſiſtance being given, ſhe frequently ſucceeds <hi>notwithſtanding</hi>; and it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017607_0030_0FA1DB3DE448CD98"/>
happens, that both the phyſician and patient are convinced, that the means which did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent have actually performed the cure.</p>
            <p>A peaſant is ſeized with a ſhivering, followed by feveriſhneſs, and accompanied with a ſlight cough— he goes to bed, and exceſſive heat and thirſt prompt him to drink plentifully of plain water; on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third day a copious ſweat burſts from all his pores, and terminates the diſorder. A perſon of fortune is ſeized with the ſame ſymptoms, ariſing from the ſame cauſe, and which would have been cured by the ſame means, in the ſame ſpace of time; but the apothecary is called, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſends pectoral linctuſes to remove the cough, and afterwards gives a vomit, to remove the nauſea which the linctuſes have occaſioned: the heat and fever augment; the phyſician is called; he orders the patient to be blooded, to abate the violence of the fever, and gives a little phyſic on ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. All this prevents the natural criſis by ſweat; and the patient being further teaſed by draughts or powders every two or three hours,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017607_0031_0FA1DB3FB0E2DCB0"/>
nature cannot ſhake off the fever ſo ſoon by ſix or ſeven days, as ſhe would have done had ſhe been left to herſelf. She generally does her buſineſs at laſt, however; and then the phyſician and apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary glory in the happy effects of their ſkill, and receive the grateful thanks of their patient, for having cured him of a dangerous fever.</p>
            <p>Every body of common penetration, at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in medical matters, muſt have ſeen enough to convince them that the above deſcription is not exaggerated; but it is not to be inferred from this, that the art of medicine is of no uſe to mankind. There are many diſeaſes in which nature ſinks, without medical aſſiſtance. It is the part of the penetrating and experienced phyſician to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe from others, and leave it to the knaviſh and weak to aſſume the merit of cures in caſes where they know, or ought to know, that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine can do nothing.</p>
            <p>Some phyſicians, who have abandoned the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſins and gums, as uſeleſs or hurtful in hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017607_0032_0FA1DB405B9C8310"/>
complaints, ſtill adhere to myrrh as a beneficial medicine; but from what I can learn, the caſes in which this gum has been thought ſerviceable, are hectic complaints, from debility, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of exceſſive evacuations of various kinds, and not proceeding from ulcerated lungs. After it is fully eſtabliſhed, that myrrh is of uſe in ſuch inſtances, it will ſtill be worthy of inveſtigation, whether it is of more or leſs than Jeſuits bark. I have repeatedly mentioned blood-letting, and a ſpare, diluting regimen, as the moſt powerful means of preventing and curing all affections of the lungs that depend on inflammation. In the caſe of external wounds, or bruiſes of the lungs, this method facilitates the immediate cure by the firſt intention. It is the chief thing to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on for the cure of pleuriſies, and it is often owing to a neglect, or too ſparing an uſe of this evacuation, that the complaint terminates in an abſceſs. In people prediſpoſed by the form of their bodies, or the nature of their conſtitutions, to a ſpitting of blood, it may prevent the turgid
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017607_0033_0FA1DB411CEA2150"/>
veſſels from burſting; and in thoſe who have tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles in the lungs, it is of the greateſt utility, by preventing thoſe tumours from inflaming, and becoming ulcers; but after the ulcers are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed, I have great doubts with regard to the propriety of attempting a cure by repeated bleedings, even in ſmall quantities. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod has been often tried; but I fear the ſucceſs with which it has been attended, gives no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to continue the practice. That ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms may be ſuch, in every period of this diſeaſe, as to require this evacuation, is not to be denied; but there is a great difference in the application of what is conſidered as an occaſional palliative, and that from which we expect a radical cure. In the one caſe, it will only be uſed when ſome particular ſymptom ſtrongly urges; in the other, it will be uſed at ſtated intervals, whether the ſymptoms preſs or not; and may tend to weaken the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready debilitated patient, without our having the conſolation of knowing, with certainty, that it has had any other effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:017607_0034_0FA1DB41DA379BE0"/>Bliſters do not weaken ſo much; they are of undoubted uſe in pleuriſies; perhaps, by exciting external inflammation, they may contribute to draw off the inflammatory diſpoſition within the breaſt: perhaps—But in whatever way they act, I imagine I have frequently ſeen bliſters and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, particularly the latter, of conſiderable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, even after the ſymptoms indicated the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an ulcer in the lungs.</p>
            <p>As for the numerous forms of electuaries, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochs, and linctuſes, compoſed of oils, gums, and ſyrups, and by the courteſy of diſpenſatory writers called <hi>pectoral</hi>; I am convinced they are of no manner of ſervice in this complaint, and ſeldom have any other effect than that of loading the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and impairing the digeſtion of ſalutary food. So far from being of any permanent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to the diſeaſe, they cannot be depended on for giving even a temporary relief to the cough; when that ſymptom becomes troubleſome, gentle opiates will be found the beſt palliatives. Some
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017607_0035_0FA1DB429B846348"/>
practitioners object to theſe medicines, on a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that they check expectoration; but they only ſeem to have this effect, by lulling the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cough; the ſame quantity will be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torated in the morning, after the influence of the opiate is over. It is ſurely better that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould accumulate, and the patient ſpit it up at once, than allow him to be kept from reſt, and teaſed with coughing and ſpitting through the whole night. Theſe palliatives, however, are to be managed with great caution; never exhibited while the patient enjoys a tolerable ſhare of <hi>natural</hi> reſt. Small doſes ſhould be given at firſt, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed without abſolute neceſſity. Exhibited in this manner, they cannot do harm; and thoſe who reject the aſſiſtance of a claſs of medicines, which afford eaſe and tranquility in the moſt deplorable ſtate of this diſeaſe, ought to give better proofs than have hitherto appeared, that they are able to procure their patients more valuable and laſting comforts than thoſe they deprive them of.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:017607_0036_0FA1DB436048B1B8"/>The known efficacy of the Peruvian bark, in many diſtempers, eſpecially in intermittent fevers; the remiſſion of the ſymptoms, which happens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly every day at a particular ſtage of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary conſumption, and in ſome degree gives it the appearance of an intermittent, joined to the failure of all other remedies, prompted phyſicians to make trial of that noble medicine in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. In conſequence of theſe trials, the bark is now pretty generally acknowledged to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in hectical complaints, proceeding from debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and other cauſes, excluſive of ulcerated lungs; but when the diſeaſe proceeds from this cauſe, the bark is ſuppoſed, by ſome very reſpectable phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, always to do harm. I am moſt clearly of the firſt opinion, and perhaps it would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me to diſpute the ſecond. It may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, however, to obſerve, that the moſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing practitioners may be led into a notion that a very ſafe medicine does harm, when it is exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the worſt ſtage of a diſeaſe, in which hardly any medicine whatever has been found to do
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017607_0037_0FA1DB44197CFA88"/>
good. In every ſtage of this diſeaſe, elixir of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol may be uſed. It is a pleaſant and ſafe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, but particularly efficacious when the patient is troubled with waſting ſweats.</p>
            <p>Having, in obedience to your requeſt, delivered my ſentiments freely, you will perceive, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the objections already mentioned to the perſon under whoſe care our friend is at preſent, I cannot approve of his being directed to take ſo many drugs, or of his being detained in town, at a ſeaſon when he may enjoy, in the country, what is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all medicine; I mean air, exerciſe, and, let me even add, diet.</p>
            <p>Had I known of our friend's complaints earlier, I ſhould have adviſed him to have met the advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpring in the South of France; but at the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in which you will receive this letter, the moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate warmth and refreſhing verdure of England, are preferable to the ſultry heats and ſcorched fields of the South. From the view I have of his complaints, I can have no heſitation in adviſing you to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017607_0038_0FA1DB45553467E0"/>
to prevail on him to quit his drugs, and to leave London without delay. Since he bears riding on horſeback ſo well, let him enjoy that exerciſe in an atmoſphere freed from the ſmoak of the town, and impregnated with the flavour of riſing plants and green herbage; a flavour which may with more truth be called <hi>pectoral,</hi> than any of the heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſins, or loathſome oils, on which that term has been proſtituted. Let him paſs the ſummer in drinking the waters, and riding around the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of Briſtol. It will be eaſy for him to find a houſe in the free air of the country, at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from that town, and it will be of uſe to have an additional reaſon for riſing early, and riding every morning. It is of the greateſt importance that he continue that exerciſe every day that the weather will permit: a little cloudineſs of the ſky ſhould not frighten him from it; there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of catching cold during the continuation of that movement which aſſiſts digeſtion, promotes the determination of blood from the lungs to the ſurface of the body, and is more ſalutary in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than after dinner.</p>

when it is accuſtomed to it by degrees; and in thoſe caſes where it does not occaſion pains in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and bowels, or other immediate inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, it has been thought to have a good effect in abating the force of the hectic fever.</p>
            <p>I have met with two caſes, ſince I have been laſt abroad, in both of which there ſeemed to be a quicker recovery than I ever ſaw, from the ſame ſymptoms. The firſt was that of a young lady, of about ſeventeen years of age, and apparently of a very healthy conſtitution. In bad weather, during the ſpring, ſhe caught cold: this being neglected in the beginning, gradually grew worſe. When phyſicians were at length conſulted, their preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeemed to have as bad an effect as her own neglect. By the middle of ſummer her cough was inceſſant, accompanied with hectic fever and fluſhings, irregular ſhiverings, morning ſweats, emaciation, expectoration of purulent phlegm ſtreaked with blood, and every indication of an open ulcer in the lungs. In this deſperate ſtate
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017607_0041_0FA1DB4897F4FEE0"/>
ſhe was carried from the town to a finely ſituated village in Switzerland, where, for ſeveral months, ſhe lived in the middle of a vineyard, on ripe grapes and bread. She had been directed to a milk and vegetable diet in general. Her own taſte inclined her to the grapes, which ſhe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on finding, that, with this diet only, ſhe was leſs languid, and of a more natural coolneſs, and that the cough, fever, and all the other ſymptoms gradually abated. She ſeemed to be brought from the jaws of death by the change of air, and this regimen only; and ſhe returned to her own home in high ſpirits, and with the look and vigour of health. The enſuing winter, after being heated with dancing at the houſe of a friend, ſhe walked home in a cold night? the cough, ſpitting of blood, and other ſymptoms immediately returned, and ſhe died three months after.</p>
            <p>In the other caſe, there was not ſuch a degree of fever, but there was an expectoration of matter, frequently ſtreaked with blood, and evident ſigns of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> who laboured
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017607_0042_0FA1DB4AE77C13F8"/>
under theſe ſymptoms, had tried the uſual reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of pectorals, pills, linctuſes, &amp;c. with the uſual ſucceſs. He grew daily worſe. He had formerly found much relief from bleeding, but had left it off for many months, on a ſuppoſition that it had loſt all effect; and he had allowed an iſſue to be healed, on the ſame ſuppoſition; though he ſtill perſevered in a milk regimen. I mentioned to him the caſe of the young lady, as it is above recited. He immediately took the reſolution to confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bread and grapes for almoſt his only food. I adviſed him at the ſame time to have the iſſue opened, and to continue that drain for ſome time; but this he did not comply with, He forſook, however, the town for the country, and paſſed as much of the morning on horſeback, as he could bear without fatigue. He ſoon was able to bear more; and after about three weeks or a month, his cough had greatly abated. When he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in this regimen between two and three months, he had very little cough; and what he ſpit up was pure phlegm, unmixed with blood or matter. He has now been well above a year; and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017607_0043_0FA1DB4D1E649BF0"/>
although I underſtand that he occaſionally takes animal food, he has hitherto felt no inconveniency from it. He paſſed the ſecond autumn, as he had done the firſt, at a houſe in the country, ſurrounded with vineyards. The greater part of his food conſiſted of ripe grapes and bread. With ſuch a diet he had not occaſion for much drink of any kind; what he uſed was ſimple water, and he made an ample proviſion of grapes for the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winter.</p>
            <p>Though I have no idea that there is any ſpecific virtue in grapes, for the cure of the pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſumption, or that they are greatly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſome other cooling, ſub-acid, mild fruit, equally agreeable to the taſte, provided any ſuch can be found; yet I thought it right to particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize what was uſed on thoſe two occaſions; leaving it to others to determine, what ſnare of the happy conſequences I have enumerated were owing to the change of air, how much may have flowed from the exerciſe, how much from the regimen, and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:017607_0044_0FA1DB4E6E1666A0"/>
whether there is reaſon to think, that the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able turn in both caſes depended on other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, unobſerved by me.</p>
            <p>I have now, my dear Sir, complied with your requeſt; and although I have endeavoured to avoid technical verboſity, and all unneceſſary detail, yet I find my letter has ſwelled to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſize than I expected. I ſhall be exceedingly happy to hear that any hint I have given has been ſerviceable to our friend. If the cough ſhould ſtill continue, after he has paſſed two or three months at Briſtol, I imagine the moſt effectual thing he can do, will be, to take a voyage to this place; he will by that means eſcape the ſeverity of a Britiſh win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The voyage itſelf will be of ſervice, and at the end of it he will have the benefit of the mild air of the Campag a Felice, be refreſhed and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fineſt grapes, and, when tired of riding, he will have continual opportunities of ſailing in this charming bay.</p>
