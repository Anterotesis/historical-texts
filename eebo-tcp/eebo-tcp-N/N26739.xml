            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TRAVELS OF <hi>JONAS HANWAY,</hi> ESQ.</head>
            <p>JONAS HANWAY, Eſq. ſo diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a philanthropiſt and a real Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, was born at Portſmouth on the 12th of Auguſt, 1712. His father was an naval offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; but loſing his life at an early age by an accident, the care of rearing and educating the family devolved on the mother, who put Jonas to ſchool in London, where he acquired ſuch branches of learning as might qualify him for a commercial life, and made ſome proficiency in Latin.</p>
            <p>At the age of ſeventeen, he was bound apprentice to a merchant in Liſbon, where he ſerved his time with great credit to himſelf and ſatisfaction to his maſter Soon after he returned to London, and accepted the offer of a partnerſhip in the houſe of Dingly, a merchant at Peterſburgh, who was engaged in a Perſian trade through Ruſſia.</p>
            <p>In this capacity he performed the travels which form the ſubject of the following pages. His work early obtained celebrity; and the character of the man gave the ſtamp of authenticity to his deſcriptions, and of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity to his remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035585_0003_10056C1123E0F3A8"/>Mr. Hanway, having cloſed his commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial engagements, took up his reſidence in London, where he employed his time in literary purſuits, and in the far more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occupations, of diſintereſted benevolence and public-ſpirited ſervices.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to follow him through all his charitable and praiſe-worthy undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. His country and mankind were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by his various exertions in their behalf; and he lived to reap the applauſe that was due to him. Honoured and reſpected, he cloſed this tranſitory life on the 5th of September, 1786, in the ſeventy-fifth year of his age.</p>
            <p>We now proceed to his travels. In April 1743, he embarked from the port of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for Riga. On his arrival there, about the end of May, he was carried priſoner to the Caſtle of Dwenamund, becauſe he had come without a regular paſſport, though it was not cuſtomary to carry one. However, having letters of recommendation from the Ruſſian ambaſſador, at the court of London, to the great chancellor of the empire, he was ſoon liberated.</p>
            <p>He found the weather here as hot as it generally is in Portugal; for the ſun, at this ſeaſon, ſinking below the horizon only for three or four hours, neither the earth nor the air had time to cool.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway was received with great kindneſs by the Britiſh factors at Riga; but as a war at this time ſubſiſted between the Swedes and Ruſſians, the governor had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035585_0004_10056C13E3332B60"/>
expreſs orders to ſuffer no one to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Peterſburgh without the particular permiſſion of the court. This being at length procured, Mr. Hanway provided him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſleeping waggon, which is made of leather and hung upon braces, and in this manner he rode poſt to the capital.</p>
            <p>Riga was founded about the year 1190, when this country firſt embraced Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is the metropolis of Livonia, and was taken from the Swedes by Peter the Great in 1713. The chief commodities here are maſts, timber, flax, and hemp, with which a conſiderable number of ſhips are annually la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. The houſes are built with ſteep roofs, and are ſeldom above two ſtories high. The German language is generally ſpoken here.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed through ſeveral inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places, Mr. Hanway arrived at Narva, the capital of Eſthonia, famous for the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fought here in 1700, when one hundred thouſand Ruſſians fled before a handful of Swedes. This city ſtands on a riſing ground, and is clean and well fortified, though not large. Its trade chiefly conſiſts in hemp and timber.</p>
            <p>Our author reached Peterſburgh on the 10th of June, and was much pleaſed with the general aſpect of the city. Soon after his arrival here, it was judged expedient that one of the partners, in the commercial houſe to which he belonged, ſhould proceed to Porſia; and the intimation he received of the diſtracted ſituation of that country did not
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035585_0005_10056C1578B092C0"/>
deter him from offering his ſervices, which were accepted.</p>
            <p>Having obtained a paſſport from the court of Ruſſia, he provided a ſleeping waggon, for himſelf, a ſecond for his clerk, and a third for his baggage. He was alſo attended by a Ruſſian ſervant, a Tartar boy, and a ſoldier; and took upon him the charge of thirty-ſeven bales of Engliſh cloth, which was ſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the 1ſt of September, and on the 10th, Mr. Hanway followed it.</p>
            <p>In two days he reached the river Volcoff, where the ferry-man, diſcovering he was a merchant began to be inſolent; for the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian boors entertain no high reſpect for the commercial character. The ſoldier, however, brought the fellow to ſubmiſſion, by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing his cane, and our traveller was carried over in ſafety.</p>
            <p>On the 13th, one of the waggons ſtuck in a moraſs, which obliged him to ſpend the night in that ſituation Next day they reached Baanitz, near Novogorod, where they found the weather mild, and the roads open and pleaſant. Proviſions were ſo cheap, that beef might be purchaſed for three farthings a pound, and matton and pork in proportion.</p>
            <p>The 15th brought them to Valdal, the inhabitants of which are chiefly Poles, who were taken priſoners in former wars; but the diſtinction between them and the original natives is almoſt loſt. The dreſs of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, however, is nearer than the generality
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035585_0006_10056C179BAF3050"/>
of the Ruſſian peaſants; but they greatly leſſen the effect of their perſonal charms by paint and giddineſs.</p>
            <p>The ſurrounding country is very pleaſant; and from the many love ſongs, which are here the delight of the Ruſſians, it might be ſuppoſed that Venus had once fixed her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence here; but the refined pleaſures are ſcarcely known among the preſent race.</p>
            <p>The next day, Mr. Hanway overtook his carravan at Twere, and fearing that he might not be able to reach Perſia ſo ſoon as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he ordered an additional horſe to be put to each carriage.</p>
            <p>The Ruſſian conveyances for merchandiſe are about ten feet long and three broad, principally compoſed of two ſtrong poles, ſupported by four ſlight wheels, nearly of an equal height. The bales are laid on a thick mat, and over them are placed other mats, with an outward covering of raw cow hides.</p>
            <p>Twere is a very ancient city, ſeated on the Twerſa, which runs into the Volga<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is a great rendezvous for merchants, who carry on their traffic along the banks of the laſt-mentioned river.</p>
            <p>On the 20th, Mr. Hanway arrived at Moſcow, the ancient metropolis of the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian empire.</p>
            <p>Among other grand projects of Peter the Great, was a road, to extend from Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh to Moſcow in a direct line, for the ſpace of ſeven hundred and thirty-four verſts, or four hundred and eighty-ſeven Engliſh
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035585_0007_10056C1B01F31988"/>
miles. This is in part executed, over ſuch impediments as would have terrified a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon genious. For about one hundred and fifty verſts, it is wholly made of wood, laid over moraſſes, till then thought impaſſable.</p>
            <p>Moſcow ſtands in 55 deg. 40 min. north latitude, and is built after the eaſtern man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, having few regular ſteets, but many gardens mixed with the houſes. It is ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Engliſh miles in circumference; and the river Moſkwa meandering through it, adds greatly to its beauty and convenience,</p>
            <p>The imperial palace is chiefly remarkable for its thirty chapels, and its pendant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. The number of churches and chapels in this city almoſt exceeds credibility. They are ſaid to amount to one thouſand eight hundred, but many of them are very mean.</p>
            <p>The great bell of Moſcow is at once a monument of art and folly. It weighs four hundred and forty-three thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy-two pounds, and was caſt in the reign of the late empreſs Anne; but the beam on which it hung being burnt, it fell to the ground, and ſuffered conſiderable damage.</p>
            <p>This city is the general reſidence of the Ruſſian nobility, who are not obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the court; and it contains the chief mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and manufacturers of the empire. The dreadful conflagrations which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly happened here, and the removal of the court, have united to diminiſh the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and extent of this place; and now there
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035585_0008_10056C1D171001C8"/>
is ſcarcely accommodations for the imperial retinue, without diſtreſſing the people.</p>
            <p>Having made the requiſite preparations, on the 24th of September, Mr. Hanway left Moſcow, and paſſed through a pictureſque and pleaſant country, till he arived at Periſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawl, where he found himſelf in another cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: for the harveſt here was not yet ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in. The proſpects are delightful, and the ſoil is well watered, but the inhabitants exhibit proofs of indigence and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Traverſing a pleaſant country by good roads, on the 1ſt of October he entered the Step, where he overtook a caravan, conſiſting of forty loads of European goods, belonging to Armenian merchants Next day he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Novochoperſkaja, the Ruſſian fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier towards the Don Coſſacks, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently fortified, and is almoſt hid in a grove of oaks. The adjacent country is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delightful, and the travelling commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>In the Coſſack towns, the people appeared neat in their perſons and comfortably cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The woman were gay and comely; they wore a high cap, with two points, in the form of a creſcent; and their ſhifts were ornamented with red croſſes.</p>
            <p>In travelling through the Coſſack country for three days, Mr Hanway ſaw little more than land and ſky, except ſome woods which covered the mountains to the eaſtward. At length they arrived at Grigoriſkoi which,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035585_0009_10056C1E99E418F8"/>
forms a kind of peninſula. Here the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants catch vaſt numbers of craw-fiſh, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the eyes for medicinal purpoſes. They dwell in oaken huts, and marry very young. Our author ſaw a boy of fifteen contracted to a girl of the ſame age.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 9th, they arrived under the lines that are thrown up from the Don to the Volga, for the diſtance of fifty verſts. The foſs is about ſixteen feet deep, and a mound of earth riſes to the height of twenty feet, with a ſtrong wooden rail near the top. At certain diſtances are placed ſentry-boxes, from which the guard can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate an alarm to the chief garriſon at Zaritzen, which terminates the line on the weſtern bank of the Volga. On this ſpot Peter I intended to join the Don with the Volga, and this canal was actually begun for that purpoſe; but it now ſerves as a defence againſt the incurſions of the Tartars on that ſide</p>
            <p>The Kuban Tartars were once very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable; but they are now kept in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe people made their appearance in ſmall parties. In a deep valley, near Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritzen, which ſtands on a high bank of the Volga, was an encampment of Calmuck Tartars. They have the ſame turn of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with the Chineſe; but are fierce and ſavage. Their arms are bows and arrows; and they feed on the fleſh of horſes, camels, dromedaries, and almoſt whatever falls in their way. They throw their dead to the dogs;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035585_0010_10056C214EA69088"/>
and if ſix, or more, feaſt on the corpſe, they eſteem it honourable to the defunct. What a ſingular and barbarous idea!</p>
            <p>They pay religious adoration to little wooden images, which they careſs when they are pleaſed, but beat and ill-treat when the weather is unfavourable, or fortune frowns on them.</p>
            <p>Our traveller now ſet about procuring a veſſel to carry his goods to Aſtracan, and found one, which he purchaſed for forty roubles or ten pounds. This bark, in her materials and equipment, was one of the moſt crazy and indifferent that was ever truſted with ſuch a valuable cargo, particularly in ſuch a dangerous navigation; but there was no alternative—a better was not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
            <p>Having given the neceſſary inſtructions with regard to the conveyance of the goods, he prepared for his own voyage down the Volga, by engaging, for himſelf and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, two boats, each navigated by five men, with the addition of ſix ſoldiers, by way of protection. This precaution was requiſite, as the Volga is frequently infeſted with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who make uſe of row-boats, that carry from twenty to thirty hands, and are provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with firearms. Theſe marauders appear chiefly in the ſpring, when the river over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows its banks, and facilitates their eſcape, ſhould they meet with reſiſtance. They ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail to murder, as well as rob, thoſe whom they can overpower; but if taken,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035585_0011_10056C2369B4D588"/>
they meet with the moſt exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, cruel as it is, is not always ſufficient to deter the reſt of the gang.</p>
            <p>The Ruſſian ſoldiers are encouraged to take them alive; when they are put on a float, wherein a gallows is erected, armed, with iron hooks; and the wretched pirates, being ſuſpended on them by the ribs, with a label over their heads ſignifying their crime, are launched on the ſtream, and writhe in agonies inexpreſſible till death releaſes them. It is a capital offence to give them the leaſt relief, or even to diſpatch them by a leſs painful death.</p>
            <p>It is reported, that one of theſe miſcreants found means to diſengage himſelf from the hook, and, though naked and faint with the loſs of blood, he got aſhore, when the firſt object he ſaw being a poor ſhepherd, he knocked him on the head with a ſtone, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain his clothes. Such is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable depravity of ſome natures, that no danger can intimidate them, no example, however dreadful, can reclaim them!</p>
            <p>On the 14th of October, Mr. Hanway put off from ſhore, and ſailing down the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he ſaw ſeveral water fowl, larger than ſwans, which the Ruſſians call Dika Baba, or the wild old woman. They live on fiſh; and their fat is eſteemed a ſpecific in aches and bruiſes.</p>
            <p>During their progreſs, the weather proved calm and the current moderate. In many places the banks were high and undermined;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035585_0012_10056C24EC8A34D8"/>
in others they found a flat ſhore of various extent.</p>
            <p>On the 17th they ſtopped at Chernoyare, about half way from Zaritzen to Aſtracan, from which it is diſtant two hundred verſts. This place has ſome fortifications, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on a conſiderable trade, with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding Tartar nations. Next night they had a providential eſcape from being loſt; and what enhanced their gratitude for their deliverance, was the ſight of ſeveral wrecks caſt on the ſhore, near the ſpot of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>On the 19th, he reached Aſtracan, where he was obliged to wait for a veſſel, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain Woodroofe, which was to convey him to Perſia; and employed the interval in viewing this city and its envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</p>
            <p>Aſtracan is the metropolis of a province of the ſame name, and ſtands in 47 deg. north latitude, within the limits of Aſia, in an iſland about ſixty Engliſh miles from the Caſpian Sea. It contains about ſeventy thouſand inhabitants, of various nations, whoſe different manners and cuſtoms exhibit an epitome of Aſia. It is ſurrounded by an old brick wall, and is well garriſoned by ſix regiments of Ruſſian troops. The houſes are of wood, and moſt of them very mean. The upper part of the town commands a view of the Volga, which is here near three miles broad, and, from its occaſional inundations,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035585_0013_10056C2709268F50"/>
is ſaid to render the air inſalubrious, and to bring on various diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Many gardens and orchards ſurround Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracan; and grapes are carried from thence, twice a week, to the court of Peterſburgh, though the diſtance is not leſs than one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred Engliſh miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons are very good; but though the grapes are in ſuch high requeſt, the wine of this country is very indifferent.</p>
            <p>About ten miles below Aſtracan is the ſmall iſland of Boſmakoff, remarkable for its large ſtorehouſes of ſalt, from whence an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe extent of counrry is ſupplied. In this place likewiſe are very capital fiſheries, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of ſturgeon, beluga, and aſſorta.</p>
            <p>This country is much infeſted with locuſts, which ſometimes appear in ſuch ſwarms that they darken the ſky, and wherever they alight, leave not a blade of vegitation. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Woodroofe informed our author, that once ſailing down the Volga, a cloud of theſe inſects had fallen into the river, and obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the motion of the boat for many fathoms together.</p>
            <p>The trade of Aſtracan conſiſts in red lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, linen and woollen cloths, the greateſt part of which is exported to Perſia, from whence they receive ſilks, cottons, and drugs, particularly rhubarb. The laſt article is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by the government, and private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are prohibited from dealing in it, on pain of death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:035585_0014_10056C29C39B9580"/>While Mr Hanway was here, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor invited him to a feaſt at which were nearly three hundred diſhes, which gave him an opportunity of ſeeing a ſingular ſpecimen of Ruſſian intemperance, in drinking goblets of cherry-brandy to exceſs. This feaſt was occaſioned by the birth of the governor's grand-daughter; and each of the gueſts, made a preſent to the mother, according to his rank and abilities. In the opinion of our author, this is an ingenious way of levying contributions on merchants and others; and though leſs delicate than ſome of our own uſages, is at leaſt as honeſt and creditable.</p>
            <p>For ſeveral miles round the city wherever the ſoil will admit of cultivation, are ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Crim Tartars, a very civil and induſtrious people, ſubject to Ruſſia. They raiſe goods crops of manna, oats, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melons; but their chief riches conſiſt in their wives and children, their ſheep, horſes, and cattle.</p>
            <p>When a daughter becomes marriageable, they cover her tent with white linen, tie a painted cloth on the top with red ſtrings, and place by the ſide a painted waggon, which is to be her dowery. This is a ſignal for thoſe who want a wife, and the girl is generally diſpoſed of to him who offers her father the moſt valuable preſent.</p>
            <p>On the 8th of November Mr Hanway left Aſtracan under convoy of the governor's barge, with twelve grenadiers, and ſlept the firſt night near a Calmuck ſettlement, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035585_0015_10056C2BDAB5DC30"/>
of circular tents about twelve feet high and fifteen yards in circumference. In the centre of the tent they make a fire, and the ſmoke iſſues out by a vent at top.</p>
            <p>Theſe people are miſerably poor, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt all the year round on fiſh, which they catch in the Volga. They prefer living on the banks of that ſtream, where the flags and ruſhes grow to a great height, and aſſiſt to ſhelter them from the ſeverity of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's cold.</p>
            <p>At the efflux of the Volga are numerous ſmall iſlands, and the whole ſcene appears wild and inhoſpitable. Arriving at Terkie, Mr. Hanway embarked on board an Engliſh ſhip, the Empreſs of Ruſſia, pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his crazy bark for a veſſel of good oak. It gave no leſs delight to ſee the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh flag, and to receive the attentions of his countrymen.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of December, having anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Langarood Bay, he ſent to Mr. Elton, a Britiſh factor, to inform him of his arrival, when that gentleman waited on him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the ſhore, where he gave him a cordial reception.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elton's habitation at Langarood, was eight Engliſh miles from the ſea, in the midſt of woods, ſurrounded by marſhes, where the roads were almoſt impaſſable. This ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally made the place very unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</p>
            <p>Here Mr. Hanway ſpent ſeveral days in converſing about the Caſpian trade. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035585_0016_10056C2D5BC19F10"/>
that Mr. Elton was actually engaged in building ſhips for the ſhah, as had been reported in Ruſſia; and Mr. Hanway took occaſion to point out his apprehenſions of the danger that might ariſe to their trade and ſettlement in Ruſſia, in conſequence of his engagements with that prince.</p>
            <p>One great inducement to open the Caſpian trade, was the hope of eſtabliſhing a new branch of commerce from Aſtrabad to Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, from whence Mr. Elton thought it practicable to extend it to the northern ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Mogul's empire. To attempt the execution of this deſign fell to Mr. Hanway's lot. He had brought with him goods to the value of five thouſand pounds, for which he found no market in this country; and though the ſhah had made an expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for his ſafe conduct in all parts of his dominions, he was under conſiderable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, till he found that, in caſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he might obtain a guard of ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>Having taken leave of Mr. Elton, our traveller got on ſhip board, and they directed their courſe for Aſtrabad, where they arrived on the 18th of December The ſea here, as in other parts of the Caſpian, makes great inroads on the land, ſo that in many places, trees lie on the ſhore.</p>
            <p>The ſhip having caſt anchor, Mr Hanway ſent an Armenian ſervant to know if he might land his goods in ſecurity; but he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without any information. Inſtantly
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035585_0017_10056C2F7A52C170"/>
they ſaw many fires lighted, the ſignal of alarm; for, it ſeems, the natives took them for pirates, and had put themſelves on the defenſive.</p>
            <p>Two days after, Mr. Hanway went on ſhore, and having ſatisfied the natives that he was come on a friendly errand, they received him kindly, and conducted him and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to a ſmall village, the way to which lay through thick woods and winding paths.</p>
            <p>Having diſpatched his Armenian interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mahomet Zaman Beg, the governor of Aſtrabad, with his compliments, that chief returned him an aſſurance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and cautioned him againſt putting any confidence in the natives on the coaſt. A few days after he received a viſit from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeer Aga, a Perſian officer attended by a grave old man named Myrza, who had a high reputation for wiſdom. The former had been recommended to Mr. Hanway as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great probity; and on this occaſion he made him offer of his houſe at Aſtrabad, which our author accepted with grateful thanks.</p>
            <p>About this time the veſſel narrowly eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being burnt, from the accidental confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of a quantity of raw cotton, which was with difficulty extinguiſhed with little damage, after it had nearly reached the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cheſt. Same night their alarm was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the mountains appearing in a blaze, which fire was intentionally kindled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the inſects; but, ſpreading by the wind
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035585_0018_10056C323038E110"/>
and the long-continued drought, it made ſuch progreſs, that the butter in the ſhip was melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its heat, and the natives were obliged to labour with all their might to divert its courſe from their villages.</p>
            <p>On the 2d of January 1744, Mr. Hanway pitched his tent on the ſhore, and made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for conveying the goods to the city. That day they were entertained with extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore ſongs, dances, and congratulations by the natives; and in the evening they witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their devotions. Next morning Myrza's brother and two ſons brought horſes for Mr. Hanway, and in a few hours they reached the city.</p>
            <p>The ſucceeding day our author waited on the governor, and made him a preſent of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cuts of broad cloth and ſugar-loaves. He was attended by ſeveral perſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in the city, and behaved with great condeſcenſion, telling Mr. Hanway that he was welcome to Perſia, and that the city of Aſtrabad was now at his diſpoſal. For this high-ſtrained compliment, our traveller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned due acknowledgments, and expreſſed the grateful ſenſe he felt of his kindneſs and protection.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway, who was about to become the dupe of his own integrity and want of ſuſpicion, now waited on Nazeer Aga, of whoſe politeneſs he had received ſome ſignal proofs. He was far advanced in years; but while his age and his white beard rendered his appearance venerable, his manly cheerful
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035585_0019_10056C345428A500"/>
manner made his company perfectly agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This perſon had been the companion of Nadir, when he was no more than the chief of a party of robbers in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountains; but ſeemed too honeſt and unaſſuming for a favourite; yet thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had, perhaps, been his ſafeguard through life. The old man received Mr Hanway with many tokens of good will, and ſent for ſome maſter carriers to agree about convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his caravan to Meſched. Here our traveller firſt received an impreſſion of the equivocating diſpoſition of the Perſians; he found it impoſſible to fix them to any thing, and therefore took his leave for that time.</p>
            <p>A day or two after, ſeveral of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal perſons of the place came to pay their reſpects to Mr. Hanway. Moſt of them had an air of importance, and ſpoke little; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſitting and ſmoking the caallean, a mode of uſing tobacco through water, for a few minutes, they roſe and took their leave.</p>
            <p>The difficulties and delays made by the carriers gave him great vexation, and ſome of the townſmen frequently importuned him to open his bales there, and ſell them what they wanted. To this propoſal he did not think it prudent to accede; but to keep them in good humour, he made the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons preſents of cloth enough to make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at.</p>
            <p>At length, on the perſuaſion of Nageer Aga, though contrary to his own ſentiments, he ſuffered the carriers to ſet out with ten
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035585_0020_10056C35D607A9E8"/>
loaded camels, two or three days before he was to follow them with the horſes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a place of rendezvous, on the other ſide of the mountains.</p>
            <p>Theſe being diſpatched, Mr. Hanway made a viſit to the governor, who appeared agitated and confounded. He pretended to be employed in providing horſes to convey part of the king's treaſure to Caſbin, which prevented him from accommodating our traveller with ſoldiers and horſes as he wiſhed. This intelligence extremely ſtartled him, but fortunately for his peace, he was at this time ignorant of the real extent of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs.</p>
            <p>Determined to follow the caravan imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, he prepared to ſet out; but while he was giving the neceſſary orders, Nazeer Aga told him this was not a lucky hour, and that he muſt not depart. Our author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his reliance on a good Providence who ordered all events, and that all hours were the ſame to him. However, the cataſtrophe was now ripe. Scarcely had Nazeer Aga left him, when the hoarſe ſound of trumpets was heard to call in the neighbouring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, the ſhops were ordered to be ſhut, and the townſmen to man the walls.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway now began to recollect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny incidents which aſſiſted to develope the plot. Nazeer Aga adviſed him to ſend or his ſhip, as they were all in extreme danger from a rebellion which had broken out in the vicinity of the city; but the veſſel had ſailed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035585_0021_10056C37F3E4D9E0"/>
to another port; and he found that no one was allowed to leave the city; ſo that the loads of cloth he had ſent forward were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the inſurgents without oppoſition.</p>
            <p>It now appeared that Mahomet Haſſan Beg, who had left the city ſome days before, had put himſelf at the head of a party Kha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jars and Turcoman Tartars, with an avowed intention of ſeizing the ſhah's treaſure, and particularly our traveller's caravan.</p>
            <p>The only conſolation that Nazeer Aga could now give Mr. Hanway, was the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that while he lived, he ſhould be ſecured from perſonal danger. The reſpect which had always been ſhewn by the chief of the inſurgents to this old man, induced him to venture himſelf among them; but he uſed his eloquence and influence in vain to recal them to their duty, though they ſuffered him to return to the city.</p>
            <p>A beſieged city, with a faithleſs and weak garriſon, was a new ſcene to Mr. Hanway; and the idea he had formed of the barbarity of the Turcoman Tartars increaſed the gloom inſeparable from his ſituation. His attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants would have perſuaded him to aſſume the Perſian dreſs, but he choſe to remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſguiſe. The governor, however, and Nazeer Aga eſcaped by night in the habit of peaſants, and left the townſmen to take c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who had not engaged in the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion now curſed our traveller as the cauſe of their diſtreſs, alledging that it was his valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035585_0022_10056C3A35EBC5A0"/>
goods that had tempted the inſurrection.</p>
            <p>But he could not reproach himſelf with having given any juſt cauſe of offence to any one; and patiently waited the event. The town was ſurrendered on the 17th, and the king's treaſure being ſeized, the general and his attentendants next viſited Mr. Hanway, who, having collected his men into one room, ſent a Tartar boy, who ſpoke the Turkiſh language, to introduce thoſe hoſtile gueſts, and to tell them that he entreated humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>They aſſured him of perſonal ſecurity, and that as ſoon as the government was ſettled, his goods ſhould be paid for; demanding at the ſame time to know where they were lodged, and aſking for his purſe, which they returned, after counting the money.</p>
            <p>It was now apparent on what principles Myrza Mahomet had acted. He was in the ſecret of the rebellion at the time he invited Mr Hanway to the city, and had brought him there as a victim, devoted to ruin; but having nothing more than his life to loſe, he deſſembled the perfidy he had experienced, and endeavoured to ſecure the protection of Baba Sadoc, the new governor of the city, to whom he made a preſent of a piece of rich ſilk that he had found means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete.</p>
            <p>His purfe, however, was again demanded, and he was obliged to give it up. Indeed he found that the Turcomans were not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his ſpoils; they propoſed to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035585_0023_10056C3CF215D2B8"/>
Khan Beg to have him and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants given up as ſlaves; and fearing leſt he ſhould be carried away by thoſe barbarians, into their own country, he reſolved to effect his eſcape.</p>
            <p>The victors ſoon quarrelled about the plunder, and an order was iſſued that no one ſhould paſs the gates without the knowledge of Mahomet Haſſen Beg. However, Mr. Hanway having given the governor a regular account of the real value of the goods, the better to carry on the farce, was preſented with a bill for the amount, payable as ſoon as the new order of affairs was ſettled. The governor alſo directed that a guard and horſes ſhould be provided for him and his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, on the 24th of January, they took their leave of the city or Aſtrabad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Myrza his brothers, and two ſons. At the end of the firſt day's journey, one of Myrza's brothers offered to conduct Mr. Hanway to a houſe belonging to him in the adjacent mountain, which ſcheme he reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely declined; and in this he was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the carriers, who expreſſed their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for his ſafety, if he complied.</p>
            <p>It ſeems this villian ſuppoſed our traveller was ſtill poſſeſſed of ſome concealed proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and having got him in his power, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make uſe of the opportunity which preſented itſelf of ſtripping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

declare, that he would not ſuffer him to proceed a mile farther, unleſs he left his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, as he could not anſwer for his ſafety.</p>
            <p>This crafty veteran, whoſe perfidiouſneſs was exceeded by nothing but his hypocriſy, was playing a deep game. If the rebellion ſucceeded, he intended to make ſure of the baggage; if it failed, be wiſhed to have the merit of pleading his loyalty, by preſerving it for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Mr. Hanway ſaw himſelf wholly at his mercy, and therefore, after having concealed every thing that was port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he delivered up the reſt to him.</p>
            <p>Next day, our author advanced with his Company about twenty Engliſh miles, and took up his lodgings in the open fields. Finding that his conductors ſowed rebellion wherever they came, as the government of the ſhah was become very unpopular, from his tyranny and exactions, he determined to part with them as ſoon as poſſible. They had engaged to carry him to Balfruſh, the capital of Mazandera; but hearing that the admiral of the coaſt, Mahomet Khan, was raiſing forces to check the progreſs of the revolters, they were intimidated from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the place of their deſtination, and left him on the ſea coaſt, before he knew how to manage without their ſervices.</p>
            <p>After a very perilous navigation, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially got ſafe to Meſchedizar, and ſoon after waited on the admiral of the coaſt, who congratulated him on his eſcape
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035585_0025_10056C40AD504010"/>
with life, and joined in the aſſurances which he had received from the merchants at Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruſh, that the ſhah would make him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for his loſſes. This ſerved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive his dejected ſpirits; but next day, the rebels having advanced within a few miles of the city, and the admiral painting the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of his own ſituation, as he neither was in a condition to give battle, nor dared to retreat for fear of his maſter's diſpleaſure, Mr. Hanway ſaw there was no time to be loſt, and eſcaped by one gate as the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars entered by another.</p>
            <p>The diſtreſſes he now underwent would be painful to relate. Hunger, cold, fatigue, and the moſt imminent danger ſurrounded him; but after various adventures, he had the good fortune to arrive at Langarood, which he had left ſeven weeks before; and was received by Mr. Elton with open arms, who rejoiced at his having eſcaped with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and life.</p>
            <p>Mr Hanway had been twenty three days in reaching this place, from the time he left Aſtrabad; and for ſixteen days he had not taken off his boots, nor enjoyed a moment's comfortable repoſe. His legs and feet were much ſwelled and bruiſed; and he was in want of every neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Being now in ſafety himſelf, his cares re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for his attendants, whom he had been obliged to abandon to their fate. Mr. Elton immediately ſent ſervants and horſes in queſt of them, and if the diſaſters which befel

Mr. Hanway himſelf were great, the calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities which Mr. Hogg, his clerk, had been doomed to ſuffer, infinitely ſurpaſſed them. This unfortunate man was almoſt expiring of a conſumption, when he was brought to Langarood; he had been expoſed, for three days and as many nights, to the cold and rain, without food or ſhelter; he had been five times robbed, and at laſt ſtripped of his clothes, and left almoſt naked; and would infallibly have periſhed, had he not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the charity of ſome derviſes, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>One of the Armenian ſervants, named Matteuſe, and his companions, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn till three weeks after, and had the good fortune to eſcape many of thoſe hardſhip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Being recovered from his fatigues, Mr. Hanway ſet out for Reſhd, and after tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling ſeven miles, arrived at Lahijan, which is ſeated on an eminence, and is reckoned the moſt healthy town in the province of Ghilan. The rains had filled a large flat with water, in the centre of which ſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

to beautify the proſpect, and to render it as delightful as the ſeaſon would permit.</p>
            <p>Here he was received by Hadjee Zamon,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hadjee, or Sacred, is a title given to all thoſe who have made a pilgrimage to Mecca</note> a man of ſenſe and authority, who loudly complained of the inhumanity of the ſhah and his officers. Supper being brought in, a ſervant preſented a baſon of water and a towel to the gueſts, to waſh and dry their hands with; and then a kind of tea-board was ſet before each, covered with a plate of pleo, in which was a ſmall quantity of mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meat mixed up with fruits and ſpices. Plates of comfits, ſherbet, and other weak liquors, were alſo ſerved up. Every viand in this country is ſo prepared, that it may be eaten with the fingers; to cut dreſſed meat is reckoned an abomination.</p>
            <p>Supper being finiſhed, warm water was brought in to waſh with, and then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was reſumed. This was carried on with great decency and attention to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the aged. It is not the richeſt man who is here regarded, but he who is moſt eſteemed for wiſdom and experience.</p>
            <p>Next morning our traveller ſet forward to Reſhd, well pleaſed with his laſt night's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; and the following day arrived at that city, where he had the pleaſure to be viſited by two Engliſh gentlemen, and three French miſſionaries. Soon after, he paid a viſit of ceremony to Ordo Kouli Beg, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035585_0028_10056C471E69F708"/>
of the province, who received him with much politeneſs, and ordered a chair to be ſet for him; a mark of attention not often paid in this country, where European faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are little regarded. The apartment was full of people, ſeated on felts of camel's hair. After ſome general converſation, Mr. Hanway related the hiſtory of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and ſoon took his leave.</p>
            <p>Having here provided himſelf with clothes, arms, mules, and horſes, he purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his journey on the 26th. In the vicinity of Reſhd, are rice fields and plantations of mulberry-trees. The mountains, however, are compoſed of naked rocks, piled on each other to a great height, and the only fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in the vales.</p>
            <p>On the 28th they paſſed the river Kizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazan in canoes, and ſwam over the horſes and mules; but the rapidity of the ſtream rendered this very dangerous. As they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the mountains, they found the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate much altered; and the wind blowing freſh, they were obliged to diſmount and lead their cattle along the narrow paths among the precipices. The rocks here almoſt roſe perpendicular from the river.</p>
            <p>Continuing their progreſs over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, on the 1ſt of March they came to the great plain of Caſbin, then covered deep in ſnow, which reflected ſuch brightneſs from its ſurface as painfully affected the organs of ſight. The villages in this plain are built in ſuch a manner, that half the tenement is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035585_0029_10056C494F488578"/>
the ſurface of the earth, and the roof is raiſed into a cone, the better to carry off the ſnow. That night they lodged in a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined ſtable; and next day reſumed their journey before ſun riſing.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Hanway arrived at Caſt in, he waited on Hadjee Abdulcrim, the principal merchant in the town, who provided him with a handſome lodging, and told him that it was impoſſible to proceed farther at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, on an account of the ſnow.</p>
            <p>The houſes of Caſbin are almoſt wholly ſubterraneous, and many of the gardens are below the level of the adjacent lands, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the conveyance of water to them. In general they build with unburnt brick, and uſe a ſtrong cement of lime. Their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are flat roofed, and conſiſt of two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions within an incloſure of mud. In the exterior court is a ſpacious room called the Aviam, open on one ſide, and ſupported by pillars, where the men diſpatch their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and behind this is the haram, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's apartment. Niches in the walls ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of tables. The floors are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with large carpets, and large pieces of felt are uſed by way of cuſhions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway was handſomely entertained by the Hadjee on the 3d of March. His hoſt enquiring how he liked Perſia, our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller told him the diſaſters he had met with; when he received the comfortable aſſurance, that the ſhah would do him juſtice; but gave a pathetic deſcription of the miſery to which
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035585_0030_10056C4C04B8E0A8"/>
the country was reduced; and inſtanced Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, which was reduced from twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand houſes to leſs than a tenth of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Mr. Hanway ſenſibly remarked, that when the ſovereign had accompliſhed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, there was reaſon to ſuppoſe, he would alter his ſyſtem; for that it never could be his purpoſe to deſtroy his people, as that would be annihilating his own conſequence.</p>
            <p>In Caſbin is a palace built by Nadar Shah, which Mr. Hanway viſited. It has a long avenue of lofty trees before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and is incloſed by a wall of about a mile and a half in circumference, with only one entrance. Within this area are four large ſquares, adorned with trees, fountains, and running ſtreams. The apartments are raiſed about ſix feet from the ground; and the aviam, or open hall, which ſtands in the centre, ſhuts in with folding doors. The rooms are ornamented in the Italian taſte, and the ceilings are embelliſhed with moral ſentences, arranged in ſquares. Moſt of the windows are compoſed of painted glaſs, in which the figures are drawn in proper ſhades, and executed with great felicity of deſign.</p>
            <p>The haram makes a magnificent appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and is quite ſeparated from the other parts of the palace, by a wall of its own. The rooms are ſinely decorated, and the whole is refreſhed with fountains, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with elegant and expenſive embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:035585_0031_10056C4E211EAB10"/>Near the haram is the eunuchs' apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, remarkable only for its having but one door. Here are likewiſe ſome old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments built by Shah Abas, in which are ſome indifferent pictures, by European artiſts.</p>
            <p>The city of Caſbin is fortified by a wall and turrets. It is famous in hiſtory for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been one of the chief cities of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Parthia, the reſidence of many of the Perſian kings, and the burial place of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoeſton, the favourite of Alexander the Great. However, the greateſt part of this once-celebrated place was now in ruins.</p>
            <p>On the 11th of March the ſnow being chiefly diſſolved, and the weather warm. Mr. Hanway ſet out with a caravan, that was carrying money to Shiras, under a guard of eight hundred Afghans. As he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, ſcarcely any thing met his view but ruin and devaſtation, which was the more pitiable in a climate and ſoil naturally good.</p>
            <p>In Perſia it is an eſtabliſhed cuſtom for the military to pillage wherever they go, or at leaſt to compel the natives to furniſh them with whatever they want. This hard treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſteels the hearts of the peaſants againſt the calls of humanity. They defend their property by barricadoing their houſes, and conſider every ſtranger as a foe, by which means the innocent ſuffer, as well as the guilty.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway at length diſcovered that all his Perſian fellow-travellers were in the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035585_0032_10056C4FA2F64588"/>
of a meſſenger. One of them who was a native of the eaſtern parts of Perſia, particularly attracted his notice. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt black; and apprehended himſelf to be in conſiderable danger from the reſentment of the Shah. Being of a communicative diſpoſition, and finding that our author was an European, he freely ſpoke his ſentiments.</p>
            <p>"I am come from Iſpahan," ſaid he, "where I have been two years engaged in raiſing forces for the ſhah; and, in return for my ſervices, he has lately extorted four thouſand crowns from me, and I am now under the dread of ſome other act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. It is no unuſual thing for my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſend for a man, in order to ſtrangle him; and, for my part, I ſhould be glad to compound for a ſevere beating."</p>
            <p>This priſoner endeavoured to learn a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by heart, which, if he repeated right in the preſence of the ſhah, he ſaid, it would divert his wrath. He had alſo another ſpell, which was the repetition of ten particular letters of the alphabet as he entered the royal tent, cloſing a finger at each, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fiſt clenched till he came before the throne; when he was ſuddenly to open his hands, and by the diſcharge of his magic ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, to ſubdue his ſovereign's reſentment.</p>
            <p>It is aſtoniſhing to ſee in how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the Perſians demonſtrate the higheſt ſuperſtition. Almoſt every motion of the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035585_0033_10056C51C5475180"/>
body is conſidered as poſſeſſed of magic power.</p>
            <p>Sneezing is held a happy omen; and they fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cy that falling meteors are the blows of the angels on the heads of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Cats are held in great eſteem, and dogs are proportionably deteſted. The Turks, however, are not behind hand with them in ſuperſtitious folly. In the reign of Shah Abas, the grand ſeignior ſent to deſire that he would not ſuffer any of his ſubjects to dreſs in green, which colour belonged to the prophet and his deſcendants. Shah Abas, who was a man of an enlightened mind, returned this humorous anſwer: That if the grand ſeignior would prevent the dogs from watering the graſs in Turkey, he would comply with his requeſt.</p>
            <p>On the 17th, they began to approach the camp, and already fell in with the advanced guard. As they drew near the place where they expected to find their doom, the fears of the Perſian convoy increaſed, and they took leave of our author with heavy hearts. Their conductor, on wiſhing them to get on quickly, was aſked, why he haſtened them; "for, doſt thou not know," ſaid one of them, "that to condemned perſons, every hour of life is precious?"</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway having ſent forward his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter to the ſhah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s miniſter, appointed for the reception of ſtrangers, to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; on the 20th pitched his tent near the royal ſtandard, and had the ſatisfaction
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035585_0034_10056C5483816660"/>
of hearing that the rebellion of Aſtrabad was ſuppreſſed. But be had not been long in this ſituation, before a loaded piece, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally going off in his tent, had very near deprived him of life; nor was he free from apprehenſion of being called to account for the danger in which this involuntary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs had involved others, particularly as it happened ſo near the royal reſidence. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it paſſed with no very ſerious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to any one.</p>
            <p>Having paid his reſpects to Muſtapha Khan, he was received with many marks of civility, invited to dinner, and made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, by the aſſurance that juſtice ſhould be done him. Meanwhile he delivered his petition into the chancery; and had the pleaſure to hear that it was believed, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would pardon the Perſians who had accompanied him from Caſbin, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to him.</p>
            <p>In a few days, the royal ſtandard was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down, as a ſignal for ſtriking the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts, and the whole army moved with great regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and again encamped about two leagues and a half diſtance.</p>
            <p>Soon after our traveller received a decree, by which it was ordered, that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver in the particulars of his loſſes in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to Behbud Khan, the general in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trabad, who had orders to reſtore whatever part of the goods might be found, and to pay the deficiency, out of the ſequeſtered eſtates of the rebels, to the laſt farthing.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035585_0035_10056C56A64D9E48"/>
As this laid him under the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Aſtrabad, it was not quite what he wiſhed for, but he thought it prudent to acquieſce.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway being now made eaſy on the ſubject of his loſs, amuſed himſelf with tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ride round the Perſian camp. The tents of the miniſters and officers were pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in front, near that of the ſhah, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied a conſiderable ſpace. The pavillion, in which his majeſty uſually ſat to give au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was of an oblong form, ſupported by three poles, adorned at the top with gilt balls. It had no appearance of appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate magnificence, and the front was always open, even in the moſt unfavourable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther The roof was covered with cotton cloth, lined with clouded ſilk. On the floor were ſpread carpets, on which the ſhah ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſat croſs-legged, and ſometimes he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged himſelf with a ſofa.</p>
            <p>At a diſtance behind were the monarch's private tents, where he retired to his meals; and almoſt contiguous were the tents of his ladies, ſeparated from each other by curtains. The boundaries of the ſhah's quarter were occupied by his eunuchs and female ſlaves; and almoſt the whole incloſure was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſtrong fence of net-work, guarded by a nightly patrole, that exerciſed ſeverity againſt all intruders.</p>
            <p>The camp market was about half a mile in extent. It conſiſted of tents ranged like the houſes in a ſtreet, where all kinds of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035585_0036_10056C5829999CC8"/>
proviſions and articles of convenience were ſold. An officer ſuperintends this diſtrict of the camp, and rides up and down, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace and order. All the dealers are under the protection of ſome of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who are themſelves the principal ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators in grain, by which they make vaſt profits.</p>
            <p>The ſhah had about ſixty women, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame number of eunuchs. When he changed his ſtation, he was preceded by running footmen, chanters, and a watch guard, that ſpread a mile or two, to give notice of their maſter's approach, and to warn the people from intruding. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when he travelled without his women, this precaution was not attended to, and his ſubjects were allowed to approach him. His women, and other ladies of diſtinction, rode aſtride on white horſes, or were carried on camels in a kind of elegant panniers. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of inferior rank mixed among the crowd; but not without a linen veil over their faces particularly thoſe of Perſian birth, who are very ſcrupulous in this reſpect. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one female to ten males is the uſual proportion in the ſhah's camp.</p>
            <p>The horſe furniture belonging to Nadir was to the laſt degree expenſive. He had four ſets of it, one mounted with pearls, another with rubies, a third with emeralds, and a fourth with diamonds of great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The immenſe value of thoſe trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings could only be equalled by the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035585_0037_10056C5A4729C168"/>
taſte in which they were executed. In a viſit to Muſtapha Khan, our traveller of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to get a complete ſet of horſe furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made up in Europe for the ſhah, which would infinitely ſurpaſs the workmanſhip of ſuch as he poſſeſſed; but the khan, perfectly knowing his maſter's temper, replied, "the ſhah has not patience enough to wait till they are finiſhed."</p>
            <p>The officers, and even the ſoldiers, ſeem to have a pride in the ſplendor of their horſes' trappings; and, indeed, their accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements and arms in general, are very rich. It ſeems to be a principle of policy in the monarch, to keep his army dependent, by encouraging them to expend their money in articles of vanity.</p>
            <p>Muſtapha Khan, one of the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men in the Perſian court, ſhewed ſo much attention to Mr Hanway, that, out of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, he preſented him with a gold repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watch, ſome fine cloth, and ſilk. The chief at firſt declined accepting them; but at laſt, being prevailed on to honour our traveller ſo far, he made a return in ſome jewels, which had once decorated the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of an Indian. The principal jewel conſiſted of a large ſapphire ſet in gold, and encompaſſed with diamonds</p>
            <p>On the 27th of March, Mr. Hanway left the Perſian camp, and had two ſoldiers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for his protection They now took a different route; and had every where the melancholy proſpect of vaſt tracts of land,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035585_0038_10056C5D018AF560"/>
of the richeſt ſoil, lying waſte, and towns and villages, once populous and handſome, reduced to ruin and deſolation</p>
            <p>Next day, in the vicinity of an inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mountain, they diſcovered five perſons, who put themſelves into a threatening poſture, which gave our author ſome uneaſineſs. The ſoldiers entered into a parley with one of them, and purchaſed a ſtolen horſe, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the party of marauders, who, it ſeems, were intimidated from attacking Mr. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, by the reputation which the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans poſſeſs for their dexterity in the uſe of fire-arms. From this adventure, our author had no very exalted opinion of the reliance he could place on his military guards.</p>
            <p>On the 29th, they aſcended the ſummit of a very high mountain, where they found the air ſo extremely ſubtle and piercing, that it was with difficulty they could breathe. Deſcending, however, into the valley, they enjoyed a very different climate, and Abar appeared before them with an enchanting aſpect. But this city had ſuffered like the reſt, and it was with difficulty they could procure a lodging in it.</p>
            <p>The mountains, over which their direct road lay, being ſtill covered with ſnow, they were obliged to take a circuit us route, and in the ſpace of four leagues, they had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to croſs a branch of the Kizilazan no leſs than ſixty-five times This river was about thirty feet wide, and between two and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035585_0039_10056C5E83454BA8"/>
three deep: the ſtream was rapid, and the bottom ſtoney and rough.</p>
            <p>After a journey of ten hours, they arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a deſolate caravanſary, where they found nothing but water; but ſome hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inhabitants of a village they had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly paſſed through, had ſupplied them with proviſions. Next day, on approaching the mountains that cover Ghilan, they found the reflection of the ſun ſo ſtrong, that it was with difficulty they ſaved themſelves from the ſcorching heat. At length, being almoſt exhauſted, they came in ſight of the village of Arſevil, which being barricadoed with large fir trees, except one narrow paſſage, excited a ſuſpicion that it was in a ſtate of rebellion. This apprehenſion, however, was ſoon relieved, by their learning that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants had thus ſecured themſelves from the couriers of the ſhah, who ſeize their horſes, and ride them without mercy. They gave our traveller and his attendants a kind reception; but in two hours after their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, eight couriers arrived, well-armed, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on ſome miſſion for their ſovereign. Theſe couriers exerciſe many acts of wanton cruelty, and think the authority under which they act is ſufficient to protect them. The poſtmaſters, who ſupply them with horſes, are ſubject to grievous oppreſſions, and have frequently demands made upon them beyond what they can anſwer. One of theſe contractors being charged by Nadir with diſappointing his couriers, made this bold
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035585_0040_10056C60A10E6700"/>
reply: "For every ten horſes in my power, you ſend me twenty couriers; and a man had better die at once than live to ſerve a raſcal." With this he immediately ſtabbed himſelf. The ſhah exclaimed, "Save him! he is a brave fellow!" but humanity was now too late: the wound was mortal.</p>
            <p>While in this village, Mr. Hanway had the pain to ſee ſome youths, inveſted with military power, ſtriking old men, whoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect entitled them to reverence, for trivial o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, or for no fault whatever. His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian ſervants ſeemed inclined to imitate their example; but he reſtrained them, by the aſſurance, that they ſhould ſuffer tenfold puniſhment if they injured any one.</p>
            <p>After croſſing a high mountain, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into a pleaſant and fruitful valley. Spring had already ſtrewed the ground with her fineſt bloom; and the brightneſs of the ſky, together with the pictureſque appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the country, filled the mind with the moſt pleaſing ideas. The river Kizila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan meandered through this delicious ſpot, and the moſt beautiful woods and lawns di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified the ſcene.</p>
            <p>How happy, ſays Mr. Hanway, might Perſia be, did not a general depravity of manners involve her inhabitants in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable confuſion! But how much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier ſtill are thoſe countries, though under a leſs favourable ſky, which enjoy a mild go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and whoſe inhabitants are inſpired
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035585_0041_10056C622301A3B0"/>
with ſentiments of true religion and virtue, which alone can blunt the edge of thoſe ills to which mankind are univerſally ſubject!</p>
            <p>On the 1ſt of April, Mr. Hanway paſſed the defiles of the mountains, which guard the province of Ghilan, and next day arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Reſhd, where he had the pleaſure of meeting ſome of his friends. On the 5th, he reached Langarood, where he once more found himſelf happy in the ſociety of Mr. Elton and the French miſſionaries.</p>
            <p>Though near the ſcene of his former ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and obliged to have intercourſe with ſome of thoſe who had contributed to his diſaſters, with a mind ſuperior to revenge, he indulged that Chriſtian charity which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can enſure tranquillity, and render the mind happy when it turns on itſelf.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway was here viſited by a Perſian prieſt, in company with Shahverdie Beg. They entertained him with ſeveral quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The prieſt, or mullah, obſerved, that though their laws allowed of four wives, beſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, he conſidered that man as the moſt virtuous, who confined himſelf to one; while, on the other hand, he regarded celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy as a crime againſt nature</p>

a year, and if ſhe produces a male child, it belongs to the father; but if a female, ſhe retains the excluſive right to it. Even legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate marriage does not ſeem to entitle the women to any diſtinguiſhed privileges; for they are conſidered as little more than crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures formed for the pleaſure of their lords.</p>
            <p>The women of Ghilan are fair and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. They have black eyes and hair; and they darken the former by art. They are generally low in ſtature, and have delicate features. The children of both ſexes have fine complexions; but the boys ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a tawney hue.</p>
            <p>The women here are very induſtrious, and are frequently employed in the toils of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, on which occaſions they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conceal their faces with a veil. When women of rank, however, go abroad, they are not only veiled, but have a ſervant to clear the way for them; and it is reckoned the greateſt mark of unpoliteneſs to look at them.<note n="*" place="bottom">How ſingular do the cuſtoms of ſome countries appear, when contraſted with thoſe of others!

            </p>
            <p>The Perſians are much governed by ſhew and external parade. Hence ſome of the European factors have carried their oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the moſt ridiculous pitch. Perhaps this conduct is politic among a people who
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035585_0043_10056C678567D9A0"/>
are ſwayed by appearance; but it ſeems in ſome caſes to be carried too far.</p>
            <p>The province of Ghilan is partly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by mountains, and has many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult paſſes, for which reaſon it is not eaſily kept in ſubjection. Reſhd, the capital, was formerly reckoned a moſt inſalubrious ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the thickneſs of the woods which ſurrounded it; but ſome of theſe have been cleared, and the place is no longer ſo fatal to life. The whole province however is marſay; and it is obſerved by the natives, that only women, mules, and poultry enjoy health, which may poſſibly ariſe from the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which they are generally ſubject.</p>
            <p>But though the climate is unpropitions, the ſoil is rich, and produces exuberant crops. Fruits of all kinds are very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but the grapes, for want of cultivation, are but indifferent Indeed, moſt of the fruits are unfavourable to the health of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, particularly the peaches and figs, which partake of the pernicious moiſture of the ſoil.</p>
            <p>Having taken care to provide himſelf a proper armed guard, on the 1ſt of May, Mr. Hanway ſet out for Aſtrabad The firſt evening they were benighted and loſt in a wood, though they had ſucceſſively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſeveral guides, who abandoned them through fear. In this dilemma they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards a light, where they found a houſe barricadoed with trees. In vain did they uſe their entre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r: they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to break into his houſe by force, and to carry him with them in a rope. Unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as this conduct may appear, it is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the practice in this diſtracted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and they took care to reward him for his ſervices, though they were involuntary.</p>
            <p>Next day they entered the province of Mazanderan. On the 4th their cattle were attacked by a large wolf; but being driven off by the guard, the ſavage content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with killing a cow. Soon after they fell in with a detachment of fifty ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the commander of whom courteouſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his ſervice to guard them. Ten men were accepted, and the officer was compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with cloth for a coat.</p>
            <p>As they advanced farther into this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which greatly reſembles Ghilan in its ſoil, climate, and productions, the peaſants began to grow daring, and one of them ſeized the commander of their troop by the throat As it is dangerous to proceed to extremities, Mr. Hanway recommended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and even withdrew from the houſe aſſigned for their lodgings to a tent in the open air, that he might not incommode the women and children belonging to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Such attentive humanity is very amiable in any perſon, and probably was little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected among the people of this country. However, night drawing on, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a very bad neighbourhood; for theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>lagers having engaged in the late rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035585_0045_10056C6B27B7FBE8"/>
began to be apprehenſive that the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were ſent to ſeize them, and took to their arms, but ſoon retired. The inhabitants of the neighbouring mountains were equally diſaffected, and ſeveral horſemen poured down into the village in the night, no doubt, with a view of plundering them; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Hanway and his party prepared, they returned without attempting any thing. It was evident they were conſidered as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rich; for the natives would not be perſuaded, but that all the braſs buttons on their clothes were ſolid gold.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as it was day, they left this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant ſituation, under a hot ſun, which the Perſians ſeemed little to regard. During the heat of the day, however, they took ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a wood, reſolving in future to travel only in the cool. As they approached to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Amul, the country appeared ſtill more pleaſant. The city ſtands at the foot of Mount Taurus, and is waſhed by a fine river, over which there is a bridge of twelve arches.</p>
            <p>The Perſians have a tradition, that if any governor or commander paſſes this bridge on horſeback, he will ſoon be deprived of his office, if not of his life. On this account, though the ſtream is very rapid, the natives generally ford it; and as our author did not chuſe to be regarded as a perſon excluded from the common bounties of heaven, he thought proper to gratify opinion ſo far as to alight, and lead his horſe over this fated bridge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:035585_0046_10056C6DD836AB60"/>Here are the ruins of an old fortreſs, which appears to have been very ſtrong and regular for Perſia; and likewiſe a ſtone pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, in which Shah Abas often reſided, which commands a pleaſant proſpect, and is well contrived for coolneſs and convenience. In the garden are cypreſs trees of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſize and height.</p>
            <p>In this city our traveller met with a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belonging to Mahomet Khan, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter detailing the particulars of the late rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, invited him to a concert of muſic. One inſtrument reſembled a flute, another a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and a third a kettle-drum; to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic of which an old man and two boys ſang and danced. Dancing is conſidered in this country as mean and ignoble, and is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by none except ſuch as make a trade of it for hire. It ſeemed principally to conſiſt in geſticulation.</p>
            <p>To entertain Mr. Hanway to the beſt of his power, the writer then ſent for a prieſt, celebrated for his voice; but neither the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nor inſtrumental muſic had much ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ms for an European ear.</p>
            <p>In the evening of the 9th, Mr. Hanway left Amul, and travelled through a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful country till they reached Balfruſh, the capital, where he learned additional circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relative to the fate of the rebels. Among the reſt, he was told, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor appointed by Sadoc Aga, being ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had holes cut in his fleſh, and lighted candles put into them, in which ſhocking

condition the unhappy chief was led <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aked about the market place, till he expired with loſs of blood.</p>
            <p>A day or two after Mr. Hanway paid a viſit to Mahomet Khan, who had a delightful reſidence a few miles from the city. It was far from being ſuperb; but the adjacent woods and rivulets gave it an air of charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſimplicity, beyond the fineſt ſtrokes of art. In the area before the houſe, one hundred and fifty men were drawn up under arms, in double lines, to receive the gueſt. Our author alighted from his horſe at a ſmall diſtance, and advanced towards the khan with the uſual ſalutation. He was ſitting in the aviam, or outer court, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with many expreſſions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, as a proof of his regard releaſed a man that was tied and condemned to be beaten; adding, that he did this purely to honour his viſitor.</p>
            <p>Our traveller made this chief a preſent of ſome fine cloths, and a caſe of choice li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, of which he was immoderately fond. Having prevailed on his gueſt to tarry all right, he ordered poultry and a ſheep to be killed. Reſolving to ſhew him ſuch attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as would wipe off the ſtain of his former oil treatment; for which he condeſcended to make an apology.</p>
            <p>After dinner, muſic and dancers were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent for, who tortured the nerves of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor the whole evening with their noiſe and geſticulation. When the dancing men finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035585_0048_10056C7179277840"/>
they preſented Mr Hanway with an orange, which was a civil intimation that they expected a recompence for their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>This entertainment being over, the khan invited him to drink brandy with him, and expreſſed his aſtoniſhment, when he found that an European and a Chriſtian was not fond of ſpirituous liquors The khan, and his friends, indeed, ſhewed no reluctance in this reſpect; and after Mr. Hanway retired, it is probable they finiſhed the ſtrong waters he had preſented him with. The uſual mode is for each perſon to have a plate of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats before him, and to drink their liquor out of tea-cups, till they drop with intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Next morning, Mr. Hanway viewed the monument of the khan's favourite wife, who had lately been buried in an adjoining wood. It had an epitaph, in which the trite ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was repeated, of comparing life to a flower, that bloſſoms in the ſpring, attains the full luſtre of beauty in the ſummer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to wither and decline in autumn, and when winter comes on, is liable to be blown to the ground by every guſt of wind, where it lies and rots</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway now left Balfruſh, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on his journey through a fine country to Alleabad, which has a palace of mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but delightfully ſituated. The moſt capital work of art in this vicinity is
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035585_0049_10056C73444BF1F0"/>
the cauſeway, built by Shah Abas the Great, which extends from Keſkar, in the ſouth-weſt corner of the Caſpian, to Aſtrabad, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it; compriſing, in the whole, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of three hundred Engliſh miles. It is raiſed to the middle, with ditches on each ſide, and, in ſome places it is bordered with a thick wood, whoſe luxuriant branches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a delightful ſhelter to travellers.</p>
            <p>At Sari, the next ſtage, are four temples of the Guebres, or worſhippers of fire, who formerly poſſeſſed all this coaſt. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious edifices are rotundas about fifty feet in diameter, raiſed to a point of near one hundred and twenty feet in height, and are formed of the moſt durable materials.</p>
            <p>Continuing their route to Aſhreff, they had a view of the mountain Demoan, on which, the Perſians ſay, the ark reſted, while the Armenians aſcribe this honour to Mount Arrarat, which in clear weather is alſo viſible on the weſtern coaſt of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian.</p>
            <p>At Aſhreff, they ſaw a celebrated palace of Shah Abas, the moſt magnificent of any on the coaſt of the Caſpian Sea. Over the entrance are the arms of Perſia, a lion with the ſun riſing behind him, emblematic of the ſtrength and glory of this empire. Within the gate is a long avenue, on each ſide of which are thirty apartments for guards. The next gate opens into a garden, through which runs a ſtream of limpid water, that falls in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035585_0050_10056C76A0B9BF20"/>
ſeveral caſcades, with a baſon and fountain at each.</p>
            <p>In an adjacent building is a princely avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, painted with gold flowers on a blue ground, and containing ſeveral portraits, by a Dutch artiſt, of no maſterly execution. On the ſides of the aviam are ſeveral ſmall apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and behind them other waterfalls that pour down the ſides of a ſleep mountain clothed with wood.</p>
            <p>The garden is chiefly laid out in walks, bordered with rows of pines, orange, and other fruit trees. Beyond this is another garden, which ſeems to be conſidered as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ground, as they were not permitted to enter it.</p>
            <p>They next viſited a banquetting houſe, dedicated to a grandſon of Ali; and out of reſpect to this place, they were deſired to leave their ſwords at the door. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity with which our author was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced here, inſpired at firſt a kind of awe; but it was ſoon exchanged to contempt, on ſeeing the room adorned with ſuch paintings as could only pleaſe a voluptuous Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
            <p>They were then ſhewn another houſe and garden, in which was a ſtately dome whoſe top was painted, and the was covered with Dutch tiles, as far as the gallery. On an eminence, at ſome diſtance, ſtood a building intended for an obſervatory.</p>
            <p>The whole ſtructure commands the view of a fine country and of the Caſpian Sea.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035585_0051_10056C78C19FEC90"/>
In ſhort, every circumſtance conſpires to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this place delightful, and filled our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with many pleaſing ideas; but the wretchedneſs of the people conſtantly recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his thoughts, and damped the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he felt from a view of the country.</p>
            <p>On the 15th, they left Aſhreff, and on the way met a courier from Myrza Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met to beſeech Mr. Hanway to haſten his journey, and uſe his intereſt to ſave his life. As they approached the city of Aſtrabad, they met ſeveral armed horſemen, carrying home the peaſants, whoſe eyes had been put out for taking a part in the late rebellion. Near the entrance of the city on each ſide, was a ſtone pyramid, full of niches which were filled with human heads that made a moſt ghaſtly appearance.</p>
            <p>On entering Aſtrabad for the ſecond time, Mr Hanway found it a ſcene of miſery and deſolation That day the eyes of thirty perſons had been ſcooped out, four had been beheaded, and one burnt alive; two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred women had been baniſhed the city, one hundred and fifty of whom had been ſold to the ſoldiers as ſlaves.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Hanway was introduced to Behbud, the king's general, he found him ſurrounded by ſoldiers, and employed in judging and condemning the unhappy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents. After the firſt compliments, our author delivered the ſhah's decree, which was received with every mark of reſpect, and given to the ſecretary to read. A ſpeedy
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035585_0052_10056C7A43293FF8"/>
compliance with it was promiſed, and Mr. Hanway was then entertained with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, and large white mulberries, which are a delicious fruit. During this repaſt, the priſoners were removed, and the ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made a complimental ſpeech on the utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of merchants, who ought, for their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to kings and countries, to be protected by all parties, and injured by none.</p>
            <p>Sadoc Aga, who had a principal hand in Mr Hanway's misfortunes, was then brought before the tribunal. When our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaw him before, he was a youth of more than common vivacity, was richly dreſſed, well armed, and full of mirth. What a change now appeared! His garb was mean, his eyes were deprived of ſight, he drooped his head, even the tone of his voice was altered. The general told him he muſt pay for our traveller's goods, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired how they had been diſpoſed of. "All I know of them," ſaid he, "is, that they were taken by Mahomet Haſſan, and by him diſtributed to the people. Would to God! that Mahomet Haſſan, and his whole houſe had been buried deep in the earth, ere I had heard his name! And how can I refund? I have nothing left, but this mean garb you ſee on my back; and this, indeed, is more than ſufficient; for, after you have deprived me of fight, of what value is life to me?"</p>
            <p>This feeling ſpeech was accompanied with that emotion, natural to a daring ſpirit: it
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035585_0053_10056C7C5E25FCB0"/>
ought to have melted the tyrant; but to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence him, he cruelly ordered the miſerable man to be ſtruck on the mouth, which was done with ſuch violence, that the blood guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out.</p>
            <p>Sadoc Aga being removed, Myrza Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet was brought in, loaded with wooden fetters, and a heavy triangular wooden col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar about his neck. Mr. Hanway might then have retorted the wrongs he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had he been a brute; but he was a man, and a Briton, and wounded with the pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous objects before his eyes, his heart was too full to bear the ſight any longer.</p>
            <p>He then viſited Mahomet Huſſein Khan, whoſe ſon had been governor of Aſtracan before the rebellion, and who had been charged with the murder of Shah Toehmas, the laſt legitimate ſovereign of Perſia. He aſſured Mr Hanway that his buſineſs ſhould be expedited according to the ſhah's order, and obſerved, "I am charged with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular commiſſion to excecute puniſhment on the rebels. I muſt do that for which I know I ſhall be damned. To-morrow is a day of blood; I will make them pay you, though I pull the money out of their throats."</p>
            <p>This was too much for humanity to hear: Mr. Hanway was incapable of thanking him for this bloody intention. The unhappy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels had acted, indeed, as if they meane to devote themſelves to ruin; yet an oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch execrable tyranny wanted only
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035585_0054_10056C7DE203F648"/>
more ſtrength and wiſdom to give it the ſtamp of glory.</p>
            <p>Next day, eight Turcoman Tartars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, were brought into the city, on which the general expreſſed great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, obſerving, that many niches in the py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid called by his own name, were yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. In Perſia a malefactor is executed with little ceremony; he kneels, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his creed, "There is but one God, Mahomet is his prophet, and Ali his friend," his head is ſtruck off with a ſcime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</p>
            <p>When Mr. Hanway waited on Nazeer Aga, who had been his firmeſt friend, he expreſſed great ſatisfaction at ſeeing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, after the dangers they had both run through. This perſon had been well remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the ſhah for the ſervices he had rendered him during the rebellion</p>
            <p>In a few days after Mr. Hanway was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Captain Woodroofe was arrived in the bay of Aſtrabad, and Nazeer Aga ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him, by letter, that, as ſeveral of the hordes were ſtill in arms, it might be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for him to truſt his property on board the ſhip. Our author thanked him for his care; but affecting ſecurity, as the beſt means of preventing danger; he returned for anſwer, that the great guns would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from the moſt numerous aſſailants that might have the temerity to attack the veſſel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:035585_0055_10056C80A5C52C98"/>On the 21ſt, Myrza Mahomet delivered to Mr. Hanway the greateſt part of his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and alſo paid him as much money as, he ſaid, was in his hands, or in his power; in hopes that our author would intercede in his favour. Next morning he waited on the khans, and told them that Myrza had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored his baggage, and that he hoped he would be pardoned "For your ſake," ſaid the khan, "he ſhall be ſaved. His ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has ſhewn you honour, and it is my buſineſs to do the ſame." Mr. Hanway made his acknowledgments, and Myrza was liberated.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway had now received to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of about five thouſand crowns; and was requeſted to take a part of the remainder in female ſlaves. This he poſitively refuſed to do, perhaps to the aſtoniſhment of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who, learning, he was only thirty-two years old, ſeemed to be looking for a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his continence in his hoary locks, till he was told that he wore a wig.</p>
            <p>Delays ſtill intervening about the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the remainder of the money, the governor preſſed Mr. Hanway to take his obligation for it, payable in ten or fifteen days, as the general was obliged to march, and avowed that he could not depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a receipt; and that he muſt kill men till he completed the ſum. Mr Hanway ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his hope that no one would ſuffer on his account; but that he could not anſwer
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035585_0056_10056C83557D2110"/>
to his principals to give a receipt in exchange for any obligation whatever.</p>
            <p>Some days after, our author privately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed on board the ſhip, money and goods to the value of eleven thouſand crowns, and on the 29th he viſited the ſhip again with five thouſand crowns more; leaving Matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, his old Armenian clerk, and two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſolicit for the remainder, that was due, in conformity to the ſhah's decree.</p>
            <p>Before Mr. Hanway takes his leave of Perſia, he give ſome account of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Guebres, which is ſtill preſerved by ſome of the poſterity of the ancient Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Perſians. This religion ſprang from Zeroaſter, who lived about the year of the world 2860. This great philoſopher, ſtruck with the demonſtrations he obſerved of the perfection of that ſelf-exiſtent Being, who is the author of all good, taught his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to worſhip God under the ſymbol of light or fire, conſidering the brightneſs, activity, purity, and incorruptibility of that element, as bearing the moſt perfect reſemblance to the nature of the beneficent Being Thus the Perſians honoured the ſun as the brighteſt image of God, and offered up their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the open air, thinking it injurious to the majeſty of the God of Heaven, who fills immentity with his preſence, to confine his ſervice within walls.</p>
            <p>About ſix hundred years after the firſt Zeroaſter, another philoſopher, of the ſame
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035585_0057_10056C84D6B917C8"/>
name, aroſe, who refined on the doctrines of his predeceſſor, and cauſed temples to be built, in which the ſacred fire was ordered to be continually preſerved. The Guebres, or Gaurs, ſtill adhere to the tenets of thoſe two philoſophers, with a few modifications, and their veneration for fire is unabated.</p>
            <p>What is commonly called the everlaſting fire, is a phenomenon of a very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature. This object of devotion is to be ſeen about ten miles from Bakir, a city of the Caſpian Sea, where are ſeveral ancient temples of ſtone, ſuppoſed to have been all dedicated to this active and pure element. Among the reſt is one, in which the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now perform their devotions. Near the altar is a hollow cane, from the end of which iſſues a blue flame, like that of a lamp burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſpirits. This flame, the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers pretend, has continued ever ſince the general deluge, and they believe it will laſt till the conſummation of all things.</p>
            <p>Round this temple are generally forty or fifty poor devotees, who come on a pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from their own country, and are charged with the expiation of the fine of their friends and neighbours, which, it ſeems, can be done by proxy. They mark their forehe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds with ſaffron, and the moſt diſtinguiſhed for piety among them, obſerve certain painful and invariable poſtures of their limbs.</p>
            <p>At a ſmall diſtance from the temples is a low cleft of a rock, with a horizontal open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, near ſix feet long and three broad, from
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035585_0058_10056C86F0C6E488"/>
which iſſues a blue flame, like that from the reed or cane in the temple. In ſerene weather it burns low, but during a high wind, it ſometimes mounts to eight feet; yet without apparent effect on the rocks or ſurrounding objects Here the devotees alſo pay their adorations</p>
            <p>What is ſtill more ſingular, for two miles round this place, on removing the ſurface of the ground to the depth of two or three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the uncovered part immediately takes fire on applying a coal or torch to it; but though it warms the earth, it does not change its ſubſtance. If a cane, or even a paper tube, be fixed, about two inches deep in the earth, and a live coal be held over the top and blown on, a flame inſtantly iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, without burning either the cane or the paper, provided their edges be luted. Three or four of thoſe burning canes will boil a pot, and in this manner the people dreſs their victuals.</p>
            <p>Though this flame burns ſo ſpontaneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may be as eaſily extinguiſhed as that of ſpirits of wine Round this remarkable ſpot, brimſtone is dug, and ſprings of naptha are found. The ſprings boil up higheſt when the weather is thick and hazy; and the naptha often kindling on its ſurface, ſpreads with incredible rapidity to a conſiderable diſtance. In ſhort, the everlaſting fire is really natural to the ſoil, and may be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to brimſtone and naptha. The latter, indeed, is the only fuel the inhabitants uſe
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035585_0059_10056C890E45A408"/>
for domeſtic uſe, and is generally kept in earthen veſſels under ground, and at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from their houſes, becauſe it is apt to kindle of itſelf.</p>
            <p>In the peninſula of Apcheron is a kind of white naptha, of a thinner conſiſtence, which the Ruſſians uſe medicinally, and it is ſaid to be carried into India, where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared, it forms the moſt beautiful and durable varniſh known.</p>
            <p>But to reſume the narrative of tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Mr. Hanway, having lived ſome time in a very friendly manner with Mr. Elton at Langarood, finding his health declining, removed to Lahijan for change of air, and from thence to Reſhd. About this time Mr Elton, who had hitherto ſhewn him the extremeſt kindneſs, being much offended with our author's employers for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Ruſſian court, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that he might be blamed for his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the ſhah, which were abſolutely inconſiſtent with the views of the Ruſſian company, ſuddenly contracted an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enmity againſt our traveller. But the details of quarrels can never be pleaſing to the benevolent, and therefore we paſs over them</p>
            <p>Mr Hanway having, with extreme dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and after long delay, obtained a recompence for his loſſes, he diſpoſed of the cloth he had recovered, in Reſhd; and laid out the produce, as well as the money that he poſſeſſed, in raw ſilk.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:035585_0060_10056C8B2663FCD8"/>Thus having finiſhed his mercantile tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, he left the city of Reſhd on the 13th of September, and arriving at Perry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazar, he embarked in a flat-bottomed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian boat, and on the 29th reached Yerkie, where the commander of a guard-ſhip, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned there informed him, that if he had any goods on board, which were not the produce of Ghilan, and did not declare them, the law made it capital to the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d decreed that the ſhip and cargo ſhould be burnt.</p>
            <p>The Ruſſian conſul, it ſeems, had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the governor of Aſtracan, that the plague was raging at Caſhan; and, in conſequence of this, Mr. Hanway was ſtrictly interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, if he had any goods on board from that place. They were then ordered to land on a ſmall deſolate iſland to the eaſt of the channel of the Volga, where a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon examined them with the uſual precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, after being ſatisfied they were not under infection, their letters were dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in vinegar, and delivered to him.</p>
            <p>Renewed enquiries were made, as to the places from whence they had taken their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and where they had perſonally been ſince they left Ruſſia.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate matters remained, till the 11th of October, during which ſpace they ſuffered both from the weather and the want of freſh proviſions. At laſt, a ſignal was made by the guard-ſhip for Mr. Hanway and the captain to come on board, when
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035585_0061_10056C8D46B9BDA0"/>
they had the mortification to be enjoined the performance of quarantine on an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited iſland, ſtill more to the eaſtward. But what affected them moſt, was to learn that all their letters, diſpatches, and paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, with the lives of twelve ſoldiers, were loſt by the attacks of the Calmucks, on the party which carried them.</p>
            <p>At length, the governor of Aſtracan ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his permiſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this place he was lodged in a houſe detached from the crew and the other paſſengers, and, before he was ſuffered to proceed further, he was required to ſtrip himſelf entirely naked in the open air, and to paſs through the unpleaſant ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of having a pail of warm water thrown over him.</p>
            <p>Having undergone this diſcipline, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in a large barge rowed by twelve grenadiers, and ſailed for Aſtracan. The day after his arrival, he waited on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, whoſe behaviour appeared much changed ſince he viſited him before. On the ſubject of trade in general he was very reſerved, though very inquiſitive about Mr. Elton's proceedings; and not even the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a handſome preſent could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure more than diſtant civility and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:035585_0062_10056C9028C7E160"/>Every danger of infection appearing viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary to the moſt ſcrupulous, our author obtained leave to depart for Peterſburgh on the 22d of November; but the Volga be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered with floating ice, he reſolved to travel by land, and finding a Ruſſian convoy under a guard of Coſſacks, purſuing the ſame route, he was happy to join them, with his two ſervants; and in this form they croſſed the Volga</p>
            <p>On the 28th they met a large caravan on its way to Aſtracan; from which they learned, that four perſons in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns were miſſing, and, as a bloody ſhirt had been found on the way, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that they had been murdered. This intelligence taught them to keep a ſtricter watch than uſual, and induced thoſe to keep cloſe together, who, from the impatience to get forward, were before inclined to ſeparate from the convoy A few days after, they found a Ruſſian waggon and the harneſs of ſeveral horſes, which belonged to the perſons who had actually been murdered</p>
            <p>At Zaritzen, where they arrived on the 3d of December, Mr. Hanway dined with one of his fellow-travellers, who acted as ſub-governor of the town. This gentleman preſented his wife to the company, who ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted her, as is cuſtomary; after which, ſhe preſented them with ſmall cups of brandy on a ſalver, and which ſhe again repeated after dinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but ill-dreſſed; and the quantity of liquors drank was almoſt beyond belief</p>
            <p>It appeared, this feaſt was made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reconcile a friend of the hoſt and a principal merchant of Aſtracan, who had quarrelled. Their healths being drank, they were deſired to kiſs each other; and then the reſt of the company ſaluted them in a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar manner. To complete the farce, they immediately began to reproach each other for paſt injuries; ſo little reliance is there to be placed on friendſhips contracted at the ſocial board.</p>
            <p>As the ſnow at this ſeaſon rendered the roads impaſſable for wheelled carriages, Mr. Hanway cauſed his waggon to be placed on a ſledge, and ſet out on the 6th, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied only by two ſervants Next day the cold was ſo intenſe, that wine froze under his feather bed At night he reached Caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliena, ſituated on the Don, where he found poverty, but liberty and content The winds now blew ſo exceſſively keen that the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could not always venture to face them; for which reaſon they were frequently oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to halt, and generally to direct their way by a compaſs.</p>
            <p>On the 13th, they ſtopped at Bruſano, where the inhabitants informed them, that the preceding night a band of robbers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>During this inclement ſeaſon, the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants live in the moſt miſerable manner. Few of their huts have any chimney, and as the ſmoke of the ſtoves is carried out through the windows, they are ſo filled with ſmoke, that it is impoſſible to breathe at more than two or three feet from the floor, till the wood is burnt to aſhes; and therefore, ſuch as wiſh to eſcape ſuffocation, muſt crawl in on their hands and knees.</p>
            <p>At Moſcow, where our author arrived on the 22d, he received letters informing him of his acceſſion to a conſiderable fortune by the death of a relation. He ſtaid at that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis four days and provided himſelf with a light ſledge, in which he determined to travel poſt. Theſe vehicles are ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the climate, and ſo eaſy that Mr. Hanway ſlept, at one time, without waking, while he had been carried one hundred verſts, or ſixty-ſix Engliſh miles.</p>
            <p>The whole road between Moſcow and Peterſburgh is marked out in the ſnow by plantations of fir-trees on both ſides; and at intervals are large piles of wood, which may be lighted when any perſon belonging to the court paſſes that way in the night. The diſtance between the two capitals is no leſs than four hundred and eighty eight Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh miles; yet Peter the Great once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the journey in forty-ſix hours.</p>

               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:035585_0065_10056C9547BC8F70"/>Mr. Hanway arrived at Peterſburgh on the 1ſt of January, after having been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent about a year and four months, in which ſpace he had travelled above four thouſand miles by land.</p>
            <p>Peterſburgh, it is univerſally known, was founded by Peter I. in the beginning of the preſent century, and may now be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the modern metropolis. Though the ſoil was formerly a barren moraſs, the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of the founder has converted it into ſolid land, and raiſed an elegant and ſuperb city on a ſpot the moſt unpromiſing. This place ranges on both ſides of the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>va. At the upper end of the north ſide ſtands the citadel, which is more remarkable for the number of lives ſacrificed in building it, than for its ſtrength.</p>
            <p>As Peter took Amſterdam for his model, this city is interſected by canals; but, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular as it may appear in ſuch a climate, the houſes are chiefly built in the Italian ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The climate in the Ruſſian dominions is very various. In the month of February, at Peterſburgh, the ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

frame is braced by the cold. Riding on ſledges then conſtitutes the principal amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the young and active.</p>
            <p>March commonly brings ſhowers, which, with the increaſing heat of the ſun, begin to melt the ſurface of the ice, which in the Neva is ſometimes three quarters of a yard thick. About the end of that month, it frequently breaks up, and navigation begins to be reſtored.</p>
            <p>April is often warm, and ſerves as the prelude to the ſpring: but it is ſometimes the beginning of June before vegetation has made any conſiderable progreſs. The heat at that ſeaſon becoming very intenſe, its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on nature may be viſibly traced from day to day.</p>
            <p>From this time, till the middle of July, the ſun is almoſt conſtantly above the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, except for about two hours every night. The heat, at this period, is even diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intenſe; and would be ſtill more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant did not winds and ſhowers occaſionally refreſh the air Mr. Hanway, who reſided here five years, once experienced a delightful ſeaſon till the end of September; but this rarely happens: Auguſt cloſes the ſcene of rural beauty and vegetation; ſo that three months alone in the year, nature appears ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.</p>
            <p>In October and November the Neva is always frozen, and when once the ice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſolid and the ſnow hard, the period of ſpeedy and ſecure conveyance by ſledges
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035585_0067_10056C9AA83296A0"/>
commences. At that ſeaſon, it is nothing unuſual to bring freſh proviſions to market at the diſtance of one thouſand Engliſh miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In December and January the cold is ſo very ſevere, that many perſons, who are expoſed to it, either periſh, or loſe their limbs.</p>
            <p>The Ruſſians are generally of a middle ſtature, though many of them are tall and comely. The women, however, are leſs lovely in Ruſſia than in many other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and even what charms they naturally poſſeſs are obſcured by paint. It is an avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſentiment with them; that if they have ſufficient plumpneſs, they can procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beauty.</p>
            <p>The common people are dreſſed in long coats made of ſheep ſkins, with the wool inwards, and they wear fur caps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, perſons of rank, dreſs nearly in the ſame manner as the Engliſh, except wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great coat lined with fur, with a fur cap, whenever they go abroad.</p>
            <p>Except the difference of petticoats, the lower claſs of women wear ſheep ſkin coats, like the men; but thoſe who move in a higher ſphere have ſilk cloaks lined with furs, which are rich or ordinary, according to rank and fortune.</p>
            <p>Having cloſed his commercial engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Peterſburgh, on the 9th of July 1750, Mr. Hanway left this place, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding along the banks of the Neva, came to the palace of Strelna Muſa, about twenty

The gardens are laid out in a fine taſte, and the whole edifice was intended to have been on a magnificent ſcale, had Peter lived to realize his ideas. However, Peterkoff, which that great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch left a mean building, by the partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ſucceſſors, has riſen into grandeur; while Strelna Muſa has been neglected In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Peterkoff has many local advantages. It has fine water works, ſaid to reſemble thoſe of Verſailles, and the landſcapes it commands are highly pictureſque.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway paſſing the Gulph of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, arrived at Cronſtadt, where unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weather confined him here ſeveral days. This delay gave him an opportunity of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the dry dock, contrived by Peter the Great, which is one of the moſt ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous works of the kind in the world It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends above ſeven hundred ſathoms, is ſixty feet wide at the bottom, eighty at the top, and forty deep, furniſhed with different flood gates. Fourteen line of battle ſhips may be accommodated here at once. Adjoining is a capital reſervoir.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of Cronſtadt is about eighteen miles in circumference, but very barren. The great reſort of mariners, however, to the town, renders it a populous and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place.</p>
            <p>On the 15th our author embarked in a ſmall yatch, and in three days landed at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.

This place is the capital of Eſtonia, and lies fifty leagues from Peterſburgh It ſubmitted to Peter I. by capitulation, and is only taxed with the accommodation of five thouſand ſoldiers, and three thouſand ſailors. The population within the walls is calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at eight thouſand ſouls; and the ſuburbs are large and well inhabited. The people ſeem to be formal and preciſe in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but are extremely induſtrious, and live in the moſt perfect ſecurity. The houſes are all adapted for the reception of merchandiſe, and there are large magazines of corn, with which the country abounds.</p>
            <p>Great part of Revel ſtands upon an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and has regular fortifications. The ſtreets are neither wide nor uniform, but ſome of the edifices are ſtately, particularly the public buildings, though they contain little remarkable.</p>
            <p>On the 19th, Mr. Hanway re embarked, and paſſing the Iſle of Gothland, belonging to Sweden, on the morning of the 24th they entered the Viſtula, and ſailed up to Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zic. This city is about three Engliſh miles in circumference, and is well fortifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with lofty works and a double wet foſſe. The fortifications require about one thouſand five hundred men to man them; but this city cannot maintain ſo many, unleſs on emergencies.</p>
            <p>The houſes of Dantzic are generally five ſtories high, which, with other peculiarities in their ſtructure, takes off from the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

width of the ſtreets. The inhabitants are very agreeable in their manners, and the women have all the perſonal attractions of the Engliſh ladies. Here women of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affect the Poliſh manners, and the moſt reſpectful way of ſaluting a lady, is to kiſs her hand, or rather the hem of her petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, as is commonly practiſed by the Poles.</p>
            <p>A republican ſpirit pervades this great commercial city, which is under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Poland.<note n="*" place="bottom">So many revolutions have taken place in this part of Europe within leſs than half a century, that the politician is confounded, and the philoſopher and the Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Among the curioſities which chiefly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted our author's attention, was the great Lutheran church, a very ancient ſtructure, which ſtill retains the crucifixes and other emblems of popery. This, it ſeems, is not merely a matter of indifference, but was ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated by treaty. Among the paintings is one on wood by Van Dyke, repreſenting the reſurrection. It is much admired for its expreſſion, though it is ſaid to be one of the firſt performances in oil colours.</p>
            <p>Corn is the principal article of traffic here, which in plentiful ſeaſons, is brought down the Viſtula in amazing quantities. The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels employed in this trade are about fifty

tons burden; and ſometimes no fewer than one thouſand ſix hundred of them paſs down the Viſtula within a year.</p>
            <p>Our traveller having ſpent a week very agreeably at Dantzic, and provided himſelf with a chariot, took leave of his friends. He ſoon entered the Pruſſian dominions, and at Stolpe, a ſmall pleaſant city, he was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined whence he came, and whither he was going This is uſual in Pruſſia, and gives a good idea of vigilance and military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p>He now travelled over an open pleaſant country of arable lands, pretty populous, but not rich. At Stargard, the metropolis of Pruſſian Pomerania, is a cathedral church of great antiquity; and three reformed church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in one of which ſervice is performed in the French language.</p>
            <p>Our author next arrived at Koeninſburg, a ſmall town on the Oder, which river he croſſed by a timber bridge. On the north bank is a fine palace and garden, belonging to the Margrave of Schwedt, with a very neat town, bearing the ſame name, adjacent. Near this place he ſaw the bodies of two malefactors, who had been broken on the wheel. A gallows, he obſerves, is planted near every town on an eminence, though the vigilance of the government prevents the perpetration of many crimes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executions are rare.</p>
            <p>The palace of the margrave is the only object that has any grandeur of appearance
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035585_0072_10056CA49D04F098"/>
for many miles. Men of family and fortune generally flock to court; and the country is thus deprived of their active ſervices on the ſpots from whence they draw the income that ſupports their ſtate.</p>
            <p>As he approached to Berlin, the face of the country began to wear a more cultivated aſpect; but the want of incloſures is a defect in rural embelliſhment; nor is that vivid verdure to be ſeen here which captivates the eye in England.</p>
            <p>From Dantzic to Berlin, the diſtance is fifty-ſeven German, or about two hundred and fifty Engliſh miles.</p>
            <p>The entrance into the metropolis of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia is airy and elegant; the ſtreets are regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and clean, and the houſes uniform. Near the Pont Neuf, over the Spree, is an equeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian ſtatue of Frederick William the Great, which is eſteemed a piece of excellent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. The palace of the Pont Neuf is alſo a magnificent pile.</p>
            <p>The firſt object that ſtrikes a traveller is the royal palace, called the caſtle. The walls of the grand front are ſeven or eight feet thick, which, though they add to the ſtrength of the building, give a dark and gloomy air to its apartments.</p>
            <p>The economy uſed in this court deſerves notice. The common articles of furniture are of maſſy ſilver, in which the faſhion does not exceed ſeven per cent. ſo that four millions of dollars might be eaſily realized,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035585_0073_10056CA620D810D8"/>
ſhould the exigencies of the ſtate require it. In this palace are the pictures of Charles V. and his empreſs, the frames of which are of ſolid ſilver, and weigh ſix hundred and ſixty pounds, or ſix centners. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a grand crown luſtre of ſeven centners, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y ſeparate articles of four or five centners weight. A muſic gallery is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ornamented with ſilver; and one end of a gallery, for about twenty feet high, and as many in width, is wholly furniſhed with gilt plate, which is entirely for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade.</p>
            <p>The king's private apartments are ſimply elegant; the prevailing taſte is ſtucco gilt. Several of the rooms have tables with pens, ink, and looſe papers, which indicate the diſpatch of buſineſs, ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her than the pomp of royalty. The hall is decorated with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral large and excellent paintings, and the grand ſaloon is hung with tapeſtry, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting our Saviour driving out the money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, the laſt ſupper, the miraculous draught of fiſhes, and waſhing his diſciples' feet.</p>
            <p>The throne in the audience chamber is of velvet, embroidered with gold, in a grand, but chaſte, taſte. In the old quarter of the palace, the moſt remarkable piece of furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a bed of crimſon velvet, adorned with above two hundred cyphers, with electoral crowns, all ſet with pearls: the chairs in this apartment are all in the ſame ſtile. In this
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035585_0074_10056CA99E55CAF8"/>
bed it is uſual for perſons of the blood roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to conſummate.</p>
            <p>The arſenal forms one ſide of the palace, and is ſaid to be well ſtocked with arms; but as viſiting it is attended with ſome diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ceremonies, our author declined an inſpection. The external, however, of this edifice is very fine: it has indeed a profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ornaments.</p>
            <p>From the palace he proceeded to viſit the library, which he obſerves, would be but a mean apartment for a common ſchool. But its regulations are excellent, and liberty is allowed to every perſon who has the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a gentleman, to ſtudy here from ten in the morning till two in the afternoon. In this collection are five hundred Bibles of different languages and editions; and one is kept as a kind of relict, ſaid to have been that which Charles I. of England uſed on the ſcaffold, and which was preſented to the Elector of Brandenburgh by Dr. Juxon <note n="*" place="bottom">Like other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The opera houſe is an elegant modern edifice, adorned with ſplendid ſcenes in an exquiſite taſte. It has three galleries, and is
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035585_0075_10056CABC0BC85B8"/>
capable of containing two thouſand perſons. The columns which ſupport the roof are ranged in ſuch a manner as to throw the whole into a grand ſaloon. The orcheſtra conſiſts of about fifty performers.</p>
            <p>This amuſement is entirely ſupported at the king's expence, and in ſome meaſure is made ſubſervient to political purpoſes. His majeſty is extremely attached to muſic, and has acquired great knowledge of that ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>The fortifications of the city of Berlin are regular, though not formidable. The French language is almoſt as prevalent here as the German. Many or the public ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are magnificent, and the ſtreets being regular, give the whole an air of grandeur.</p>
            <p>Several thouſands of French manufacturers having found protection in this country, the arts and manufactures are carried to a great degree of beauty and perfection. Gold and ſilver lace, and wrought ſilks, are ſcarcely to be purchaſed on ſuch advantageous terms in any other place.</p>
            <p>Before Mr. Hanway left Berlin his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity carried him to Charlottenburg, about a German league diſtant. This palace was fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d by his majeſty's grandfather, but has been finiſhed in a fine ſtyle by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſovereign. It has a range of ten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments well diſpoſed, ornamented with ſtucco and gilding. The ball room, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is worthy of the king who deſigned it. It has ten windows on each ſide, and is
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035585_0076_10056CAD42EF86A0"/>
decorated with buſts, ſtatues, and large mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway's character of Frederic II. king of Pruſſia, from the impartiality of the author, deſerves to be recorded. He ſays, that he had an early taſte for literature and the polite arts, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the delicacy of his manners, in oppoſition to the inelegant cuſtoms that prevailed in his father's court. The late king was much addicted to drinking, a reigning vice in Germany: the prince abominated this beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice, and in conſequence of this and other cauſes of diſſatisfaction, he determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to retire from court in a private manner, and take up his reſidence in England; but his intentions being diſcovered, an unhappy gentleman, who was in his confidence, loſt his head, and the plan was fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>When princes are really God's vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, religion muſt be the baſis of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This prince, however, is by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reputed a free thinker of the worſt claſs; but the rule of his government, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the vanities and mean gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of life, do not favour ſo harſh a judgment.</p>
            <p>In one circumſtance his majeſty excels any European potentate; I mean in economy. The allowance of his table is but thirty crowns a day, fiſh and wine excepted, in which he is by no means extravagant. Potſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam is his favorite reſidence, and here he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids the empty parade of a court. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035585_0077_10056CAF62180700"/>
at his table twelve perſons: his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite miniſters and foreign ambaſſadors, who happen to be in attendance there, are firſt invited, and his military officers, even to an enſign fill up the vacant places. But this is not the only method he takes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himſelf with his ſoldiery. The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt officer knows that his injuries will be redreſſed by the king; for wherever he may be ſtationed, he needs only to write to his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and by the return of the poſt he may expect an anſwer, frequently written by the prince's own hand. He ſometimes even condeſcends to adviſe, where he thinks the party errs in judgment, or is influenced by unreaſonable deſires.</p>
            <p>His converſation is free and eaſy, even to pleaſantry; but he knows how to ſupport his dignity, not only through fear but affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He is choice in his food, but eats mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; and mixes water with his wine. He takes Spaniſh ſnuff to exceſs, and his clothes frequently bear the marks of this harmleſs though inelegant practice.</p>
            <p>His face is florid, and his looks inclined to the penſive, or rather are expreſſive of the inceſſant labour of the mind. He begins to ſtoop, and is plump rather than corpulent. He often appears in boots, and always in regimentals; and he is maſter only of one change for the winter, and another for the ſummer. Our author ſaw his wardrobe, which is either mean or noble, according to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035585_0078_10056CB1920FF660"/>
the impreſſion it makes on the ſpectator. Little minds, which are caught by ſhow, will receive ſmall gratification from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play.</p>
            <p>So little does he obſerve uſeleſs forms, that he has riſen from his chair at his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting table, and ordered his ſecretary to take his place, and write down what he dictated ſtanding. He often aſks his moſt familiar favourites, if they think the condition of a king deſirable above all others: and then tells them how eaſily they may rectify their opinion, by obſerving what labour and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention the duties of a king impoſe on him.</p>
            <p>Beſides his great ſkill in muſic, in which he is a compoſer as well as a performer, he has a taſte for poetry; and after undergoing the fatigues of a general in the day, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes ſuch tranquillity as to anſwer letters of pleaſure and politeneſs in the evening, or even to compoſe verſes</p>
            <p>The grand ſecret of life, with regard to the execution of buſineſs of every kind, is a proper diſtribution of the ſeveral hours of the day; which nobody underſtands better than his Pruſſian majeſty. He generally goes to bed early, and, after ſeven or eight hours reſt, gets up, and purſues his ſtated routine of buſineſs or amuſement. When not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in war, he generally ſpends a ſhort time every morning in playing on the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man flute, before he enters his cabinet, where he ſtays till eleven: he then receives foreign miniſters, and tranſacts other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035585_0079_10056CB45C9C62F8"/>
avocations till noon; when he uſually goes abroad and gratifies himſelf in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duties of a general, and keeping up the ſpirit of diſcipline. Soon after one, dinner is ſerved up: about three, a ſecretary comes to read to him; and in the evening he has a concert. This is the uſual mode in which he fills up the day; and the regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſovereign is carried into every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>His reputation is eſtabliſhed on the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt foundation, was it only for that bold and generous ſtroke in politics, by which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his country from the jaws of hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lawyers, who, before his time, ſported with the ſufferings of the wretched, and ſaw unmoved, the tears of the widow. In the Pruſſian dominions the deciſion of cauſes cannot be protracted to a ruinous length, nor carried to an enormous expence.<note n="*" place="bottom">We will venture to affirm, that a prompt and cheap execution of diſtributive juſtice, is one of the greateſt bleſſings of any country, and without it, no country can be happy.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Potſdam is agreeably ſituated on a branch of the Spree, and is an elegant and regular town. The palace is ſmall but handſome; and ſome of the apartments are richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with works of mechanic art, and the fineſt productions of taſte and genius</p>
            <p>Here the royal guards are quartered, who amount to two thouſand men, all of large ſtature, perſonable, and well clothed. They
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035585_0080_10056CB5DEDCF0A0"/>
are diſtinguiſhed by wearing ſilver laced hats and black cockades. His preſent majeſty has wiſely declined the oppreſſive meaſures practiſed by his father, to keep up a race of giants, and yet they are ſtill remarkably tall. The officers dine every day in a large apartment at the king's expence.</p>
            <p>The Pruſſian ſoldiers, in general, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſhort coats, ſtrengthened at the elbows with leather, in the form of a heart; which prevents the neceſſity of patching an old garment. A ſoldier here is never ſeen in rags; but as far as reſpects perſonal neatneſs, all appear to be gentlemen. The guards, and ſome other regiments, have new clothes every year; but in general, two ſuits ſerve for three years. The pay of a common ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is eight groſch, or fourteen pence a week, out of which they are ſuppoſed to ſpend three pence in waſhing, and in materials for cleaning their arms; but it ſhould be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they are furniſhed with bread gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</p>
            <p>Our traveller next viſited Sans Souci, in the vicinity of Potſdam. It ſtands on an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, and enjoys a fine view of the town, and a ſmall branch of the Spree which waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the gardens. The apartments are chiefly on the ground floor, and are ſplendidly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed From the palace to the lower end of the garden is a deſcent of one hundred and twenty yards, by ſix ſeveral ranges of ſtone ſteps, and as many terraces, the ſides
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035585_0081_10056CB80C410238"/>
of which are planted with vines under glaſs frames, by which means the grapes are brought to great perfection. The lower part of the garden is adorned with ſeveral fine ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, particularly Venus drawing a net, and a Diana with game, on pedeſtals, richly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented with alto relievo. At the eaſtern extremity is an Egyptian pyramid embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hieroglyphics.</p>
            <p>Mr Hanway now took his leave of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and proceeded through woods and ſandy plains to Britzen, which is the Pruſſian fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier. He then entered the Electorate of Saxony, where the brightneſs of the verdure, the richneſs of the ſoil, and the various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of nature, both animate and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, gave the idea of plenty, ſuperior to what he had ſeen in Pruſſia; yet, many of the inhabitants of the latter have been tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by political advantages, to change their country for the more ſteril ſoil of Pruſſia. Hence the towns erected by his Pruſſian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on his frontiers, are almoſt wholly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by Saxons.</p>
            <p>At length our author arrived at Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, a fortified town on the Elbe, famous for a manufactory of coarſe cloth, the wool of this country being good and plentiful. Clothes are ſent hither from all parts to be dyed, and the blues and greens, commonly called Saxon, here are ſuppoſed to receive their fineſt tints.</p>
            <p>In this place is an academy, with nearly ſeven hundred ſtudents, and here is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koloff
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035585_0082_10056CBAC9DA81B8"/>
church, where Martin Luther firſt preached the doctrine which gave riſe to the reformation. In this church too, that great reformer is inferred; but has no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument than a braſs plate with an inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except his original portrait painted on wood, and well preſerved.</p>
            <p>The people here have a ſtrong tincture of the Romiſh ſuperſtition, and the credulous maintain, that the devil viſited Luther in the library, now belonging to the academy; but that the reformer received him by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his inkſtand at his head.</p>
            <p>In paſſing through this electorate, Mr. Hanway obſerved, that the fertility of the ſoil did not operate much to increaſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulence of the inhabitants. On the 25th, he ſaw Molſberg, a hunting palace of the Elector of Saxony, ſituated on an eminence near the village of Iſengberg Its approach is by a long avenue, planted with wild cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut trees, and is encompaſſed by woods, in which the prince takes ſuch delight in hunting the wild boar, that he fixes his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence here ſometimes for months ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</p>
            <p>Hunting, indeed is the favourite diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Saxon court, but by indulging this too far, the ſubjects are more diſtreſſed than the brutes. Above thirty thouſand head of deer are ſaid to range in the open fields and foreſts; but though they commit terrible depredations on the crops of the farmer, he dares not kill one, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty

of being ſent to the gallies. In every town of note, five men keep watch every night by rotation to frighten the deer away, will bells, from deſtroying their corn.</p>
            <p>The peaſants of this country carry their proviſions to market from a great diſtance in wheelbarrows, whoſe ſtructure is well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this purpoſe. The wheel is bound with iron, and is both larger and lighter than thoſe uſed in England</p>
            <p>Dreſden, the capital, is ſeated in the midſt of a plain, ſurrounded by lofty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant hills, the neareſt of which are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into vineyards. The Elbe divides it into two parts, over which is a ſtone bridge, five hundred and forty feet long, and thirty-ſix broad, conſiſting of eighteen arches Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſtructure ſtands a brazen crucifix of curious workmanſhip.</p>
            <p>The city contains many handſome build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſix or ſeven ſtories high, and ſeveral elegant ſquares Near the entrance of what is called the New city is an equeſtrian ſtatue of Auguſtus II. erected on a lofty pedeſtal, ſaid to have been executed by a common ſmith, and as ſuch deſerves admiration, though it has many capital defects</p>
            <p>The trade of Dreſden is very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, conſiſting chiefly in ſilver ingots, brought every fifteen days from the mines of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035585_0084_10056CBE7165E3A8"/>
into the neighbouring territories, and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down into pieces of other denominations.</p>
            <p>Among the calamities under which this electorate labours, that of religious jealouſy is none of the leaſt. The Lutheran clergy oppreſs the Calviniſts; while both think themſelves extremely injured, by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance given at court to the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics. The Proteſtants deem it a groſs abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to be ruled by a Catholic prince; for, according to the eſtabliſhed Saxon conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only one Catholic church can be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Dreſden. A chapel, however, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at, as a private place of worſhip.</p>
            <p>Our author viſited the Grune Gewolbe, a part of the royal palace, conſiſting of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral apartments; replete with curioſities, which have been collected at an immenſe expence.</p>
            <p>The firſt chamber contains one hundred ſmall, but exquiſite, ſtatues, principally in braſs. Among others, are an equeſtrian ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Auguſtus II. King of Poland, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric William the Great of Pruſſia, after the famous ſtatue of Berlin, Lewis XIV. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius, Centaurs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſecond chamber contains a variety of ivory figures, among which are Abraham offering up his ſon Iſaac, with the angel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, all of exquiſite workmanſhip; a fine crucifix; and a ſhip completely rigged, with ropes of gold wire.</p>
            <p>The third is filled with ſilver ornaments, in particular, a large fountain, and four vaſes of vaſt ſize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:035585_0085_10056CC08F762140"/>The fourth contains veſſels of pure gold, and ſilver gilt. The pannels of this apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are of looking glaſs</p>
            <p>The fifth is a ſpacious room, in which are many precious ſtones, wrought with great art; a cup of lapis nephriticus; a ſtatue of Charles II. of England; a hall of cryſtal, ſix inches in diameter, without a blemiſh; a large goblet ſet round with the moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and coſtly antiques; ſeveral tables in moſaic; and the angel Michael vanquiſhing the devil, admirably executed in wood, and which coſt in England, where it was made, two thouſand five hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>The ſixth chamber contains a collection of precious ſtones, with an infinite variety of pearls, ſet in a multiplicity of forms.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh and eighth apartments are ſtored with jewels of immenſe value, incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in glaſs caſes. Among other rich curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, is a repreſentation of the throne of the Great Mogul, in ſilver figures enamelled, and adorned with precious ſtones, with a view of princes offering their preſents, and falling proſtrate, with elephants, ſoldiers, ſervants, and attendants.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway having gratified his curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here, paid a viſit to the cabinet of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities, called the Kunſtkammer</p>
            <p>The firſt chamber contains a ſeries of prints, from the commencement of engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent time.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is filled with minerals, ores, and earths, from every country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:035585_0086_10056CC3404CD7E0"/>The third contains petrifactions, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of animals and wood.</p>
            <p>In the fourth chamber are different kinds of wood, and other vegetable productions; in particular, a cabinet, with three hundred and fifty ſquares, about the ſize of the palm of a hand, all run in flat, as drawers, of as many different kinds of wood. In this apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, likewiſe, are the portraits of a man and his wife, who lived near Tamiſwar: the man was one hundred and eighty-five years old, and the woman one hundred and ſeventy-two.</p>
            <p>In the fifth chamber is a ſmall cabinet of ſkeletons, and other anatomical prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The ſixth contains the ſkins of many different animals ſtuffed. The ſeventh the ſkins of fiſhes ſtuffed. The eighth is devoted to ſhells. In the ninth is a cabinet of about ſix feet high and four broad, every drawer of which has ſome natural curioſity in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. In the tenth is a grotto with ſprings of water The eleventh contains corals The twelfth is filled with the ſkeletons of lions, bears, and other extraordinary animals, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of a horſe, whoſe mane is ſaid to be three ell and a half long, and his tail twelve and a half.</p>
            <p>Our author was then ſhewn, in an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at ſome diſtance, a model of Solomon's temple, with all its furniture, which coſt twelve thouſand crowns.</p>
            <p>The gallery of pictures next fell under his obſervation, which is one of the fineſt
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035585_0087_10056CC571657A30"/>
in the world. It contains one hundred pieces of ſuperlative value, all ſaid to be originals, and to have coſt half a million of crowns. The whole collection conſiſts of above two thouſand pieces, the capital works of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael, Rubens, and Corregio. Their aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate value is about half a million ſterling.</p>
            <p>The Chineſe palace, as it is called, is a capital object of attraction. It ſtands on the Elbe, and is built in the Chineſe taſte throughout. In its different apartments are many natural and artificial curioſities, too numerous to be particularized. Among other articles are forty-eight China vaſes of great ſize, with which the father of the preſent elector was ſo charmed, that he purchaſed them of the late king of Pruſſia, at the price of a whole regiment of dragoons.</p>
            <p>The royal gardens, though fine, want that charm which ariſes from an inequality of ground. They contain a ſmall palace, in the front of which is a field for tournaments, and behind a ſheet of water. They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with a profuſion of marble ſtatues, many of them coloſſal; and pourtray the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the late King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, who, being entirely devoted to his amours, left them as monuments of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs</p>
            <p>Some of the palaces of the grandees are very beautiful, particularly that of Count Bruhl, which is fitted up with princely mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence. His library is two hundred and twenty feet long, and well furniſhed with
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035585_0088_10056CC6F3348158"/>
books. Nor is his gallery of pictures much inferior to ſome royal collections.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that Saxony contains thirty thouſand towns and villages, of which ſixty are to be ſeen from ſome eminences near Dreſden. The population of the electorate is computed at four millions; but this ſeems to be exaggerated. The people are burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many heavy taxes, and the expenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the court, in delicacies only, is ſaid to be twice as much as the King of Pruſſia allows for his whole table.</p>
            <p>During Mr. Hanway's reſidence here, he was introduced to M. Calkoen, who had been ambaſſador from the United Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands to the Ottoman Porte, and was now envoy to the King of Poland.</p>
            <p>He had formerly reſided in England, and profeſſed himſelf an admirer of that nation. At his table were Polanders, Italians, French, and Germans. The converſation, at firſt, turned on Nadir Shah, when our author was aſked, which of the countries he had ſeen he thought moſt agreeable, and where a man of ſentiment would chuſe to ſpend his days. Mr. Hanway modeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that his knowledge of the world was very limited; that he had ſeen a great deal of miſery in one ſhape or other, in every country he had viſited; but, after a pauſe, determined in favour of England The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſeemed ſurpriſed at his heſitation; and expreſſed their ſuffrage by a loud, but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035585_0089_10056CC875278F28"/>
applauſe, and unanimouſly agreed in praiſe of this happy iſle.</p>
            <p>On the 30th of Auguſt, Mr. Hanway left Dreſden, and travelled towards Meiſſen. He was captivated with the rural charms of the country; the corn-fields, the vineyards, and the different proſpects of the Elbe. On approaching Meiſſen, the valley contracts, and ſome of the houſes of this town are built on lofty rocks that riſe perpendicular from the Elbe, and have a moſt romantic appearance.</p>
            <p>The caſtle of Meiſſen, in which the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celain manufactory is carried on, ſtands on the weſtern bank of the Elbe, and is a large building, capable of ſome defence. No perſon is admitted here without an order from the governor of Dreſden, nor are the workmen allowed to leave the gates, on pain of being cloſely confined; though, in fact, they are all priſoners in a limited ſenſe. They amount to about ſeven hundred; and ſo moderate is their pay, that the annual expence of this eſtabliſhment is not eſtimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at more than eighty thouſand crowns. This manufacture, which is kept ſo ſecret, is entirely on the elector's account, who ſells porcelain to the amount of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty, or two hundred thouſand crowns a year.</p>
            <p>After paſſing the Elbe, and mounting a ſteep aſcent, our author entered on a fine champaign country, where the ſoil is rich and well cultivated, and towns and villages
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035585_0090_10056CCBCEF905E8"/>
agreeably intermixed. At length he arrived at St. Hubertſberg, another hunting pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, belonging to the elector, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well ſituated for its deſtination. This building is large, and ſome of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments are ſuperlatively fine.</p>
            <p>Proceeding on his journey, he met with nothing worth notice till he came to Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, one of the greateſt trading towns of Germany, though it has no river of any mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude near it. Here are three fairs,—on New Year's Day, Eaſter, and Michaelmas, to which reſort, people of almoſt every Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nation, either to buy or ſell. But what adds to the pre-eminence of Leipſic over many cities, which have ſuperior local advantages is that liberty of conſcience granted to all religions <note n="*" place="bottom">It is aſtoniſhing that the obvious advantages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from toleration, have not yet put a final end to bigotry, and that men ſhould ſtill be weak enough to think they honour God by perſecuting his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Hence the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are diſtinguiſhed for their induſtry, and their progreſs in moral and intellectual improvement. This is the ſeat of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable univerſity. The inhabitants amount to about forty thouſand within the walls, and the ſuburbs are alſo very populous.</p>
            <p>The fortifications ſeem rather calculated for the uſe of the inhabitants to walk on, than for defence. The citizens, however, maintain two hundred ſoldiers. The ſtreets
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035585_0091_10056CCD51B979C0"/>
are clean and commodious, and the houſes in general are lofty, with elegant fronts.</p>
            <p>In the vicinity of Leipſic are fine gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; that called the Apel garden, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, is laid out in an excellent taſte, and is ornamented with ſtatues, which, though not maſterly performances, are ſo ranged as to have a pleaſing effect.</p>
            <p>In his road to Landſperg, Mr. Hanway had a diſtant view of Hall, famous for its univerſity. At Landſperg he re-entered the Pruſſian dominions; the tranſition from one ſovereignty to another, being very rapid in Germany, from the intermixture of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ſmall extent of principalities. Indeed the ſubjects of the petty ſtates of Germany, which are very numerous, are the moſt oppreſſed of human beings. Their princes, by every art of exaction, can ſcarcely raiſe enough to ſupport their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected dignity; though it may be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that their neceſſities render them ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in deviſing the means of obtaining ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. Yet poverty and morality ſeem in this country at leaſt to be intimately allied; for thefts and robberies are hardly known.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of September, our author ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Magdeburg, diſtinguiſhed for its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, which are immenſely ſtrong. This city is under the ſovereignty of the King of Pruſſia, and is remarkable for its magazines of merchandiſe, which are ſpread from this centre over the ſurrounding country. In the great ſquare is an ancient ſtatue of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035585_0092_10056CCF79B4E360"/>
Otho, who is ſaid to have founded this city in the year 930</p>
            <p>Soon after quitting Magdeburg, Mr. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way had a fracas with a cuſtom-houſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, on account of the poſtillion attempting to evade the payment of a certain duty. However, by his ſpirited conduct, he brought himſelf off in the moſt honourable manner, and was allowed to purſue his journey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moleſtation. It ſhould be obſerved, that the German poſtillions wear the liveries of the countries to which they belong; and uſe ſmall French horns, which ſome of them ſound in no unpleaſant manner.</p>
            <p>At Helmſtet, belonging to the Duke of Brunſwick, are two hundred ſtudents, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported by the bounty of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. Four German miles farther, lies Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinbuttel, where our traveller arrived after the gates were ſhut, but procured admiſſion.</p>
            <p>The fortifications are neat and regular, and the houſes appear comfortable, but not grand. The ducal palace anſwers the ſame deſcription; but it has ſeveral well-furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apartments, and two ſmall galleries of pictures. Mr. Hanway declined ſeeing the public library, for want of time to examine its contents, thinking that the ſimple view of books is a more barren entertainment, than ſurveying the ſky, without contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating him who made it.</p>
            <p>Next day he reached Brunſwick, a well fortified place. This is the ducal reſidence, and has an arſenal well filled with every kind
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035585_0093_10056CD1DA245260"/>
of armour and ordnance. On the ramparts is a braſs mortar piece, made in 1411, which is ten feet long, and nine feet in diameter. It requires fifty-two pounds of powder to charge it, and will carry a ball of ſeven hundred and thirty pounds weight to the diſtance of thirty-two thouſand paces, and throw a bomb of one thouſand pounds weight.</p>
            <p>The military are clothed and trained near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Pruſſian model: in times of peace they are eſtimated at thirteen thouſand men; and yet the revenues of the country are ſaid not to exceed two hundred and ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling a year.</p>
            <p>Brunſwick contains ſeveral churches, one of which is a very ancient Gothic ſtructure, and has its ceiling ornamented with twenty large paintings, repreſenting the prophets in the Old Teſtament in the clouds of heaven, which communicate a very ſolemn air to the edifice. The high al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> is of marble, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Aaron and Moſes, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſtatues of the four evangeliſts.</p>
            <p>This court is diſtinguiſhed for its polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, particularly to the Engliſh, who paſs this way The duke ſeems more attached to eaſe and happineſs, than vain parade. His coach is generally attended by no more than ſeven ſervants, and ſome of his family al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways occupy the vacant ſeats.</p>
            <p>The palace of Saltzdahlen ſtands above a German mile from Brunſwick, and is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtructed of timber, lined with painted cloth, which gives the apartments an air of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035585_0094_10056CD4D65E70C0"/>
grandeur at a ſmall expence. The picture gallery is a noble apartment, and contains many capital productions of the pencil. The left wing is furniſhed in a groteſque taſte, with porcelain; and another is filled with painted enamelled ware, great part of which is ſaid to have been executed by Raphael d'Urbino, while he was enamoured of the potter's daughter.</p>
            <p>Among the moſt celebrated paintings, are Adam and Eve viewing the dead body of Abel, and trying to open his eyes; Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham embracing his own ſon, after the trial which God had made of his faith; Peter delivered from priſon by the angel; Judith and her attendant holding the head of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifernes, which ſtill ſeems to retain the laſt traces of life; Cephalus and Procris; and various others.</p>
            <p>The dutchy of Brunſwick carries on a pretty extenſive trade with Bohemia. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in hops, eſteemed the beſt in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and much oil is made from turnip ſeed.</p>
            <p>On approaching the city of Hanover, it appeared emboſomed in trees, through which viſtas are cut; and ſo extenſive are the woods in the environs, that though our author ſays it was computed eighty thouſand trees had been blown down in a late ſtorm, they could ſcarcely be miſſed.</p>
            <p>Hanover, in many reſpects, is a pleaſant place, and may be eſteemed elegant. It is waſhed by the Lena, a branch of the Alie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:035585_0095_10056CD6F464A0D0"/>
which runs into the Weſer, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it has a communication with Bremen.</p>
            <p>The electoral palace is ſeated on the banks of the Lena. It has ſeveral courts, and many grand and commodious apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſome of which are hung with very rich tapeſtry. The opera-houſe and the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre for the French comedians are both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the palace. During the winter, plays are regularly performed, and concerts are given twice a week, when the courtiers, without exception, take place, according to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary rank. A guard is always mounted, and an open table kept for the council of ſtate, even when the king is not in his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral dominions.</p>
            <p>The military force, in time of peace, is about twenty-four thouſand men, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the electorate amount to ſeven hundred thouſand pounds, a conſiderable part of which ariſes from the ſilver mines.</p>
            <p>Herenhauſen, ſituated about two Engliſh miles to the north of Hanover, is always conſidered as an object of attraction to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers. Our author ſays, he knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was more mortified or ſurpriſed, to find that this celebrated palace fell vaſtly ſhort of his expectations. It was built in the year 1670, by the elector Erneſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus; the greateſt part is of wood, and though the apartments are large, they are far from being magnificent Some of the furniture, however, is rich, and the pictures deſerve admiration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:035585_0096_100556BFD3DF6700"/>The gardens are very beautiful. Mr. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſays he had ſeen none in Germany to be compared with them, though they were not laid out in that exquiſite taſte, of which there are ſo numerous ſpecimens in England. They are adorned with ſtatues; and the jet d'eau, formed in 1716, by Mr. Benſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, is unrivalled, as it throws up the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeventy feet high. Here, according to the German taſte, is a ſylvan theatre, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtatues, on which are ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited plays and maſquerades.</p>
            <p>On the 15th of September, Mr. Hanway ſet out for Zell. By the road, he obſerved in ſeveral places, the remains of ancient buildings, about three feet high, which the vulgar ridiculouſly imagine are of an era coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val with the deluge</p>
            <p>Zell, which is ſubject to Hanover, is a conſiderable fortified place The palace is ſituated on an eminence commanding a fine proſpect, and is itſelf a ſtrong poſt. The houſes are moſtly mean wooden ſtructures. This place has an inconſiderable trade with Bremen, by means of the river Aller.</p>
            <p>In his way to Weiſſendorf, he paſſed through a barren country, fit only to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port flocks of ſheep; and indeed this elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torate ſupplies the greateſt part of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with mutton, as Weſtphalia does with hogs, and Hungary with be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the 17th he arrived a Hamburg, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low which city the banks of the Elbe in
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035585_0097_10056CD877C85D70"/>
ſome places riſe to a great height, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a delightful view of ſeveral iſlets in the middle of the river, which is five or ſix miles broad.</p>
            <p>Hamburg is one of the towns belonging to the Hanſeatic league, and is a place of the greateſt importance. Its ſituation for trade, and the reputation of its laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have peopled it with opulent mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who carry on an extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. It ſtands in the dutchy of Holſtein, on the north ſide of the Elbe, where that river forms many iſlands, and ſome of the ſtreets are ſo low, as to be frequently inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated by the tides.</p>
            <p>The houſes in general are ſubſtantially built, and make a ſtately appearance; but many of the ſtreets are ſo narrow, as to render it difficult to uſe wheel carriages. However, there are ſome parts of the town which are open and airy; but theſe being more remote from the river, are leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by commercial people.</p>
            <p>Hamburgh is, with reſpect to Germany, what Amſterdam is to Europe—the general emporium of natural produce and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. By means of canals, ſhips may unload at the warehouſes, which are ſtored with the moſt valuable commodities.</p>
            <p>The whole number of veſſels, of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burden, belonging to the town, is computed at four hundred; ſome of the largeſt of which trade to and from London. The Britiſh factory here is poſſeſſed of as
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035585_0098_10056CDAA327FC18"/>
many diſtinguiſhed privileges as any body of foreigners enjoy in the commercial world.</p>
            <p>The fortifications on the land ſide are reckoned very ſtrong. The walks round the ramparts extend about four Engliſh miles, and, in moſt places, are very pleaſant. On the eaſt ſide of the town is a fine piece of water, formed by the Alſter, within the walls, which, in the ſummer, is covered with pleaſure-boats. The citizens have ſeveral gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on the banks of the Elbe and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; they are kept in the neateſt trim; and, from their diminutive ſize, appear more like a puppet-ſhow than a rural ſcene.</p>
            <p>The city is divided into five pariſhes, which have as many capital churches. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſm is the eſtabliſhed religion, and Roman Catholics are objects of great jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy; but the Jews, the univerſal brokers of nations, live unmoleſted.</p>
            <p>The government of Hamburg is veſted in four burgomaſters, and twenty-four ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; fourteen of whom are choſen from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the merchants, and ten from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the law. There are alſo four ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dics, who act as ſecretaries of ſtate, and as many profeſſed ſecretaries. Beſides, every pariſh has the appointment of three officers, in the nature of the tribunes among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans; and nothing of moment is determined by the ſenate without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. The population within the walls may be computed at one hundred and eighty thouſand ſouls, and it is probable, that the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035585_0099_10056CF24EBCC420"/>
ſuburbs and adjacent villages contain about half that number. Except ſugar-baking and cotton printing, the manufactures of this place are very inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>The better ſort of people, among the men, are very affable; but the women ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear reſerved. State and grandeur are here loſt in the ſuperiour attention to commercial purſuits. Indeed the eaſy circumſtances of the majority of the inhabitants, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the conſtitution under which they live, have infuſed a certain degree of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican independence, which tinctures their manners. This ſpirit of inſubordination is perceptible even in the loweſt claſſes; not that it prompts them to acts of riot, but it gives them a kind of conſequence, which, where the gradations of rank are obſerved, would appear inſolent.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of September, Mr. Hanway proceeded to Blankeneſs by a delightful road, on the banks of the Elbe, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a fine and extenſive view of part of the Hanoverian dominions on the weſt, and of Holſtein an appendage of Denmark, on the eaſt. For ſome days he obſerved nothing worth notice in the country or towns thro' which he paſſed.</p>
            <p>On the 1ſt of October, he reached Cloſter Seven. The ſurrounding territory is thinly inhabited; but, as he approached Bremen, the aſpect in fertility and population began to improve About three Engliſh miles from Bremen, he obſerved three ſtones bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035585_0100_100556C7BA15F6F0"/>
the Britiſh arms, which mark the limits of the Hanoverian dominions.</p>
            <p>Bremen is ſeated on a plain, on both ſides of the Weſer, over which it has a bridge. This dutchy formerly belonged to Sweden; but being conquered by the Danes, was ſold to the Elector of Hanover in 1716; yet only a ſmall part of the town is ſubject to that electorate. The reſt, with its adjacent territory, is independent, and is governed by its own laws and magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>Calviniſm is the prevailing religion here, and there are five churches for citizens of that perſuaſion. The inhabitants amount to thirty thouſand; and, were we to judge from the frequent appearance of Soli Deo Gloria, painted in large characters over their doors and windows, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, we ſhould conclude that they were pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indeed.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the ſtreets are narrow, but many of the buildings make a handſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the ſhops are full of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. In the market-place is the figure of a giant fourteen feet high, clothed in armour, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>id to repreſent a general who ſaved the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when it was in the utmoſt danger from its enemies. The great dome devoted to the Lutheran religion, is the moſt remarkable ſtructure in the place. It is built in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic ſtyle, and ſeems to poſſeſs the quality of preſerving the bodies of the dead from corruption. In confirmation of this, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that corpſes, which had been buried
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035585_0101_10056CE01CBD8B40"/>
one hundred and fifty year, were diſcovered entire, with their ſkins black and parched, but the features diſtinguiſhable, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion of the parts unaltered. The vault in which they were depoſited, is about ſix feet below the ſurface of the earth, arched over, and ſeems to have nothing extraordinary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that the air is temperate, and perfectly dry.</p>
            <p>Several perſons have offered conſiderable ſums to have their bodies depoſited in this receptacle of mortality: but the prieſts, it is ſaid, refuſed the idle boon; alleging that it is the decree of heaven, "that man ſhould return to the duſt from which he was made."</p>
            <p>The vicinity of Bremen being ſubject to inundations, a long cauſeway is raiſed for the convenience of travelling. Paſſing along this, Mr. Hanway re-entered the Pruſſian dominions, and at length arrived at Wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhauſen, a principal town, and the reſidence of the great bailiff of the diſtrict.</p>
            <p>From thence he advanced to Haſſelune, a pretty agreeable town, in the electorate of Cologn. Poverty and ſuperſtition reign here unrivalled: a crucifix is erected on almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſpot ſubject to obſervation.</p>
            <p>Lingen was the next ſtage. This lies in the circle of Weſtphalia, and is ſubject to the King of Pruſſia The town is fortified, and the buildings are neat, the general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of places under the ſovereignty of Pruſſia.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="unknown:035585_0102_10056CE19F880D50"/>Our author now approached the confines of the United Netherlands, where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men appeared almoſt blinded with the ſmoke ariſing from the turf, which is here the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fuel. The little towns he began to paſs through, exhibited that characteriſtic clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, for which the Dutch are ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time he arrived at Daventer, a large city in the province of Overyffel, which formerly conſtituted one of the Hanſe towns, but is now ſubject to the States.</p>
            <p>It ſtands on the river Yſſel, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable for veſſels of large burden. Over this ſtream is a wooden bridge, where paſſengers are ſubject to a heavy toll. The town is well fortified, and has a ſtrong garriſon. The houſes and ſtreets are neat, and the inland trade is conſiderable.</p>
            <p>From hence is a regular ſtage to Voorthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and about midway is Loo, a famous ſeat of the Prince of Orange. Voorthuſen is a mean village, and the environs are not very inviting.</p>
            <p>At the diſtance of two German miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, lies Amersfort. On approaching this place, evident ſigns appear of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering induſtry of the Dutch. The tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co plantations are formed with great labour, and for an article, whoſe conſumption is ſo univerſal in the Netherlands, perhaps no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or trouble is too great</p>
            <p>Amersfort is an ancient and pretty large town, on the ſmall river Eems, which runs
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035585_0103_10056CE3208875F0"/>
into the Zuyder Sea. The houſes are clean to an extreme, but the manners of the people are far from being equally delicate; and their ruſticity is ſhewn in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>About two Engliſh miles from this town ſtands Soesdyke, a palace belonging to the Orange family, with a park of eight miles in circumference.</p>
            <p>Our author being impatient to reach Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, declined viſiting Utrecht. In his way he paſſed through Naarden, the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of the province of Holland, and a well fortified place, ſtanding near the Zuyder Sea. From hence to Amſterdam is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two German miles. The whole country appears below the level of the ſea, but is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with gardens and luxuriant paſtures. In the avenue to Amſterdam, is a cauſeway lined with villages and gardens, which add greatly to the beauty of this artificial coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>The city of Amſterdam, as well as many others in the Netherlands, are works of art and labour, not inferior to the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of human induſtry in ancient times. It ſtands about two hundred and twenty miles eaſtward from London, and derives its name from the river Amſtel, or the dam of the Amſtel, which, by corruption, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes its preſent appellation.</p>
            <p>Our author computes that it is about four hundred years old from its firſt foundation, and two hundred and ſeventy from the era
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035585_0104_10056CE6180980E0"/>
that it was incloſed with walls. In 1570 the Dutch began to lay the baſis of their opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and power. Embracing Calviniſm, and wearied with the oppreſſions of the Spaniſh government, they emancipated themſelves into liberty, after a long ſtruggle and many conflicts, and formed a great republic.</p>
            <p>About the year 1660, the flame of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty occaſioned ſuch a conflux of people to Amſterdam, that the walls were extended, and by ſubſequent enlargements, they are become three leagues in circuit. The city is eſteemed nearly one third as populous as London or Paris; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd within the walls are computed to be twenty-ſix thouſand five hundred houſes.</p>
            <p>The main ſtrength of the place conſiſts in the difficulty of acceſs both by ſea and land; but the numerous ſhoals that obſtruct the mouth of the Texel have proved no bar to commercial enterpriſe, though they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der navigation dangerous to ſhips of war. Economy is here perceptible in every thing: even the baſtions of the fortifications, which are very numerous, have each a windmill.</p>
            <p>Many of the ſtreets are lined with canals and planted with trees. No wheel carriages are allowed to be drawn here, except on pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a heavy duty. Coaches are ſet on ſledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, drawn by one horſe, and on the ſame vehicle goods and merchandiſe of every kind are conveyed from one place of the town to another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:035585_0105_10056CE8341655D8"/>The houſes are rather diſtinguiſhed for neatneſs than elegance; and the principal care of the inhabitants ſeems to be laid out in keeping them clean, which the nature of the climate renders in ſome meaſure neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but perſonal elegance is far from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pace with domeſtic neatneſs.</p>
            <p>Of all the buildings in Amſterdam, the town-houſe is the moſt remarkable Its front extends two hundred and eighty-two feet in length, its depth is two hundred and thirty-two feet, and its height one hundred and ſixteen feet, excluſive of the cupola The expence of its erection coſt three millions of Guilders, which, conſidering the value of money at that period, is an aſtoniſhing ſum; but it ſhould he conſidered, that it ſtands on thirteen thouſand large piles of wood, ſo that the foundation greatly enhanced the expence.</p>
            <p>This immenſe fabric contains the offices and tribunals for the execution of the laws, in every branch of government. It is night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded by a body of the burghers, who are charged with the protection of this great reſervoir of the wealth of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. The bank, which is kept in the lower apartments, is ſaid to contain immenſe ſums of ſpecie.</p>
            <p>The Exchange is likewiſe a ſpacious and convenient ſtructure. It is ſupported by forty-ſix pillars marked with numbers, and every merchant has his particular ſtation, that he may be the more eaſily found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="unknown:035585_0106_10056CE9B6DB26E0"/>Though Calviniſm is the eſtabliſhed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, all perſuaſions are allowed the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their modes of worſhip. The Jews are very numerous, and have ſeveral ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. To render marriages, however, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, they muſt either be performed according to the rites of the eſtabliſhed church, or the parties muſt firſt enter into a contract before the civil magiſtrate; after which they are indulged with their own particular ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p>In paſſing over the Ya to Saardam, our author obſerved the various purpoſes to which windmills are applied in this country. They are uſed for ſawing timber, for grinding woods and other materials for dyeing, and for almoſt every manufacture to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery is applicable.</p>
            <p>The dykes are prodigious monuments of labour, and many of them are lined with large ſtones. That which bounds the Zuyder Sea, is raiſed ſixteen feet perpendicular, and goes off on an eaſy ſlope.</p>
            <p>The danger of ſuch a dreadful element as the ſea, is almoſt equal to that of a volcano, and the Dutch have often ſuffered from its inroads. In ſpite of their utmoſt ſkill and induſtry, their dykes have proved ineffectual to ſecure them. In 1530, a great part of Zealand was overflowed, and in the ſame century, ſeventy-two villages on the coaſt of Holland were ſwallowed up, and twenty thouſand people periſhed. Other inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035585_0107_10056CEBDAEDA958"/>
have happened at different periods, and ſpread deſolation over extenſive tracts</p>
            <p>Amſterdam is a prodigious magazine of corn, wine, timber, and naval ſtores. Its herring and whale fiſheries bring in immenſe wealth; and the rich productions of their oriental poſſeſſions being poured in here, add immenſely to the opulence and commerce of this emporium.</p>
            <p>Though there are many Hollanders who live elegantly, the manners of the common people are extremely booriſh. Our author obſerves, that he has ſeen a boatman in a great city, ſtrut up and down a room with his hat on, and ſpit with a careleſs air of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence at the feet of a gentleman who was treating him with civility, and throwing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument in his way. This behaviour they miſtake for liberty, as if liberty were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with propriety of manner.</p>
            <p>Cheeſe, beer, Geneva, brandy, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, with red herrings, are the luxuries of the common people, who in their cups are apt to mix ruſticity with cruelty.</p>
            <p>Conſtant employment, coldneſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and an ungenial kind of food, may perhaps account for their indifference to the paſſion of love. Except among the higher ranks, female beauty is ſcarcely to be met with, nor does their dreſs ſet off their home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons to any advantage.</p>
            <p>The women here are generally paſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition at thirty years of age, and as the men are ſingular for their large breeches, ſo
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035585_0108_10056CEEA1212F98"/>
the women are remarkable for uſing pots of live coals, which they place under their petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats as they ſit, to warm themſelves; which is not only an offenſive cuſtom, but in a phyſical light, is attended with many ill conſequences. Hence the proverb, "that the dirtieſt piece of furniture in a Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's houſe is his wife."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hanway quitted Amſterdam on the 16th of October, and embarking at the Haerlem gate, proceeded down the canal in a treckſcoot to that town, paſſing through a ſucceſſion of rich meadows well ſtocked with cattle.</p>
            <p>From Haerlem he proceeded to Leyden, through a pleaſant and rich country. This city is well known for its univerſity, to which ſtudents reſort from all parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The houſes are neat, and the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gardens very pleaſant; but here the water becomes ſtagnant, and in conſequence diſagreeable.</p>
            <p>Our author next viſited the Hague, which having no incloſure, is denominated a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage though it is the moſt elegant place in the Netherlands. The ſtreets are broad, and the gaiety and ſplendor of the inhabitants form a ſtriking contraſt to the ſtyle of life in the trading cities. The aſſembly of the States General being held here, draws hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the principal people of diſtinction of the different provinces, and the ambaſſadors from the other European courts. In ſhort, the Hague is the ſeat of amuſement, of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035585_0109_10056CF0CBED5840"/>
and magnificence, in the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</p>
            <p>Delft, which was the next place our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor viſited, is a very ancient and pleaſant town, environed by meadows of conſiderable extent. This place is famous for its earthen ware, and its population, is computed at twenty thouſand perſons.</p>
            <p>Rotterdam, about ſeven miles diſtant, may juſtly be conſidered as the ſecond city of Holland. Indeed it has ſeveral advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages over Amſterdam itſelf, particularly with reſpect to the ſouthern trade of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope: beſides, the navigation of the Maeſe is more ſafe and commodious than that of the Texel, and the air and water are better.</p>
            <p>Among other public ſtructures, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the merchants; but the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable edifice is the great church of St. Lawrence, in which are the monuments of ſeveral perſons of diſtinction On the great bridge is the ſtatue of the illuſtrious Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh factory here is chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of North Britons, who have a Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic church. During the wars in Flanders, under the great Duke of Marlborough, an epiſcopal church was erected by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Engliſh officers, merchants, and mariners, which is ſaid to be the only regular epiſcopal church, countenanced and eſtabliſhed, belonging to the ſubjects of Great Britain, in a foreign country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:035585_0110_100556C579773650"/>On the 27th of October, Mr. Hanway ſailed down the Maeſe to Helvoet Sluys. Though this is one of the beſt harbours in the United Provinces, the town is of no great extent. Here our traveller had the pleaſure to find a ſmall ſquadron of Britiſh ſhips of war, under the command of Lord Anſon, intended to convey George II. to England. The ſight of his country's ſhips of war was the more agreeable, as he had not enjoyed ſuch a view for the long ſpace of eight years.</p>
            <p>Embarking at this place next day in the packet for Harwich, he landed ſafe on the Britiſh ſhore, after a paſſage of twenty-four hours, and thus cloſed his extenſive perigri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
