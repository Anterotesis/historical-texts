            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The following charge was delivered at the close of the pleadings, by the Hon. Judge Shippen.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS is an action brought by the Plaintiff againſt the Defendant for writing, printing and publiſhing divers ſcandalous libels, to defame and villify him. The defendant has pleaded that he is not guilty;—his counſel, however have acknowledged the publication of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which, otherwiſe, it would have been incumbent on the plaintiff to prove. The queſtion, therefore, will be, whether they amount in law to defamatory libels or not?</p>
            <p>By the law and practice in England, in the caſe of libels, the only taſk of the jury is, to judge of the fact of publication, and the truth and fair application of the inuendos. The court, as judges of the law, reſerving to themſelves the ſole power of deciding whether the paper amounts to a libel or not: But in this ſtate, by the ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of our conſtitution, the jury poſſeſs the power of judging both of the law and fact, under the direction of the court.</p>
            <p>A libel is defined by the law, to be the malicious defamation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed either in printing or writing, or by ſigns or pictures, tending to blacken either the memory of one who is dead, or the reputation of one who is alive, or to expoſe him to public hatred, contempt or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule. This offence may be puniſhed, either by indictment at the ſuit of the commonwealth, or by a civil action at the ſuit of the party inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. When the proſecution is by indictment, the court only are to direct the puniſhment; but is a civil ſuit, the damages are to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ſolely by the jury.</p>
            <p>The charges laid againſt the defendant in the declaration, are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but they may be reduced in ſubſtance to the following.—That he repeatedly calls the plaintiff a quack, an empyric; charges him with intemperate bleeding, injudiciouſly adminiſtering Mercury in large doſes in the yellow-fever; puffing himſelf off; writing letters and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering them himſelf, ſtiling him the Sampſon in Medicine; charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with murdering his patients and ſlaying his thouſands, and tens of thouſands.</p>
            <p>The counts laid in the declaration is full proved by the publications which are certainly libellous. In what manner do the defendant's counſel repel theſe proofs? Not by juſtifying the truth of the matters charged againſt Dr. Ruſh, which on the contrary they have repeatedly acknowledged to be falſe, but by analyzing the ſeveral allegations in the newſpapers, and from thence drawing a concluſion that no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional perſonal malice appears, which they ſay is the eſſence of the offence.—Malice reſts in the heart, and is only to be judged of by the words and actions of the party; the words themſelves import malice, and in that caſe the proof lies on the defendant to ſhew the innocence of his intentions; if he has done THAT to your ſatisfaction, you will acquit him; but as this is chiefly founded on the allegation that the attack was meant to be made on Dr. Ruſh's <hi>System,</hi> and not on the <hi>Man;</hi> it unfortunately appears that not the leaſt attempt is made to combat the Doctor's arguments with regard to the ſyſtem itſelf, but the attack is made merely by groſs ſcurrilous abuſe of the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0003_100D326C383150A0"/>
Added to this, one of the witneſſes proves a declaration made by the defendant, that if Dr. Ruſh had not been the <hi>Man</hi> he ſhould never have meddled with the <hi>System.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another ground of defence is of a more ſerious nature, as it leads to an important queſtion on our conſtitution—it is ſaid that the ſubject of diſpute between the plaintiff and defendant was a matter of public concern, as it related to the health and lives of our fellow citizens, and that by the words of our conſtitution, every man has a right to diſcuſs ſuch ſubjects in print. The liberty of the preſs, gentlemen, is a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able right in every free country, and ought never to be unduly reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but when it is perverted to the purpoſes of private ſlander, it then becomes a moſt deſtructive engine in the hands of unprincipled men; the utmoſt purity and integrity of heart, is no ſhield againſt the ſhafts and arrows of malice, conveyed to the world by printed publications. Verbal ſlander may be frequently very injurious, but ſlander writing or print being more generally diſſeminated and more durable in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is conſequently infinitely more pernicious and provoking. Our ſtate conſtitution of 1790, contains certainly very general words with relation to the right of a citizen to print his thoughts and offer them to the conſideration of the public, but it at the ſame time guard againſt the generality of the privilege, by expreſsly declaring, that every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon availing himſelf of the liberty of the preſs, <hi>should be responsible for the abuse of that liberty;</hi> thus ſecuring to our citizens the invaluable right of reputation againſt every malicious invader of it.</p>
            <p>Printed publications attacking private character, is conſidered with great reaſon by the law as a very atrocious offence, from its evident tendency to the breach of the public peace—if men find they can have no redreſs in our courts of juſtice for ſuch injuries, they will naturally take ſatisfaction in their own way, involving perhaps their friends and families in the conteſt, and leading evidently to duels, Murders, and perhaps to Aſſaſſinations.</p>
            <p>The principal ſubject of conſideration with the jury will be, what damages they are to aſſeſs. On this ſubject you are the almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable judges—it is your peculiar province:—The court have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the power to order a new trial where damages are exceſſive; but in caſes of torts and injuries of this kind, the law books ſay the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges muſt be ſo outrageouſly diſproportionate to the offence, as at firſt bluſh to ſhock every perſon who hears of it, before the court will order a new trial.</p>
            <p>Every one muſt know that offences of this kind have for ſome time paſt too much abounded in our city; it ſeems high time to reſtrain them—that taſk is with you, Gentlemen. To ſuppreſs ſo great an evil, it will not only be proper to give compenſatory, but exemplary damages; thus ſtopping the growing progreſs of this daring crime—at the ſame time, the damages ſhould not be ſo enormous as abſolutely to ruin the offender.</p>
            <p>I hope no party conſiderations will ever have place in this court in the adminiſtration of Juſtice—and I intreat you, Gentlemen, to baniſh them, in conſidering this ſubject, entirely from your breaſts.</p>
            <p>The Jury, after an abſence of two hours, brought in a verdict in favor of the Plaintiff of <hi>Five Thousand Dollars.</hi>

               <p>Thoſe who are in the habit of looking over the Gazettes, which come in from the different parts of the country, muſt have obſerved, and with no ſmall degree of indignation, the arts that our remorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Bleeder</hi> is making uſe of to puff off his prepoſterous practice. He has, unfortunately, his partizans in almoſt every quarter of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. To theſe he writes letters, and in return gets letters from them: he extols their practice, and they extol his; and there is ſcarcely a page of any newſpaper that I ſee, which has the good fortune to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the poiſon of their preſcriptions.—Blood, blood! ſtill they cry more blood!—In every ſentence they menace our poor veins. Their language is as frightful to the ears of the alarmed multitude, as is the raven's croak to thoſe of the ſickly flock.</p>
               <p>Among all theſe puffs, I do not recollect a more ſhameleſs one than the following from Dr. TILTON.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <head>Extract of a letter from Dr. Tilton, of Wilmington, to Dr. Rush, dated September 12.</head>
                     <p>We have had repeated inſtances of <hi>your fever</hi> at this place. The infection has generally been taken in Philadelphia, I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any inſtances where the contagion has been received

at Wilmington, but at Newcaſtle and Newport there are unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal examples of the contagion being received from thoſe who brought it from the city.</p>
                     <p>In the treatment of the fever we uſe <hi>copious</hi> blood-letting in the beginning, and active <hi>mercurial purges.</hi> I have conceived however, that mercury is uſeful, not merely as a cathartic, but as <hi>a specific against all kinds of contagion.</hi>—There is no contagious diſeaſe in which its uſe is not acknowledged: not only ſmall-pox, meaſles, dyſentery, &amp;c. but ſcarlitina and influenza yield to its ſpecific vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. You probably remember as well as I, that it was given with advantage in the hoſpital and camp fever. In ſhort, I have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it as a maxim, to give mercury as ſoon as I know a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to be contagious.</p>

               <p>This Dr. Tilton is a kind of a puritan; a four wry-faced incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible democrat. He has the pride of Lucifer himſelf, and, to me, it is aſtoniſhing that he ſhould have condeſcended to become the trumpet, the underling, the mere barber-ſurgeon of the maſter-bleeder.</p>
               <p>The mercurial purges too, Dr. Tilton muſt break forth in praiſe of! Mercury is good for every thing that is contagious! Is good for ſanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullotiſm Doctor? If it be, in the name of goodneſs, take a double doſe of it twice a day, 'till it has wrought a cure.—Dr. Ruſh, in that emphatical ſtile which is peculiar to himſelf, calls <hi>Mercury</hi> "the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of medicine." In his hands and in thoſe of his partizans it may indeed be juſtly compared to <hi>Samson;</hi> for, I verily believe they have ſlain more Americans with it, than ever Samſon ſlew of the Philiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines. The Iſraelite ſlew his thouſands, but the Ruſhites have ſlain their tens of thouſands.</p>

Would you believe it Mr. P—that the raſcal after reading my eſſay in your paper, purchaſed <hi>"Dr. Rush on the Yellow Fever,"</hi> and has been ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever ſince, to my great loſs and mortification. And now the wiſe illiterate thinks he can commence buſineſs for himſelf. But let him remember that <hi>"Ne sutor ultra crepidem," The cobler must not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his last.</hi> I obſerve he is half a phyſician already, for he has got the <hi>Cocoe iters scribendi</hi>—and has obliged the public with his firſt medical eſſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0006_100D32740CADC5F8"/>
Not content with deſerting my ſervice, he appears deſirous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the public againſt me, and my brethren, aſſerting in ſtrong terms, that we are enemies to the <hi>noble science of blood-letting:</hi> This is abominable and contrary to the truth. For I am, and ſhall be <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens volens,</hi> an advocate for the practice, and it is my creed that it will cure all diſeaſes—as our good allies the French have clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their practice,—I have alſo another reaſon for commencing the buſineſs of a phyſician; In fact, the villainous liquors my wine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant obliges me to ſupply my gueſts with, has lately cauſed in the latter ſevere and harſh expoſtulations, and, as I am a conſcientious man, I wiſh to follow a quiet buſineſs, and I prefer that of the lancet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know Mr. P. <hi>dead men never tell tales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I have now cautioned your readers, and I conceive the public againſt my raſcally hoſtler, I have to obſerve to you, that a meeting of our brethren was held at my tavern laſt evening; when the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I had recommended was very warmly approved; and a college was determined to be held the enſuing week, for the purpoſe of taking out our diplomas.—And it was unanimouſly agreed to requeſt, Dr. J. Redman Coxe to favor us with a prefatory oration in praiſe of the noble ſcience of blood-letting. We alſo voted a ſerious expoſtulation to the public, on their prejudices againſt the new practice addreſſed to Dr. Ruſh, the great patron of the art.</p>
               <p>As our reſolves will appear in your paper, I think it unneceſſary to ſtate more at preſent, than that we determined not to advertiſe the particular taverns where compounds may be had; as we believed each of our brethren was well qualified in that reſpect. The ſuperior me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of ſome, who ſell ſtale porter, dead cider, &amp;c. will be ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by their reſpective patients.</p>
               <p>I have already got my carriage newly painted, and have engaged a <hi>French</hi> hoſtler, whoſe merits and <hi>sang froid</hi> in the uſe of the lancet are I believe, unrivalled, for I believe he was an <hi>eleve</hi> of Robeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre.</p>
               <p>I have alſo hired a few nurſes, whoſe abilities I am well acquainted with. They will never deſert their patients, as I have engaged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them conſtantly with excellent gin and have alſo promiſed them the pillage of ſuch of my patients who may be determined to die.</p>

               <p>In reading thy paper of the 19th inſtant, I took notice of a curious obſervation made on a certain rye faced incorrigible democrat, one of the medical puffers. To complete the ſtory, I will give thee a ſhort ſketch of a curious fact (which happened ſome time paſt in this place) concerning this ſelf conſequent Mercurial ghoſt.</p>
               <p>There was a woman travelling from the head of Elk to German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, and on her way her carriage was turned over, ſhe thrown out, and very much hurt, She has ſince returned from Germantown through Philadelphia, and made a ſtop at an inn, in this borough;—the woman overcome with fatigue and a cold ſhe had taken, felt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little indiſpoſed.</p>
               <p>This crooked faced Quack was called in. As ſoon as he ſaw her, he ſaid he muſt take ſome BLOOD, and I ſuppoſe, if he had not got frightened, a good doſe of mercury would have enſued.</p>
               <p>But fortunate for the poor woman, he happened to puſh up her ſleeve a little, and diſcovered a bruiſe on her arm, which ſhe received in her fall from the carriage. Alarmed at the appearance of her arm, he aſked her if ſhe had been to Philadelphia, the reply was, yes: he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pronounced her complaints to be the <hi>Yellow Fever,</hi> made his eſcape and has not ſeen her ſince. The good woman has recovered and proceeded on her way home. There now lies a perſon, a ſmall diſtance from the town, in a houſe (built for the reception of perſons coming here with the contagion) who he pronounced to have the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever. But, who in fact, has nothing but the common ague.</p>

intended to make the duped world believe, that he is the Oracle at Philadelphia, and that all the other phyſicians are mere gliſter-pipe Dickes under him.—It is a cheap mode of acquiring fame, which he learned from the crafty old hypocrite, Franklin.—I wonder what <hi>Coates</hi> it is that the Doctor has got in tow; Some well meaning man, I dare engage, whom he <hi>makes use of</hi> as a <hi>step in the ladder</hi> of his ambition, at the ſame time that he expreſſes his contempt of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects, by making his court to him in a ſtrain of vulgar flattery.</p>

MR. HOPKINSON, As Counſel for the Plaintiff opened this cauſe, in the following addreſs:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is my duty to open this cauſe to you on the part of the plaintiff, Dr. Ruſh. In diſcharging this duty I ſhall beg leave to extend it ſomewhat beyond its uſual limits in ordinary caſes. I ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with merely reading the declaration to you, and ſtating the points of evidence by which it will be maintained; but ſhall alſo take the liberty of opening to you the views and diſpoſitions with which this action has been brought, and ſome of the leading principles on which it will be ſupported.</p>
               <p>The action now before you is an action of ſlander, brought by Dr. Benjamin Ruſh, who has long been a diſtinguiſhed ornament of our city, againſt William Cobbett, the printer and publiſher of a newſpaper under the name of <hi>Porcupine's Gazette.</hi> It will eaſily be imagined that no ſlight cauſe could bring a man of Dr. Ruſh's character into this, or any other competition, with a man of William Cobbett's character.—Dr. Ruſh is as well known for his peaceful habits and his amiable manners, as William Cobbett is for his diſocial malignant diſpoſition and inveterate hate—While the one may well be termed the friend of humanity, the other has labored hard to be conſidered, <hi>hostis humani generis</hi>—It is not then to indulge a fondneſs for controverſy—It is not to gratify unſocial, litigious or revengeful diſpoſitions, for no ſuch find a place in his heart, that Dr. Ruſh now preſents himſelf before the tribunal of his country, demanding juſtice for barbarous and unprovok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed injuries, and requiring that protection of an honeſt reputation which the law guarantees to every citizen—He comes here impreſſed with high duties—To THE LAWS OF HIS COUNTRY he owes a duty, that they ſhall not be violated;—TO HIS FELLOW CITIZENS he owes a duty to bring to puniſhment, and, if poſſible, ſuppreſs an abandoned and dangerous offender, who tramples over truth, decency and charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with a tiger's ſtride, and aſſaults with venomous fury the moſt ſacred bands of ſocial order and peace; the moſt endearing ties of private life and happineſs—TO HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY, he owes a duty of <hi>protection,</hi> which ſhould never be diſregarded—let the father of a family aſſert the honor and purity that it deſcend not as a ſhame upon his children.—Let the huſband preſerve the tender feelings of a wife from inſult, and her affections from the deep wounds of public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
               <p>On this high and dignified ground, Dr. Ruſh ſtands before you—He appeals to his country in firm confidence in its juſtice, and it is your province, Gentlemen, to adminiſter that juſtice—you are to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſecurity in which a citizen of Pennſylvania holds his good name, and to ſanction or to check the ravages of defamation—This day we are to know whether character is deemed a valuable and ſacred poſſeſſion among us, in which we have a perfect and inviolable right,
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0010_100D327C9E393A78"/>
or whether it is to be the mere ſport and play-thing of malicious ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and vulgar wit, the undefended victim of aſſaſſinating malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; we are now to know if honor and virtue are known and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here; if a fair and unimpreached life, of above fifty years, ſpent in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant public ſervices, and the conſtant exerciſe of private virtues, has a good claim to protection from premeditated ruin, and ſhall not ſue for redreſs in vain.</p>
               <p>The courts of juſtice are ſo often harraſſed with actions of ſlander, brought for trifling or revengeful cauſes, originating in paſſion, and ending in repentance,—founded on the quarrels of children, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning intemperance of harmleſs old women, that they have fallen into ſome kind of diſrepute, and loſt much of that importance, which the law and good reaſon attaches to them, when properly founded.—In fact, it ſeldom happens, that the kind of ſlander which the law ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly contemplates, occurs—The offence is ſo enormous, ſo deſtitute of palliation or defence, ſo unworthy, ſo low and deteſtable, the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo exemplary, that few men are found regardleſs enough of ſocial order and decency, or ſufficiently outrageous and audacious to commit it. But when ſuch a caſe does occur, it riſes in terrible pre-eminence above the multitude of actions for defamation which throng the dockets and diſgrace the remedy.—When an offender is found hardy enough to aſſault the ſacred fortreſs of reputation, and ſtrive to poſtrate it in the duſt; hardy enough to brave the vengeance denounced againſt him by God and man, he ſhould be ſtruck with dreadful and ſpeedy juſtice, and ſtand a blighted picture of ruin and infamy, an awful leſſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity and vice.—Such an offender, we aſſert, is William Cobbett; and if ſuch an offender we ſhew him to be, we truſt that ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment awaits him.—</p>
               <p>[Here Mr. Hopkinſon read the declaration.]</p>
               <p>You obſerve, Gentlemen, that the controverſy between the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff and defendant in this cauſe, does not originate in any diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout property; it is a queſtion of CHARACTER. And, as in its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it differs from ſuits on queſtions of property, ſo muſt it in its mode of treatment, and in its objects of enquiry—While the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant be permitted to a certain extent to ſcrutinize and inveſtigate the character and conduct of the plaintiff (to which inveſtigation Dr. Ruſh moſt cheerfully offers himſelf) we ſhall alſo claim a right of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or obſerving upon, to a certain extent, the character and conduct of the defendant.—His <hi>character,</hi> as far as relates to his occupation of a printer and publiſher; and his <hi>conduct,</hi> as far as relates to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral management of his newſpaper, are ſurely proper objects of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation at leaſt—Nothing can be more evident; nothing more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. If the general character of his preſs is that of decency, of tenderneſs for reputation, of candor, liberality and truth, and he has now, as if by accident, fallen into perſonal defamation, it will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be urged by his counſel, as a powerful extenuation of his offence, as a ſtrong argument to induce you to believe that this ſingle devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is error, and not crime, is ignorance and not malignity—The plea would moſt juſtly, hold a powerful influence over your judgments: and
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0011_100D3280D8CDF1F0"/>
although in the ſtrict eye of the law, the only queſtion in this action is on the ſpecific charge of ſlander, exhibited in the declaration, yet the conſtruction of thoſe charges—the <hi>quo animo</hi> or diſpoſition with which the offenſive paragraphs were written and publiſhed, will depend much on the general character and conduct of the defendant as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will have a ſtrong influence over the verdict of an equitable jury.</p>
               <p>Permit me gentlemen one further explanation—Parties have in our country, become wrought up to ſuch illiberal fury, that every action of a man's life, from the moſt important to the moſt obſcure and trifl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is traced to party motives and party principles—His attachments and his enmities—his connexions in buſineſs or otherwiſe, nay almoſt the color of the cloth he wears, and the ſpecies of diet he feeds on, are aſcribed to his party and political principles—This is an unhappy ſtate of things—Were I of the party to whom it has <hi>happened</hi> the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant has oppoſed himſelf—I ſhould expect that all I ſhall now or ever ſay againſt this man, would by many of my fellow-citizens, perhaps by you gentlemen, be deemed to be the mere vengeance of party ſpirit, the unmanly gratification of political hatred—But my opinions of this man have ever, even from the commencement of his extraordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, been the ſame; and are now, as they always have been, honeſt, conſiſtent, and conſcientious—My political character depends not in the ſlighteſt degree, upon his recommendation or his cenſure—I have had both; I have regarded neither—Doubtleſs his dark and virulent ſpirit prepares ſome attack, which his inſufferable arrogance informs him will be formidable and deſtructive to lawyers, court and jury, that ſhall dare <hi>to do him justice.</hi> For myſelf I declare, if the declaration be neceſſary, that there is not in the bounds of creation that thing ſo feeble or ſo vile that I ſhould hold it in greater contempt than the reſentment of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cobbett; and, I will anſwer that you will not be driven from your duty or your oaths, by a fear of being placed on his <hi>black list.</hi> He has indeed, the unquenchable and vindictive ſpirit of an inquiſitor, but wanting all power, it is harmleſs and contemptible—The ridiculous vanity of this man, and his ignorance of his <hi>true situation</hi> in this country and of the <hi>kind of value or use</hi> that has been put upon him, has lead him into an opinion that his voice is the voice of fate, either with regard to public meaſures and character, or to private reputation. This however is an error which it lies with the public to correct; and they will find their intereſt and their honor, deeply concerned in doing it ſpeedily and effectually. God forbid that my country ſhould have ſunk ſo low, that an oppoſition to ſuch a wretch as this, will be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unfriendly to our government. When tempeſts agitate the ocean to its foundation, and rock it in convulſions, numerous noxious animals are thrown up, which would otherwiſe never have ſeen the light; ſo in a troubled ſtate of things, wretches are caſt up from the very dregs and ſlime of the community, who, in more happy times, would have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and rotted in obſcurity.</p>
               <p>The attack made on Dr. Ruſh is of the moſt deadly and violent kind that malice could invent, or abandoned depravity execute—He is
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0012_100D3282B4CAB1B8"/>
accuſed of murder, or deſtroying the lives of his fellow citizens, in a time of dreadful calamity—It is then fair and neceſſary to enquire—</p>
               <p n="1">1. What was the conduct of Doctor Ruſh during that calamity—has it merited reproach or applauſe—If the former, the offence of W. C. is extenuated, though not juſtified; if the latter, it is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated beyond all example.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What inducement or motive had W. C. for this attack—If a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to inform the public mind on an intereſting ſubject, his offence is extenuated, but not juſtified—if private and political malice, it is aggravated.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ruſh's reputation is not confined to the narrow circle of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, nor his applauſe to the clamours of old women and nurſes. His fame has ſpread as extenſively as our commerce. He has added a freſh and a blooming laurel to the head of American genius—he has done much to reſcue the American name from obloquy and contempt, which ſome of the proud Philoſophers of Europe would caſt upon us, ranking us as inferior to themſelves in the order of beings. From the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and from the Weſt—from almoſt every part of Europe, he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived honors and compliments; and we are different from all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the face of the earth, if theſe honors reflect not ſome pride and ſome pleaſure into our breaſts.—This participation in the honors and fame of our countrymen is coeval with the exiſtence of the paſſions of men, and he that does not feel it muſt want a ſocial temper, and the true ſpirit of patriotiſm. Nor, has the private character and deportment of Dr. Ruſh forfeited that eſteem which his public ſervices and fame ſhould command. Where is the man whoſe diſpoſitions are more mild, whoſe temper is leſs virulent, whoſe affections, more warm and ſincere.—From my ſoul, I believe him to be among the moſt unoffending and moſt benevolent of mankind; ſo that in the wide range of creation you cannot find too beings more unlike each other than Dr. Benjamin Ruſh and William Cobbett—Even when, day after day, this vile ſource of falſhood and pollution, vomited forth the blackeſt venom of ſlander upon his name, he ſtood like a ſuffering martyr, and dipped not his pen in the gall of controverſy.—And yet it is known that Dr. Ruſh can write—his pen has often been drawn in the ſervice of his country, never to blacken the name of his neighbour or wound the feelings of innocence. He did not even wipe away by contradiction the filth with which he was covered; determined that the hands of his country alone ſhall either cleanſe him from theſe foul aſperſions, or ſink him deeper in diſgrace.</p>
               <p>When peſtilence and death, walking hand in hand, ſwept away the people of Athens with the beſom of deſtruction, the immortal Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates threw himſelf undaunted into the midſt of the danger, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the extremes of fatigue and diſtreſs to aſſiſt and deliver his periſhing fellow citizens. How like this was the conduct of Dr. Ruſh in the memorable and dreadful year 1793. He then ſtood foremoſt and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt alone to encounter and arreſt the ravages of death. Hundreds of our fellow citizens, ſinking under the unparalleled calamities of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and diſeaſe, ſought relief as well from the chriſtian charity and
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0013_100D3284EB0D2228"/>
benevolence of his heart as from the powerful application of his ſkill. If there be any who ſought his attention in vain; if there be any who were repelled with unfeeling inſolence or mortifying neglect, let them declare it. For thoſe who received from him the relief they ſought, we aſk them not to ſpeak, it is not the applauſe of men or the tears of the grateful that he requires. The voice of conſcience ſpeaks a louder tone of applauſe, which the approbation of his God will render eternal—but, gentlemen, let us not forget the days of difficulty and diſtreſs, they have returned and may again return and utter dreadful reproach to the ungrateful. This flouriſhing city, where health, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and pleaſure gave joy to every heart and ornamented every countenance, became at once ſilent as a wilderneſs, the ſolemn the joyleſs habitation of diſeaſe and death; no longer the noiſe of buſineſs was heard through our ſtreets, or the ſprightly notes of mirth, but the dull ſounds of the heavy hearſe, and the lamentations of the wretched ſtruck an uneaſy terror to the ſoul "making night heidous." The day and the night were now the ſame. The riſing ſun brought no comfort, no joy to the afflicted, nor night its uſual reſt; all was ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ruin and deſpair; commerce bent her ſails for happier ports; your warehouſes no longer received or diſtributed the wealth of nations; the temples of God were cloſed, and it was dangerous to meet together even to implore from divine mercy an iſſue to our ſufferings—WHERE THEN WAS DR. RUSH? Where was this man, and HOW WAS HE EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLOYED, who has been treated as a very cut throat, or a worthleſs and abandoned vagabond, who diſgraces the community which tolerates his exiſtence? Need I tell you where he was—God forbid that you ſhould have forgotten—ſeparated from a large and an amiable family, and expoſed daily to a ſeparation from them forever, he ſeemed at once to have forgotten the huſband, the father, and all thoſe tender ties and exquiſite ſenſibilities which form the happineſs of ſuch a man, and to have contemplated himſelf only as a citizen of Philadelphia. He ſeems to have loſt ſight of the duties he owes to his family, and to have been devoted to the more godlike duties he owes to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>Twice he found himſelf languiſhing on the bed of ſickneſs, and gaſping at the gates of death, diſtant from his family, and almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by every friend—Scarcely had he recovered ſtrength to move, when he reſumed his dangerous duties; and often did he totter into the infected chambers of the ſick, when he could not aſcend to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtopping to recover his exhauſted ſtrength.—It was for the poor and helpleſs too that he thus expoſed himſelf to deſtruction. The rich had generally fled—How like is this to the conduct of Hypocrates—I wiſh I could add how like Philadelphia to Athens. Athens heaped honors and wealth on her Phyſician and his poſterity; but contumely and defamation have been the reward of ours. What are the rewards that Dr. Ruſh is juſtly entitled to, ought not perhaps to be decided by his friends or enemies; but nearly all muſt agree that he has not deſerved the treatment he has received from William Cobbett. It has been ſtrangely ſuggeſted by ſome (for this ſuit has been a ſubject of pretty general converſation and concern) that Dr. Ruſh's character is
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0014_100D3288E4958E08"/>
too well known and eſtabliſhed to be injured by the attacks of Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett, who is not worth his ſerious attention, and therefore he ſhould recover no damages in this action. I am ſure I think as highly of Dr. Ruſh, as any of thoſe who would in this manner palliate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Cobbett, or weaken the claims of the plaintiff to redreſs. But, Gentlemen, there are few characters ſo pure and ſo impenetrable as to receive the conſtant, unceaſing attack of malicious ſlander, exerted in every poſſible form and to every poſſible point, without ſtain or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. Of a phyſician this is moſt emphatically nice. His reputation is a fabric delicate as air, the ſlighteſt guſt of popular prejudice or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price diſſipates it, even ſuſpicion deſtroys it; if he is diſtruſted he is ruined. This notion that the purity of the object attacked is to juſtify or leſſen the crime of the aſſailant, is quite novel in morals and in law. Is the virtue of the injured, to be the defence of the injurer? Should it not rather be the protection of the juſt? Have you a daughter of ſpotleſs virtue and diſcretion? Is it then no offence to proclaim her a proſtitute? are you unqueſtionably upright and honeſt? Is it therefore no offence to publiſh you a ſwindler and a thief, while the real proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and the convicted thief would be entitled to exemplary damages?—Why, gentlemen, doctrines of this ſort are ſo abſurd, ſo repugnant to every ſentiment of juſtice and propriety, that the honeſt heart ſhrinks from them as from its bane? Let us ſee to what they would lead us. To ſlander a man is ſimply no offence; to villify a man pre-eminently wiſe and uſeful, is ſomething better than merely an offence; and to blaſpheme the all pure and perfect God muſt be highly meritorious. But to return to Dr. Ruſh's ability to withſtand the blows that have been aimed at him: It is not gentlemen this ſingle paragraph or that one that carries with it the deadly weight, and brings the intended victim to the ground. It is a regular concerted ſyſtem of defamation, an uninterrupted and perſevering attack of calumny and ſcurrility, in every form which they can aſſume. Shmetimes it is made under ſome dark, myſterious paragraph, and ſometimes in the open language of denunciation. Now fear is alarmed with a bold aſſurance of danger, and now ridicule is exacted by the point of a jeſt. Thus a net is thrown out for every weakneſs, paſſion or prejudice that is afloat in the community, and few eſcape the entanglement. This, gentlemen, is what ſcribblers call, <hi>writing a man down,</hi> and is a moſt abominable ſpecies of aſſaſſination.</p>
               <p>Beſides, although Dr. Ruſh's actual loſs from the defendant's conduct muſt neceſſarily have been very important; yet it is not the only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the caſe that calls for heavy damages. The utility of theſe actions is not merely to reimburſe the pecuniary injury a man may have ſuſtained; to <hi>pay</hi> for his character, which can have no price, but to correct vice, and give countenance to virtue; to confine the licentious within proper bounds; and give the worthy and good citizen a ſafe and reſpectable ſtation; to preſerve the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> of ſociety—The ſecond queſtion then ariſes:—</p>
               <p>From what motive or inducement has William Cobbett made his flagitious attack—was it a deſire to inform the public mind?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0015_100D328B8078BE28"/>
The nature of the publications ſhew this was not the caſe. They do not conſiſt of any examination of the ſyſtem and principles of Dr. Ruſh's practice, but merely of violent and low perſonal abuſe.</p>
               <p>But, gentlemen, although the entire want of every thing like a juſt cauſe of attack on Dr. Ruſh would juſtify us and you in aſcribing a baſe one to it, yet we ſhall not rely even on this legal and reaſonable preſumption. We ſhall be able, by the light of living teſtimony to trace the low malice of the defendant to its true ſource. We ſhall trace it to perſonal hartred, grounded on political prejudice. You may remember, that ſome time paſt, an eulogium was delivered, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and direction of the Philoſophical Society, on the late David Rittenhouſe; that this eulogium was delivered by Dr. Ruſh. Here, then originated the firſt excitement of reſentment in the mind of Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett againſt Dr. Ruſh. We ſhall ſhew you, as I am inſtructed, that, from that moment he determined on the attack. Long he waited for an opportunity to gratify this groveling reſentment, and diſcharge the venom that rankled in his heart.</p>
               <p>From the teſtimony of a reſpectable witneſs we ſhall alſo ſhew you that the defendant did not himſelf pretend that his attack on Dr. Ruſh was commenced with a view to give uſeful information to the public on an intereſting queſtion, to correct any errors in Dr. Ruſh's ſyſtem or treatment of his patients, or diſpenſe any public benefit whatever; but that he avowed to be <hi>personal against the Dr.</hi> and <hi>not against his system,</hi> that he avowed his ignorance whether the ſyſtem was right or wrong, and declared he ſhould have ſaid nothing about it, had any other man than Dr. Ruſh brought it forward. Where, then, can be the defence, were the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, where the apology for the infamous ſlanders he has heaped upon a worthy and honor able citizen? Does he not ſtand the moſt barbarous, the moſt wanton, the moſt impudent defamer that has ever exiſted?</p>
               <p>Slander is a headlong torrent that ruſhes over the land—like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty water rolling from the mountain's top, it ſpreads and ſtrengthens as it goes—the palace and the cottage are involved in its common ruin—nothing is ſo high that it cannot reach it, or ſo mean that it will not deſcend to it—let not the great promiſe themſelves ſecurity in the unblemiſhed dignity of their characters, nor the humble expect ſafety in their obſcurity—like death it comes to every man's door. What is there ſo pure, or what ſo ſacred that it has eſcaped this cormorant of defamation. From the higheſt magiſtrate to the meaneſt vagabond no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been ſecure; all men and all nations have been called with an equal tone of authority to the bar of his reproach, and every law, liberty and inſtitution has undergone his <hi>modest</hi> animadverſions. He has aſſumed a haughty and tyranical juriſdiction over every thing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or private; political or domeſtic; religious or moral, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the United States, but in every quarter of the globe. His arrogant vanity is as diſguſting as his crimes are deteſtable. William Cobbett is indeed a phenomenon even in the courts of defamation.</p>
               <p>He may look back on the endleſs liſt of his predeceſſors in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of ſcandal who have, at different times, infeſted ſociety, and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, he will find many ſuperior in <hi>talents, learning</hi> and <hi>wit,</hi> he will diſcover few equal in <hi>boldness</hi> and <hi>scurrility.</hi> His opinion is the <hi>great law</hi> from whence there muſt be no appeal; his aſſertion, the <hi>high au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0016_100D328D497059F0"/>
from whence there muſt be no enquiry. Deſpotic dogma uſurps the place of juſt knowledge, and the moſt loathſome vulgarity is offered as a ſubſtitute for wit. The eye of decency can ſeldom read his pages without offence, and virtue turns from them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and diſguſt. Is there a ſpecies of editorial pollution that has not blackened them? If there be, it is becauſe it has eſcaped the laborious induſtry, and acuteneſs of this <hi>strange man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is, gentlemen, no ſubject of political enquiry that has excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more anxiety among the people of every free country; there are few ſubjects that have employed more able pens, or received more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſcuſſions in every poſſible form of argument than the <hi>Liberty of the Press</hi>—and yet perhaps, there is no ſubject now more remote from <hi>a general understanding</hi> or ſettled opinion. It is ſo difficult to draw the juſt and ſafe line between the proper uſe and the inſufferable abuſe of this liberty; ſo difficult to fix its legal or its reaſonable bound; to ſay "thus far ſhalt thou go and no farther;" to ſay, here flow the wholeſome waters of Liberty, and there begins the poiſoned torrent of Licentiouſneſs; that all that has been ſaid, and I fear all that will ever be ſaid, on the ſubject, has but little effect to produce an unity of ſentiment, or eſtabliſh the point ſought after. Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be offered for the univerſal uncertainty and diſagreement on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>The diſcuſſion is conducted, the inferences are drawn, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is formed more by the paſſions and particular intereſts, than by the juſt reaſon of the ſeveral advocates and enquirers. While this ſhall continue to be the caſe, and while the paſſions and intereſts of men ſhall continue to drive them to different wiſhes and different objects, no coalition can be hoped for on this ſubject. But, gentlemen, this mighty uproar about the liberty of the preſs, and all the <hi>violence,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation and invective that it has excited, touch not the caſe of <hi>private slander.</hi> By a common principle of ſelf preſervation, by a common principle of unqueſtionable juſtice, by a common appreciation of the value of character, and by the dictates of honeſty and ſound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, all men have agreed that this admits of no defence. No writer, no declaimer, however mad with popular enthuſiaſm, has yet been wild and abſurd enough to claim or defend a right of wanton abuſe of his neighbors character. The diſpute has been how far, and in what manner, public men in their public capacities, and public meaſures in their public tendency, are to be inveſtigated and reproached at the bar of the public, through the medium of the preſs. But no diſpute has ever been had upon the ſanctity of private reputation and happineſs.—No queſtion has aroſe, whether a vindictive enemy may, with wanton falſehood and ungovernable rage, attack, through the preſs, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the object of his hate; may diſtort truth and invent falſhood, may ſet every engine of malice, ingenuity and ridicule to work to render him contemptible and deteſted; to ſcatter miſery through an unoffending and amiable family, and bring them down from a fair ſtation in ſociety to contumely, wretchedneſs and want. Yet ſuch have been the views and wiſhes of William Cobbett in this caſe, and
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0017_100D328FE1B7E988"/>
to accompliſh them none of his vaſt reſources in this way have been unemployed.</p>
               <p>I profeſs myſelf, gentlemen, a zealous and devoted friend to the <hi>true liberty of the Press.</hi> I view it as a lofty citadel from whence the people overlook the conduct of their governors; encourage, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and reward the virtuous, and cruſh the daring effects of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious oppreſſion or unprincipled deſigns. The wicked ſtand appalled before it, and the good flouriſh and rejoice. But, permit me to ſay that the ſafety of this citadel in this country at leaſt, is more endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by the treachery, malignity and arrogance of pretended friends, than from the violence of open foes. Such friends, poſſeſſing themſelves of this important ſtation, and protected under its ſacred walls, uſe this high privilege for the moſt abandoned purpoſes. That which was intended for the public good, is the proſtituted inſtrument of private malice—that which was erected for the ſalvation of a people, becomes the foul avenger of a villain's wrath. That thunder which ſtood ready to aſſert violated rights, and protect the liberties of millions, is pointed with deadly vengeance againſt the domeſtic happineſs of ſome virtuous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the private peace of ſome deſerving citizens. Nay, againſt the very incloſures of ſocial order and harmony and the ramparts of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and morality? Is this the Liberty of the Preſs? Are theſe the ends for which it was inſtituted and preſerved? You muſt not, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, be made to believe that the Liberty of the Preſs is attacked or endangered, whenever a ſcurrilous printer is proſecuted and brought to juſtice for ſome malicious and profligate attack upon an unoffending neighbor. Theſe are truly the only means of preſerving it pure, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable and undefiled. By theſe means only will it continue to be a bleſſing—to be a terror to evil doers, and a praiſe and protection to thoſe that do well. Let not the fair fabric be defiled; and by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the baſe engine of malignant perſecution, become the juſt object of univerſal deteſtation. Preſerve it in its exquiſite beauty; its elegant proportions, and its impenetrable ſtrength; and let not its foundations be ſapped by treacherous guardians, till its high walls totter and fall. Theſe high toned and pretended ſons of Liberty, who bawl inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Rights of the Preſs, while they blacken it with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable crimes; who tell you it is ſacred, while they are plunging it in diſgrace; who under its name and ſanction practice the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned licentiouſneſs, and invade our moſt important and valuable rights, muſt be laid low, or they will work a fatal ruin to the liberty they abuſe; pretending to be its friends, they are its moſt deadly foes; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to protect, they inevitably deſtroy it. To preſerve the Liberty of the Preſs from ruin and contempt it is neceſſary to bring down theſe wretched impoſtors. While frequent proſecutions againſt the Preſs, are ſome times the refuge of tyranny ſhrinking from inveſtigation, it muſt be remembered, they may alſo be the ſymptoms of approaching extreme depravity and licentiouſneſs among a people. When the latter is the caſe, the evil is to be corrected by expoſing every atrocious offender, to ſevere and exemplary puniſhment, and not by ſhielding him under the Liberty of the Preſs. To make defamation dangerous and deteſtable, is the only mode of preſerving the preſs from deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0018_100D32941514ED48"/>
Let this liberty and defamation never be claſſed together! Ask me, what are the evidences of the decay of religion and morals among a people, of the approaching diſregard of every ſocial law and duty, of the entire proſtration of truth, honor and honeſty, of the tottering ſtate of government, of the burſting of the ſocial compact and of the conſequent ſcenes of blood-ſhed, revolutions and warring chaos, and I will tell you, it is a boundleſs multiplication of licentious libels, a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic encouragement of malicious defamation, and unpuniſhed ravage upon reputation.</p>
               <p>When good character loſes its value and protection in ſociety, when it is fallen into ridicule and contempt, why ſhould any man labor to obtain it? It is <hi>excess</hi> that is the great deſtroyer of all things: human exceſs of health ſometimes ſhatters the human frame, and burſts the ſtrong ligaments of life. Exceſs of deſpotiſm has humbled the moſt powerful monarchs; and exceſs of liberty has ſubverted the firmeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics. Seldom has a tyranny been overthrown by the mere ſpirit of liberty among the people, unleſs firſt rouſed, aſſiſted and goaded to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the inſolent and inſufferable oppreſſion of overgrown power, and never has the freedom of a republic been deſtroyed by the bare ſtrength of the arm of the uſurper, unleſs favored by thoſe diſorders, diſtractions and conſequent weakneſs and diſunion, which the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and licentiouſneſs of liberty never fail to produce. Permit me, gentlemen, to make a few more obſervations on this liberty of the preſs. Is not this at once abſurd and inſulting to an intolerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree? a printer will ſpend months and years in unprovoked, unceaſing exertions to deſtroy the character and fortune of a fellow-citizen, to bring him into public hatred and contempt, to overturn every fair proſpect in life, and reduce him and his family to poverty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; but <hi>this</hi> is not <hi>persecution;</hi> it is <hi>liberty, the sacred liberty of the press.</hi> If the oppreſſed individual ſeeks redreſs for his inſufferable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and endeavors to avert the threatening ruin; if he calls upon his ſlanderer in the moſt decent and dignified manner to ſupport his charges; if conſcious of innocence, and martyrs under injuries, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines even to put his character in iſſue againſt his vile and lurking defamer; this indeed is <hi>persecution,</hi> the whole country is alarmed and inflamed; the liberty of the preſs is attacked; the great palladium of our rights, the ſacred and unalienable pledge of freedom is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with immediate deſtruction; and the poor innocent, unoffending printer, loudly demands univerſal ſympathy, and public protection from <hi>persecution.</hi> Can we liſten a moment to ſuch impudent abſurdity and nonſenſe, to ſuch a horrid perverſion of the eternal dictates of truth and juſtice? If Dr. Ruſh is guilty of perſecution in applying to the tribunal of his country for the juſtification of his character, and the redreſs of his wrongs; if he is guilty of perſecution when he calls his aſſaſſin to open, fair and dignified ground, to the courts of juſtice of his country, making the great iſſue between them TRUTH, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to ſtand or fall, to be juſtified or diſgraced by this infallible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter; when he puts this iſſue on trial before a jury of his fellow-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, juſt and impartial—I ſay, if this is <hi>persecution,</hi> what term, what language is vile, is baſe, is indignant enough to expreſs a juſt ſentiment
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0019_100D3296B11D5D40"/>
of the conduct of a printer who attacks his neighbor with deadly weapons, condemns and deſtroys him, unheard, undefended; who, without remorſe, will plant thorns in the hearts of unoffending chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and a tender wife, and tear down, with ruthleſs hands, the peace and proſpects of an extenſive, reſpectable and amiable family.</p>
               <p>It is equally aſtoniſhing and abſurd in this man, ſo loudly and ſo frequently to aſſert, that the American preſs is the moſt tame, humble and abject in the world, while his own daily publications, and thoſe of his competitor, the AURORA, give ſo flat a contradiction to the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; while, from thoſe preſſes there inceſſantly iſſues a peſtilential deadly vapor of the moſt low and vile defamation; and theſe things are not only winked at by the law, but too much applauded by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.—But the preſs of Great Britain, he ſays, is more free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhackled. If it be ſo, ſo much the greater the curſe. But the fact is not ſo. Their reſtraints on this moſt abominable ſpecies of licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are wholeſome and ſevere. I ſay, it is falſe, that the juſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable liberty of the preſs is more cheriſhed or protected in England, or any where elſe, than here. I ſay this to defend the conſtitution and laws of my country from the groundleſs aſſertion. We know what the conſtitutional liberty of the preſs is here, and do not our books inform us what it is in England? Is not page after page and volume after volume loaded with private actions and public proſecutions for libels and ſlanders? Do not we ſee the moſt exemplary puniſhments inflicted for them, and very properly too: and are not the rights of reputation a ſpecial object of protection with Engliſh law. Is not defamation reſiſted and depreſſed, as a moſt dangerous foe to the order and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of ſociety, tending to the introduction of the moſt enormous crimes, the fatal exceſſes of revenge. Indeed, does not Mr. Cobbett himſelf applaud the ſeverity and vigilance of the Engliſh courts of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence in puniſhing the publiſher of Paine's infamous libel on religion and morality; and in the ſame book boaſt of the licentious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which printers enjoy in England—Do we not know that men have there expiated on the pillory, expoſed to the ferocity and inſult of a mob, the offence of libelling; and moſt juſtly and deſervedly too: Have we not ſeen a member of the Houſe of Commons, driven from his ſeat and not only ſo, but declared ever after ineligible for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of libelling. And I rejoice that he was ſo. To diſcountenance and puniſh even to exceſs, indecent obſcene and defamatory publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is the beſt proof of the virtue and purity of a people, and of the energy and ſtability of their government.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not, Gentlemen, detain you much longer! I feel that I have already treſpaſſed too much on your patience. But ſuffer me to turn your attention for a moment to the ſituation of the plaintiff in this cauſe. He has a tender and affectionate wife, who fully participates in all his misfortunes, injuries, and mortifications. The blow that pierces his character and happineſs, opens a deep wound in her heart, tearing with remorſeleſs rage all the fine fibres and delicate ſympathies of conjugal love. Have theſe no value, that they ſhall be the wanton ſport of baſe malignity? He has an amiable and valuable young fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0020_100D32985BE58A60"/>
juſt riſing into that age of nice feeling and generous ſenſibility, when the reputation of a parent, they have ever deemed immaculate (if this be weakneſs, where is the virtuous child that is not weak?) is peculiarly dear and intereſting! and when every attempt to blacken or degrade it, corrodes their feelings with poiſonous rancor, ſhocks with new horror, and excites a boundleſs indignation. Are theſe things of no importance, that they ſhall be done with impunity? What a ſcene for a huſband and a father? By what crimes has he merited theſe things? But manlier paſſions ſwell, agitate and enflame the breaſts of his ſons.—They burn, they burſt with indignation, rage, revenge, drive them headlong to deſperate deeds, accumulating woe on woe. With difficulty the prudential advice, the parental command of the father reſtrain their fury—With difficulty they are prevented from taking immediate vengeance on their cruel oppreſſor—Be patient my children, ſaid he, I am deeply injured, but the laws of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try offer me juſtice, and point out the road to redreſs. It is tardy, but it is certain and ample. Delay may be painful to you, but the duties of a good citizen require it. This ſuit then, Gentlemen, and the hope of the juſtice that you will adminiſter, may have been the guardian angels of the defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conclude</hi>—Volumes need not be unfolded to inform you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, what ſlander is. It is unneceſſary to diſgorge our libraries upon you to ſhew what forms of words have or have not been deemed action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by other courts. Aſk the honeſty of your own hearts, conſult the light of your own underſtandings, and let it be anſwered whether in a ſtate of civilized ſociety, where the actions of men are amenable to government and to law; where protection is pledged to the unoffend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and redreſs to the injured, an outrageous member of that ſociety, in the mere ſport of wanton wickedneſs, may attack with malignant and unprovoked virulence, the peace of another; may deſtroy that good reputation, which the unceaſing merit of many years, and the labors of countleſs hours of toil, which, indeed, a whole life ſpent in public ſervice and unblemiſhed private virtue, had accumulated; may diffuſe mortification and pain through an amiable family; may ſnatch from the father the bread with which he would feed his children; may be guilty of theſe enormities, may purſue and glory in them, and owe no redreſs to the bleeding victim of his malice, no expiation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted juſtice of the country—The honeſty of your hearts will ſwell with virtuous indignation againſt a wretch ſo l<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t and vile; the light of your underſtanding will readily inform you, that the government and law where ſuch things are tolerated, muſt very ſoon fall into me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited contempt; that the ſociety where they prevail, hangs but looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, and muſt ſpeedily diſſolve into anarchy and miſery. If the injured ſeek in vain, for redreſs; if the promiſed protection to our lives, property and reputation, is but a dead letter, a cruel jeſt; if the triumphant deſpoiler is to go laughing from your courts, and the prayer of the injured be rejected, what is the inevitable conſequence? An immediate, nay, a juſtifiable reſort to private vengeance for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate wrongs; an immediate and a neceſſary introduction of murder and aſſaſſination. I feel and you feel that no man has a right from
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0021_100D329AC4961280"/>
God, from Nature, or from Law, to injure us without juſt retribution. I diſcover that that retribution is not to be expected from the juſtice of my country; that he that injuries is borne off in triumph, and he that complains is laughed to ſcorn.</p>
               <p>The alternative is obvious and inevitable. To myſelf and my own exertions I muſt apply for that juſtice which my country idly promiſes and ſhamefully denies. If ſuch damages are not given, then, in this caſe, as will check ſuch offences, as will convince your fellow-citizens, that this is the place where juſtice is fully adminiſtered, and the injured ſatisfied, you take upon yourſelves all the dreadful conſequences that may follow. Will I give credit to my government; will I call my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf protected by it, becauſe I can recover a debt of 20 ſhillings by its authority, or obtain poſſeſſion of an acre of land, while I am denied the peaceable purſuit of an honorable and uſeful profeſſion, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of an honeſt and well-earned reputation; while the feelings of myſelf and my family are given up as a ſacrifice to wanton and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant defamation. Let me call upon you, then, gentlemen, by the juſt heavens, to conſider this as no common caſe. Let me call upon you to feel yourſelves entruſted with one of the moſt important deciſions that has ever yet been ſubmitted to any court in any country. By your deciſion we ſtand or fall. By your deciſion is every man to know on what tenure be holds his character and happineſs.

               <p>WAS then called, who depoſed upon his oath, that about the middle of April, 1798, while he reſided at the Marine Hoſpital, Mr. Cobbett came down to the Hoſpital with a Capt. Young Huſbands, who came to ſee a man that was landed from on board his ſhip, with a chronical diſeaſe.

about Dr. Ruſh's diſpute with Cobbett, the defendant roſe upon his feet, and with much warmth ſaid <hi>"Damn him, he had better withdraw his cause,"</hi> the witneſs believed clinching his fiſt, and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much agitated. He continued—<hi>"or I will persecute him while living, and his memory after his death."</hi> On which the witneſs told the defendant he was very wrong in his attacks upon Dr. Ruſh's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treatment, for he (Dr. Meaſe) was a living witneſs of its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and in his practice he had found it, under Providence, the means of ſaving hundreds, and he believed thouſands had been ſaved by the mode of treatment recommended by Dr. Ruſh.</p>

The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant anſwered no, but he had read it. I aſked him how he liked it? He anſwered that the doctor had better have confined himſelf to medicine, and have let politics alone. I aſked him what diſpleaſed him in it? On which he went up ſtairs and brought down the book, ſhowing me the paſſage he diſliked, but I cannot now recollect what it was.

               <head>DR. COX, was ſworn.</head>
               <p>He depoſed that on the 2d of October, 1797, a gentleman who had juſt arrived from the Weſt Indies called upon him, and after ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation told him he was ſoon going to ſail for England; but wiſhed before he went, to ſee Peter Porcupine, (the defendant) who had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf ſo celebrated. He aſked the witneſs to inform him where he lived; upon which he, (the witneſs) accompanied him to his houſe, having occaſionally been in the habit of ſtepping into his ſhop.—After ſome general converſation had paſſed, the witneſs expreſſed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant his diſapprobation of his publications reſpecting the uſe of the lancet, and reſpecting Dr. Ruſh in particular, as this remedy had been recommended by him in certain caſes.—He replied to my obſervation, ſaid the witneſs, that his writing could be of very little conſequence, or have no effect upon the public mind; I replied that I thought it was impoſſible he ſhould imagine what he ſaid, for he muſt know that all he wrote muſt have a very conſiderable effect, particularly at the time the mind of the public was ſo diſtracted. He returned the ſame reply adding that as he was not a phyſician, people would naturally ſuppoſe that he knew nothing of the ſubject. I obſerved to him then, that the effect was certainly produced; he replied that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he ſhould ever have ſaid ſo much on bleeding or mercurials, if Dr. Ruſh had not been the author of it.</p>
               <p>An article entitled THE POTENT QUACK, was then read in evidence of the deſign, and perſiſtence of the defendant, from <hi>Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines Gazette,</hi> of October 5, 1797, which he introduces in theſe words:</p>
               <p>[<hi>The following are Mr. Fenno, junior's remarks on Dr. Rush's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Brown, announcing that he had entered actions against Fenno and me.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Here follows the letter from Fenno's paper.</p>
               <p>After which the defendant introduces his remarks in theſe words:</p>
               <p>[<hi>I defy the Grand Empiric, aided by all his legion of subaltern quacks, to compose a paragraph like this that closes young Fenno's remarks.</hi>—<hi>These are cutting truths for the Doctor.</hi>—<hi>They leave the mark.</hi>]</p>
               <p>The words referred to in the latter part of Fenno's remarks are as follow:</p>
               <p>"The fact is, and I have before glanced at it, that a loved ſcheme of the Doctor's ambition met a rough blow in 1793, and in 1797 a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, which threatens in progreſs to caſt the ſcheme and its author into the ſhades of obſcurity.

               <p>A letter inſerted in Porcupine's Gazette of October 6, 1797, was alſo read in evidence which related a cure of the Yellow Fever by a ſoldier's accidental immerſion in Tar. The editor, William Cobbett, makes the following inferrence:</p>

               <head>MR. RAWLE Addreſſed the Jury to the following effect:</head>

                  <salute>With submission to your Honors,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I ſtand up, Gentlemen of the Jury, much more impreſſed with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty on account of the extraordinary and unuſual manner with which the gentleman who preceded me has thought proper to open his cauſe, than of any danger in which my client ſtands from the accuſations on which this proſecution is grounded.</p>
               <p>It has not fallen to my lot, ſince I have had the honour of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the character of an advocate, or ſince I began my endeavors to obtain a knowledge of the law, to hear ſuch ſerious animadverſions made, or ſuch ſtrong ſtigma uſed on the character of any man, as that gentleman has uſed in reference to my client, the defendant. I could not help being ſtruck with the compariſon of that addreſs and the publications which it was meant to implicate.—In that compariſon I declare I can perceive none which deals in ſo ſtrong epithets—none bordering ſo much on abuſe, as thoſe are with which the gentleman
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0025_100D32A61F02E760"/>
has amuſed you. If it were poſſible to commit this opening addreſs to paper, there would be no difficulty in diſcriminating which was moſt deſerving the appellation of <hi>slander.</hi>—Gentlemen, if you believe the declarations of my opponent, you muſt be brought to believe William Cobbett to be the moſt <hi>insignificant</hi> and <hi>worthless reptile in creation,</hi> and that under the ſhape of a man, he has ſtalked abroad <hi>a very monster</hi>—that for him, no juſtice ought to be had—that he is to be expunged from all ranks of ſociety, that he is to remain an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mark for hatred, and courts of Juſtice are never to conſider him as even the object of mercy!—Mercy, that which we all claim, that which we think we are all entitled to, ſeems not to be his due! Gentlemen, even your opinions and your paſſions too have been aſſaulted, and called forth in a manner, which to me, has hitherto been perfectly unknown. This human monſter—this moſt unheard of being—every thing that is entitled to the terms of <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>base,</hi> has been repreſented as the deſtroyer of the public peace and happineſs; as the diſturber of the harmony of ſociety.</p>
               <p>But permit me to ſay, that this is not the way to appeal to the juſtice of a Jury. Juſtice is what even <hi>this man</hi> has a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you, baſe as he has been made to appear. You have a right to ſtand indifferent to the common received, or repreſented ſtate of any man's character, who ſhall be brought before you. You are to poſſeſs no prejudices no opinions—no prepoſſeſſions. I truſt juſtice will be your only impreſſion in the preſent caſe. But although every effort has been uſed to endeavor to excite your prepoſſeſſion againſt the defendant, every other ſenſation that that of ſtrict equity, ought to be left at the door, the moment you enter this court.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, you have heard the Gentleman amuſing himſelf, and no doubt, agreeably entertaining his audience with repreſenting the <hi>highly superior</hi> character of the Plaintiff;—he is ſuperior to men in general—nay any man—he is an angel from God, clothed with every virtue—with every qualification, while Mr. Cobbett is nothing but a daemon from the infernal regions. With you it is not left to judge of the diſtinction, but to you they ſtand on equal grounds.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ruſh ſtands before you as a reſpectable citizen, who has done much to increaſe the good of ſociety; but permit me ſay, <hi>society have rewarded him for it.</hi> This is his happineſs, and I am not inclined to ſay it is not his deſert. While we are entertained with ſuch a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affecting picture of the calamity which has diſtreſſed our city, and the general diſtreſs experienced thereon, we are told that this good angel went from door to door, communicating his aſſiſtance freely, but no doubt, every man who ſo expoſed himſelf, whatever general good he might adminiſter, received an adequate compenſation. If he has bravely faced death, he has met the lot of his profeſſion. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſailor, who has ſhipped himſelf on board a veſſel of war, might, in the hands of my eloquent opponent, be repreſented as a man who has faced the cannon ball, inured himſelf to the dangers and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of the boiſterous ocean, and met danger at every avenue of his calling; but what would his oratory amount to more, than that others did ſo, and it was their profeſſion. Dr. Ruſh ought to have every
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0026_100D32A9CE028088"/>
merit which he deſerves: but let it not be forgotten that William Cobbett ought to have every merit <hi>he</hi> deſerves, and every privilege to which he is entitled—let him have every cenſure he deſerves, and yet, I repeat, both ſtand upon equal ground before you. Cobbett puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the iſſue, and you are to decide according to evidence, and thus only.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, to the declaration filed, we have pleaded not guilty. We are charged with having <hi>maliciously</hi> written ſuch and ſuch things, in order to deſtroy the good name that Dr. Ruſh has heretofore borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his fellow-citizens. We deny the malicious part of the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to obtain our right, we put ourſelves upon a jury of our country, and unleſs it can be proved that the publications laid to our charge are of the nature deſignated, to wit, malicious, we are entitled to your acquittal in the action.</p>
               <p>The malice of a libel is collected, in general, either from its neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſtruction, plainly apparent on the face of a publication, or from ſome circumſtances eaſily deducible from the nature of the caſe.</p>
               <p>We have heard, upon the preſent occaſion, the teſtimony of ſome medical gentlemen brought forward, alleging, that at periods ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to this proſecution being entered, the defendant uſed words, tending to ſhow that theſe publications proceeded from perſonal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. To me, the whole of the publications and charges appear to be free from perſonal, private or domeſtic malice. How could they iſſue from perſonal malevolence? I aſk whether it has been proved, in any caſe, that Cobbett has endeavored to intermeddle with the family con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Dr. Ruſh? or whether, on the other hand, the whole of the publications have not been ſo far juſtifiable, in as much as they treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only on a ſubject of public enquiry? Moſt true it is that every man has a property in his own reputation—moſt true it is that the law has ſpread about the reputation of every man all the aſſiſtance poſſible; but there is another thing <hi>demands</hi> your conſideration: he who exiſts in community, hath a property and intereſt equally valuable in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſafety and peace of that community. To every man, theſe are important conſiderations: every man is bound by them, and his own welfare is in them—every man is puniſhable for a neglect of them. It is of conſequence to a man, that in the ſociety he has ſelected for his reſidence, he ſhould ſee proſperity about him, otherwiſe he can have but little hope of proſecuting his own means for his own benefit. In order to procure this object, he will exhort all the citizens of the ſame ſyſtem, who enjoy a common cauſe with him, to adopt what is good, and leave what is evil. Where ſuch have been the efforts of a man, he is undoubtedly entitled to reſpect. This principle is conſiſtent with the conſtitution of Pennſylvania, Sect. 3. Art. 9. And there exiſts no law of the ſtate or general governments that reſtrains a full and free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the merits of any queſtion in which the public are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted. If in the courſe of this inveſtigation expreſſions are uſed, and obſervations made which may fall heavy on the concerns of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon about whom he is writing, it is ſufficient for the perſon accuſed, if he can ſhow that he has not been guilty of untruths, nor entered
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0027_100D32AC2197DE68"/>
into the family or moral connections of his accuſer; but that he has only thrown his mite into the public ſtock of information.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there are few offices in ſociety of more public import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than that of a phyſician, few on whom ſo much depends the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the community. A good, ſkilful, laborious, honeſt phyſician, is a very valuable member of ſociety. But, on the contrary, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful, avaricious, indolent phyſician deſerves, not only public diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, but, public contempt. Private compenſation, and public confidence is the ſure reward of the meritorious practitioner; but you have heard this man's character even exalted above humanity; ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to humanity indeed muſt he be, if in the whole of his <hi>extenſive practice</hi> he never committed ſome error; if he never for a moment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſome miſtaken principle, and perhaps tenaciouſly, not to ſay obſtinately adhered to it! Such inſtances in every profeſſion, in men the moſt celebrated we have known, and I preſume ſhall continue to know. If on the <hi>public</hi> labors of any man in ſociety, animadverſion is admiſſible, on which can it be ſo properly exerciſed as on the man in whoſe hands, in ſome ſenſe, is life and death? Who ſo fit an object on whom to exerciſe the liberty of the preſs? I ſincerely truſt we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall ſee the day when any public character, how eſpecial ſoever the qualifications of his head or heart, or how bad ſoever, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from enjoying the common advantages of his good charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſecure him from juſt odium for his reprehenſible conduct, and I truſt we never ſhall ſee the time when any man, however baſe his character may be, ſhould be denied that juſtice which our conſtitution and laws make the common right of all men.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Fever of 1793, it is well remembered, was truly ſerious and awful, a diſeaſe then almoſt unknown among us, ſo that the moſt wiſe was at a loſs how to act. Different modes of treatment, and different experiments were made, but notwithſtanding great numbers deſerted the city, and notwithſtanding the utmoſt exertions and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the Phyſicians, about one fourth of the people who remained died. Of the number who remained Dr. Ruſh was one. I need only appeal to your recollections how unlimited were the publications which ſucceeded that fever, ſo unaccountable and various were the attacks, and ſo difficult and various the modes of treatment, that it was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a juſtifiable ſubject of public diſcuſſion. To ſome of theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications I might appeal, and ſhew you how ſtrong, how acrimonious was the language, uſed even between the members of that learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The ſubject continued thus, for a long time a ſubject of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic controverſy, and much warmth was uſed. Finally, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of divine Providence, more than the united attempts of men, the diſorder diſappeared, and for four years we happily remained free from its dreadful ravages, conceiving ourſelves quite ſecure from its return. However it again made its appearance in 1797. What was a ſubject of ſo much public diſcuſſion in 1793, was reſumed in the ſubſequent attack, at that time others, beſides the unfortunate defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who, it appears to me, is ſufficiently paid for his temerity by the accuſations brought againſt him, others took the liberty to declare, as all mankind ought to encourage them to do, what their opinions were
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0028_100D32ADB4515750"/>
of the topic. At this period we find iſſue from the preſs of Mr. Cobbett what it has been thought proper to ground this proſecution on—not for aſſailing the private character of Dr. Ruſh; not tearing open his connections, nor meddling with his family concerns, but for diſcuſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a public queſtion, in ſuch a manner as others had thought proper to do before him, and were then doing. The topics of public diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were the free uſe of the lancet, and mercurial purges. And who ſo natural, ſo likely to be attacked as the perſon who was well known to be at the head of this ſyſtem of treatment, a ſyſtem peculiarly adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and recommended by Dr. Ruſh, and followed by his pupils. Hence the name of Dr. Ruſh, and the uſe of bleeding and Mercury in the Yellow Fever came into public notice at one period. We know that the two learned bodies in this city, who were incorporated for the purpoſe of eſtabliſhing public confidence, by an unanimity of ſyſtem, (I refer to the academy of medicine and the college of Phyſicians)—Thoſe two bodies eſtabliſhed different ſyſtems in the treatment of this diſeaſe. This certainly gave to Mr. Cobbett, allowing that he is a man entitled to the uſe of his faculty of reaſon, and the common pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege enjoyed in the United States, this ſurely gives to him the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of expreſſing his opinion, as applicable, not barely to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, but to the practice uſed: and what might encourage him the more, he thought that whatever he might advance, as appeared in the evidence, could do no injury, not being a medical man himſelf, and if he was wrong he ſhould only expoſe his ignorance, which he was willing to hazard, hoping however that he might eventually do good.</p>
               <p>Doctor Ruſh was at that time a very public character, and exerciſing an important public function: Mr. Cobbett was unqueſtionably exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing his conſtitutional right to do at that time, what others did, to examine his public tranſactions, in which he thought he was on the ſide of humanity.—Suppoſe we ſee an individual, or a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons running headlong towards a precipice, down which they muſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably fall, ſhall I be blamed if I ſay to them ſtop, liſten not to the man who adviſed you to take that road: I will give you ſolid advice, go the other way. They eſcape the danger, and I have done my duty. Gentlemen, however the conduct of Mr. Cobbett may appear in the ſubſequent part, it is plain that the ſyſtem eſtabliſhed by Dr. Ruſh, has not produced all the good effects he wiſhed.</p>
               <p>[Mr. Rawle here read a letter written in Auguſt 1798 from Drs. Phyſic and Cooper at the hoſpital, requeſting advice in caſes of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to which Dr. Ruſh wrote an anſwer acknowledging the uncertainty of <hi>any</hi> preciſe method of treatment in <hi>all</hi> caſes, and that bleeding and mercurials were not, in every ſtage, and every appearance of the fever, a proper mode of treatment. He concludes, acknowledging the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties thoſe Phyſicians had to meet, ſcarcely ever having an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of commencing their treatment until an advanced ſtate of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, much of the ſucceſs in which, depended on a particular <hi>hour</hi> of application. Some, he ſaid, "in 1797 he occaſionally loſt, even after the application of bleeding and mercurials.]—From which it appears that the new ſyſtem of treatment, was not the infalliable cure which
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0029_100D32AFEBAF4210"/>
was ſuppoſed. But whether this medicine was found to anſwer the Doctor's expectation, I know not, my object is to prove that there was more than one method of counteracting that diſeaſe, and that it was the buſineſs of thoſe who had the misfortune to be expoſed to the danger, to make their obſervations, with freedom on thoſe various modes, as much as experiment was the privilege of the practitioners. I take the principle of the Law to be, that your minds ſhould be well ſatisfied, either <hi>from an internal evidence of the publication, or from concomitant circumstances, that the writer had a malicious intent.</hi> This principle is well eſtabliſhed in the books: ſee Buller's Niſi Prius p. 8. Where it is plain that the <hi>git</hi> of the expreſſion muſt be MALICE, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute it a crime in the eye of the law. And again p. 110. ſame book "the words muſt be malicious, as well as falſe, to ſupport an action for ſlander." If it is juſtifiable to ſhow that words uſed with a ſincere and liberal intention, in order to prevent miſchief, is harmleſs, is not that man juſtifiable, who ſeeing a dangerous ſyſtem likely to predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, who prevents, as much as lies in his power, that ſyſtem being put into action? This I conſider as a very eſſential ground of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>We contend that Mr. Cobbett exerciſed a right given him by the laws and Conſtitution of this State; no law required him to publiſh, but he had liberty ſo to do, and he is far from deſerving that odium with which he is now ſtigmatized. That men's language, and modes of expreſſion will differ according to their talents and education, I preſume you will all allow. When I ſay this, I hope you will not conceive me to mean that the whole of this man's merit conſiſted in the ſcurrility with which he treated his opponent. Here I may juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiably apply the obſervation of Dr. Johnſon, that "thoſe who think profoundly will expreſs themſelves differently from the common accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation." This profundity of thought could not be ſuppoſed to be an attribute of my client; no doubt, he ſpoke from his momentary ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But for communicating theſe obſervations to the public, is the law to be appealed to in this ſolemn and expreſſive manner? Is the ſtrong arm of juſtice to be called up, becauſe the little forms of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are ſuppoſed to be attacked by an individual! No, ſuch is not the fixed principle of the law, nor of common juſtice. The law will be found to ſtate it as a principle, that in no inſtance where the party has gone wrong through the impulſe of paſſion—beyond the bounds of ſtrict decency and propriety, that for this cauſe alone, the plaintiff is to recover damages. Salkeld 693 ſays, that "to ſay a juſtice is a fool, an aſs, a blockhead, or a bufflehead, is not indictable, unleſs the words are in themſelves ſuch as ſhow an intention to deprive the party get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his livelihood." Theſe are rough expreſſions, but it appears not indictable.</p>
               <p>[Some diſtinction was here remarked by the court to exiſt between words that are "indictable," and words that are "actionable."]</p>
               <p>Mr. Rawle contended that unleſs the party could ſhow that he had ſuſtained ſome injury by the uſing of the words, no damages could be laid; but he obſerved that their opponents had not thought proper to prove any ſpecial damages, from which it muſt be deducted by a jury that none were ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0030_100D32B4872E0340"/>
In diſcuſſing a matter of public intereſt, the amount of damages, if the jury ſhould think proper to find for the plaintiff, muſt depend on the ſituation and ability of the perſon who undertook to diſcuſs it. Beſides, the powers of men's minds are not always alike. Truth is frequently attacked by ridicule, much leſs can we expect a public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to remain exempt. Pope ſays

               </p>
               <p>The enquiry always is in the caſe of ſcandal. "Is it a matter in which the intereſts of the nation are implicated?" If it is not; if it is a matter of public diſcuſſion, as in the preſent caſe, it has ever been conſidered as harmleſs, though perhaps poignant ridicule. We find nothing in the declaration but words which relate to the public prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and medical ſyſtem of Dr. Ruſh. We were told that proofs of the malicious deſign of our client would be produced; we have heard the evidence of three perſons brought here to prove the malice aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But neither of them has related an item whereupon to found that accuſation. A clear proof to me, and muſt be to you, Gentlemen, that no malicious deſign, a temper and diſpoſition abſolutely neceſſary to the conviction of the defendant—no malicious deſign did exiſt.</p>
               <p>The effort made to ſupport malice from the evidence of Dr. Dewees, reſpecting the eulogium on Dr. Rittenhouſe, to me, is very feeble; for, from the words of the witneſs and the concomitant circumſtances, it is clear the attack was to be of a <hi>political</hi> nature, on account of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical principles publicly delivered. Change it, and ſay it was to be againſt the man, it muſt be proved to have been carried into execution.</p>
               <p>Another gentleman relates a converſation with Mr. Cobbett in Oct. 1798, about the conſequences of his publications. Mr. Cobbett then declared that he did not think his writing could have any effect, and at laſt he declares that he ſhould not have attacked the practice of Dr. Ruſh, if the Doctor had not been the author of it. The true meaning of that expreſſion, it will be difficult for you to aſcertain: but if you underſtand it not fully, you are not to receive the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from it. Perhaps it was this: if it was an obſcure practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, a man of no note, it would not be worth my notice. But mark the difference. If a man, ſuch as the Doctor has been held up to you,—not only the firſt in America, but almoſt, if not quite, in the whole univerſe; ſuch a man inculcates principles, and draws others into the adoption of them: a new ſyſtem in the hands of ſuch a man merited Mr. Cobbett's attention, in his editorial capacity; and I think he was juſtifiable in thinking him a proper perſon for attack. Gentlemen, there muſt be ſomething more than mere ſuggeſtion; there muſt be ſomething to prove the viſcioſity of the writings; or you muſt give a verdict for the defendant.</p>
               <p>Our client is abſent, he has reſted his caſe with you to give your deciſion upon his rights of publication; we claim that right for him, a right which every free man is entitled to at your hands, and for him, I think we ſhall not claim of you in vain. The farther exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0031_100D32B619A6FC70"/>
into the publications and the evidences produced, I ſhall leave to my colleagues, who I have no doubt will be able to prove to you that no ſuch malice as is charged, is intended or is any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. I will only remind you of one apparent inconſiſtency in the reaſoning of our opponent; If the ſyſtem and practice of Dr. Ruſh has been ſo uſeful, ſo infallible, as you have been made to ſuppoſe, in order that you may give judgment for large damages, it is natural to ſuppoſe that the feeble efforts of Mr. Cobbett could not deſtroy his celebrity, or injure that ſyſtem, and therefore it could be but little or no offence for him to expreſs his opinion.</p>
               <p>With you I ſhall leave the weight of my arguments; we have no evidence to produce, but I truſt you will ſee the juſtice of our defence.</p>

               <p>THE queſtion in this caſe is not whether the plaintiff is a phyſician of eminence, a man of worth, a peaceable citizen, a good father, or a tender huſband,—was this the point to be diſcuſſed, we muſt ſhrink from the oppoſition, and allow the claim to be in his favor, nor is it whether our client has offended againſt decorum, and every principle of civility and good manners,—or it would be equally difficult to make out a defence. The queſtion is, whether, in theſe publications, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the declaration, which has been read, the defendant was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by a deſign to injure Dr. Ruſh in his perſonal character, or to injure him as a phyſician, or to run down and laugh out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a practice which he conſidered would have a miſchievous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. Gentlemen as you muſt be of one or the other of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, your verdict muſt be for the plaintiff or for the defendant: If from the whole of the teſtimony you ſhould be of opinion that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, in making theſe publications, was induced merely by a deſire to overthrow a ſyſtem of medicine which he thought miſchievous, you are bound to give him your verdict. And, why? Becauſe this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is brought for the <hi>malicious</hi> deſign with which it is ſaid he uſed thoſe expreſſions.</p>
               <p>What is malice?</p>
               <p>Malice in its preſent application muſt be an attempt and deſign to injure the plaintiff in his perſonal, or in his profeſſional character. When this ingredient is not made out, either from its appearance on the very face of the action, or by direct inference, the action of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot be ſupported. This is an obvious and incontrovertable fact. No man has a right to attack another in his profeſſional purſuits, ſo as to rob him of the fruits of his induſtrious efforts, but every man has a right to attack a ruinous ſyſtem, and whether a ſyſtem is ruinous or miſchievous, <hi>he</hi> who makes the attack, and <hi>he alone</hi> is to be the judge, becauſe if I lift my hand againſt a ſet of opinions or practices which I hold to be evil to ſociety, I muſt firſt ſuppoſe my liberties or privileges, or thoſe of ſociety to be in danger, before I ſhould exerciſe my freedom of opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0032_100D32B89F3EA458"/>
I will admit that if, in the combat of opinions or practices, I throw any unneceſſary perſonal reflections, and attack the individual holding thoſe opinions, if I go beyond his opinions, and abuſe his perſon; if I go beyond his perſon, and traduce his character, then indeed the pretence that I meant only to attack his opinions, would not avail me in a court of juſtice; it would be ſuppoſed merely a cloak, merely a fallacious excuſe, and therefore would fairly be actionable, and ſubject me to puniſhment. The queſtion, then, will recur whether William Cobbett meant to attack Dr. Ruſh's ſyſtem, or his perſonal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional character? If the latter ſhould appear to be his deſign, he ſurely has ſtepped beyond due bounds. The utmoſt latitude of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that I ſhall grant in this caſe is, that if attempts are made to bring a phyſician into general diſrepute, then the injured party may claim retribution from the laws of his country. Having gone thus far, let us enquire how far theſe ingredients exiſt in the preſent caſe. Whether there be, in the paragraphs upon which this action is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, any thing from which malice can be fairly and properly deducted, or whether the only deſign of the defendant was to overturn, if he could by argument, that part of the practice of Dr. Ruſh which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in "BLEEDING" and "PURGING" in the yellow fever.</p>
               <p>We will read the paragraphs, compare the evidences with them, and ſee whether this diſpoſition is contained in them.</p>
               <p>[Mr. H. here read the paragraph of September 19th, 1797.]</p>
               <p>Before I enter into the examination, I will admit that the ſame ſtudied language which well-bred men ought to uſe, is omitted, and that the ſame ſtile and decorum is not uſed which, if I were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat a public ſyſtem, I ſhould think it right to uſe.—But are we to wonder at it? Are we to wonder that writers, in a controverſy, in which they had excited ſo much acrimony, even among the members of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty themſelves, ſhould be led too far? Nay, have we not heard it ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly exemplified in the conduct of the Gentleman who opened this cauſe! Gentlemen in the Legiſlature do not always avoid this unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming practice of perſonal abuſe. But although that fact would not juſtify the man, ought we not to look with ſome little excuſe upon the author of a newſpaper? If this conſideration ought not to pardon the offence, it ought at leaſt to extenuate it.</p>
               <p>Laying aſide what is merely indecorus; what is merely harſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, let us enquire what is the ſubſtance and meaning, and the total amount of the charges.</p>
               <p>Having read the article entitled <hi>"Medical Puffing,"</hi> Mr. H. aſked if there was any thing like ſlander in that piece; if ſo, hardly a newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper which was printed in the United States, but might be made a ſubject of enquiry by a Jury.—I do not, reſumed Mr. H. juſtify the language; but what does it amount to? It calls an eminent phyſician a remorſeleſs bleeder. What is that? It is that he purſued bleeding too far. But have not ſome of the moſt reſpectable medical men ſaid that it is remorſeleſs and deſtructive? There are ſuch. The idea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed is nothing to you; whether bleeding in his practice, is puſhed too far, or whether it is not a ſubject of your enquiry; but whether this man meant more than to expoſe that ſyſtem which was extreme in his view
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0033_100D32BA96608018"/>
is a proper ſubject for your enquiry. Was it not wrong that a ruinous ſyſtem ſhould have been perſiſted in, when human life was ſo material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected? This was ſo conſidered by him, and he thought it his duty to expoſe it. I am well convinced that it was not only unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming language, but I believe it to be very untrue, but is it a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? No, it is merely unmeaning ribaldry. Suppoſe, I ſay, a man is in the habit of getting himſelf puffed in the paper: he may be laughed at, but could do nothing in it. He might get himſelf puffed, and yet be a very able phyſician.</p>
               <p>"Blood, blood, they cry more blood."</p>
               <p>To be ſure this is very hyperbolical, but ſtrip it of its exaggeration, and is it not true? Was it not common, during that period, for theſe ideas to be reiterated through the papers and pamphlets of the city day after day? <hi>The free use of the lancet, the free use of the lancet,</hi> was conſtantly repeated by the medical men in favor of that ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>As to calling a man a ſhameleſs ſilly puff, and in general, the letter of Dr. Tilton, wherein he is called a ſour wry-faced democrat, I do not know how it came to be introduced, or what it has to do with an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought by Dr. Ruſh! I have heard a very good character of Dr. Tilton, but if he is "a ſour wry-faced incorrigible democrat," I am ſorry for it. As to the epithet of "Maſter bleeder," I ſee no harm in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction; it is no ſlander, but an high eulogium, raiſing him to a pre-eminence, rather than giving any abuſe. The queſtion reſpecting mercurial purges is then introduced, "Is it good for Sans culottiſm, Doctor?" I wiſh it was, gentlemen, for if ſo, it would be a ready cure for a great number of perſons, who, I fear, are now utterly incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Comparing mercury to Sampſon, and ſpeaking of its ravages, Mr. Harper did not conceive it perſonally applicable to Dr. Ruſh, but to the ſyſtem, which was particularly pointed at in reference to the "Ruſhites."</p>
               <p>Not Dr. Ruſh but his partizans, which amounted to nothing. Is it ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſaid Mr. Harper, to ſay to a gentleman, when we contend in another place, (Congreſs Hall) that certain political opinions go to the ſubverſion of Government, or in other inſtances tend to rob the country, &amp;c. No, far otherwiſe, a great diſtinction is always held between a man, perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and his principles. Miſerable would be the times, were it not ſo, and much more miſerable would it be if we could not be permitted to call in queſtion the practice of a phyſician, without being ſubjected to an expenſive action for ſlander. The only meaning of theſe words is, that it is a miſtaken principle to attach to certain practice the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it has not, for that it has occaſioned the death of many, rather than recovered them from diſeaſe. If the words had been that Doctor Ruſh killed more than he cured, it would have been actionable on good grounds, but it is only vaguely the "Ruſhites," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The next paragraph is in 25 September, ſigned "a tavern keeper." Here we only find Dr. Ruſh's name mentioned as having publiſhed a book on the yellow fever, and his being a great patron of the art of blood-letting. This is known to all America and Europe, it has never been denied, but it is not ſlander. It might with propriety be called a piece highly ridiculing the practice of blood-letting: I believe it
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0034_100D32BCC3EEAEF0"/>
was ſo intended—but ſhall ſuch a piece of <hi>ridicule</hi> be made the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of an action of ſlander? If ſo, ſome of the moſt admired produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in every age ought to be conſidered as ſlanders. In every age ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule of this ſort has been reſorted to, and where it does not run into ſcandal it is approved. But I ſay this does not, and I know you will ſay by your verdict, that it does not run to that length.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harper then read the article inſerted September 26, 1797, which he contended contained nothing injurious to the reputation of Dr. Ruſh as a phyſician, nor as a man, nor would it tend in the leaſt to deprive him of a livelihood, one of which muſt be proved in order to ſubſtantiate the action. As to the terms "potent quack," and "me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical puffer"—the words are very indecent, but it is always a principle of obſervation that ſuch <hi>low, unmeaning ribaldry</hi> always recoils on its projector. Far be it from me to juſtify, or even extenuate ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but that it is no offence in a law view is eaſy to prove. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is the only puniſhment it can have.</p>
               <p>Next Mr. Harper took up the article of September 29, 1797, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face "A PUFF equal to Dr. Ruſh's." Here Mr. H. ſaid was a puff introduced the moſt ridiculous and abſurd which could be conceived, and he called it EQUAL to <hi>Dr. Rush's.</hi> Surely he ſaid it was EQUAL, and it could be no ſlander to ſay ſo. It was very indecorous to be ſure, to bring in the name of ſo reſpectable a character as Dr. Ruſh, when ſuch an extravagant piece was introduced, but it did not tend to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the man in his reputation and fame, and therefore could be no ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This Spilſbury had invented a remedy to cure impurities of the blood, but was it not a more perfect cure to let out that foul blood? Certainly ſo. The indecent epithet of <hi>master Sangrado</hi> he could not defend; it was very unbecoming to apply it to ſo reſpectable a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But ſuppoſe a man was called after in the ſtreet by this name, could he ſupport an action for ſlander upon it? No, actions of ſlander are not to be brought for <hi>abuse</hi> but <hi>injury.</hi>—This <hi>Sangrado</hi> is mentioned in a novel as a famous quack, who uſed to take blood and give water to his patients until he brought them to the grave.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harper again contended, that from the whole ſum of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it was clear that not the man, but the mode of practice, which he conſidered dangerous, was the object of attack. He then took up the article inſerted in Porcupine's Gazette, Oct. 5, 1797, extracted from Fenno's Gazette, ſubſequent to the action being entered, which he ſaid, the greater part of it, was only an extenuation, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſays, that none of the paragraphs made the foundation of the action, were meant more than to combat "an erroneous ſyſtem." This printer conſidered himſelf to be unjuſtly aſſailed by the action, and therefore it is no wonder if the ſubſequent publications are acrimonious; but is this a proof of his criminality in the firſt inſtance? Even thoſe ſubſequent publications go principally to the ſyſtem, and ſay very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle about the man himſelf. If the malice was intended at the time he uſhered the publications for which he was ſued, he would not have waited to diſplay it in the future ones.—Gentlemen, the ſubſequent publications cannot ſupport the action, as they took place ſince the action was commenced, and flow only from the reſentment natural to
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0035_100D32BFCD358BC8"/>
a man who conſidered himſelf unjuſtly proſecuted; they cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be called as a proof of the motive with which the firſt were written, except the malice had been plainly expreſſed in them, which is not the caſe.</p>
               <p>Verbal teſtimony is next produced: three gentlemen of reſpectabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for their age, appear in court, but I am ſorry the action could not be ſupported without reſorting to private converſations, perhaps uſed in confidence, and certainly without a view of its going farther than the ſpot where it was uſed. This particularly referred to the two firſt. But it may be laudable in the gentlemen to come and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer themſelves in ſupport of a man, their friend and patron, whom they conſider aſſailed. I will admit that the expreſſions uſed by the defendant, was proof of his vindictive ſpirit, and were very improper, but I aſk what influence it can have on the action now before you? This ſtrong reſentment was in conſequence of his being ſued by Dr. Ruſh. If it proves any thing, it is that the defendant was certain of the injuſtice of the action, he having, legally ſpeaking, done no harm, at which his mind revolted, and being very much agitated at the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſuit by Dr. Meaſe, the ebullition of his inflamed mind burſt forth into an unwarrantable expreſſion. Is this the mark of <hi>malice,</hi> ſettled, cool, deliberate malice? Malice ſpeaks leſs and does more, than is apparent in any part of the defendant's conduct. You may call him ill tempered, unamiable, harſh, &amp;c. if you pleaſe; in ſo doing you do him juſtice, but to call an haſty expreſſion, <hi>malice,</hi> is a perverſion of terms.</p>
               <p>The teſtimony of Dr. Dewees amounts to leſs than the laſt. The defendant was diſpleaſed at certain paſſages in an eulogium ſpoken by Dr. Ruſh, and he ſaid the Doctor had better have confined himſelf to medicine. This to be ſure was very impertinent, for he had nothing to do with it; but it was not criminal. What he meant by its being "too republican" does not appear. I have read it, and with pleaſure; but he or any man certainly had a right to find fault with it, if they diſliked it. He farther ſaid he would attack the Doctor about it. Does this mean that he would commence a vindictive attack upon the Doctor, and endeavor to wound him in his reputation or profeſſion? No, gentlemen, this is not to be inferred. It was a determination to attack the principle advanced, to expoſe it to ridicule, ſo that it ſhould not have the effect which it was intended to have. It could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly refer to any attack on his buſineſs, and therefore cannot ſtamp a malicious intent upon words uſed for another purpoſe ſo long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. It appears that Mr. Cobbett did afterwards employ Dr. Dewees in his family, and recommended him to ſome of his friends. I am very glad of it, I believe him to have merited that recommendation, but this is no proof that it was not to the ſyſtem, but the man that Cobbett aimed at, for although Dr. Dewees was employed by him in other caſes, he might not have done it, had the yellow fever came into his family, if he had, it would have changed the queſtion, and proved the ſcandal.</p>
               <p>The evidence of Dr. Cox goes only to prove the opinion of Cobbett that all he could ſay would do no harm, ſince the attack upon the
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0036_100D32C20D4D1EF0"/>
bleeding was well known not to have flowed from profeſſional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. This was paying homage to the character of Dr. Ruſh.—If a man of no note had introduced the ſyſtem, he would not have ſaid a word about it, but ſince a man of Dr. Ruſh's talents, had advocated it, it was an object worth attacking with all his might. But wherein is the coincidence between this teſtimony, and that related by Dr. Dewees? The circumſtance of the eulogium occurred in December, '96, or in January following, but the evidence of Dr. Coxe relates what did not occur until the September following, that if Dr. Ruſh had not been the promoter of this purging and bleeding ſyſtem, he ſhould not have thought it worth while to ſay much about it. There can be no relation or connection between the two, becauſe one refers to expreſſions which he denominated "too republican" for which he meant to attack him; but the other is wholly bent towards his ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of phyſic. It was the weight of authority, ſo great a man as Dr. Ruſh being at the head of that <hi>disapproved</hi> ſyſtem, which called forth, not his malice, but his animadverſions. It does appear to me that there was no appearance of the ingredient which the law calls malice, and which is neceſſary to vitiate his conduct, through the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the diſcuſſion, and that this man was not injured in his name, fame or reputation: in his name as a man in ſociety, or in his domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic connections; in his fame as a man of ſkill and profeſſion; or in his reputation as a Phyſician, and conſequently there is no ſlander to his character.</p>
               <p>We have heard much of the family of the plaintiff, and of the keen feelings of his reſpectable wife, of which not a doubt can be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. I ſhould never have thought it my duty to have hazarded my reſpectability by ſtanding here to advocate a man who ſhould ſlander ſo eminently uſeful a character as Dr. Ruſh, or his very reſpectable wife or family: far be it from me, I ſhould rather have conſigned him and his cauſe to the fate it would deſerve. My profeſſional name ſhould never have borne the blot ſuch conduct would juſtly attach to it. But this I conceive not to be the caſe. That my client has overſtepped the bounds of good manners and decorum, I have admitted, but that he had a right to run down what he believed to be a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous ſyſtem, I have contended for, and ſtill wiſh to impreſs upon your minds. His conduct muſt meet with ſtrong diſapprobation, but agreeable to the rules of law and juſtice he merits your verdict, becauſe neither a breach of good manners, nor harſh opprobrious epithets can be conſtrued to mean <hi>slander.</hi> How reprehenſible ſoever his conduct, if he has not ſlandered the good name, ſame or purſuits in life of Dr. Ruſh, I repeat that William Cobbett has a demand of juſtice at your hands, and that is to acquit him of the declaration.</p>

               <head>MR. MOSES LEVY. BY YOUR HONORS' LEAVE.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Gentlemen of the Jury,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE enquiry before us is of a nature to demand our moſt ſerious conſideration. From the attention which has been given to it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſcuſſion, by you and the Court, the utmoſt candor is evident, and a juſt concluſion certain. The ſuit you are now to conſider ſhould be perfectly open to your underſtanding; its nature ſhould be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome of the errors corrected which have too generally eſcaped from the counſel for the defendant, though, I preſume without inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This is not legally a ſpecial action for ſlander; it is true the action is to recover damages for grievous and unprovoked ſlander, but in its nature, this is an action for a libel. An action for <hi>slander</hi> and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a <hi>libel</hi> is differently underſtood in courts of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Words may irritate and rankle; they may even blaſt the character of a man upon whom they are ſpoken, but they periſh the moment they paſs out of the mouth of the ſpeaker, and the ſhortneſs of their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leſſens their importance. But what is committed to paper,—what is <hi>printed,</hi> has a laſting impreſſion, and is capable of much, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal miſchief. It exiſts through ages, and is not confined to the ſeat of its birth, but may extend even to the remoteſt parts of the earth. There can be no bounds of its effects. If ſlander, then, is puniſhable by the law, with how much more nicety ſhould reputation and private honor, be guarded from attacks by writing. For words, however public, the law has therefore provided no puniſhment: the law does not conſider the public peace ſo far injured thereby, as to command the public offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to iſſue proſecution. But words committed to paper demands more attention, becauſe more extenſive are its effects. Taking notice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the law does by this pointed diſtinction between words ſpoken and ſlander committed to the preſs, the offence is defined.</p>
               <p>In relation to words ſpoken, ſee 3 Blackſtone 123, "Words which may impair, or hurt a man's trade or livelihood, as to call a tradeſman a bankrupt, <hi>a physician a quack,</hi> or a lawyer a knave." Theſe are an exception to the general propoſition which I have laid down, that words are harmleſs. Theſe words are conſidered as a good ground for action, becauſe they attack in a vulnerable point, and it remains with time defendant to ſhow that there was no malice intended in the uſe of them. Thus we find that the burden is put on the defendant.</p>
               <p>Another way of attacking a man's reputation, and a more ſerious one is by printing, writing, exhibiting pictures or ſigns, &amp;c. ſo as to ſet any one in an odious and diminutive light, ſee 3 Black. 125. Every libel has a tendency to breaking the peace, by provoking the perſon li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled to break it. It is unneceſſary to multiply authorities to prove the law is pointedly againſt the defendant, he having written what
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0038_100D32C64F65D560"/>
would have been a libel even if ſpoken. I ſhall take it for granted then, that this newſpaper attacking of Dr. Ruſh, as "quack," "potent quack," "grand empyric," &amp;c. "who had ſlain his tens of thouſands," is a groſs and infamous libel, except it ſhould be made to appear other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by extenuating, and giving it a mild aſpect.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the principles of law laid down by my colleague, in his opening addreſs were juſt, and conſiſtent with the Engliſh books of law. If, for a moment, his zeal carried him into a ſtate of efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, for which he is blamed by our opponents, it is what the moſt moderate man, who is warmly attached to reputation and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who has read what was inſerted againſt the plaintiff, can ſcarcely refrain from ſhowing. Who could reſtrain a warmth of expreſſion at ſeeing a worthy, valuable citizen ſo laviſhly abuſed without provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without ever appearing to have ſpoken with the defendant, or even glanced at his principles or conduct. Farther, we find this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent intention repeatedly purſued in, even after a proſecution was commenced.—It certainly will not be, nor has it been contended, that character is not a ſacred thing; no one ſhall touch it with impunity. Character is the road to private happineſs and public confidence and honor. Deſtroy the characters of men, and it diſſolves the union which blends together ſociety, nor wealth, nor real merit can conceal contempt. So careful is the law to preſerve character inviolable, that even the memory of the deceaſed is ſacred, and the offence of traducing that memory is puniſhed by law. It is not enough, then, to prove that the ſlander cannot operate to injury; no, the imputation caſt upon the memory of the dead, might lead to acts of violence between the living, and thus the peace be broken. Such a libel as this upon the character of a man, even after he had been dead fifteen years, would be ſufficiently atrocious to juſtify an indictment and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>If the importance of reputation is ſo expreſsly acknowledged by the laws of this country, and if theſe laws are deemed ſo eſſential to the public peace, how are they to be carried into effect, but in one of two ways, legally.—Firſt by public proſecution, in which the defendant is not at liberty to give the truth of the libel in evidence, or ſecondly by an action for ſlander, in which he is at liberty to prove the truth, which if he can do, exculpates him from legal blame. Of theſe two, Dr. Ruſh was not at a loſs to know which was moſt proper for him to adopt: it was reaſon enough for him to commence a civil action, becauſe it gave the defendant an opportunity to bring forward the truth in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if he could do it. This civil action being commenced, you are the organs through whom alone we claim juſtice. A jury taken from the maſs of the people, is a permanent and invaluable inſtitution: they can beſt eſtimate the value of private or public character, and diſpenſe juſtice in proportion to the quality of the offence. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a jury is permanent; however the perſons compoſing it, may vary or die, yet the inſtitution ever remains, and they are the judges on whom the law has reſted property, perſonal liberty, and perſonal character. In caſes where a jury eſtimate damages too high, wherein damages can be eaſily eſtimated, the court have a controlling juriſdiction over their verdict, by ordering a new trial, and referring it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0039_100D32C91F483D60"/>
jury. But in an action which refers to character, to chaſtity, or to the honor of an individual, you are the uncontrolled judges. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of property the court is ſuppoſed to be able to eſtimate, but of the value of character, &amp;c. the jury are ſuppoſed to be able to give the beſt judgment. If therefore the character of a valuable and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table man is wantonly and wickedly attacked, it lies with you, as the guardians of your fellow citizens, to eſtimate the damages. <hi>You</hi> have characters of your own, and you know the importance of preſerving them inviolate; all of you follow ſome buſineſs, and you cannot be ignorant of the violence and effects of an attack on the means you uſe to execute that buſineſs. You, who are merchants, muſt conceive the danger a newſpaper publication, declaring you a bankrupt would be to you: it would wound your reputation ſo as to effectuate your ruin, by ſtopping your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> credit and your trade. It would be no excuſe to your opponent to ſay it was but a jeſt, becauſe the defamation would be effected, and you muſt ſuffer. Picture to yourſelves, if you can, how you would feel, if preciſely ſituated as is the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant! of what avail would it be to you to be told that it was only <hi>ridicule?</hi> Suppoſe an infamous picture was put before your door—ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a pair of horns, deſcribing the conduct of your wife, and that repeatedly, would you be ſatisfied at being told it was "<hi>a test of truth</hi>" and that "<hi>ridicule could do you no injury?</hi>"—Suppoſe it was a label put, that you were guilty of this or that ſpecies of ſwindling, or worſe, ſuppoſe this to be inſerted in the newſpapers,—ſuppoſe that inſtead of low, indecent, and ruſſian-like vulgarity, you were attacked with a keen ſatire,—would it be to your benefit that you were cut with a <hi>sharp</hi> knife? No, it muſt have a direct tendency to ruin, or material injury, and notwithſtanding the utmoſt uſe of philoſophy in calming the mind, to ſay it is only ridicule will not avail to compenſate the injury.</p>
               <p>Let us enquire what was the ſituation of Dr. Ruſh at the time this ſlander was circulated. He reſided in Philadelphia, and it was at a period when moſt had deſerted it who poſſeſſed property ſufficient to make their eſcape, from a ſenſe of the danger to which they ſhould otherwiſe expoſe themſelves. He had property to fly, but he choſe to remain. Can you ſuppoſe, Gentlemen, that he remained here unruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled? His object in ſtaying could not be to enhance his private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, for it could not be profitable for him to ſtay when moſt or all of his profitable patients had gone. No, his object in ſtaying was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good—to mark the ſteps of the diſorder, and the ſenſible effects of the remedies which he applied, and to lay before the public a ſeries of facts and obſervations which might in future, either keep the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence out of our land, or if invaded again, reſtrain its progreſs.—Yes, at this important moment, in the execution of a great ſervice; when every citizen of Philadelphia ought to have acknowledged their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the man who would brave Death for the general good—inſtead of public thanks, the great points for which he was contending, and the great labors he was executing, were attacked in a public news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper with the moſt degrading ridicule, ſcurrility and vulgar jeſt. Yes, the defendant then infamouſly attacked his profeſſional ſkill, in order
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0040_100D32CBCB54B9F0"/>
to bring the man into deriſion, and depreſs his name as one of the moſt dangerous of the human race.—Gentlemen, what does ſuch a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; a man who does not claim the honor of a ſingle <hi>stick</hi> among us; a man who has taken the preſumption of degrading the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable characters of our country, from the Preſident of the United States to the loweſt citizen, whenever their ſentiments have happened to come in contact with his. In the courſe of this cauſe, he has ſworn himſelf an Alien, and in another cauſe he has declared his intention of returning to his own country. Yet this man who profeſſedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf of no country, pretended to wiſh Dr. Ruſh had ſtuck to his medical profeſſion, and have let alone politics! This man could not be ſuppoſed to be intereſted in the politics of our country; he no doubt would have taken the part of his own country, when in colluſion with this, for he glories that he is not the citizen of a republic. And ſhall he be permitted to revile a reſpectable citizen of this country for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which, if he had not done he would have merited cenſure, or at leaſt not merited that good name now ſo juſtly given him. Dr. Ruſh had uttered ſome ſentiments which were "too republican" for Mr. Cobbett. This furniſhed a clue to the ſubſequent attack which he made, not with a view to correct the medical practice; not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the introduction, or ſtop the ravages of a dreadful diſeaſe—no, he ſtopped, as far as he was able, any examination into the truth; as much as he poſſibly could, he weakened the force of the mind engaged in thoſe uſeful reſearches by clamor and abuſe, and the ground was, becauſe he was a <hi>republican!</hi> What could he mean by this declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he would attack him for it? The reſult will anſwer. While his republican opinions gave the offence, why did he not attempt to ſhow that thoſe opinions were founded upon wrong ideas of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But not one word was ever ſeen upon that head. No, his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was deſigned to be on a part more uſeful to his vicious deſigns, and more injurious to the man—on his reputable name as a <hi>Physician.</hi> This will account clearly for the diſtance of time between the threat and its accompliſhment. In January 1797 he threatens, and keeping in his mind the offence, he began not to put it in execution until Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember following. The arrow which, was ſtuck in his ſide, he did not attempt to draw out at the moment of reſentment, but there remaining it grew ſtronger as it grew older—it muſt remain until a fit period for making it felt. None ſo fit as when his practice of Phyſic was at its height, and the mind of his patients the moſt weak and ſuſceptible.—Men differ much in opinions; to attack him therefore upon the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican principles, he had laid down would not do; that was an injury not ſufficiently extenſive, he would not attack him there; he would wound him to effect. Accordingly at the moment of trepidation and confidence he cries out "Dr. Ruſh has been the death of thouſands." Thus he produced by ſkill, what argument would never have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid Cobbett has the ſame right to offer his opinions, and to the liberty of the preſs which others enjoy, and to examine public queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. for which the conſtitution is appealed to; but permit me to ſtate to you the principle that though a right to examine into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0041_100D32CDEF3C1E08"/>
of public officers and diſcuſſing public queſtions is there given, a right of reſponſibility for that examination is likewiſe given, in caſe of the abuſe of that liberty. Admit that he has the right, (though in another caſe it has been declared that aliens have not ſimilar rights with citizens) there is ſtill much reaſon for jealouſy, becauſe, as he has not the ſame intereſt at heart with citizens, not expecting to ſpend his days here, his diſcuſſions of public queſtions ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked to. Indeed I think the "cloven foot" is plainly obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his writings. There is a ſomething appears at the bottom, though it might not comport with his intereſts to avow it. Suppoſe this man was inveſtigating a ſyſtem, or ſearching after truth, which he had a right to do, are theſe reſearches to be made with vulgarity, defamation, and ſcurrility? Is this the way to come at truth? Are not juſtifiable reſearches made by others, and with ſucceſs, without it? Surely you muſt all think this the moſt likely way to defeat his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended object. The true mode, if I wiſh to convince of an opinion, is to reaſon with the underſtanding, and not traduce the character, and opinions of my pupil or opponent. What would the American people be thought of, if they could not be convinced without low abuſe? And what our Courts of Juſtice, if this ſlanderous uſage was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with impunity?</p>
               <p>The preſs is of incalculable benefit; it is the great road to informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The nature of man is formed to aſpire after truth, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected by initiation, it muſt come into the minds of men by a ſeries of ſteps, one leading to another: the preſs is a very important help to this progreſs, becauſe by it we diſcover in one part of the world what has tranſpired at the moſt diſtant part from it. Thus improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in arts and ſcience are made. It is for its ineſtimable general uſe we value it. Do we value it becauſe it furniſhes any man, who is able to purchaſe a ſet of types, and paper, with means to blacken ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's character, ſo that old age, virtue nor chaſtity cannot throw a ſhield round the victim of his envy?—It is neceſſary to encourage the preſs, but ſhall it be done at the hazard of character—of all that is dear to man, his very means of ſubſiſtence? If ſo, inſtead of increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our knowledge and happineſs, it would operate as the greateſt curſe upon frail humanity: There is no principle in government, in Philoſophy, or in religion, that is ſo ſacred but the fangs of envy might ſucceſsfully attack through the licentious uſe of the preſs. But if the aim of an individual is to improve the ſciences, or the happineſs of man in any way, whatever be his mode, he ought to be protected and encouraged. If his reaſoning is fair and candid; if his arguments are addreſſed to the underſtanding; if he ſhews a deſign of increaſing the maſs of knowledge among mankind,—to him the preſs ought to be free. It is by this means man is wreſted from ignorance, and made as near to angelic as his nature will admit. If the defendant had taken theſe means to obtain his object—<hi>to destroy what be thought a ruinous system,</hi> as is pretended, far would it have been from the plaintiff even to have blamed him, much leſs commenced a ſuit againſt him. The opinions of Dr. Ruſh were circulated from an idea that they were juſt; he ſubmitted them to public ſearch and enquiry. How were they to
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0042_100D32D0316F22D8"/>
be anſwered? who were the people to be convinced of their propriety or impropriety? Do the maſs of the people know how to form a juſt judgment on it? As for myſelf, my education, habit of life, nor lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure has enabled me to form any judgment upon it; and I preſume few of you are able to ſay whether the ſyſtem of Dr. Ruſh is falſe or true. At the period alluded to, Philadelphia was in a diſtreſſed ſtate, and owing to the prevalence of the ſame diſeaſe in ſeveral parts of the union, commerce and wealth have been conſiderably impaired. Did this man endeavor to leſſen that affliction? were his efforts directed to promote public happineſs, or to ſatisfy perſonal animoſity? Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you muſt determine theſe points. Did he accompany his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a ſingle ſcientific remark, or give a ſingle argument as to the origin or neceſſary treatment of the diſeaſe, as though he wiſhed to alleviate the prevailing diſtreſs? Every thing proves that he wiſhed not to improve the ſyſtem, and why ſhould be? he had no incitements; he declared his deſign not to ſpend his life amongſt us, and of courſe had no common intereſt with us. To him it was not an object whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philadelphia was deſolated or not. Perhaps, indeed, the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of trade here would give him pleaſure: the diminution of the growing wealth of the principal cities of the United States, might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him gratification, ſince his own country muſt otherwiſe receive impreſſions from our proſperity. No, it is evident he did not wiſh to develope error, to convince men, or increaſe public happineſs, or he would have uſed arguments to ſhow the fallacy of the practice eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. But he knew not, nor cared any thing about it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to prove, by the moſt irrefragible evidence, the <hi>previous, concomitant,</hi> and <hi>subsequent malice</hi> of William Cobbett, from the teſtimony you have heard.</p>
               <p>There was a previous intention of attack. Before the writings iſſued, the deſign was formed. Whenever an act ſhall appear, that correſponds with a previous declaration, we may juſtly conclude a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence therefrom. Thus, ſhould a man ſay, "I will raiſe ſuch an army, and oppoſe ſuch a law:" if in nine months after, ſuch things are done, the circumſtances are blended together, and it is ſuppoſed to be treaſon. As we obſerved before, the circumſtances of January and September, '97 are coupled ſo as to be impoſſible to part them. He then really fulfilled his promiſe, endeavoring to make Dr. Ruſh appear as odious as poſſible. I can ſee no excuſe for ſuch epithets under the name of <hi>ridicule,</hi> but I will ſay, any writing that tends to ſet a man in a ridiculous light <hi>is a libel.</hi> The words uſed to ridicule the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, might excite a laugh, but that is not all it ought to excite, as the honorable Gentleman ſuppoſes, who ſpoke juſt now. Shall the attick ſalt, the elegance of language, or the keenneſs of a ſatire, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a man's abuſe? Of what comfort would you think it to be cut with a <hi>sharp</hi> knife, and ſhould the offender be excuſed, becauſe the weapon was keen? Shall a man dare to bring the Preſident of the United States, or the Congreſs into contempt, and he be excuſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>ridicule</hi> and <hi>ribaldry?</hi> No, the laws of the United States, and of the States, provide that notwithſtanding the keenneſs of the expreſſions, a libel ſhall be puniſhed. It is not juſtifiable merely
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0043_100D32D3250A4CC0"/>
becauſe it is calculated to excite a laugh. Does not the defendant repreſent the plaintiff in an odious point of view, and aſcribe to him the murder of his fellow creatures, by the uſe of bleeding and mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Can there be a more ſevere attack upon a medical man, or upon his art than this? What kind of man muſt he be, who follows a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſyſtem with callous heart and murderous hands, when he ſees direful effects attending that ſyſtem? Who would follow ſuch a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of ſlaughter as this is repreſented, but the moſt abandoned and unfeeling wretch; and who would employ the man that ſhould ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue his hands in blood?—This "potent quack;" this "murderer;" this unfeeling empyric, rejoices at the murder of his fellow-citizens, and has no other way of getting over his miſanthrophy, than by eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizing himſelf, or getting ſome weak men of his own profeſſion to eulogize him!—Gentlemen, I aſk if this does not ſet the plaintiff in a ridiculous point of view,—a fit object for the deteſtation of the world?</p>
               <p>With reſpect to Spilſbury's antiſcorbutic bill, it is an exemplary ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of quackiſm—an univerſal noſtrum worthy univerſal contempt. "There maſter Sangrado, beat that if you can." Meaning, by writing letters, and getting eulogiſtic anſwers purpoſely to puff yourſelf. In my opinion theſe words, and the words "a puff equal to Dr. Ruſh's" means no more nor leſs than that Dr. Ruſh has equalled it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is an empyric. On the ſecond of October Dr. Cox called on Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett, when he adviſed him to withold his publications, as he could not calculate on the injury they did. Notwithſtanding this evidence of their ill effects he went on publiſhing on the 5th, 6th and 20th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, increaſing the aggravation of his crime. He ſaid if any other man than Dr. Ruſh had done it, he ſhould not have ſo gone on. Was it that he thought Dr. Ruſh high in his profeſſion, and therefore the moſt proper object whereby to attack the ſyſtem? No, I think it quite otherwiſe. Could any man hear the gentleman who ſpoke laſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimenting Dr. Ruſh on this pre-eminent ſtation to which Mr. Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett had exalted him, without laughing? Can any man think him ſincere? I agree it was all the honorable gentleman could ſay, becauſe a caſe like this muſt neceſſarily put ingenuity to its laſt ſhift, and leave genius without even a plauſible reſource. No, we know better. He had called the Doctor "Sangrado" "potent quack, &amp;c:" he has aſperſed him with "killing his tens of thouſand by his prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice" and can it be ſuppoſed, after all this, that his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were directed againſt the Doctor for his eminent ſkill, and that it was honorable to him? No, we can trace it but to one cauſe—<hi>private, personal malice,</hi> without the leaſt regard to public duty, or public good. He declared he would attack, but little did he expect that this avowal would ever come againſt him.</p>
               <p>"Let him withdraw his action, or I will perſecute him while <hi>living,</hi> and his <hi>memory</hi> after he is <hi>dead.</hi>"</p>
               <p>What an heart has this man? My colleague has been blamed for keen expreſſions, and violence of attack. But what is violence? Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury, I wiſh you to remember that what is violence without evidence, is truth with evidence. To call murder only aſſault and battery would be a perverſion of terms. To call malice, <hi>"fun"</hi>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0044_100D32D4B556F010"/>
is as much ſo. To ſay that the defendant had malice at heart when he uſed theſe words, I therefore contend is evident without a doubt. Perhaps he uſed this violence for another purpoſe. I could name a perſon who fell a victim to the malice indefatigably thrown at him through this very news paper. A man that ſhould uſe ſuch threats, could not be ſuppoſed to uſe his weapons but to the moſt baſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And ſhall a man of this baſe diſpoſition teach Americans poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics? Shall this man deal about the Theorems and Aphoriſms of the medical art, and examine ſyſtems of practice which he does not even pretend to underſtand? Can there be any caſe of malice more expreſs than theſe words convey, or a better key found whereby to explain his writings? If expreſs declarations are ever admitted as proofs of the meaning of writings, (and certainly they are) there can be no doubt, here, of the exiſtence of the overt act in ſix or even eight inſtances: if it was poſſible to give a more bright coloring to the tranſaction, it was done by the ſubſequent publications in which the reſpect which every man owes to the Law, is highly violated.</p>
               <p>We live in a land where the public transactions, and the officers of government are to be regulated by written rules; theſe are well known; theſe rules give to the people their duty of obedience to the Laws, and ſubmiſſion to the higher authorities; it limits to every man in ſociety, how far he can go; it puniſhes tranſgreſſion in the one claſs, and violation in the other. If any individual, therefore, ſhall dare tranſgreſs theſe laws, he ſubjects himſelf to the puniſhment they inflict. Therefore if any action is brought againſt a man, he is not thereby to be irritated! Upon the doctrine advanced by the honorable gentleman, as impriſonment would undoubtedly irritate any man, he would have a right to break priſon, and murder any perſons who ſhould ſtand in his way. An action would be a great irritation if juſtice was leſs certain than we happily enjoy. Well, inſtead of ſubmiſſion to the operation of the law, what does he do? He continues to iſſue out from his preſs, new libels, calculated to increaſe his crime. The ſuit was commenced in the beginning of October 1797, the whole of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications of the 5th, 7th and 20th of October were ſubſequent to the commencement of the ſuit. Can there be a doubt, then, that the true cauſe of Mr. Cobbett's publications againſt Dr. Ruſh, originated, not with a view to improve the medical practices, but to diſgrace and villi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the individual? Was Cobbett capable of judging of, or is he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtructure of the ſyſtem, or its relative parts? Can he point out how the different treatments operate on that or any other diſeaſe? Can he ſhow how a certain mode of adminiſtration would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one, while it would deſtroy another? Was he ſkilled in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of anatomy or medicine? He does not pretend to be; Nay, he declared that he had no knowledge of it at all! He plainly confeſſed that his eſſays were not to inform the public mind, but to ridicule a certain ſyſtem, for he ſuppoſed no-body would take notice of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Gentlemen, his hardihood has left every act and declaration upon which he is called to anſwer, or which proves the charge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſingle equivoke on which the mind of any man can heſitate.</p>
               <p>We do not contend that Dr. Ruſh has eſtabliſhed the true mode of
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0045_100D32D7269303E8"/>
practice: he thinks ſo, and has given to the world his reaſons for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. But the caſe does not reſt upon that point, it is all one to you whether his practice is right or wrong. Did Cobbett ſay that he knew a better mode? No. He endeavoured to riſe a public laugh upon Dr. Ruſh, and put him forth in a moſt degrading point of view, at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when drooping humanity found no longer a baſis in its own ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; when the ſtate of the city was enough to appal the ſtouteſt heart; when the confidence of men in general was placed on the advice of this man;—at that moment his reputation is pulled down; his mode of treatment, almoſt the only one then practiſed, is deſtroyed, and no effort is made to put another in its place! Dr. Ruſh does not pretend to ſay he is right; he thinks ſo: But the ſuperior genius of Cobbett <hi>does</hi> preſume to declare that he is wrong, and that he has killed his tens of thouſands, though at the ſame time he declares he does not know whether the mode is right or wrong. The true ſyſtem is not diſcovered perhaps, nor ever might be: it might be like the dreadful earthquake that deſolates the world, no means ever found to arreſt its awful progreſs. It lies behind a veil through which the human ſight cannot, and never might penetrate. But our duty and our intereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that, though we may never find the cauſe and cure, we ſhould be indefatigable in our endeavors to do it: perhaps we may only find the mode of avoiding, by keeping out of its way. But is it probable we ſhall ever be able to diſcover any means of prevention or cure, if the man who ſtays making thoſe reſearches in times of imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in addition to the natural alarm diſtracting his mind, which mind at that moment ought to be the moſt ſtrong and penetrating, to ſpread all its ſails and catch every, even the moſt minute idea—How, I ſay can we expect the fever to be ſubdued, or kept away from our doors, if an individual ſhall be ſuffered to vend his malice on ſuch a man at a period ſo momentous? Suffer that with impunity, and no efforts will ever in future be made to appal this foul deſtroyer, no man will fortify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the illiberal attack. Gentlemen, conſider this in a public, or in a private point of view, can there ever be an inſtance in which a plaintiff can come before you more entitled to your juſt verdict, or a defendant with leſs claim to your verdict? Can a caſe occur in which there is leſs to plead even for extenuation or excuſe or the crime? Gentlemen, reputation is ſacred: an injury done to honor can ſcarcely be redreſſed. How can youth acquire proſperity or affluence, or age reſpectability, if that character, which is the foundation of ſucceſs in every profeſſion, may be attacked with impunity? If upon property there is protection, but there is no protection for character, juſtice is but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially adminiſtered, and it is time now, if for the firſt time, for an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican court of juſtice to ſhow the world that character is property, and a property moſt ſacred. But I hope our courts of juſtice have proved this whenever called upon ſo to do. Who can ſay when a man is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked in his reputation how numerous the chinks through which he may ſuſtain injury? When this ſhaft is directed by malice and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, how are we to depreciate the value of the injury done? How much might it not prevent a young man progreſſing in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And does the attack upon age leſſen the crime: a time when
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0046_100D32D953C1F008"/>
the experience is matured, and ſtudied labors become eminently uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? Who knows but this ſcandal might have prevented thouſands from applying to Dr. Ruſh for advice? We ſee the defendant ſtand upon the high ground of boaſting of his income, from the number of perſons who bought and read his papers: we may thence conclude that this ſlander extended very wide, and therefore to attempt at forming an eſtimate of ſpecial damages, would be fruitleſs. To prove this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, would be impoſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore cannot be expected from us, for who would come to Dr. Ruſh and ſay, "I ſhould have employed you, had not I read ſuch a character of you; you have murdered thouſands, and therefore I could not truſt my life with you." To eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate damages muſt be your province agreeable to circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the queſtion of damages often came before the courts in England, of which we have ſome ſome accounts in the books, and they are not always guided by pecuniary circumſtances, but more to enforce the law, and ſhow example. The law has there eſtimated the fine for ſeducing a man's wife at ten thouſand pounds ſterling. Here is no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary injury ſuſtained, but a very heavy fine laid; for often it may happen that a man has a bad wife, and her loſs is a real profit to him, but this is not the meaſure of the fine. Though leſs than that ſum is uſually laid, yet it is always exemplary. We find other caſes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the books. 2 Wilſon, 206. A journey man printer, in the office of the North Briton, was ſeized for publiſhing No. 45 of that paper. He was ſeized by an order of the ſecretary of ſtate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but ſix hours in cuſtody, and during that time treated with beef ſtakes and beer. On examining this in a court, to which it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, the jury gave 300l. ſterling damages. The fact was, not the pecuniary injury ſuſtained by the man was conſidered, but the political conſequences—the liberty of the ſubject, and therefore the award re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the approbation of the court. In 244 ſame book, 1000l. was awarded for a falſe impriſonment of ſix days; alſo p 252 there is a caſe of aſſault and battery. In all theſe, the conſequences were conſidered. 3 Blackſtone 126, notes there was 4000l. damages laid for a reflection on the chaſtity of a lady. Theſe, gentlemen, are inſtances of exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary damages, and that is what we aſk for in the preſent caſe, your verdict. Doctor Ruſh has a wife and children arrived to ages capable of reading newſpapers. Can any man ſet by with patience, when he ſees his children crying, or his wife in tears in conſequence of the perpetual newſpaper abuſe laviſhed upon a tender huſband and a loving father?—abuſe and reproach the moſt heart-rending—no leſs than a murderer and a quack. Suppoſe yourſelves for a moment in his ſituation, and ſay whether the meaſure of this newſpaper libelling ought to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned merely to the damages any individual could ſuſtain from it, or whether it ought not to be made a public example of, on account of the principle. It is high time to reſcue the American character from the indifference which has too long prevailed amongſt us, while we ſee the characters of our unoffending fellow-citizens conſigned to infamy. If it has hitherto been too much diſregarded, let not this be ſo, for ſurely it is time to puniſh crimes ſo daring. This man has declared, that he would "perſecute the defendant while living, and his memory
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0047_100D32DC18AEE0D0"/>
after his death." How can you check this vindictive ſpirit, but by timely and exemplary puniſhment? Let him be taught that he has wantonly attacked, and that with cool deliberate malice, an unoffend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing individual, and though he has removed himſelf out of the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this court, yet that he is a marked man, and that a reſpectable jury of Philadelphia have ſtudied only principles of truth and juſtice with impartiality. Let others be taught by his puniſhment to avoid his offence.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, let not Dr. Ruſh be a marked man for defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his name be remembered with ſcorn. Let it not be ſaid to him "your character is ſo infamous that no ſlander can defame it." Nor let it be ſaid that the immaculacy of character, againſt which he drew his ſhaft, was ſuch as to excuſe or protect the inſolent offender from damages. If Cobbett has never injured the character of Dr. Ruſh, it is evident he has attempted to do it, and with his utmoſt efforts—but I think he has injured it. He certainly has wounded his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; he has hurt his health, and he has wounded him in his family. There cannot be a doubt but he has wounded his fame and reputation, and of courſe his pecuniary intereſt. As I think you muſt be of the ſame opinion with me in theſe particulars, I ſhall content myſelf with confiding this caſe to you, and as I am ſure nothing in the conduct of Dr. Ruſh has merited ſuch infamous treatment, ſo ſure am I you will do him ſatisfactory juſtice.</p>

               <p>I AGREE moſt heartily with the council for the plaintiff that if you came into the bar, previous to being ſworn with any prejudice what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, you ought to lay it perfectly aſide, and conſider the cauſe, which you are called to try, fairly between man and man: you ſhould come with minds, in the language of the law "like blank paper," and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch impreſſions only as law and evidence muſt make.</p>

William Cobbett, my client, though an alien, is entitled all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which law and juſtice can beſtow; and if he can ſatisfy you that damages ought not to be recovered from an <hi>American</hi> ſtanding in his place, no damages are to be given againſt him.—The plaintiff de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands damages of my client for certain publications written by him, ſaid to be libellous, on his profeſſional reputation and character, to ſupport which much has been ſaid, but what deſerves particular notice is, that the plaintiff's council are <hi>tremblingly</hi> alive as to the character of Dr. Ruſh, while Mr. Cobbett is treated in terms utterly deſtructive of all character and reputation.</p>
               <p>This was not what I expected in any caſe whatever, and eſpecially from the gentlemen whence it came, whom I much reſpect. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you are not to pay regard to the contemptuous light in which the defendant is held by the plaintiff's council: you are not to meaſure your verdict by their reſentment. One gentleman in order to ſhow the contemptuous light in which he holds Cobbett's opinion, has ſaid he muſt extend his duty beyond the ordinary limits. There can be no doubt but his zeal for his client induced him to go an extravagant length, or he would not have ſtiled the defendant an aſſaſſin (which he has twice done) and a noxious animal thrown up from the very dregs and ſlime of obſcurity, a being which has no equal in ſociety, taking his tigers ſtrides to do miſchief, and guilty of every ſpecies of editorial pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Farther he condemns him for his <hi>litigious</hi> diſpoſition. Where, I aſk is the evidence of this diſpoſition? It is not before the court, nor has it appeared in his conduct, for he has not appealed to the law to redreſs his wrongs, but has uſed another weapon, his pen. So far has my friend's zeal carried him, that he declared he could name an individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al who was brought to the grave by this man's publications. Theſe are vague and unproved aſſertions: words which have no tendency but to inflame your minds, but I can only impute it to a zeal, the impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of which they know as well as I am able to inform them. May we not ſuppoſe, after all this that Mr. Cobbett is a man more ſinned againſt, than ſinning? For while abuſe and deteſtation is his lot, Dr. Ruſh is daubed with praiſes ſo laviſhly that he muſt almoſt have bluſhed to hear them. <hi>He</hi> was compared to Hypocrates, at Athens, having done ſo much as to be entitled to public thanks, and yet the public are much divided as to the efficacy of his means of treatment, but more particularly ſo as to his opinion of the origin of that fatal diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Further. The defendant is ſaid to be an alien, and to owe no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to our government, and that his diſcuſſions of public queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhow the <hi>cloven-foot.</hi>—With reſpect to country, it is a principle that every <hi>alien</hi> who comes here, does owe allegiance—a temporary allegiance. So long as he ſtays to receive the benefit of our laws, ſo long he is anſwerable to them, and is bound to reſpect them. I am far from contending that the defendant is immaculate or infallible, yet I muſt ſay that he is not without ſome merit. He certainly did, (whatever his motive, whatever <hi>cloven-foot</hi> he might have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed) at a critical period, give a very ſeaſonable and proper alarm to this country; an alarm which did much towards uniting our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in an attachment to preſerve the honor of our country, and which
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0049_100D32DF636497B8"/>
tended much to reſcue us from European influences and attachment. As he began, ſo he perſevered, and we are not without experiencing its good effects. Twice were bills of indictments ſent to grand juries, who proved his innocence of the charges exhibited againſt him by his opponents, by returning both of them <hi>ignoramus.</hi> However, all this is foreign to the queſtion at preſent, but the plaintiff's council having departed to <hi>derogate,</hi> we may be allowed to <hi>extenuate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I agree with Mr. Levy in his ſtatement of the law; he certainly has ſtated it with preciſion and accuracy, and I muſt do honor to his talents and candor. It formerly became my duty to ſtate to this court, that every writing is on the face of it independant of collateral matter (which does not appear upon the face) either criminal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it appears on the face of it to be innocent, or not libellous, ſtill it becomes criminal and libellous, if written with a particular <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> of a <hi>criminal nature</hi>—then ſuch intent muſt be proved.</p>
               <p>Secondly. If it appears, from the face of it to be criminal or libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, there may, from the occaſion, be juſtification or excuſe.</p>
               <p>In each caſe, the criminality or innocence depends on collateral matter, not appearing on the face of the paper.</p>
               <p>Lawful excuſe is juſtifiable either in legal proceedings;—Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of an injury, &amp;c. even when the publication is in a newſpaper: From a ſenſe of duty, and not with a malicious <hi>intent:</hi>—Or in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or with a view to reform and amend.</p>
               <p>Generally. <hi>Publications must include</hi> MALICE <hi>or a</hi> CRIMINAL IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENT <hi>either expreſs or implied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I agree that if the jury ſhould find the words themſelves to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellous, then the plaintiff can recover damages, to prevent which, it would be his duty to ſhow that the intention was innocent.</p>
               <p>A caſe to exemplify theſe doctrines, is found in a Burrows, 807. "This was an action upon the caſe for ſpeaking and publiſhing defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory, falſe, malicious and libellous words, of and concerning the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, Sir John Aſtley."</p>
               <p>The defendant applied to the plaintiff (a juſtice of the peace) for a tavern licence, and was refuſed: on which account, words were uſed by the defendant, which were ſuppoſed libellous.</p>
               <p>Lord Mansfield in the caſe ſpoke thus, page 810:</p>
               <p>"The charge againſt the defendant is made upon oath, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the affidavit of Sir John Aſtley, and of the <hi>defendant in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> to his complaint: he mentioned the charge, and denies it with this concluſion, calling it "what Sir J. A. has ſo FALSELY ſworn againſt him."</p>
               <p>"Now in every diſpute in a court of juſtice upon oath, where <hi>one by affidavit charges a thing,</hi> and the other <hi>by affidavit</hi> denies it, the caſe is, ordinarily, <hi>much the same</hi> (in effect) with the preſent, and each party might bring a civil action againſt the other; for it TOO often happens that the affidavit and evidence <hi>are</hi> in terms DIRECTLY OPPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SITE each other.</p>
               <p>"As to the reaſon of the thing, there can be no SCANDAL if the allegation is <hi>material,</hi> and if it is not, the court before whom the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0050_100D32E2326B0F08"/>
is <hi>immaterial</hi> ſcandal, may <hi>order satisfaction,</hi> and expunge it out of the <hi>record,</hi> if it be upon the <hi>record."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that thought the defendant was charged with ſwearing that Sir John Aſtley had "forſworn himſelf, and be (the defendant) would not do it for his whole eſtate," yet, although the expreſſion "falſely" was rather <hi>too rough,</hi> it was not taken notice of.</p>
               <p>I muſt agree with the gentlemen, that had I been engaged in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Dr. Ruſh's opinions, I ſhould have deemed it very improper to have uſed ſuch <hi>coarse</hi> expreſſions. This brings me to a more cloſe and immediate view of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>The fever of 1793 you well remember. Dr. Ruſh ſtaid in the city, no doubt, from a ſenſe of duty: no doubt this operated ſtrongly with him, but it cannot be ſuppoſed that he had no ſenſe of the profit: he expected to be paid for his labor, but notwithſtanding that, his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did him very great honor. I do not pretend to juſtify ſuch as attack on the ſyſtem he practiſed, but I do not think that condemning the <hi>system</hi> was libellous. I am ſure that when he came to take even 70 or 80 ounces of blood he was under the moſt perfect conviction that it was neceſſary to ſave the life of his patient, and that in all his practice he was actuated by the moſt honeſt motives. But the moſt ſenſible, ingenuous and ardent man; the moſt indefatigable in his exertions, is moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſed with new ſyſtems and ideas, when they come plauſibly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Inquiſitive minds, like that of Dr. Ruſh, are not of a caſt to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

To us it was new: the uſe of mercurial purges and bleeding, to ſo vaſt an amount, was entirely unheard of by us, and therefore it was no wonder that the practice ſhould ſpread an alarm of nearly as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a nature as the fever itſelf.</p>
               <p>Doctor Ruſh was ſo confident of the ſucceſs of his ſyſtem, that in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter addreſſed to his fellow-citizens on the 12th of September, 1793, he aſſures them <q>there is no more danger from it, when theſe remedies have been uſed in the early ſtage, than there is from the meaſles or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza.</q> But with all his ſucceſs, and though he ſtood <hi>foremost, and nearly alone,</hi> as his counſel ſay, there was a deſtruction in that year of nearly 5000 perſons. Notwithſtanding ſo many periſhed, though he ſtood almoſt alone, and notwithſtanding the novelty of the remedies, and the great applications of bleeding and mercury, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind was extremely agitated and divided as to the efficacy of them. What was ſtill more extraordinary, there is no man whoſe perſuaſive ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of manners is more likely to attract the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and acquieſcence of either pupils or patients than thoſe of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Ruſh. But ſtories of bleeding and purging were much exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the relation, ſo as to harraſs the public mind extremely. Indeed the phyſicians themſelves were much divided, and even parties were formed to ſupport the different ſyſtems. The event of this was a creation of animoſity and newſpaper contention. Of courſe this increaſed the public alarm, and dreadful was our ſituation. One ſet of Doctors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this was the true mode, and the other another. In this ſtate of uncertainty and indeciſion things remained until the fever again unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily broke out in 1797, and with it the Doctors' quarrels, on account of
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0051_100D32E4F4AFDE88"/>
which numerous publications iſſue forth. Nor even were the reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble learned inſtitutions exempt: the College of Phyſicians and the Medical Academy. I believe the difference between thoſe bodies ſtill exiſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The difference was explained to exist at present only as to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, whether by importation or of domestic source. With respect to treatment they now both agree with the system of Dr. Rush.</hi>
                  </note> Doctor Ruſh ſtaid again, and much to his honor. It is ſaid that the great point for which he ſtaid was fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen I aſk by whom it was fruſtrated? Can it be believed that it was fruſtrated by Cobbett? Whoſe oppoſition to Dr. Ruſh was moſt ſerious, that of Cobbett, or that of the Doctors? As you are not ſure it was by Cobbett, but muſt have good ground for believing the other more <hi>potent,</hi> there can be no doubt where his diſappointment ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated. Or, I would aſk, was it fruſtrated at all? No doubt the Doctor did much good by ſtaying, and as the diſpute was ſo undecid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I do not believe that any perſon would be prevented from apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Doctor Ruſh for aſſiſtance on account of Cobbett's publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>In September 1797, out comes Cobbett's firſt publication. I do not mean to vindicate the manner of the attack, but my client has been charged with calling the defendant a <hi>murderer.</hi> Now, Gentlemen, I appeal to your conſciences, can any man who reads the publication look upon it as any thing like <hi>a serious charge</hi> againſt Dr. Ruſh as a <hi>murderer?</hi> I am very ſure that you will all allow with me that he meant no more than a ludicrous attack upon the ſyſtem of which he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the head.</p>
               <p>What is murder? It is to kill a man by <hi>malice prepense.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed that the defendant had an idea of ſo ſerious a charge. There were numerous ſkirmiſhes among the Doctors, and he ſkirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the reſt with the only weapon he poſſeſſed: <hi>Ridicule.</hi> In this ſenſe "ridicule is ſurely the teſt of truth," however the ingenuous gentleman may have uſed it. I aſk, then, did this proceed from <hi>cool de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate malice,</hi> or was it ridiculing a ſyſtem which he ſuppoſed to be ill founded? If he had meant that Doctor Ruſh went on murderouſly rejoicing at the direful effects of his ſyſtem, it ſurely would have been a libel of the moſt egregrious nature, but the idea cannot be proved, even by the greateſt ingenuity. That William Cobbet had a right to attack that ſyſtem or any other we contend is indubitable, however ſmall the ſtake he had among us, or however ſhort his intended ſtay, if he uſed no improper words in making that attack. I allow, with Mr. Levy, that it is incumbent on the Defendant, when brought into the court, to prove that he did not uſe the words with an evil intention; with reſpect to this, we contend that if he exerciſed his abilities with a view to the public ſafety, he exerciſed them not only innocently but laudably. I ſubmit to you that the publications include no deſign to render Dr. Ruſh, in his perſon odious, or to injure him in his buſineſs. However free he has been in his attack upon Dr. Tilton, or any other perſon, he has here only attacked <hi>mercury</hi> and <hi>blood letting.</hi> If he ever diſapproved of the private character of the defendant, he has not
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0052_100D32E7334B39C0"/>
exemplified it: the phyſicians were the main battle, and great was the ſhock, but Cobbett was a mere ſkirmiſher, on the practice and not on the man.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak in reference to the publications mentioned in the declaration, for though the plaintiff's council have a right to read any other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, it is only to ſhew the <hi>quo animo,</hi> or deſign with which the others were written.</p>
               <p>But the malice of this man is ſaid to be <hi>deep, antecedent, concomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and subsequent.</hi>—All this I deny. The teſtimony of Dr. Dewees is called to prove that it was <hi>antecedent</hi>—Sometime in 1796, Doctor Ruſh delivered, on occaſion of the departure of Dr. Rittenhouſe from this life, an <hi>elegant eulogium</hi>—too <hi>elegant</hi> to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>However, there was ſome little of that ſort of <hi>spice</hi> in it which was not pleaſing to Mr. Peter Porcupine. It was <hi>too republican</hi> for his taſte. I do not know what Dr. Ruſh's political ſentiments are, but if they are of one ſort, I ſhould diſlike them as much as Cobbett. If of another ſort, I ſhould approve of it, and perhaps not think it <hi>too republican.</hi> But that is to be no meaſure for him; he had a right to attack them. In a converſation about the merits of that eulogium, he ſays "Damn him, I will attack him for it." This, to be ſure is very illiberal, but he did not ſay in what way he would attack him, on that he meant more than to attack him as a political man. There is no evidence of any private malice that <hi>Peter</hi> had in his heart, nor can it be contended that this eulogium was the ground of his attacks, mentioned in the declaration, for had it been ſo it would not have reſted ſo long in ſilence as from January 'till September. No, from the repreſentation of gentlemen themſelves, he was of too combuſtible a matter to keep it ſo long. If it made any impreſſion at all, it was not ſolid, for if it had, I think it would have been out of the power of <hi>bleeding and drastic purges</hi> to do it away. He was angry, and expreſſed his anger in a very coarſe way. Well.—In September came the attack. Is into the <hi>man</hi> or the <hi>system?</hi> It has appeared that Dr. Dewees practiſed upon the ſyſtem of Dr. Ruſh, and yet he attended Cobbett's family. This is brought to prove the man, and not the ſyſtem was the object of attack! I aſk whether, if there had come an alarm of the fever du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Dr. Dewees's attendance upon Mr. Cobbett's family, he would have been ſuffered to uſe Dr. Ruſh's ſyſtem? If that had been done, then indeed there would have been reaſon to conclude <hi>the man</hi> was attacked. I cannot but conſider this circumſtance reſpecting the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logium to be an attempt to draw the attention of the Jury from the real merits of the caſe, tending to eſtabliſh a belief that there was deep ſettled malice, which he kept in his breaſt during that period, growing deeper and ſtronger in proportion to the time it exiſted in the mind, and therefore, gentlemen, you are earneſtly inſtructed to give verdict for the plaintiff. On the ſame account alſo, the queſtion is aſked why Cobbett ſhould wiſh a reform in medicine? and it has even been hinted that he might wiſh to leave the diſeaſe without a cure, and might not be diſpleaſed with the misfortunes of Philadelphia, becauſe it would diminiſh the commerce, and probably ſerve his own country. This ſurely is too much to ſay of any man, but tho'
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0053_100D32E9AE32EB68"/>
ſerious, I have no doubt you will put the whole of theſe <hi>insinuations</hi> upon a candid footing, and decide only upon <hi>facts.</hi> As to his wiſhing to leave the diſeaſe without a cure, it is abſurd, for he ſtayed in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia during the fever of '97, in which ſituation, he ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the firſt victim of his ownenvy! This is what I think you will ſcarcely believe.</p>
               <p>In the evidence of Dr. Meaſe it appears that Cobbett made uſe of a very intemperate expreſſion, but having been ſued, he might be idle enough, knowing himſelf to be maſter of a very bitter weapon the pen—he might think he could thereby induce Doctor Ruſh to withdraw his action. If ſo, he was guilty of a very great miſconcluſion. He was very wrong, but I rather think it muſt have been the effect of haſte, without any evil intention. Gentlemen, upon your oath, try if you can couple theſe words with thoſe ſpoken to Doctor Dewees! I think you cannot.</p>
               <p>As to the words to Mr. Cox, I am of the ſame opinion with Mr. Harper: that he would "not have written againſt the ſyſtem, if Dr. Ruſh had not been the author of it." It was paying a very great compliment to Doctor Ruſh. This appears to have taken place about the time the ſuit was commenced, and to have been preſſed upon him by Doctor Cox. Doctor Cox himſelf ſeems to believe it to be an attack upon the ſyſtem. His view was no doubt to preſerve the life, and health of his fellow creatures, many of whom, in his opinion, ſuffered from this mode treatment, and therefore he did his utmoſt to point out the danger.</p>
               <p>Upon this part I ſhall not remain longer, ſince I think neither "keen, private, nor perſonal malice," as has been pretended, can be proved. Gentlemen view the whole together as Mr. Levy ſaid, and if you ſee all this "fixed, keen, private, perſonal malice" againſt Doctor Ruſh, then you muſt give verdict for, the plaintiff. But I conſider that the great alarm which exiſted in the public mind at that time, many deeming the practice in queſtion to be no leſs than poiſon, and death—If ſuch was the alarm, and ſuch the apprehenſion, for which I appeal to your recollections—then, I ſay it was not improper to point the ſhaft of ridicule againſt the ſyſtem ſo replete with danger.</p>
               <p>But, Gentlemen, ſuppoſe you ſhould be of opinion that the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff has been injured by thoſe publications, and damages ought to be awarded, the next queſtion that occurs to you is <hi>what ought those damages to be?</hi> It has been a queſtion aſked by the plantiff's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel "Who knows how many have been prevented from applying to Dr. Ruſh"? How a negative can be proved I cannot conceive; neither he nor I can tell <hi>who has been prevented;</hi> that is entirely in the dark. Doctor Ruſh's Counſel, when they drew up the declaration drew it upon ſpecial damages. Near the concluſion of the declaration are theſe words! <hi>(The said Benjamin")</hi> is alſo thereby greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in his buſineſs practice and profeſſion of Phyſician, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner as aforeſaid, <hi>many persons have been induced to withdraw their confidence from the said Benjamin, as Physician, aforesaid, and the following persons, who were previously accustomed to employ the said Banjamin a Physician as aforesaid to wit:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0054_100D32ED122D9468"/>
"The <hi>mountains</hi> are in labour, and a rediculous <hi>mouse</hi> creeps forth"!!</p>
               <p>Where, then, are the inſtances in which Doctor Ruſh has received damages? Wherein is he injured?—all the induſtry of thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could not find out ſpecial damages, or a cuſtomer withdrawn. It appears that ſuch was Dr. Ruſh's reputation, that he is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. You know what this reputation and character is at preſent. I do not mean by this that, if you diſcover the expreſſions to have proceeded from <hi>malice</hi> you are to give any damages; but you muſt be guided by the injury ſuſtained in a great manner. Has not Doctor Ruſh from 1793 to 1797 and from 1797 to 1799 been in as great buſineſs as he could do?</p>
               <p>Plaintiff's Counſel.—We ſay No.—We can prove from his books that his buſineſs has materially leſſened ſince this newſpaper attack commenced on him.</p>
               <p>Mr. TIGHLMAN.—It is ſaid that Mr. Cobbett violated the law by ſubſequent publications. I grant that, from the moment the ſuit was commenced he has done wrong in doing or ſaying any thing until the trial. So far he was liable to puniſhment, but not in this way, nor at this time. He was liable for contempt of Court, and if Dr. Ruſh had complained, he could have been committed for that contempt. The moment a ſuit takes place the law ſays the parties ought both to be ſilent, <hi>because every thing ought to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Jury,</hi> who ſhall not have their paſſions raiſed, or be prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in favor of either party. Therefore, this does not prove that he ſhall recover aggravated damages.</p>
               <p>One of the Counſel has ſuppoſed libels to be the ſources of nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous evils, and laid down the poſition that to ſecure good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you muſt puniſh libels ſeverely; thus ſevere puniſhment would be the beſt criterion of a good government? I truſt this will never be a law principle; that no perſon will ever be puniſhed, not even an <hi>alien,</hi> to prove how good the government is. How fatal would be the adminiſtration of Juſtice if this was law! To what ſevere ties would it not lead!</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that you are the uncontrolled Judges of dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. In matters of debt or property, there can be no difficulty as to the eſtimate of damages proper, and then the Court will not ſuffer what is eaſily perceivable to be an extreme award. But, in civil ſuits, as in an action for Slander, when damages are uncertain, and difficult, the aſcertainment of thoſe damages are more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly the province of the Jury, though in that they are not perfectly uncontrolled; but the Court will not grant a new trial, unleſs the damages given are "outrageous;" unleſs, "at the firſt bluſh, all mankind would revolt againſt it." Farther, they are not uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, becauſe they are to conſider the Plaintiff's ſuffering, and the Defendant's ability to pay. Would you give againſt William Cobbett the ſame damages as againſt a man with an hundred times the property? Surely not. You muſt conſider the circumſtances of the man. There has been no evidence adduced in reſpect to the circumſtances of the defendant, but it is a rule in Courts to fine the party <hi>not to his ruin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0055_100D32EEA179C360"/>
The Counſel has told you, that if a Phyſician's character is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, it is ruined. Then may I ſay that Dr. Ruſh's is not only not ruined, but in as high credit and reputation as can attend a phyſician, and therefore not even ſuſpected, and if not ſuſpected, he is not injured.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that if damages were not given ſufficiently high, perſons would take the law into their own hands, and the Jury muſt take the conſequences, therefore you muſt give high damages to avoid being implicated yourſelves! Gentlemen, pay regard only to juſtice, and leave the conſequences; meaſure the degree of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry received on the one hand, and the ability to pay on the other, and thus eſtimate your damages. Remember, that although the doctor may have a right to damages, his reputation will not in the leaſt be affected by your not giving him <hi>large</hi> damages.</p>
               <p>I paſs by the gentleman's appeal to the juſt heavens, and his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſcene of crying children and a weeping wife, becauſe I know you can only eſtimate this as an appeal to your paſſions. I ſhall, therefore, only proceed to examine the caſes referred to you.</p>
               <p>The caſe in 2 Wilſon 206 was a flagrant violation of the liberty of the ſubject, by unjuſt impriſonment, and 300£ was not too high an award, though the impriſonment was ſhort, and the treatment good. The Secretary of State was there exerciſing arbitrary power by taking the man up upon a general warrant. Thus it ſtruck the jury. <q>To enter a man's houſe by virtue of a nameleſs warrant is worſe than the Spaniſh inquiſition: a daring attack;—an attempt to violate <hi>magna charta,</hi>
                  </q> ſaid Lord Campden.—A more diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe to the preſent cannot poſſibly be cited.</p>
               <p>The other caſe p. 244 of the ſame book is alſo on a general war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. The caſe 252 called the turtle caſe, was an unprovoked and unreaſonable aſſault and battery, where the damages ought to be great, but the defendant was able to pay.</p>
               <p>It is diſagreeable for me to make any obſervations on the letter which I was impelled by my duty to read at the commencement of my defence. You will collect from that letter a few ideas which I think may prove that the Doctor has not only been intemperately, but uncommonly ſevere upon every one who had the misfortune to differ from him in practice. He has ſaid "As well might there be two ſuns or two moons, as to ſuppoſe that two ſorts of lever prevailed in that year," although ſo many different ſymptoms made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. His treatment of the Health Laws is extremely ſevere, he does not only ſpeak againſt the phyſicians, but againſt the Legiſlature it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. One ſolitary inſtance of good might happen therefrom, but upon the whole he declares the laws very deſtructive. Though he does not handle the objects of his attack in ſtrains ſo ſtrong as Cobbett does, yet he is extremely ſevere. If he ſuffers himſelf to be led to ſuch great lengths in his attacks, upon his brethren, the Phyſicians, and upon the Legiſlature itſelf, I truſt you will not conſider him entitled to as great damages as though he had been ſilent.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with theſe remarks, I leave the cauſe to your deciſion, and repeat that I hope, if you ſhould conſider the plantiff deſerving of <hi>damages,</hi> you will conſider how little injury he has ſuſtained, and what
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0056_100D32F04F4F0D58"/>
are the defendant's circumſtances; but I truſt you will believe, with me, that none of theſe publications flowed from malice, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them was meant to injure the Doctor as a man or as a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, but to attack his ſyſtem. If theſe are your opinions, you muſt give a verdict for the defendant.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE Counſel for the Defendant have dwelt much on an obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is very trite, but certainly very true; that the underſtanding is not to be truſted when the paſſions are engaged.</p>
               <p>I will therefore endeavor at preſent, to ſuppreſs my feelings;—the honeſt indignation which, in ſpite of my efforts is ready to burſt forth; and examine calmly the facts; I will approach your paſſions through the fair and honeſt medium of <hi>your understandings,</hi> and if I ſucceed, as I think I ſhall, in ſhewing that every <hi>tittle</hi> of our declaration is ſupported by the cleareſt proofs, then I contend that your ſenſibility ought to be excited. For, give me leave to ſay that any man who can believe the teſtimony we have produced; he who reflects on the particulars ſtated, with a full conviction of their truth, and then remains wholly unmoved, muſt be callous, and loſt to every honeſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of humanity.</p>
               <p>What, Gentlemen, is the nature of our complaint? Is it of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or of a peculiarly aggravated nature? Wearing himſelf out in the duties of his profeſſion, the Plantiff, like a ſaving <hi>Angel,</hi> arreſted the arms of Death, expoſing himſelf, when it was difficult which moſt to admire, the profundity of his profeſſional ſkill, or the vigor and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of his mind, that bore him up againſt the dread of infectious ſcenes, which the ſtouteſt Hero could not have approached without trembling. While thus employed, the foul attack is made; he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the world as a "Quack—Empyric—Potent Quack." and "Grand Empyric," and the confidence of his Patients is withdrawn; he is repreſented as either by deſign or ignorance, deſtroying "thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and tens of thouſands" of his fellow citizens. He is repreſented by this printer, as the exterminating Angel, going through the ſtreets and heaping dead bodies on each other, and practiſing little arts and tricks to ſupport his reputation, which would diſgrace even a moute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank.</p>
               <p>This is only an Epitome—The particulars I will detail to you as I go along.</p>
               <p>One of two things you muſt do; you muſt either ſay that the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given by Cobbett of Dr. Ruſh—that he is a Quack, Mountebank, &amp;c. is juſt, that he has, either from ignorance or a bad motive, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0057_100D32F33866BC68"/>
his fellow citizens, and deſerves to be baniſhed not only this city, but ſociety; or the alternative preſents itſelf—You muſt believe the ſuggeſtion is falſe and malicious, that his well earned character has been wreſted from him, for which the offender ſhould pay damages;—compenſatory they cannot be—out exemplary—ſuch as ſhould mark him hereafter as the moſt aggravated calumniator, and deteſtable of characters: one whom neither ſenſe of honor, of duty, or of propriety will reſtrain. Let the offender know that though the Law has <hi>Leaden</hi> feet, yet it has <hi>Iron</hi> hands: that though ſlow in its operations, it is direful when once it catches its prey.</p>
               <p>The charge conſiſts of theſe particulars:
<list>
                     <item>Firſt, The Publications.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Its Falſehood.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, its Malice.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>With regard to the publications, when you take the papers out with you, you will find them to be a <hi>burthen</hi> of defamation, ſo that his preſs groaned under the weight of—not to ſay "ribaldry" but the moſt ſevere, atrocious and indecent perſonal abuſe. You will pleaſe to obſerve that in this inſtance we do not purſue a <hi>Journeyman</hi> Printer, as in the caſe of Gen. Hamilton at N. York. There was ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence urged for pity; but here we bring before you the Printer and Editor; not the printer only, who may ſuffer an innocent victim, from the concealed name of his correſpondent, whom a ſenſe of honor may induce him to ſecrete, but the editor himſelf, who made it his conſtant practice to <hi>vilify</hi> and traduce the unoffending, and in theſe inſtances, the man whoſe upright conduct, and uſeful labors would have been ſuppoſed to remove him far even from <hi>suspicion</hi> of ill fame.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of reſorting to an Indictment where Dr. Ruſh might be a witneſs, we come fairly into the field with an action which puts the parties upon an equal footing. The queſtion is not now whether the truth may or may not be given in evidence, but we invite the conflict If William Cobbet can ſubſtantiate any thing againſt Dr. Ruſh, he may now come and do it; or he may come and juſtify himſelf if he can, but <hi>that</hi> he pretends not to do; the publications are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, although loaded with ſuch atrocious <hi>villainy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The defendant had his choice to <hi>take</hi> one of ſeveral courſes; he might ſay all theſe things were true, and pretend to ſubſtantiate them, or he might ſay he did not mean it as it has been conſtrued; or he might ſay "I have been very raſh and unguarded in my treatment of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured man, and upon reflection, I am at war with myſelf as much as you can be with me." But what has he done? He has undertaken to juſtify himſelf in the acts. I appeal to your honors whether it has not always been the practice in Pennſylvania, when a defendant has not endeavored to prove his diſavowal, but perſiſted in a juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf, and aggravation of his offence—whether in ſuch a caſe, the guilt appearing plain, the jury does not always give <hi>exemplary</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages? One of his Counſel ſpeaks of Dr. Ruſh as all but ſuper-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral—another <hi>hints</hi> and inſinuates, and damns by feint praiſe; and a
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0058_100D32F69C706540"/>
third acknowledges that the publications contain many untruths; that they are <hi>"Stuff, Nonsense and Ribaldry;"</hi> but he wiſhes to eaſe his client from the <hi>legal</hi> conſequences. If he contends that we do not put the right meaning upon his publications, then it muſt at laſt be left for us to underſtand their true meaning, except he can convince us otherwiſe. I therefore aſk you Gentlemen, where there is any thing to <hi>justify</hi> or <hi>palliate</hi> or whether they do not come up to the very <hi>climax</hi> of abuſe and vulgarity, more than I hope will ever appear again, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this, or any other country.</p>
               <p>A perfectly accurate idea of theſe publications, then, becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly neceſſary; and here, ſo far, I will accede to the wiſhes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by my learned opponents. I will not wander from the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; they ſhall form my text, and I will keep cloſe to it.</p>
               <p>I will analize it; I will diſſect it; I will contemplate it in different points of view, and reaſon upon theſe points; I will follow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant through all his windings, and at every turn prove malice upon him. Theſe publications furniſh an exhauſtleſs fund of obſervation, and ſhould I ſpeak a week there would yet remain more to be ſaid.</p>
               <p>Two poſitions ſtated by the firſt Counſel who ſpoke for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant muſt be kept conſtantly in view through this cauſe; That Doctor Ruſh diſpenſed his medicines, and adminiſtered the healing art to the beſt of his great abilities, and without even ſuſpicion as to his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—That the defence reſts upon this ground that the defendant has made a public diſcuſſion of a queſtion of general concern, free from perſonal abuſe of the plaintiff's moral or profeſſional character. The gentleman then, as if apprehenſive that his conceſſions might furniſh a weapon againſt himſelf, immediately adds that a little acrimony mixed with the diſquiſitions does not render it ſcandal, and that <hi>acrimony</hi> exiſted even among the Phyſicians themſelves.</p>
               <p>Much depends upon what name we give a thing. What the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen calls <hi>acrimony,</hi> I call <hi>slander</hi> and perſonal abuſe, with a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate deſign of demoliſhing the reputation of Dr. Ruſh.—God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is by ſome called <hi>a lucky hit,</hi> Piety <hi>superstition,</hi> Seduction and Debauchery <hi>gallantry,</hi> violence <hi>spirit,</hi> and the whole ſtore-houſe of <hi>defamation,</hi> here ranſacked for epithets of reproach, is denominated <hi>Acrimony!</hi> We may call any thing by a <hi>soft</hi> name, but that does not alter the nature of the thing. The Counſel in admitting the eminence in point of ſkill, and the purity of Heart of the Plaintiff, takes from the defendant all poſſibility of defence in attempting to lay its founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If Doctor Ruſh is thus deſervedly eminent, and if there can be no ſuſpicion of his integrity, and he has acted ſo uprightly in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon a diſeaſe, the moſt fatal that ever Providence inflicted upon a guilty world, with what temper ought a man to come forward and ſpeak of him? Certainly it ought to be with much deference and reſpect to his character and conduct. But even ſuppoſing he did fall into an error, ſhall he be held up to the world as the moſt remorſeleſs of murderers?</p>
               <p>We are told by the learned counſel on the other ſide that <hi>"Ridicule</hi> is the teſt of <hi>truth."</hi> I deny the poſition. This was the favorite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that Arch Deiſt Shafteſbury—driven from the field of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0059_100D32F82BDD2FE0"/>
and <hi>Argument,</hi> this was his only ſubterfuge in his attacks on Chriſtianity. It is poſſible, to be ſure, to render <hi>truth</hi> a <hi>ridicule;</hi> in the ſame manner you may dreſs a wiſe man in a fool's cap. This maxim, ſo long ago exploded by the greater part of mankind, muſt now be revived—its revival is worthy of the cauſe of the defendant!—The very goſpel of Heaven, by diſtorting its ſenſe, and by partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, may be made to appear ridiculous: But this is no teſt of its intrinſic merits.</p>
               <p>The law, however, has reſolved this queſtion: <hi>"You shall not, by a libel, or by writing, set a man in a ridiculous light"</hi>—the reaſon forms a part of the rule—it goes on, <hi>"and thereby diminish his reputation."</hi> 3 Blackſtone 125. The ſame doctrine is exemplified in the other books, and the law ſays expreſsly, that <hi>"you shall not make a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation even to impute to a man</hi> BOASTING <hi>and</hi> VAIN GLORY."—This is a principle laid down in Hawkins. Slander endeavors to creep behind every covert battery, and aſſumes every form—ſometimes it even pretends to praiſe and commend a man, for the very purpoſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing its venom. Gentlemen, the law ſays this is a libel; judges have ſaid ſo throughout the annals of every court, and ſhall <hi>we</hi> and <hi>juries</hi> affect not to underſtand what every illiterate man underſtands to be libellous?</p>
               <p>The principle of innocence in theſe publications, on account of their pretended diſquiſitions on the yellow fever, is not juſt; but if it was eſtabliſhed, it would not help the defendant. What diſcuſſion on the ſyſtem, or what reſpecting the treatment, or what that tends to ſhew that ſyſtem to be <hi>ridiculous,</hi> do you find in theſe publications? I will defy the counſel to point out a ſingle ſyllable either as to the <hi>nature, origin or treatment</hi> of the yellow fever; not a word even to ridicule the poſitions laid down!</p>
               <p>Does the ridicule appear to be aimed at the <hi>system</hi> or the profeſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>reputation</hi> and character of the phyſician! that, ſays Mr. Harper, is the queſtion. You may not, ſays he, combat the ſyſtem by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reputation of the practitioner.—So far we agree. To this teſt, thus furniſhed by the opponents counſel I appeal—If the defendant did enter into the nature and application of the remedies, I am quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed; but I think he did not. Let us ſee how he attacked the ſyſtem and not the man, as is pretended. The firſt publication intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced begins with two lines, wherein it is repreſented that Dr. Ruſh is one <hi>quack</hi> holding converſation with another. Now, gentlemen, I would ſubmit one queſtion to your underſtanding:—is it the ſyſtem that he calls a <hi>Potent Quack,</hi> or is it Dr. Ruſh? Is it the ſyſtem that he has ſtigmatized with the degrading epithet of <hi>Don Sangrado,</hi> or is it Dr. Ruſh perſonally?</p>
               <p>Who was this Don Sangrado?—Mr. Harper has told you in part—<hi>A Quack damned to everlasting fame,</hi> in the novel of Gil Blas.—What could be the meaning when it was applied to Dr. Ruſh? What would you think of it, if you were to be called Moſes Caſtello?—a man who practiſing merchandize, was arraigned and convicted of a <hi>fraud</hi> in this court. Would you put up with the inſult, merely becauſe the perſon who called you ſo, ſhould ſay "I was only diſcuſſing a queſtion of
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0060_100D32FA9F441EB0"/>
commerce?" If this was to be done in a public paper, would you treat it with ſilent contempt?</p>
               <p>William Cobbett, at the time he made theſe publications, whatever defence he has now ſet up to the contrary, did not mean to adopt the ſubterfuge which is now uſed. He meant to put it beyond all kind of doubt who he meant; for leſt <hi>all these names</hi> ſhould not be perfectly underſtood; as if ſome perſons would ſtill be at a loſs to know who he meant that <hi>dishonored his profession, and was not worthy the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;</hi> he proceeds on to the introduction of Spilſbury's advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which pretends with the ſame remedy to cure all manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, however different their nature, calling it firſt, "a puff equal to Dr. Ruſh's," and concluding "there, beat that if you can." Thus, you ſee, this <hi>Quack,</hi> this ridiculous <hi>Empyric</hi> is, forſooth, put upon the ſame footing with Dr. Ruſh!—It would inſult your underſtandings to inſinuate that this was not to degrade Dr. Ruſh. Nay, he expreſsly ſays in one of his public papers that <hi>he would demolish the fortress of his reputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, I aſk you whether it is the ſyſtem or the man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked? he loads the Dr. with all kinds of epithets which malice and ill nature could poſſibly invent; holding him up as a vain puffer; when the language of the law is expreſs that "you may not impute to a man vain boaſting." A child could not be at a loſs to underſtand the meaning of theſe attacks.—The idea of attacking the ſyſtem was an after thought; it originated in the ingenuity of the counſel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the defendant has never once ſaid that he underſtood it, or was able to produce an argument againſt it. It was not the ſyſtem which he attacked, when he aſcribed to Dr. Ruſh the vain boaſting practice of courting and making encomiums upon himſelf, and raiſing a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he did not deſerve, by writing letters and anſwering them himſelf, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What would you think of a man who would interfere in the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a cauſe, in which property to the amount of millions was depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in a caſe of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> that would tell you at the ſame time, he neither underſtood the cauſe, nor had ſtudied the merits of it, nor the guilt or innocence of the accuſed, and afterwards ſay he was only in jeſt, he was only laughing; would you not declare lie was like the man in holy writ, who "threw firebrands, arrows and death, and ſaid, <hi>I am only in sport?"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the queſtions which have been made, and which the learned counſel have exerted themſelves ſo much to overthrow, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Cobbett himſelf. In the dialogue between him and Dr. Cox, does he ſpeak as though he wiſhed to convince the public; as though he was attacking the ſyſtem only? No, he does not pretend to have ſpent a moments reflection either as to the ſyſtem, or the cauſe, but that <hi>he knew nothing at all about it,</hi> he was only laughing about it, as his learned counſel ſay! Here the "cloven foot" plainly appears, he acknowledges that if it had not been Dr. Ruſh who ſupported the mode of treatment, he ſhould not have troubled himſelf about it.</p>
               <p>"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh." Little thought he that he was furniſhing evidence againſt himſelf at the trail.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0061_100D32FD79E92648"/>
In September, 1797, he ſets out ſtigmatizing him with the epithet of "QUACK." Was not this the way to deſtroy his reputation, by writing him down, by making the people believe he was a quack? Will gentlemen contend this is not actionable? If he is a quack in the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, is he not to be preſumed a quack in every other diſeaſe? If a man undertakes to be a phyſician when he does not underſtand the nature or the cure of the diſorder, is that man to be truſted?</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid that Dr. Ruſh's perſon was not attacked becauſe his family was not. Who could be ignorant of the contemptible point of view in which Dr. Ruſh was held up at this time, and ſurely his family muſt be very anxious as to his fate, and the inſults he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent. This, to me, is a good proof that it was the medical ſkill of Dr. Ruſh that was attacked, for we find in other parts of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications that "Ruſh and <hi>the</hi> Ruſhites" are held in a very contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble point of view, not being able to diſtinguiſh between the ſmall pox and the yellow fever, and the declaration is made, that pregnant wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſent by them to the hoſpital, thus ſuggeſting but in terms which cannot be miſtaken, the groſs ignorance of this "Maſter Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er," this "Potent Quack."</p>
               <p>But ſay the Plaintiff's Counſel this is not particularly aimed at Dr. Ruſh; it refers to a whole claſs. But, Gentlemen, is it the <hi>less</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal becauſe the inſinuations extend to <hi>a whole class,</hi> inſtead of one individual? It is more a diſcuſſion of the ſyſtem on that account. No, it cannot act as an extenuation, but an aggravation of the ſlander.—Can you conceive that the introduction of Dr. Tilton, and this letter concerning him was neceſſary to the mere diſcuſſion of the ſyſtem? 'Tis true that no action has been brought by Dr. Tilton, but Cobbett appears to be following up his abuſe upon Dr. Ruſh by that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, repreſenting Dr. Tilton as a violent party man; mentioning him as ill formed, and that his judgment was wrong in as much as he miſtook a bruiſe on the arm of a woman for the yellow fever. He attacks him as a Ruſhite and a "Bleeder."—As one of the exterminating Daemons. Inſinuations, with ſo much explanation, are fully equal to direct attacks. What means the inſinuation "that dead men tell no tales," &amp;c. but that he delighted in deſtroying his fellow-creatures. That they are inſinuations does not deduct from the criminality. It is far worſe than open attack, becauſe it adds <hi>meanness</hi> to <hi>malice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words "Empyric" and "Quack," are uſed through his whole reflections on Dr. Ruſh. We may therefore, aſk what means the word "Quack?"</p>
               <p>"A boaſtful pretender to an art which he does not underſtand;—a vain boaſtful pretender to Phyſic; one who proclaims his own medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal abilities in public places. So the learned Addiſon explains it. Pope calls it "an artful tricking practitioner in phyſic."—"a mountebank; a bold and ignorant pretender to the art of phyſic." It is a word of a determined, aſcertained meaning, more ſo than even bankrupt to a merchant.—Thus illiberally has he treated Dr. Ruſh, but has not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained when bleeding ought, or ought not to be uſed; what is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and what exceſſive bleeding; nor an idea of the evils of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; but with the moſt inquiſitorial meanneſs, has blackened what he
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0062_100D3300D4303298"/>
could not attempt to confute. Can it be pretended that he was not well acquainted with the meaning of the words he uſed? No, for at another period we perceive him boaſting of his claſſical <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ading. He has deſignedly called Dr. Ruſh a boaſtful pretender to phyſic, an art which he did not underſtand; and this will appear from his falſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Doctor's conduct in writing letters, &amp;c. Indeed in one place he ſays, the "citizens were duped" by that gentleman's conduct. It therefore cannot be doubted that he has been guilty of a libel.</p>
               <p>While this profuſion of abuſe is heaping on an innocent head, his counſel think to leſſen his criminality by calling Doctor Ruſh a man as great as he is good. If they believe ſo, how inconſiſtent is their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the aſſaſſin of that great and good character!</p>
               <p>If you wiſh information whether theſe words are in themſelves acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable or not, the law is very explicit on that head. The very words are ſelected out in the elementary treatiſes; they are theſe: "words are in themſelves actionable which injure a man in his trade or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; ſuch as charge a want of honeſty or ability, &amp;c." To call a "phyſician a quack," is afterwards ſelected <hi>particularly.</hi> William Cobbett, who is ſtated by his counſel to be a man of ability and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no doubt knew this, and therefore, uſed the very expreſſions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by the law, to defy the utmoſt power of the object of his attack. The words go on, "or that he has killed a patient with his phyſic."—He has ſelected theſe two parts which are actionable; he has called him "a quack," and then he has gone on to the comparative and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative degree—"a potent quack and mountebank," and in order to complete the degradation, he adds that in his mode of treatment he has "killed his thouſands and tens of thouſands."</p>
               <p>But ſays my learned friend, this does not mean that <hi>he</hi> murdered them, but many died from this mode of treatment, and therefore it is only an attack upon the ſyſtem. What ſays may authority? "If a man ſays a Phyſician has killed his patients by his phyſic" <hi>the words are actionable.</hi> Though a man does not charge mudrer on the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, he is not excuſed, it is enough, if it implies that perſons were killed through ignorance; becauſe thereby he is not entitled to the confidence of his fellow citizens. The laws are not to be eluded by artful and ingenious conſtructions; you are the Judges, and can eaſily underſtand the expreſſions. Malice adopts an equivocal ambiguous ſtile, but if the "cloven foot" is diſcovered, if the veil is ſeen through, if the diſguiſe is diſcovered, the law ſtrips the ſheep's cloathing from the wolf, and expoſes him to indignation in his own natural deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>But, ſay gentlemen, whatever might have been ſaid, Dr. Ruſh has as much buſineſs as he can do, and therefore he is not injured.—Does this appear in evidence?—Is it fact?—I am authoriſed to ſay that his buſineſs has ſenſibly diminiſhed ſince the period at which the attack took place. But of this preſently.</p>
               <p>It is enough for me if I prove that the words are actionable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:037103_0063_100D33026171F360"/>
It is ſaid that much diſpute and acrimony was uſed in the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy among the Phyſicians, and that it was no wonder if Cobbett forgot decency when Dr. Ruſh himſelf treated his opponents with ſo much acrimony and ſeverity in his animadverſions.</p>
               <p>I do not ſee the force of this argument. If Doctor Ruſh <hi>had</hi> been guilty of even <hi>scandal</hi> in that diſquiſition, would that juſtify Cobbett to do ſo too? If he has been guilty of ſcandal, let him ſuffer for it from a due courſe of law. But has Dr. Ruſh, from the beginning to the end of what has been read of his diſcuſſion of the ſyſtem, ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized any Phyſician as a Quack? No, but he reſpectfully calls them his brethren and treats them with tenderneſs. He was learned on the ſubject, and was a proper perſon to lead the public opinion: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has occaſionally forgotten himſelf in ſpeaking of a countrary ſyſtem, he may be excuſed in part.</p>
               <p>I ſay again if no injury, why take theſe methods if an injury, why not redreſs by law? My character—my profeſſional and moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter attacked with the venom and art of a daemon—my daily bread about to be taken from me—the ſubſiſtence for my family in danger of being loſt to me—a head covered with grey hairs—fortune gone in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money—prime of life paſſed in the revolutionary army—and law allow me no remedy: then the bands of ſociety are rent aſunder—I am in a ſtate of nature, let me ſeek my private revenge, and I am ſatisfied without the aid of courts—Oh no if theſe meaſures are purſued I ſhall be puniſhed—William Cobbett however ready to violate the law him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf we know is in the habit of appealing to law for his protections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt force and even againſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The counſel for the defendant then ſoftened and we are told that the only conſolation left us under all this injury is ſilent contempt—ſtrange inconſiſtency—if a man takes my purſe, value of one ſhilling—laws and courts and juries give me remedy—but if he robs me of my good name, which ne'er enriches him, but makes me poor indeed, my only redreſs it is ſaid is ſilent contempt.</p>
               <p>If the evil extended, only to myſelf, the remedy the gentleman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, though much worſe than bleeding or mercury, might be more palatable; but if I allow myſelf to be brought into diſrepute in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to be conſidered as a Quack, as a pretender to knowledge in Phyſic which I don't poſſeſs, my buſineſs will leave me, and my family ſtarve—my wife be reduced to diſtreſs—my daughters expoſed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, my ſons be deprived of education and myſelf left a miſerable object of deluſion and pity.</p>
               <p>It is true, as the learned gentleman obſerved the ſame words, if ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken are not actionable which are ſo when written or printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed—the poiſon is in that way infinitely more diſſeminated—3 Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone 126, words ſpoken to me in the ſtreets, may not be actionable, which if reduced to writing, are ſo, the words in the inſtance of the young lady, who recovered £4000 ſterling damages, would not have been actionable if they had merely been ſpoken, the publication of actiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words imply malice, unleſs explained by the defendant.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary however that we ſhould ſhew the circumſtances of the caſe, in order to eſtimate the nature of the offence. Theſe poſitions
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0064_100D2DF46367BC68"/>
laid down, I ſhall undertake to ſhew that the defendant was determined to ruin Dr. Ruſh as a <hi>Physician,</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>"Republican."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think it is perfectly evident that he was not actuated by any motive to diſcuſs any ſyſtem for the cure of the yellow-fever.—Let us examine the facts. The defendant began his preſs early in 1796: the ſentiments of Dr. Ruſh and his mode of treatment were perfectly notorious in 1793. I call upon the counſel, even at this late hour, to ſhew one word about Dr. Ruſh in that paper previous to the eulogium in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1796—immediately afterwards the defendant thinks him "too republican," and he ſays "damn him, I will attack him for it." I argue, the medical ſyſtem of Dr. Ruſh being well known in 1793, why did he wait till the ſpring of 1797 before he threatened, and till the September following before he executed his threat? Not a ſingle word about his republican principles! I know the ingenious turn that was endeavored to be given to theſe words—<hi>that he would attack the principle.</hi> No, gentlemen, the witneſs would not give the anſwer in that way: no, ſaid he, he diſapproved of the principle and he would attack HIM for it.</p>
               <p>I truſt we are all Republicans—Is there a man who hears me that does not feel and indignation in his breaſt that an <hi>alien</hi> ſhould abuſe him becauſe he is a republican! The citizen of the United States who is not a republican, is a traitor. I am by choice a republican;—I am ſo by oath: The conſtitution of the United States is a republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can form of government, and a republican form of government is guaranteed to each State.</p>
               <p>But ſays the gentleman, there is a ſenſe in which <hi>republicanism</hi> is aſſumed, it may mean <hi>democrat</hi> or <hi>sans cullotte:</hi> But I aſk, do they ſhow any paragraph in his writings or any action of his life in which he does not avow himſelf a <hi>republican,</hi> not in forced, but in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional ſenſe of the word. When a term is uſed, of determinate ſenſe in the conſtitution of my country, I ought to be underſtood in that ſenſe. And has Dr. Ruſh from the memorable day on which he voted for, and ſigned the declaration of our independence, till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment ever proved himſelf to be any other than a <hi>republican</hi> in the conſtitutional ſenſe? The inſinuations of his deviation might have been ſpared, ſince they are totally void of foundation. But republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniſm is the whole extent of the offence for which he is to be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted while living, and his very aſhes raked up to obtain a vindictive ſatisfaction upon his mangled memory after his death! And for all this ſhall we ſay, Go, and take a boxing match with William Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett? No, gentlemen, courts and juries will give a righteous and honorable deciſion.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder at his reſentment againſt Dr. Ruſh: he is one of thoſe who in the language of the Preſident of the United States, have <hi>done too much, suffered too much, and succeeded too well</hi> in our glorious ſtruggle for liberty, ever to be forgiven. Gentlemen, I conceive an appeal to your feelings to be fair, becauſe by temperate deductions I have eſtabliſhed facts:—I ſee the ſun ſhine, and the ſhowers deſcend—I afterwards ſee the graſs grow: I thence form a natural concluſion that one is the cauſe, the other the effect.

gentlemen, that it was the political opinion he threatened to Dr. Dewees to attack, will not do: no, he muſt approach under a maſked battery: the political ſentiment was the real ground of the offence. When the threat was made, the opportunity to execute it was wanting; he therefore ſuffered the malice to lie in his breaſt, until one the moſt fit that could poſſibly occur made its appearance: one which could not poſſibly at the time of the threat have entered into the contemplation of the defendant. But the meaſure was reſolved on—the death war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was prepared—a more fit opportunity could not have been wiſhed for than the fever of 1797 in one reſpect, nor one leſs fit in another. We cannot reflect on the ſituation of our deplorable city at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and not be ſtruck with horror at the recollection. We ſee the patient in extreme diſtreſs, ſtretched on his bed of ſickneſs; phyſicians themſelves at a loſs how to relieve that diſtreſs. It was at this event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful period. William Cobbett began his malevolent attacks; tending to withdraw the confidence of the unhappy patients from their phyſician, and thus doubling their affliction.</p>
               <p>Farther. This attack was not only threatened, but with violence; he aſſigns his reaſon, "Damn him, I will attack him for it."—The reputation of Dr. Ruſh was intimately connected with his political ſentiments, and therefore he attacks the phyſician.—It is obſervable, that when he firſt threatens the attack, ſo far was he from being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by a wiſh to repel an improper mode of practice in Dr. Ruſh as a phyſician, that in that character he ſpeaks of him as liable to no exception: He wiſhes him to confine himſelf wholly to his practice as a phyſician, and not to meddle with politics. But Dr. Ruſh was his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. "Malice rankles in his heart," and a few expreſſions which find their way out now and then, prove it to be deep rooted.—He confeſſed he knew nothing about the practice.</p>
               <p>Doctors Griffith and Phyſic, commonly made uſe of the medicine and practice of Dr. Ruſh, and to as great a degree, but they had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no eulogium; they had made no uſe of any <hi>republican</hi> expreſſions, and therefore they eſcaped without a ſingle remark. Farther than that, Cobbett employed a family phyſician of the ſame ſchool: Dr. Dewees, who followed the ſame mode of treatment, attended on the family. All this proves the meaning of the words uſed to Dr. Cox: that if it had not been ſupported by Dr. Ruſh, he ſhould not have troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about it.</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons, gentlemen, I think I may preſume, without the poſſibility of a doubt, that you will be of the opinion, that the action is well founded: that the words are, in themſelves, <hi>actionable,</hi> and that they imply <hi>malice.</hi> But we have not reſted on the legal ground, as we might with ſafety: we have gone farther, we have ſhewn that perſonal reſentment inſtigated to the malicious attack, and that it was the ſole and entire motive.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I do not wiſh to introduce domeſtic ſcenes unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; but ſurely when we contemplate injuries and damages ſuſtained, we may, at leaſt, relate what effect it might probably have on the family. Doctor Ruſh was engaged amidſt ſcenes of danger and death; not only expoſed to, but actually attacked by that dreadful diſeaſe.

His family were reſiding in the country. Inſtead of receiving letters from him, <hi>his affliction was so severe he could not write,</hi> ſuppoſe they receive theſe papers, in which he is ſtigmatized a "murderer" and "quack" and though he might ſurvive the contagion, his character ſhould remain aſperſed and his memory after his death. So undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing public confidence.—Would this have no effect on his family?</p>
               <p>We have heard much about the liberty of the preſs. I think I would not yield to any man in ſincere eſtimation of that invaluable right; I conſider it the <hi>eye</hi> of our political body, and I would much rather a ſpeck a ſmall blemiſh ſhould remain, than that by a raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful operation the noble organ itſelf ſhould receive an injury. But it is difficult to run the preciſe line in compoſing the happy medium which the conſtitution has formed for the ſupport of every thing which is dear to a citizen. In the conſtitution formed for Corſica, vide annual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of 1794 p. 90 are theſe words: "The liberty of the preſs is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, but the abuſe of it is left to the law." Private reputation and character is protected by the conſtitution, the great fundamental law of this ſtate.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I acknowledge that this caſe, now about to be decided by you, is one of the moſt important ever intruſted to a jury of this country. It is true that for a long time paſt the licentiouſneſs of the preſs has been extreme: neither the government nor individuals have eſcaped: no merit of character has ſcreened the individual from attack through that medium. It is therefore that you ought to keep a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy watch over thoſe intruſions upon the good order of ſociety, for it is with you to protect character and government, which if you neglect, like the droppings of rain on a ſtone, it will wear it imperceptibly away: though the progreſs be ſlow, the effect is certain.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you muſt take human nature as you find it, and we ſhould not better it had we the power of formation: of the law does not give ſatisfaction for injuries, it is a ſentiment written on the heart of man that <hi>he will obtain it,</hi> and no law will then ſtop his reſentment. Of what avail, it will be argued, was it for me to reſtrain the impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my temper and a await the courſe pointed out by the laws of my country: In vain do I reſpect them unleſs damages are given ſufficient to ſtop the progreſs of a groſs offence.—You will have no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of this ſort, but they will be obtained in another, and moſt fatal way, if the law is not ſufficiently ſtrong to curb it.</p>
               <p>In England we find that juries underſtood this ſubject perfectly well.—Mr. Tilghman ſays it was a general warrant which affected the individual liberty which made them ſo ſevere in the caſes referred to. The judge ſaid it ought to be exemplary in order to protect the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charta: ſo we ſay. So ought you to ſay in your verdict: it is not the injury ſuſtained by Dr. Ruſh by the number of patients he has loſt. The gentleman read the declaration and made ſome obſervations upon the <hi>blanks.</hi> He ſays no ſpecial damages are laid. Are we to run about to enquire who never came to Dr. Ruſh on this account? If that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, it may as well be ſaid at once that we ſhall have no damages, and that men ſhall publiſh what they pleaſe with impunity!</p>

As I obſerved before, in England juries underſtand this matter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well. If a libel involves the public peace and good, ſpecific injuries are not conſidered. In the caſe of a young lady whoſe chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity was attacked, 40<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0£ was awarded.</p>
               <p>I hope Dr. Ruſh will not have to ſay as a gentleman in Scotland once ſaid, <q>Oh that I had brought forward this trial in England, for there the Jury would take care the verdict ſhould be ſuch as would do honor to their impartiality.</q> Gentlemen, the precedent cannot fail to have a deſirable effect, if you give ſuitable damages. Inſtances ſeldom occur in Pennſylvania of this nature, but in one not long ſince the Jury proved that they will knew the importance of private charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: a perſon was proceeded againſt <hi>ex parte</hi> by one of the German religious ſocieties, and excluded. The proceeding was entered upon the books of the Society. As it was an attack upon character, the man brought an action, and the Jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff of 500£. damages. Cafe, Stock againſt the German corporation.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, conſider the ſituation of Dr. Ruſh at the time of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact;—a Phyſician of conſiderable ability in his art—at a period when his whole attention was doubtleſs engaged for the advantage of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable city: when not an <hi>Herb</hi> nor <hi>Drug</hi> eſcaped his utmoſt reſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; when not a part of the Human Syſtem but he pryed into; all his learning, all his ingenuity on the full ſtretch. The life of thouſands in his hands, an important charge! Surrounded with difficulties, and thus indefatigably engaged he is repreſented as the moſt deſpicable of the human race. I aſk you, gentlemen, whether this did not diſable him from proſecuting his important purſuits? much of cure in ſuch deplorable ſituations, depend on the confidence of the patient in his Phyſician, often more than in medicine: we know how much ſmall ſhocks affect the mind ſo weakened by diſeaſe.—Who can tell what numbers periſhed from theſe publications in this way?</p>
               <p>We are told that though Dr. Ruſh has his merit, he no doubt had his reward. I aſk how he could receive his reward? among what claſs of perſons did his practice extend? We well know that the rich had left the city, and therefore the thouſands upon whom he attended could not pay him: it would have been to his advantage to have left the city, for a man of his eminence could have commanded buſineſs any where, but his point was to diſcover if poſſible, an alleviation of the general diſtreſs by examining and exploring this new ſpecies of diſeaſe, which has ſo often baffled the utmoſt ſkill of talents.</p>
               <p>As to the merit of the defendant. It is ſaid that he was of great uſe at a certain time in giving an alarm to the citizens of this country againſt foreign influence. I will tell you how far he went, and no farther: <hi>He did not wish to destroy, but to change this foreign influence.</hi> He wiſhed to deſtroy it when it came from one foreign country, and place it on another. But to Americans ſenſible of the high deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies of their country, what is it from whom the influence comes? it ought to be wholly deſtroyed, come whence it may from France or from Britain.</p>
               <p>I do not know that I need take up your time in referring to the opinion <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the plaintiff in other countries: ſuffice it to ſay
<pb facs="unknown:037103_0068_100D330D5C877398"/>
that almoſt every Philoſophical and medical ſociety in the world have honored his character. He is an honorary member of almoſt every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in Europe, or in the world. Dr. Trotter, the celebrated Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian in England ſpeaks of him in terms ſtrongly indicative of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in which he is held abroad.</p>
               <p>Although ſo great is his character and reputation, yet I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the caſe is between A. plaintiff and B. defendant. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your verdict muſt be according to evidence and juſtice, yet you muſt not be unmindful of character in order duly to eſtimate the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. If Dr. Ruſh had not obtained a well earned reputation, I ſhould not be preſſing upon you to bear teſtimony to that character by exemplary damages, but the malevolent deſign, the ſpite and the ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is much blackened by the uprightneſs of character procured and preſerved for many year by the plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen I thank you for your attention—I muſt in my concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beg you to conſider the great evils of <hi>slander.</hi> Permit me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt its definition. Amongſt all the offences that degenerate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind can commit is one of the greateſt: there is nothing that an honeſt and brave man has ſo much to fear.</p>

                  <hi>Man need not dread a worse foe—it stabs with a word—It is the PESTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENCE walking in darkness, spreading CONTAGION far and wide, which the most cautious traveller cannot avoid.—COURAGE cannot defend against its insidious attacks—It is the heart searching DAGGER of the dark AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SASSIN.—It is the poisoned ARROW whose wound is incurable.—It is the mortal sting of the deadly ADDER:—nor GOVERNMENT nor OFFICER nor INDIVIDUAL can resist its fatal effects without the aid of LAW.—MUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER is its employment; INNOCENCE and MERIT its prey, and RUIN its SPORT.</hi>
