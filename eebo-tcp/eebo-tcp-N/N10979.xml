            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is with the greateſt propriety I addreſs this paper to you: It is in your defence, at this great, this important criſis I take the pen in hand: A criſis big with the fate of the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious empire known in the records of time; and by your firmneſs and reſolution, you may preſerve to yourſelves, your immediate offspring, and lateſt poſterity, all the glorious bleſſings of freedom given by Heaven to undeſerving mortals; by your ſupineneſs and puſillanimity, you will entail on yourſelves, your children, and millions yet unborn, miſery and ſlavery.</p>
            <p>It is in your defence I now ſtand forth to oppoſe the moſt ſanguinary and deſpotic court that ever diſgraced a free country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:013898_0002_0F9257EBA84FBF78"/>
It is in your defence I now unſheath the ſword of juſtice, to oppoſe the moſt profligate and abandoned adminiſtration that ever ſhewed the weakneſs, or abuſed the confidence of a prince.</p>
            <p>It is in your defence I now ſtand forth, and with a firmneſs becoming an Engliſhman determined to be free, to oppoſe every arbitrary and every uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional act of a venal and corrupt majority ſmuggled into the preſent new fangled court par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, through the villany of Lord North, and purchaſed with the public money, to betray their truſt, enſlave the people, ſubvert the Proteſtant religion, and deſtroy the glory, honor, intereſt, and commerce, both foreign and domeſtic, of England and America; and all this villanous ſacrifice of a great empire, a brave people, and the glorious truths of Heaven, to comply with the ambitious views, and gratify the mean vindictive ſpirit of one, aſſiſted by a numerous train of deputy tyrants, whoſe ſole aim has been to trample under foot the ſacred rights of mankind, and the Engliſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</p>
            <p>It is in your defence, and in defence of the liberties of my country, that I now ſtand forth, with a fixed reſolution, to oppoſe, and ſhew to the world, unawed by fear, the dangerous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of every act of lawleſs power, whether it ſhall proceed from the King, the Lords, or the Commons.</p>
            <p>I will endeavour, in conjunction with my fellow laborer in this great work, to reſcue the liberty of the preſs (that bulwark of freedom) from the ruin with which it is now threatened by ſpecial ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Middleſex, and the arbitrary deciſions of a Scotch Chief Juſtice, the glorious advocate for
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013898_0003_0F9257ED533C58D0"/>deſpotic ſway. The heavy fines, and cruel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of the two Woodfalls, without even the appearance of guilt, and contrary to the intention of the jury, will be faithfully recorded by the pen of truth, and fill many pages in the black catalogue of Murray's
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Mansfield's name is Murray.</note> crimes.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be my endeavour, in this degenerate age, to revive the dying embers of freedom, and rouſe my countrymen in England from that lethargic ſtate of ſupineneſs and inattention, in which they ſeem to ſleep, at this time of national danger, when a mighty kingdom, and all the deareſt rights of men are haſtening to their ruin; that they may yet ſtand high on the roll of fame, equal with their brave and virtuous brethren in America, who are now ſtruggling in the glorious cauſe of liberty, againſt the cruel oppreſſions and deſtructive deſigns of exalted villains, whoſe actions will be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to poſterity in characters of blood, and their names for ever branded with eternal marks of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy; while America will remain the glory and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the world, and be held in the higheſt veneration to the end of time. Let not the long envied glory of Britain, O my countrymen, be eclipſed by the virtuous actions of the Americans in the new world! Our danger is the ſame, their cauſe is our cauſe; with the conſtitutional rights of America muſt fall the liberties of England; let us then, ſhew ourſelves equal to them in virtue, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, firmneſs, and reſolution; and, as they have done, prove to the world, we are alike enemies to tyranny, and lawleſs power, and that we never will be ſlaves to one, nor to a majority of five hundred and eighty-eight tyrants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:013898_0004_0F9257EDC0EFBF00"/>
We will ſtrain every nerve, and brave every danger, to ſtimulate our countrymen on this ſide the Atlantic, to a noble exertion of their rights as freemen; to ſhew them the danger, as well as the infamy of remaining quiet ſpectators of their own deſtruction; and to remove that dark cloud of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which now obſcures the glorious light of freedom; and, but for the virtue of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, would ages ago have overwhelmed this kingdom, like the ſtates around us, in a long, a laſting night of miſery and ruin.</p>
            <p>Upon this plan, and with theſe principles, we ſet out, and intend to proceed, that the preſent (if not too far degenerated) and future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may enjoy undiminiſhed all the bleſſings of liberty. To accompliſh this end, we will riſk every thing that is dear to man, and brave both royal and miniſterial vengeance, to preſerve from ruin (if poſſible) the natural rights of mankind, the ſacred conſtitution of the Britiſh empire, and the freedom of our country.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to our motto we ſhall ever think, "Liberty with danger preferable to ſervitude with ſecurity."</p>
            <p>We ſhould glory in the ſmiles of our Sovereign, but will never purchaſe them at the expence of our liberty; nor will we ever give up, but with our lives, the right to expoſe and publicly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, in all its hideous forms, the cruel deſpotiſm of tyrants. We can conceive no reaſon why the laws and religion of England ſhould be ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and trampled under foot, by a Prince of the Houſe of Brunſwick any more than by one of the Houſe of Stuart; ſurely upon every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of juſtice, reaſon, and common ſenſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013898_0005_0F9257EE8BD07D88"/>is tyranny and murder in one man, is equally ſo in another; and if it is juſt to oppoſe and reſiſt one, it is as juſt to oppoſe and reſiſt the other. It is not a name, nor an office, however import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, that can or ought t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bring reſpect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the poſſeſſor, while he acts below, and is unworthy of them. Folly and villany ought to have no aſylum; nor can titles ſanctify crimes, though in our days they protect criminals. A royal, right honourable, or a right reverend robber, is the moſt dangerous robber, and conſequently the moſt to be deteſted.</p>
            <p>Our modern advocates for vallany and ſlavery have found out a new way of arguing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the judgments of men; they make nice diſtinctions without a difference, and tell the world what was tyranny in the time of Charles the Firſt is not tyranny in the days of George the Third, and to this they add a long catalogue of virtues which he never poſſeſſed; they ſay he is pious, that his chief aim is to render his ſubjects a happy, great, and free people (and indeed he has more than once ſaid ſo himſelf) theſe and many other falſehoods, equally wicked and abſurd, they endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil into the minds of the too eaſily deluded Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. Theſe, and ſuch like artifices, have ever been made uſe of in the reigns of arbitrary Kings, to deceive the people, and make them with more eaſe, and to chains well poliſhed, ſubmit their necks, and even reverence and adore the hand that rivets them. Thus do tyrants ſucceed, and the galling yoke of ſlavery, ſo much complained of by almoſt every nation in the world, becomes a crime of the firſt magnitude in the people, through their own credulity and vile ſubmiſſion. Truth, in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013898_0006_0F9257EF46268A08"/>ſpite of all the falſe colouring of venal writers, ſpeaks a different language, and declares in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the pen of falſehood, that bloodſhed and ſlaughter, violence and oppreſſion, popery and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs power, characteriſe the preſent reign; and we will defy even the penſioned Johnſon, after the cloſeſt examination of the two reigns, to tell which is the beſt. Charles broke his coronation oath, butchered his ſubjects, made ten thouſand ſolemn promiſes he never intended to perform, and often committed perjury (but theſe are no crimes in a King, for moſt Kings pretend a divine right to be Devils) he tried to overturn the conſtitution by force, but found his miſtake when it was too late, and that even royal villany does not always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and when the juſt vengeance of Heaven overtook him, he ſaw (though he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it before, and imagined he had a divine right to ſhed human blood) that the ſame power which raiſed him up, could pull him down. The preſent Sovereign, not wiſhing to make a figure in hiſtory without a head, and being more mild and gentle, juſt and good, has improved upon the plan, and is now tearing up the conſtitution by the roots, under the form of law; this method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is certainly much ſafer, and more judicious, as well as juſt; for what right can an Engliſhman have to complain, when he is legally made a ſlave by act of parliament. How wicked! how rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious! muſt the Americans be, and what levelling principles muſt they poſſeſs, to reſiſt the divine right of the King, and the divine power of the Lords and Commons, under the ſanction of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine act of parliament, ſent from heaven to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, butcher, ſtarve or enſlave them; juſt as it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013898_0007_0F9257F006ED50C0"/>ſhall come into their divine heads, or the heads of their divine inſtruments; and when once they have carried this divine law into execution, according to their righteous intention, we ſhall ſoon ſee on this ſide the Atlantic, that they have the ſame divine right to uſe us in the ſame merciful and divine manner. This is but the firſt divine ſtep of a diabolical plan for ſhedding human blood, reducing an induſtrious, brave, flouriſhing, and free people, from a ſtate of affluence to that of miſery, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, and ſlavery; and nothing but a reſolution in the people here will be able to prevent the next divine ſtep on the ſame plan, from laying in ruins all the rights of the Britiſh, with thoſe of the American world.</p>
            <p>The altar of deſpotiſm is erected in America, and we ſhall be the next victims to lawleſs power; all the horrors of ſlavery now ſtare us in the face; our religion ſubverted, freedom, law, and right, artfully undermined; the Roman catholic religion not tolerated, but eſtabliſhed; a majority of the Houſe of Commons, and the Houſe of Lords, mere creatures of the King; in ſhort, every engine of oppreſſion and arbitrary power is at work to accompliſh our ruin.</p>
            <p>O, my countrymen! that we could but inſpire you with noble ſentiments of LIBERTY, rouſe you to a juſt ſenſe of your immediate danger, and make you feel, ſenſibly feel, all the bleſſings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from freedom, the natural right of every man, but more peculiarly of Engliſhmen; it is our birthright, our inheritance; it was handed down to us by our anceſtors, and ſealed often with their blood; let us then, in juſtice to them, to ourſelves, and to poſterity, make a noble conſtitutional ſtand,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013898_0008_0F9257F0BB47CBE8"/>in conjunction with our noble and ſpirited, but ſuffering fellow ſubjects in America, againſt the preſent plan long fixed by the minions of power to deſtroy it, and overturn the conſtitution, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ten thouſand times ſuperior to any ſyſtem ever deviſed by the Greeks or Romans.</p>
            <p>At ſuch a time as this, when the mercileſs, the relentleſs hand of tyranny is tearing out the vitals of freedom, ſapping the foundation of public ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, making a mockery of juſtice, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the envied rights of Britain and the truths of Heaven; I ſay, at ſuch a time, to be inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or inactive, is infamy; and he who can tamely ſee his country upon the brink of ruin, without putting out his arm, and lending a helping hand to reſcue her from deſtruction, muſt be an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned wretch, a diſgrace to the name of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and to his country.</p>
