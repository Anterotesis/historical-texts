            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Vindication of the ſovereign Decrees of God.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Beloved Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALTHOUGH we ſhould endeavour to avoid all needleſs contention, yet the <hi>faith once delivered to the ſaints,</hi> is ſometimes treated in ſuch a manner, as to make it our incumbent duty, <hi>earneſtly</hi> and publickly to <hi>contend for it.</hi> Such a caſe I think is preſented before us, by means of a printed paper lately ſpread in Providence, and towns adjacent, which you have requeſted me to make ſome remarks upon. It begins in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>On Traditionary Zeal.</hi> Some good chriſtian paſtors will not ſcruple to tell you, that they could find no joy in their own ſtate, no ſtrength or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their labours of love towards their flocks, but becauſe they <hi>know, and are aſſured,</hi> from St. Paul, that God never had, nor ever will have, <hi>mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men;</hi> but that an unknown multitude of them are, through all ages of the world, inevitably decreed to the eternal fire and damnation of hell: and that an unknown number of others are elected to a certain, irreſiſtible ſalvation. Wonder not, my friends, if the <hi>inquiſition</hi> has its pious defenders: For inquiſition cruelty, and every barbarity that muſt have an end, <hi>is mere mercy,</hi> if compared with this reprobation doctrine. And to be in love with
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012656_0003_0F8BBE2507EE4218"/>it, to draw ſweet comfort from it, and to wiſh it God-ſpeed, is a love that abſolutely forbids the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our neighbour as ourſelves, and makes the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-wiſh, <hi>that all men might be ſaved,</hi> no leſs than a rebellion againſt God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This writer's evident deſign, is againſt the doctrine of particular election, and efficacious grace in our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and againſt thoſe who preach it: And he takes the ſame method that the heathen perſecutors did with the primitive chriſtians, viz. To cover them with ſkins of wild beaſts, in order that they might be devoured by dogs, or if not, yet that they might be hated and avoided by all men. He aſſerts that ſome chriſtian peſtors tell their people ſuch a ſtory as he has here related; if he can find any man upon earth that teaches ſo, he is welcome to correct him as much as he deſerves; but till he exhibits his proof, he ought to be accounted a blaſphemer of God's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, and a falſe-accuſer of Chriſt's miniſters. Yea, out of his own mouth he is condemned; for as ſhort as his paper is, he has not been able to keep to one conſiſtent ſtory, but the ſame preachers that he accuſes of rejoicing that God never will have mercy upon all men, when he comes to give us their own language, it is, "O the ſweetneſs of God's election!" And neither the devil nor any of his children, will ever be able to make a rejoicing in God's <hi>everlaſting love to a choſen number,</hi> to be the ſame thing, as it would be to rejoice in the deſtruction of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Our Lord ſays, <hi>Every one that doth evil, bateth the light; but he that doth truth, cometh to the light;</hi> and let the reader judge which of theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters ſuits the conduct of the writer before us. He caſts out theſe horrid accuſations againſt ſome good
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012656_0004_0F8BBE25E6029358"/>chriſtian paſtors, without naming any one, while his evident aim is againſt all that profeſs a ſweetneſs in ſovereign election; at the ſame time (like the Savages) he tries to keep himſelf and his principles hid.— Though it fares with him as it did with the old ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>ſure foundation</hi> which God has <hi>laid in Zion;</hi> whoſe bed was ſhorter than that a man could ſtretch himſelf upon it, and the covering narrower than that he could wrap himſelf in it, Iſa. 28. For though by the title of his piece he would have peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eſteem him, as a bold champion againſt <hi>tradition,</hi> and a friend to Paul, and the ſacred <hi>writings;</hi> yet he does not ſo much as attempt to prove, that ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign decrees, and irreſiſtable grace, are not fully taught by them. No, inſtead of confuting us, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſending himſelf, by the ſacred oracles, he, like thoſe who propheſied out of the <hi>deceit of their own hearts,</hi> firſt makes his addreſs to mens paſſions, and exerts all his art to bring up the horrid ideas, of an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decreeing of multitudes to hell fire; of cruelty vaſtly worſe than the <hi>inquiſition;</hi> of God's ſacrifyſing of myriads of his creatures to the devil, &amp;c. and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done his utmoſt thus to raiſe a tempeſt in the ſouls of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he winds up by aſſerting that, <q>The only poſſible way of avoiding every prevailing er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and of finding every ſaving truth, is to liſten, ſolemnly, attentively to liſten, agreeable to the written word, to the <hi>ſtill ſmall voice within you.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is juſt like the old ſerpent, who with malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflections upon God's government, and lying pretences of friendſhip to man, drew him into rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God's <hi>revealed will,</hi> and to gratify his own <hi>heart's luſts.</hi> Yet from that day to this, when the tempter thinks it will ſerve his turn, he is very ready to catch at ſome ſcripture <hi>words,</hi> to intice
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012656_0005_0F8BBE26492EDC50"/>people into violations of the <hi>truth</hi> which is therein taught.</p>
            <p>Let the pretended advocate for truth now before us, mean what he will by the <hi>voice within,</hi> yet when he or any others are brought ſolemnly and attentively to liſten, either to reaſon, conſcience, or the Spirit of God, they will teach them, that the way to avoid error, and to find the truth in any caſe, is not firſt to inflame our paſſions before our judgments are well informed. No, for a gift will blind the eyes of the wiſe, and pervert the words of the righteous; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt have our eye ſingle, or elſe our <hi>whole</hi> body will be <hi>full of darkneſs.</hi> Hence appears the neceſſity of the holy Spirit, to renew us in the ſpirit of our minds, and to guide our ſouls into all truth.</p>
            <p>The grand conteſt ever ſince ſin entred into the world, has been between the will of the Creator, and the will of the creature; but as it is too ſhocking for human nature to have it openly appear in that light, God's enemies in all ages, have <hi>made lies their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and under falſhood have hid themſelves.</hi> And in the controverſy before us, we may take notice of the following refuges of lies, which the enemies of ſovereign grace try to hide themſelves in.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the ſacred writers often appealed to mens reaſon and conſcience, and exhorted the ſaints to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the teachings of the holy Spirit in their ſouls, above all human authority on earth, deceivers of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious denominations have catcht at, and perverted that ſacred cuſtom, as a plea for ſetting up a ſtandard <hi>in themſelves</hi> to decide every caſe, ſo as not to admit any thing for truth that does not agree with their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teſt.</hi> But it is well known in our nation, that in order for us to enjoy our juſt rights and liberties,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012656_0006_0F8BBE27104AF988"/>rulers as well as ſubjects muſt be governed by known laws and eſtabliſhed rules; and that for judges to aſſume a diſcretionary power to diſpenſe with old laws, or to make new ones as occaſion ſerved, would introduce arbitrary government, or rather a cruel ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanny. And were not people deluded with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious names, and great ſwelling words of deceivers, all their attempts to ſet up a <hi>voice within,</hi> which ſpeaks in any reſpects contrary to God's <hi>written word,</hi> would appear as arbitrary and tyrannical as any ſuch proceedings of earthly judges can be. Thoſe holy men whom God employed to write his word, had their authority ſo to do <hi>confirmed by divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and wo to that man who preſumes either to add to, or take from thoſe holy oracles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The advocates for their own free-will in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſovereign grace, have determined that the doctrine of fixed decrees in the divine mind concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the future ſtate of men, is inconſiſtent with the liberty of their own wills, and with the proper influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of precepts and promiſes, rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and having quoted a number of precepts, with conſiderations to enforce them, (of which the Bible is full) they boaſt that they have gained their argument, when in truth they have never touched the point in debate. We know and as firmly hold as any free-willer on earth, that all men are under moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where precepts and promiſes, exhortations, warnings, &amp;c. have their proper place, and ought to influence us in all our conduct; and I believe from the bottom of my heart, that God never did nor ever will puniſh any but the guilty, and that he will finally reward every man according to his works. But in the preſent controverſy, the true ſtate of the queſtion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012656_0007_0F8BBE27DAA39098"/>is this, viz. Whether the whole plan of God's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the final iſſue of every action through the univerſe, has not been known and fixed in his counſels from the beginning, ſo that <hi>nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it?</hi> Eccl. 3.14. Or whether many events are not held in ſuſpence and uncertainty in his infinite mind, till they are decidedby the free-will power of men? We hold the firſt, they the laſt ſide of this queſtion. But inſtead of attending to the true ſtate of the controverſy, and inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the deciſion of it to the divine oracles, <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> has carried them into the way which this writer perſues, of repreſenting our doctrine to be, that God decrees ſome men to miſery in the ſame manner that he does others to happineſs; yea this ſlanderer, in imitation of thoſe who have gone before him, ſets reprobation foremoſt, and would have people believe that we hold, God's firſt deſign to be the damnation of <hi>multitudes,</hi> and then ſecondly, the <hi>irreſiſtable ſalvation</hi> of a <hi>number!</hi> Hoping no doubt by theſe horrid colourings, to guard people ſufficiently againſt all the goſpel weapons, which are appointed to pull down the ſtrong holds that are raiſed <hi>against the knowledge of God,</hi> and to caſt down the <hi>imaginations</hi> which keep mens <hi>thoughts too high</hi> to yield their all to a meek and lowly Jeſus, 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. Many in latter ages have carried their imaginations ſo high on this ſubject, as,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To aſſume a dignity to themſelves, that they will not allow to the eternal God; for they claim a <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determining power</hi> in their own wills, while they deny it to the Moſt High; and inſiſt upon it, that his choice of ſome men to ſalvation rather than others, is from either a foreſight, or afterſight, of good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and good doings in them more than others;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012656_0008_0F8BBE289F45D430"/>ſo making that to be the cauſe of his choice, which he declares is the effect of it, and repreſenting that God is influenced in his works by motives <hi>without</hi> himſelf, at the ſame time that they hold to a power to determine all their own actions <hi>within</hi> themſelves. Can any imaginations ever be entertained, more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, or more contrary to holy writ, than theſe are! See Mat. 11.25—28. Rom. 8.29, 30. Eph. 1.4, 5. 1 Pet. 1.2. 1 Joh. 4.19.</p>
            <p>The people we are now ſpeaking of commonly deny the doctrine of mans univerſal depravity, but if to claim a ſovereignty to their own wills, while they deny it to God, does not prove them to be rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heaven, I know not what can do it.</p>
            <p>Nebuchadnezzar made trial how it would do to aſcribe all his atchievments to himſelf; but after he had grazed among the beaſts of the field till ſeven times had paſſed over him, he declares that, <q>All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as <hi>nothing</hi> (before the Moſt High) and he doth according to HIS WILL in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</q> Dan. 4.35. Thus it appears that the hearts of kings are in the hand of the Lord, ſo that <hi>as rivers of water he turneth them whitherſoever he will.</hi> i. e. to act volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily as he deſigns to have them. From whence it appears evident, that there is no inconſiſtency in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's decrees to be immutable, and yet that men act as voluntarily as if it were not ſo. And the great reaſoners on the other ſide cannot avoid this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if they would once own that the will of man is always determined in it's choice by motive, or by what they at preſent prefer and think to be beſt; for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012656_0009_0F8BBE2B082AE1A0"/>that perſon muſt be ſtupid indeed who cannot ſee, that HE in whom we live, move and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can at any time ſet things in ſuch a view before our minds, as to make us think it beſt to choſe one way of acting rather than another.

Hence it appears evident, that they and not we, would exclude the the uſefulneſs of means; for if the liberty of man lay in acting againſt motive or with motive, juſt as they pleaſed, where could there be any proper uſe for means? For the very deſign of goſpel means, is to turn ſouls from evil, to follow that which is good; and if their liberty conſiſted in not being moved and governed by means and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, there would be no ſenſe in uſing of them; but like ſmoke and vapour men muſt be left to act juſt that way the wind happens to blow. In ſhort, the main objections I ever heard againſt ſovereign election, and certain ſalvation by free grace alone, appear to me to ſpring from this root, viz. Man who was flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the notion of being <hi>as gods,</hi> ſtill conceits that he has a power <hi>in himſelf</hi> to do as he pleaſes, let that pleaſure be to comply with, or to diſappoint God's deſigns; and therefore if they are not diſpoſed at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to engage in his ſervice, that he muſt wait their leiſure, and be ready whenever they ſet about the work in good earneſt, to grant them the aſſiſtance of his grace, and if they improve it well unto the end, then to receive them to his glory. But for my part I have no more notion of worſhipping a deity that can poſſibly be miſtaken or diſappointed in any one event, than I have of worſhipping Baal, who could not defend either his altar or grove, when his votaries were aſleep, Judges 6.31.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are determined to believe nothing but what they can comprehend, are determined to be ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators; for tis certain that any thing which can be comprehended by a finite mind, cannot be the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Jehovah; whoſe wiſdom, knowledge and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <hi>unſearchable,</hi> and his ways <hi>paſt finding out; of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012656_0011_0F8BBE2CABD2C000"/>to whom be glory for ever, amen.</hi> Rom. 11.33—36. Thus to believe, adore and obey, is not as many would have it, a ſacrificing of reaſon to tradition and blind devotion, but the contrary. As for inſtance, ſhould any man conceit that he could not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not there was light in the ſun, or warmth in the fire, without looking through the one and running into the other, and ſhould try the experiment till he became blind and burnt; he could not from thence convince me that I had loſt both my ſight and feeling, becauſe I ſtill profeſſed to enjoy great comfort in the cautious improvement of thoſe bleſſings. Now the perfections of the deity are compared both to the ſun and the fire, to teach us the importance of receiving his grace freely, of acting towards him <hi>uprightly,</hi> and <hi>ſerving</hi> of him with <hi>reverence and godly fear,</hi> Pſal. 84. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>Some ſerious perſons are afraid to give in to the doctrine of immutable decrees, leſt they ſhould make God the author of ſin; but Mr. Norton, one of the fathers of this country, juſtly replied to this objection, That ſin is a <hi>defect,</hi> and God is the author of all effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, but not of any defect at all. An illegitimate child is the creature of God, but its illegitimacy is wholly from its parents. It was their loſts which cauſed the <hi>defect</hi> or want of its being lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; yet the child is God's creature, and if he pleaſe he makes it a ſubject of his grace. The heat of the ſun that attracts the ſecret virtues of the earth, is not the cauſe of the ſtink of the dughill. And though carnal reaſoners try to perſuade people, that to hold every event to be certain in the divide councils, takes away the guilt of evil actions, and the virtue of good ones, yet the word of truth abundantly ſhews the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. It ſhews that Joſeph's brethren were as <hi>verily
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012656_0012_0F8BBE2D496BE938"/>guilty</hi> in their actings againſt him, as if they could have fruſtrated God's deſign; and yet that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled their <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> towards their brother, for his own <hi>praiſe,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm 76.10.</note> and to make Joſeph much more of a public and extenſive bleſſing, than they could have made him in Canaan, if they had tried their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt for it. At the ſame time the ſacred ſtory clearly ſhews, that they acted quite voluntarily, both in their wretched abuſes to their brother, and in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proſtrating themſelves before him afterward.— They acted by motive; when they firſt ſaw Joſeph coming to them, they felt ſo that they thought they would ſlay him: But upon another view murder ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo ſhocking that they thought it beſt to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify themſelves another way, which moved them to chuſe that way. On the other hand, when Joſeph was tempted by his wicked miſtreſs, though men were abſent, yet God to whom be was under infinite obligation, was preſent to his thoughts, and that prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſufficient motive to make him chuſe any ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather than to ſin againſt ſuch a glorious being.</p>
            <p>The inquiry and purſuit of all men is after <hi>good,</hi> and the believer finds it only in God, who is <hi>good,</hi> and is always doing <hi>good,</hi> and this cauſes his ſoul to be in earneſt to <hi>learn his ſtatutes,</hi> Pſal. 4.6, 7, and 119.68. Others do not like to retain the true God in their knowledge; neither his nature nor his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment appear good to their carnal minds, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they worſhip and ſerve the creature inſtead of the Creator; ſetting up gain, honor or pleaſure, as their chief good. Yet to appear nakedly irreligious, is too ſhocking to multitudes, who at the ſame time are very far from deſiring to ſet the Lord always before them, ſo as to be influenced by him in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012656_0013_0F8BBE31E5A8E650"/>therefore they chuſe their <hi>idol ſhepherds</hi> that will prophecy <hi>ſmooth things</hi> to them, rather than faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful watchmen who repreſent the true character of the <hi>holy One of Iſrael before them,</hi> Jſa. 30.8,—11. Zech. 11.17.</p>
            <p>A darling topick with the carnal reaſoners of our world is this; they ſay, That either men are <hi>able</hi> to obey and ſerve God, or elſe if they <hi>cannot</hi> do it, they are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> blame for neglecting of it, until God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to convert them. But the truth is, the natural man <hi>cannot ſerve God</hi> becauſe he does <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ſerve</hi> an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol: And the ſoul before it is ſlain by the law, <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>married</hi> to Chriſt, becauſe it is <hi>wedded</hi> to its own doings, Mat. 6.24. Rom. 7. Yet this inability is ſo far from being any juſt excuſe, that the more unable they are to love God, or to believe in Chriſt, the greater is their <hi>condemnation,</hi> Joh. 3.16,—19. And it is a moſt wicked device in the writer of the paper now in hand, to uſe the word <hi>inevitable</hi> concerning the reprobate, and <hi>irreſiſtable</hi> concerning the elect, in ſuch a manner as to exclude the idea of their own choice; whereas the veſſels of wrath ſay, <hi>We</hi> WILL <hi>walk after our own devices;</hi> and EVERY ONE <hi>that doth evil,</hi> HATETH THE LIGHT, Jer. 18. 12. Joh. 3.20. And veſſels of mercy perſue the ſame ways, till God works in them to <hi>will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. Tit. 3.3,—5.— Therefore though the final event is as certain to the one as the other, yet the manner of its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is vaſtly different. The veſſels of wrath, <hi>after their hard and impenitent heart, treaſure up wrath</hi> TO THEMSELVES; while God <hi>endureth with much long ſuffering</hi> with them. But he <hi>makes known</hi> the riches of his glory, in effectually <hi>calling the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012656_0014_0F8BBE32C304F6E8"/>Rom. 2 5. and 9.22,—24. And renewed ſouls are ſo far from aſſuming to themſelves a power to be God's <hi>counſellors,</hi> or venturing to act upon <hi>ſecret things which belong to him,</hi> that where he has told them of his deſigns concerning any future event, they have not made the deſign of the great Ruler, but the laws he has given to his ſubjects, the rule of their conduct; and the difference between ſubjects and rebels is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by this. As for inſtance, God let David know that he deſigned to remove Saul, and to make him king in his ſtead. Yet David refuſed to ſmite Saul when he had opportunity, but leſt it with God to remove him in his own way, 1 Sam 24.12, 13. Whereas when the Jews heard Caiphas prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the death of Jeſus, <hi>from that day forth, they took counſel together for to put him to death,</hi> Joh. 11.49, 53. And God's accompliſhing his infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in that great event, while the Jews were inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſably guilty in their actings about it, are ſtrongly aſſerted by the inſpired apoſtle. <hi>Him, being delivered by the</hi> DETERMINATE COUNSEL <hi>and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, ye have taken and by</hi> WICKED HANDS <hi>have crucified and ſlain,</hi> Act. 2.23.</p>
            <p>They acted moſt wickedly in conſpiring againſt our Savior, who was perfectly holy and harmleſs, and conſtantly went about doing good; yet God's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and promiſes were thereby exactly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in beſtowing infinite and eternal mercies upon guilty and miſerable men. Pharaoh uſed great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and cruelty in order to keep Iſrael in bondage, and ſet up his <hi>will</hi> at the higheſt rate againſt releaſing of them; yet God in his providence cauſed things to appear ſo to him and his ſubjects, that they volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily furniſhed Iſrael with ſilver and gold, and <hi>Egypt was glad when they departed,</hi> Pſal. 105 37, 38. and that on the <hi>ſelf ſame day</hi> which God had told Abraham
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012656_0015_0F8BBE330E1721C8"/>of above four hundred years before, Ezod. 12.41.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many other inſtances of mens voluntary actions the Lord declared with a perfect exactneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to paſs, becauſe he <hi>knew</hi> that with a <hi>brazen obſtinacy,</hi> and <hi>wilful treachery,</hi> they would rather give this <hi>glory</hi> to their <hi>idol</hi> than to him, Iſai. 48.3,—8. But the firm faith of the ſaints in every age, in the certain accompliſhment of God's promiſes, has made them the more watchful and active in the rational choice and uſe of the beſt means that he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with for attaining the deſired end. Jacob wreſtled and prevailed with God, yet that did not make him neglect means, but he wiſely improved the beſt that he had in his power, to calm his angry bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it had the deſired effect. Paul <hi>believed God</hi> that the lives of all thoſe who were with him in the ſhip ſhould be ſaved; yet when the men who were killed in managing the ſhip were about to leave it, he ſaid to the centurion, and to the ſoldiers, <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye</hi> CANNOT <hi>be ſaved,</hi> Acts 27.25, 31. Here was a certainty of the event, and yet it is expreſſed conditionally, while both were true; it was true that all ſhould be ſaved, and it was as true that the mariners muſt be inſtrumental of it.</p>
            <p>Thus my dear friend, I have endeavoured in as plain and brief a manner as I could, in the little time I had for it, opened and vindicated the great ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doctrine of God's ſovereign decrees, againſt a malicious attempt which has been made to vilify the ſame. It may well ſeem ſurprizing to thoſe who are acquainted with the 17th article of the church of England, to hear that a miniſter who has ſolemnly engaged to maintain the truth therein expreſſed, ſhould have a great hand in ſpreading this blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous paper which is diametrically contrary thereto, as has evidently been the caſe. But I leave him and all others in the hand of a righteous and gracious God, and reſt,</p>
