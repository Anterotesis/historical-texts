            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE GLEBE HOUSE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN a beautiful vale, watered by a winding river, in D—ſhire, was ſituated the Glebe Houſe of Mr. Owens, who convinced of the truth and efficacy of thoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines it was his duty to inſtil, ever delivered them with that awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and energy, calculated to catch the moſt wandering idea, and ſoften the heart, if not thoroughly hardened in the ſchool of depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>He was much eſteemed in his neighborhood, and often brought to mind the good paſtor of Auburn Village—his virtues and humanity
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035553_0004_10055F9E498A17C8"/>
would have adorned the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſtation, while his ſimplicity and content appeared as if none other than his preſent humble one would have ſuited him half ſo well.</p>
            <p>Moderate as was his income, he ſtill reſerved ſome trifle for the children of affliction—ſatisfied, that a ſmall gift from the hand of real charity, would obtain the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Providence. He knew not the vanities of life, and thought with Goldſmith,</p>
            <l>"Man wants but little here below,</l>
            <l>"Nor wants that little long."</l>
            <p>His wife with equal ſimplicity, had a much larger portion of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—nor could any argument to the contrary perſuade her but that more happineſs muſt be enjoyed in a coach and ſix, than without
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035553_0005_10055F9FCF129CB0"/>
one. She yet remembered with pride, her maiden name of pretty Fan of the Glade, but was fonder, if poſſible, of diſplaying her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's perfections than her own; ſhe was, to allow her all her merits, an excellent houſe-wife, was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the greateſt adept in the country at <hi>Pope-Joan,</hi> and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced ſeveral improving ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in mixing particular pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>Her ſweet little boy, Jaſper as ſhe called him, was now clearly ſix feet high, and in his one and twentieth year—the tints of the lilly, once conſpicuous on his face, had long been uſurped by a brown hue, enlivened with the brighteſt bloom of health; his hair of the darkeſt cheſnut, luxuriantly thick,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035553_0006_10055FA30A174850"/>
hung careleſsly round his neck and forehead, while the fire of his large hazel eyes might have been played off with dangerous ſucceſs, againſt hearts boaſting of peculiar frigidneſs.</p>
            <p>But except a little ruſtic gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with the wood nymphs, poor Jaſper had confined his admiration to ladies who had flouriſhed centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries back, ſuch as Hebe, Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra, Lucretia, &amp;c. His father had really almoſt made him a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.—With ſuch abilities 'twas ſurely hoped he would eſtabliſh his family in proſperity.</p>
            <p>Natural are thoſe preſages in the paternal heart, and while bounded by reaſon, cruel would be the hand which would ſeek to cruſh them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:035553_0007_10055FA494B42008"/>Conſtantia, their only daughter, was about ſeventeen, her perſon of the midling height was formed with a pleaſing delicacy, her face inclining to roundneſs and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely fair, was animated by the pure bluſhes of nature—her blue eyes ſparkled through their long laſhes with that reſiſtleſs look of which Thompſon ſo eloquently ſpeaks. A ſmile, ever brought into her cheeks the ſweeteſt dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and her mouth, tempting as the roſe-bud, diſcovered when ſhe ſpoke, a ſet of teeth that might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt be called pearl.</p>
            <p>With an artleſs negligence, her light brown hair flowed down her back, and had the trees, (as we are told was once the caſe,) been occupied by Dryads, thoſe about the Glebe might have regretted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035553_0008_10055FA78FEB7850"/>
her charms, ſince the pen of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral lovers on their ſmooth rinds, had made numberleſs inciſions concerning them.</p>
            <p>Vivacity and innocence were conſpicuous in her every action; ſhe joined in the merriment of her companions, and ſhe wept at the tale of the unfortunate.</p>
            <p>The Glebe-houſe was a rough old ſtructure—the ivy crept over one wing entirely and over the door was a beautiful canopy, of honey ſuckles; the lawn on which it ſtood was hedged round with evergreens and planted with elms, and the waving poplar; the garden was laid out more for uſe than ſhow, yet it was not unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, nor had a ſhady ſeat for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035553_0009_10055FA9E9D970A0"/>
after the fatigues of the day, been forgotten.</p>
            <p>Such was the Glebe-houſe and its inhabitants, whom circling years ſtill found in poſſeſſion of felicity, and conſenting ſpring ſhed her own roſy garland on their heads, when the death of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia's ſponſor, threw them into a little commotion. She fulfilled her promiſe of a legacy, by a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of two hundred pounds to Mrs. Owens.</p>
            <p>That good woman ſhed a flood of tears when ſhe heard the firſt account of the death, but ſoon moderated her grief by quoting an old ſaying of her huſband's— "we are all mortal, and muſt die ſooner or later;" in ſhort, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſted until ſhe put on her
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035553_0010_10055FAC81F6F5D0"/>
cloak and hat, and ſpeeded away to a particular friend of her's.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Crofts was a lady who had retired to the country to lye-in about ſix months after the death of her lamented ſpouſe; finding the people very ſimple, and very much what ſhe wanted them to be, ſhe ſettled near the Glebe-houſe, now and then taking a trip to London—in which, never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying her, we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to aſcertain her buſineſs; no groſs vapours of ſlander ever pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued her from the metropolis to leſſen the eſteem ſhe was regarded with in the neighborhood, whither the purity of the ſurrounding at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere might have repelled them we cannot determine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:035553_0011_10055FAEAFF4EAA0"/>Mrs. Owens ſat down puffing and blowing, a tear dropped on her cheek, ſhe felt another ſtarting and timely wiped it away with the corner of her apron.</p>
            <p>My dear friend is gone, ſaid ſhe, anſwering the interrogations of Mrs. Crofts, my ſweet friend, a ſad loſs I have ſuſtained—but, as poor Frank ſays, we muſt all go, my dear friend—ſhe has left me two hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Crofts declared ſhe did not wonder at her grief, her friend was a valuable perſon, and ſhe well knew what it was to loſe the deareſt connexions. Her huſband had been dead theſe five years, yet ſhe ſtill wept over his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; here her tears began to flow, and the afflicted matrons found it requiſite to partake of an admirable
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035553_0012_10055FB10F726C08"/>
cordial which Mrs. Crofts recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as a moſt effectual remedy for grief.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Owens aſked her advice concerning the diſpoſal of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, hinting her intention of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to London. Mrs. Crofts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it was the wiſeſt ſcheme in the world—that perfections ſuch as her children poſſeſſed ſhould not be concealed; they were not born to bloom unſeen; in ſhort the journey was ſtrenuouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
            <p>The affair was diſcuſſed over and over, preliminaries adjuſted; to London Mrs. Owens was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to go, and Mrs. Crofts was to give recommendatory let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and procure lodgings at a couſin of her's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:035553_0013_10055FB294545C68"/>When Mrs. Owens returned home—well Frank, ſaid ſhe, I have ſettled every thing about the two hundred pounds; aye, to be ſure, ſaid he—I mean to go to market next week and buy ſuch a flock of ſheep as was not ſeen in thoſe parts this ſome time, Jaſper ſhall have a poney, and the great dyke in the garden ſhall be filled up.</p>
            <p>No truly, exclaimed ſhe, not one of thoſe things ſhall be done with my legacy. I intend going to London with the children;— Yes, Mr. Owens, continued ſhe, with more violence, perceiving his aſtoniſhment, we are not always to be ſecluded, we were not born to bloom unſeen; as Mrs. Crofts ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035553_0014_10055FB5AF9E6A18"/>You jeſt lovey, ſaid he—aye, aye, deary, when I am a biſhop, you ſhall go to London: I believe if we wait for that, replied ſhe, we ſhall be as grey as your old gooſe; no, no, Frank the money was left to me and the money I will ſpend, ſure in your heart you muſt know what advantages the children will receive from ſeeing the town; Jaſper has ſuch a head that I make no doubt of his getting a fortune; and as for Conſtance, the little rogue, ſhe ſhall ſhew the world what pretty Fan of the Glade was in her youth.</p>
            <p>When the poor parſon was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the ſeriouſneſs of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, he earneſtly beſought her to alter her mind; he pointed out every avenue to danger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035553_0015_10055FB7DF58FA88"/>
her to avoid the deſtruction of their happineſs.</p>
            <p>My Fanny, he cried, you are too innocent to encounter the wickedneſs of the town, our dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings here in their proper ſphere, will not behold objects which will excite wiſhes—wiſhes that create diſtreſs from an inability to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them.</p>
            <p>All his rhetoric was vain, ſhe was determined: he therefore made a virtue of neceſſity, and ſubmitted,—Yet a tear involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily fell.</p>
            <p>Since reſolved, then exclaimed he, may heaven guard you, and bring you ſafely back to the Glebe-houſe—but indulge me one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                        <p>IN a ſweet ſheltered neſt, two doves once lived, remarkable for felicity, till a ſpirit of wandering ſeized the female, and to travel ſhe would go.—The firſt day's jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, overtaken by a ſtorm, ſhe ſought ſhelter in a garden, where an unfeeling creature knocked her down with a ſtone out of ſport, another attempted to ſeize her, but ſhe eſcaped with the loſs of a great part of her plumage.</p>
                        <p>She now thought of her deſerted neſt and partner, but ſtill reſolved to purſue her travels, ſcarcely had the morning light dawned, when

this ſhe afforded him no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of doing, as ſhe quitted the room to prepare for her departure, leaving him ſtanding at a window ſeemingly contemplating ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though what it was, would probably puzzle himſelf to tell.</p>
            <p>The entrance of Conſtantia rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he took her hand, and leading her to a chair, ſat down beſide her; ſo Conſtantia, ſaid he, you are going to London; you are rejoiced, I ſuppoſe; I really don't know whether I am or not, cried ſhe.—This ſcheme of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, he proceeded, has ſadly broke in upon a thouſand little plans I had formed againſt the next ſheep-ſhearing. I propoſed having the ſweeteſt dance on the graſsplat —I had trimmed up your bower in the niceſt manner—but all my
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035553_0020_10055FC45BBEC880"/>
flattering proſpects are blaſted— we ſhall no more walk down the dark lane. Oh, Conſtantia, you will forget every think of this kind, when a few weeks in town.</p>
            <p>I don't think, I ſhall, ſhe replied. —Oh, my ſweet girl, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, have you ever allowed me the privilege of a friend, you will therefore excuſe the cautions I preſume to give.</p>
            <p>In the great world, you will behold objects calculated to dazzle every ſenſe, you will there find flatterers very different from thoſe ruſtic ones that have hitherto ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded you. Should your guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heart be ſuſceptible of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſhould—here his voice grew ſo extremely low, it was quite inarticulate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:035553_0021_10055FC958B1FDB0"/>Conſtantia, ſaid he—after a hem, of conſiderable length— come into the garden.—He drew her arm under his, and they went to the ſhady bench.—I ſhall often viſit this, he exclaimed.— I ſhall here think upon you— While I'm, perhaps, forgotten.</p>
            <p>She ſpoke not, but putting her hand into her pocket, pulled out a little green ſilk purſe ſhe had knit, and preſenting it to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe ſhould ever rernember with gratitude his kind attentions: He received her gift with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and with an emotion he could not ſuppreſs, catching her to his boſom, cried—Oh! my lovely, my deareſt Conſtantia, could I repleniſh as often as I'd wiſh—this purſe, you would not,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035553_0022_10055FCBCB9C3E88"/>
I truſt, think of leaving the fold of theſe fond arms.</p>
            <p>Fearing he had ſaid too much, he quitted his hold with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ran out of the garden.</p>
            <p>Poor Conſtantia purſued him with her eyes, while her boſom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſtrange feelings. Tears involuntarily trickled down her cheek, and at that inſtant ſhe would have heard with pleaſure, that her mother meant not to have quit the Glebe.</p>
            <p>Coverly, now in his nine and twentieth year, was tall and thin, a thinneſs cauſed by an innate and ſecret uneaſineſs;—without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to beauty, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was ſtrongly marked with the reſiſtleſs expreſſion of ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035553_0023_10055FCE1D820038"/>
while the ſpirit of his dark eyes, denoted their illuminating ſoul, warm, generous and intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.</p>
            <p>Finances, ſcarcely amounting to a ſupport compelled him to that obſcurity, he appeared by nature never formed for.</p>
            <p>Whether he was a connexion of Sir Roger de Coverly's is a point we could never clearly learn, if ſo, the good Old Knight's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were of an hereditary, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a diffuſive kind, and flowed with the ſtream of life to the heart of his relation.</p>
            <p>Though poor, pity was not all that Coverly beſtowed on diſtreſs, frequently has he taken from his table, the ſimple viands prepared
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035553_0024_10055FCFA3B58290"/>
for himſelf, and delivered them to the creature enfeebled by poverty and pain.</p>
            <p>He had been about five years in the country—on his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſeemed ſedulous to avoid ſociety, but the benevolent Owens, combatted his deſpondency and tempted him to become a conſtant viſitor at the Glebe.</p>
            <p>Conſtantia, then ſcarcely more than a child, attracted his notice; in her unfolding mind, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered qualities which wanted that cultivation to yield the moſt delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fruit, the thoughts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing her in ſome of thoſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant accompliſhments he poſſeſſed ſoothed his melancholy, and thoſe improvements her father had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035553_0025_10055FD287615010"/>
received their laſt poliſh from the tuition of Coverly.</p>
            <p>At this period his affection for her, was that of a brother, as ſhe grew up, feelings of a more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at leaſt a more anxious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, occupied his breaſt; her modeſty, her artleſs innocence, her bluſhing charms, were to him irreſiſtible. He had ſeen the moſt poliſhed parts of the world, yet he never beheld her counterpart. The ſweets of domeſtic life would have been balm to his ſorrows, but theſe were ſweets he durſt not think of taſting, his narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rendering the maintenance of a family impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Accurſed, cried he, with enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic warmth, be that man, who
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035553_0026_10055FD4C8DC0930"/>
for ſelf gratification involves a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he pretends to love, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a number of innocents, into the extremes of poverty; Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, thy Coverly ſhall never be guilty of ſuch villainy.</p>
            <p>Her going to London was an unexpected ſtroke; he knew the credulity and vanity of Mrs. Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens would expoſe the lovely bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, to the infectious blaſts of flattery and vice.—He ſighed to point out the danger, but was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her poſitiveneſs, and feared the family might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his caution to intereſted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>He continued his race, with very little abatement, from the garden to the adjoining village which was two miles from the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035553_0027_10055FD7241676E0"/>
Glebe. Here the noiſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rouſed him from his reverie, he feared he had uttered too much; he does juſt ſcarcely wiſh to excite a paſſion, before whoſe completion fate had thrown ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obſtacles. He regretted his abrupt departure, had ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things to ſay—the enſuing morning the journey was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.—He could not bear to paſs the few remaining hours from the Glebe.—So buying ſome ſpiced cakes, as an excuſe for his ſpeedy return, in the evening brought them to Mrs. Owens.</p>
            <p>The buſtle of preparation was now over, the ſtage was to take them up early the next day, and he found Mrs. Crofts writing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of recommendation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:035553_0028_10055FD8AA0DBB58"/>Coverly felt peeviſh, he could not controul himſelf, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the poor Parſon more than once. He wanted to ſay a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things to Conſtantia without knowing what they were. Some heavy ſhowers falling, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred the pleaſures of a private walk with her. Supper was early ſerved, and at ten Mrs. Crofts roſe to depart. Coverly of courſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the motion. He ſaluted Mrs. Owens, ſhook Jaſper by the hand, and wiſhed him much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement; then turning to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia, attempted to ſpeak, but ſound it impoſſible. He preſſed his cold lips to her's, a ſigh heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the boſom of both;—he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round, the reſt were too buſy talking to obſerve the emotions of love. He ſtrained her to his breaſt, ſnatched another kiſs, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035553_0029_10055FDAFB582F38"/>
was about leaving the room, when the voice of Mrs. Crofts exclaimed, "Sure Mr. Coverly you will ſee me home," detained him.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning the ſtage coach took them up: had duty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, the worthy parſon could have wiſhed to be the guardian of his family, but that was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—He wept in ſpite of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Owens, now ſure of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was alſo affected—ſhe ſhed tears, and gave old Deb a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand charges to take care of her maſter.</p>
            <p>Jaſper whiſtled, looked aſkance, ſkipped about, felt in his pocket to be certain of Horace, aſſured his
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035553_0030_10055FDDCEBB8F88"/>
father that he would be an old Trojan by the time he came back.</p>
            <p>Conſtantia wanted power to ſpeak,—never did ſhe appear more attracting. Dreſt in a habit of dimity, her hair in its wonted lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriance, flowing from under a ſtraw hat, lined with the paleſt ſhade of pink, which gave a faint tint to her cheeks that were this morning totally pale.</p>
            <p>The parſon recommended a number of good books to his wife, particularly a volume of excellent ſermons: but whether from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take or hurry, is not certain, ſhe took the Fortunate Country Maid in its place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:035553_0031_10055FE006B233F0"/>There were no other paſſengers in the coach, and they wheeled off with varied emotions.</p>
            <p>As they approached the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Coverly, Conſtantia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bent forward; an unintereſted object might have viewed the proſpect with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The cottage which was ſmall, but elegantly neat, ſtood on the ſummit of one of thoſe low hills which ſkirted the vale. Some clumps of trees caſt a ſhade upon the windows, and a winding path led up to the door.</p>
            <p>The ſloping garden on the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>r of the hill, was adorned with the moſt beautiful flowers, interſperſed with choice old fruit trees; on the bank of the river winding beneath,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035553_0032_10055FE18CDC05D0"/>
was formed a bower, conſiſting of the interwoven branches of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, part of which had crept round an old elm, on whoſe bark the name of Conſtantia was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved.</p>
            <p>As ſhe probably conjectured, Coverly was watching their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. He called to the man to ſtop. Conſtantia's hand reſted on the door; Coverly darted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſeized it, and preſſed it to his lips, while the gliſtening tear ſtood in either eye—he hemmed, complained of a cold, and put into the carriage a handkerchief of fruit juſt pulled.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Owens begged him to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit poor Frank often, and that he would take care of himſelf, as he looked very ill, aſſuring him, that
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035553_0033_10055FE4F9A3D430"/>
Deb made excellent whey. He bowed, ſmiled, and drew back, the coachman whipped his horſes, and off they flew.</p>
            <p>Coverly was transfixed, the noiſe of the wheels ſtill reſounded in his ears—at length he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his houſe. The little boy who attended him, aſked if he was ill? he neither could anſwer the poor child, nor partake of the breakfaſt he aſſiduouſly had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Shortly after, he walked out, and ſoon found himſelf in the road the carriage had taken. Aſhamed of his weakneſs, he changed his courſe, nor recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till the ſtriking of the village clock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was time to viſit the parſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:035553_0034_10055FE7DD76C920"/>The poor forſaken old man, was ſitting down to a ſolitary din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he brightened up a little at the entrance of Coverly,—You ſaw the travellers, I ſuppoſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he,—they ſet forward with the exultation of hope. Oh may they return with that ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of innocence in which they left me: Yet, alas, my heart trembles for them, they are all the offspring of ſimplicity, and expoſed to the machinations of the baſe. I did all that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of my temper would allow, to combat the inclination of my wife. Oh, may ſhe never have reaſon to rue her oppoſition to my wiſhes.</p>
            <p>He wanted Coverly to reſide with him during their abſence. Coverly promiſed to be frequently
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035553_0035_10055FEA42BFC028"/>
with him, but could not think of quitting his cottage entirely, where he could have ſome private hours for the luxurious indulgence of concealed grief.</p>
            <p>After feeding Conſtantia's gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finches he touched her guittar, which had been a New Year's gift from him, but the ſtrings were diſcordant, and he found that with her, Harmony had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Glebe Houſe.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now bid adieu to the gentlemen for ſome time, and purſue the travellers.</p>
            <p>Nothing occurred during the firſt day of their journey worth reciting, on the ſecond, when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the inn where they were to dine; a gentleman, who had
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035553_0036_10055FEBC93719B0"/>
juſt alighted from an elegant phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, accompanied by a lady, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and with the utmoſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs handed them out.</p>
            <p>Scarce had they entered the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, when the hoſteſs followed, preſenting the compliments of the ſtrangers, with an invitation to an entertainment they were juſt ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down to.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Owens elated by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected civility, inſtantly drew up her head, and with elevated creſt, cried, upon my word they are vaſtly polite; but pray, my good woman do you know—</p>
            <p>Truly, miſtreſs, interrupted the hoſteſs, you need not demur, the gentleman is my young Lord Stanville—heaven bleſs him as
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035553_0037_10055FEF74818358"/>
pretty a man as one ſhall ſee in a ſummer's day, as the ſaying is, and the lady is his ward.—Oh, Lord bleſs me, if you knew the power of money they ſpend, 'its themſelves that would'nt ſtand hagling about this thing, and ſcolding about t'other thing, but fling it from them juſt as I would do a rotten apple.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the ſound of a title reached the ears of Mrs. Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, than ſhe made but three ſteps to the glaſs, fell to adjuſting her dreſs, repeating, "upon my word they are vaſtly polite, but I have always the good fortune to meet with civility, to be ſure, there's ſomething in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome people, that cannot fail commanding reſpect; there
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035553_0038_10055FF1B0A5A4D0"/>
was a great lord came down to our country once,—bleſs me,—I forgot his name, but that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here nor there,—and he was ſo attentive, and ſo,—but I am afraid we ſhall keep his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, my lord Stanville, waiting."</p>
            <p>She was accordingly uſhered to the apartment, at the door of which, his lordſhip received her, and taking her by the hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf particularly obliged by her condeſcenſion.</p>
            <p>He ſeated them at the table, taking care to place himſelf oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Conſtantia, of whoſe perſon, in a ſly manner, he took an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſurvey, and evidently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enraptured with her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:035553_0039_10055FF3FA59D9D8"/>Having learned their place of reſidence, he ſaid he had been there, mentioning ſeveral great families he had viſited, whom Mrs. Owens knew perfectly, though they were too exalted for her to have any intimacy with.</p>
            <p>I remember, continued his lordſhip, when there, of a Mr. Owens, a very worthy divine, who they ſaid had married the greateſt beauty in that country, —ſhe had ſome particular name —bleſs me, how forgetful I am,—it was either Maria, Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, or,—</p>
            <p>Perhaps, my lord, cried Mrs. Owens, in raptures, ſhe could not conceal, it might have been Fan, pretty Fan of the Glade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:035553_0040_10055FF5844ED438"/>The ſame, the ſame,—I preſume madam, you have ſeen her, will you be ſo good as to inform me, if your opinion coincides with the admiring villagers.</p>
            <p>It would be impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Mrs. Owens countenance, when ſhe faultering pronounced, "my lord, I had the honor of bearing that name."</p>
            <p>Pardon me, dear madam, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his lordſhip, with a look of aſtoniſhment, how could I be ſo ſtupid; ſurely, when I heard where you came from, I need no longer have doubted, ſince in you I behold all thoſe graces for which ſhe was ſo deſervedly extolled.</p>
            <p>This young lady, I preſume, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is your daughter—how love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035553_0041_10055FF910E44F70"/>
a copy—I tremble for the ſafety of the beaux hearts in London.</p>
            <p>Your lordſhip, ſaid Miſs Somers, has never yet trembled for your own, you are very hard to be pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Why hitherto I have been ſo, my dear, replied he, but the time perhaps approaches (glancing at Conſtantia) when I ſhall be as vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable as any other mortal, to the ſhafts of cupid.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this ſcene, a wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entered, to inform them that the coachman was impatient; a cloud immediately overſpread the countenance of Mrs. Owens, which however was ſoon diſſipated by his lordſhip, who declared, he could
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035553_0042_10055FFBECD31CE8"/>
not relinquiſh the pleaſure of their ſociety; his ward and he propoſed going off in a few days to London —they would be happy to have the vacant places in their carriages occupied by them. He urged his requeſt—much entreaty was not requiſite, their baggage was brought from the ſtage, and Mrs. Owens was rejoiced to hear it drive off.</p>
            <p>She may with juſtice be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for imprudence in thus putting herſelf in the power of total ſtrangers.—But though vain to exceſs, ſhe was artleſs, and credulity is reckoned the ſiſter of innocence.</p>
            <p>The attention of his lordſhip will not be wondered at, when it is known he was an intimate of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035553_0043_10055FFE408E9BD0"/>
Mrs. Crofts, who had given him a ſketch of the family, and from whom he received the following letter:

His ward was in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the daughter of a tenant who had fallen a victim to his wiles.</p>
            <p>His carriage came ſoon after dinner, and carried them to a magnificent houſe at ſeven miles diſtance.</p>
            <p>Lord Stanville frequently ſaid that it was a pity a man like Mr. Owens ſhould be in ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a ſtation—threw out many hints of having livings in his gift —that he could diſtinguiſh merit, and knew how to reward it.</p>

            <p>Conſtantia felt a ſadneſs cling around her heart ſhe could not conquer, and availed herſelf of her mother's falling aſleep to peruſe a letter which Coverly had ſlipt into her hand at parting.</p>

            <p>The portrait was wrapt in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which contained the following lines.</p>

               <l>With Guido's pencil, had I power to trace</l>

            <p>Conſtantia very eagerly gazed for the portrait, it was indeed a penſive ſhadow, for the limner had thrown into the countenance all that lock of deſpondency for which Coverly was ſo remarkable.</p>
            <p>'Tis probable ſhe might have ſtaid hours contemplating it, had not her mother waked and haſtily called her to bed.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>In the morning they were uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered into a magnificent ſaloon, where a ſumptuous breakfaſt was prepared; his lordſhip, if poſſible, was more aſſiduous than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding night.</p>
            <p>After breakfaſt, he conducted them through a long ſerpentine walk to a plain, opening in front to a ſpacious river, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by an ampitheatre of trees, an awning of light ſilk, ſpread over ſome of them, formed a kind of bower—where they ſeated themſelves on a bank of turf, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with the gayeſt flowers.</p>
            <p>Two gaudy barges were lying on the river, occupied by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of young men dreſt in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; ſoft muſic played, and

ſeemed to ſteal along the waters, till at a ſignal given by his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the barges ſet off to a ſmall iſland, the deſtined gaol for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing their abilities.</p>
            <p>On their return, the victor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately landed, and coming to the bower, modeſtly bent his knee to Conſtantia—his lordſhip pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her a chaplet of artificial flowers, and begged ſhe would reward merit—bluſhing, and confuſed at this piece of gallantry, with a trembling hand ſhe decked the brows of the youth.</p>
            <p>You may now, cried his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, eſteem yourſelf the happieſt fellow in the univerſe, ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by the hands of beauty;

Oh! with what rapture would I be bound with the flowery fetters of love.</p>
            <p>Conſtantia bluſhed, but made no reply.</p>
            <p>Numberleſs other devices were practiſed to divert and beguile the hours.</p>
            <p>At length they were led to a ruſtic building, emboſomed among the loftieſt trees; where a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was laid out, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every luxury that wealth could purchaſe.</p>
            <p>His lordſhip had, indeed, been aſſiduous in procuring what he thought moſt calculated to tempt, betray and intoxicate the ſenſes;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035553_0053_1005601668A3A408"/>
while his unſuſpecting victims gave hopes by the pleaſure mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, that his trouble would be ſoon recompenced.</p>
            <p>He entreated Conſtantia to ſing in the courſe of the evening, ſhe at length yielded to his importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity— or rather the command of her mother, and ſung, from the Hermit, of Goldſmith

            <p>Lord Stanville preſſed her hand and ſighed—ſuch was the gentle preſſure ſhe had from Coverly, when ſitting by him, ſhe ſung in this manner—ſuch the profound

ſigh that heaved his boſom;—ſhe raiſed her eyes replete with moſt bewitching ſoftneſs, and gave a look that ſunk to his lordſhip's ſoul.</p>
            <p>Her mother was enraptured with every thing; nor till this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, imagined ſhe ever knew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect felicity.</p>
            <p>Alas! ſuch is the deluſion vice ſo frequently ſpreads before our eyes, thoughtleſs we rove in its flowery paths; nor perceive till the poignant ſting of ſorrow comes, thoſe rocks and quick ſands, which ſo temptingly were covered.</p>
            <p>Lord Stanville left them to give ſome orders to his attendants;— Miſs Somers was rambling about
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035553_0055_1005601B0AC76A28"/>
with Jaſper, who was comparing her to all the beauties of antiquity, as the moſt finiſhed original, in his opinion, while his mother was ſtealing after, to liſten to his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry.</p>
            <p>As Conſtantia was going to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, ſhe felt her gown ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly twitched, and turning, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſervant, who with a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant look ſlipt a paper into her hand, and ran off.</p>
            <p>Surprize for a moment deprived her of the power of peruſing its contents—judge of her amazement and horror when ſhe read as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
            <p>"Let innocence beware; there's treachery on foot. Fly! ere the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035553_0056_1005601C91E1CDF8"/>
ſhades of night afford an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the contemplation of the darkeſt deſign.—The bearer will conduct you to a place of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;—be guarded if you hope to eſcape."</p>
            <p>Oh, my father! why did we leave you? oh, Coverly! my Coverly, exclaimed Conſtantia, why are you not here to protect us?</p>
            <p>A flood of tears relieved her from that diſtraction, which in the firſt moment had overwhelmed her ſenſes—ſhe reſolved on col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting all her fortitude, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that circumſpection, which her unknown guardian had deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:035553_0057_100560201BC11A40"/>As ſhe was quitting the retreat, Jaſper appeared to acquaint her that Miſs Somers and his mother were going to the houſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted her to follow.</p>
            <p>She inſtantly communicated the contents of the letter; all on fire at the deſigned injury, he was for venting openly the impetuoſity of his paſſion, had ſhe not conjured him to the contrary.</p>
            <p>She repreſented to him, how unavailing the diſplay of either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment or reſiſtance, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they were, by minions of the monſter—that, their only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource was, for him to ſeek the ſervant; ſhe was aſſured he would befriend them, and was
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035553_0058_10056022F0C6BD78"/>
determined, with his aſſiſtance, to fly the baneful manſion.</p>
            <p>With words like thoſe, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia won her brother to convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he went in queſt of their humble friend; while ſhe, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with horror, purſued the footſteps of her mother.</p>
            <p>When they reached the houſe, ſhe made an excuſe for going to her apartment, to change her hat, which was damp with dew and unnoticed, whiſpered her mother to follow.</p>
            <p>After ſecuring the door, ſhe acquainted her with the ſource of her terrors—to deſcribe thoſe of her mother at that moment, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, all her flattering proſpects
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035553_0059_1005602564C6F678"/>
vaniſhed—humbled to the duſt; experiencing all the agonies of ſelf-accuſation.</p>
            <p>Raiſing her ſtreaming eyes to that fair bloſſom, which ſhe had torn from his native ſhade, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the peſtilential blaſts of iniquity; like the wandering dove, how joyfully would ſhe have fled to the ſheltering arms of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band—ſhe could not ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Conſtantia, ſhocked at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of her mother wept upon her neck, and beſought her to be compoſed;—Heaven, ſhe ſaid, ever protects the virtuous.</p>
            <p>Jaſper ſoftly tapped at the door, attended by the ſervant, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them down the back-ſtairs,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035553_0060_10056026EA4CD3B0"/>
into an orchard, at the extremity of which, was a bye-road; a coach was prepared, into which they eagerly entered, Jaſper firſt flouriſhing his ſtick, and vowing revenge; declaring, he diſapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed highly of this inglorious flight —the way would have been—to challenge—and in ſingle combat, chaſtiſe—thus did the heroes of antiquity.</p>
            <p>Faſt as the horſes went, they could not keep pace with the wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Mrs. Owens and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; at length they ſtopped, as well as they could diſcern by the ſaint light which a few ſtars afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a large edifice.</p>
            <p>They were conducted into a parlour, where they beheld a lady
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035553_0061_1005602A62D3E4C0"/>
and gentleman, the terrors which had taken poſſeſſion of them, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided almoſt inſtantly at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>The gentleman was old, and from a certain dejection in his look, appeared perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſorrow; his grey hair was thinly ſpread upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, a placid luſtre in his eyes denoted how brilliant they had been in the gay morning of youth, a faint hectic tinged his cheek; and the ſofteſt ſenſibility over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread his countenance.</p>
            <p>Conſtantia had eyes for no other object, ſhe felt a pleaſing awfulneſs at his ſight—her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, however, thought there was
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035553_0062_1005602CF5D92FD0"/>
one ſtill more attracting in the room, and could not forbear gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the young lady, though he bluſhed at the ſame time; ſhe was about eighteen, with a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſimplicity in her looks.</p>
            <p>Welcome! thrice welcome! to this manſion, exclaimed the old gentleman—forever bleſſed be the hour in which Providence made me the humble inſtrument of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a family from deſtruction —yes madam, continued he, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mrs. Owens's hand, I conſider myſelf particularly fortunate, in being enabled to ſave you from that heart-rending diſtreſs you would have experienced, had the baſeſt of ſchemes been executed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:035553_0063_1005602F59E731F0"/>He then briefly informed them, that Lord Stanville's man, who was ſon to a tenant of his, had told him of their being decoyed to the houſe, he knew the whole plot; having found Mrs. Croft's letter in the room where his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had been dreſſing—he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it made him quite ſad to think his maſter ſhould have the power of ruining an innocent family. His artleſs repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, continued the gentleman, ſo excited my pity and reſentment, that I reſolved to do all in my power for their protection, and laid the plan which has ſo happily ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>They poured forth their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, called him their
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035553_0064_10056030DEB38710"/>
guardian, and vowed unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gratitude; Mrs. Owens in her preſent humbled ſtate, heſitated not confeſſing her motives for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to London, her huſband's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the excurſion, and her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>Alas! cried the benevolent man, ſuch is the waywardneſs of mankind; they ſeek for felicity in every ſtation but their own, where alone they ſhould look for, and cultivate it.</p>
            <p>Oh! moſt erroneous opinion, to ſuppoſe riches only can beſtow bliſs, I am an evidence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, had I been a ſhepherd ſwain, with the ſweat of my brow was obliged to till my parent earth and reaped her fruits, I might have been happy; but born in the lap

of affluence how bitter has been my fate.</p>
            <p>He was checked by his emotions and pauſed a few moments, then raiſing his head, ſaid, if you will honor me with your attention for a ſhort time, I may, by reciting the incidents of my life, more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince you of the truth of what I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>They entreated him to begin the relation, which he accordingly did,—

                           <p>I had attained my two and twentieth year, when chance bro't me acquainted with the widow of an officer and her daughter, who had taken a ſmall cottage in our neighbourhood.</p>

                           <p>Nature had been profuſe of its lovelieſt gifts, and her mind was as celeſtial, as its repoſitory chaſte, ingenious, undiſſembling, while mourning over an unfortunate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's fate, ſhe endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her mother, though ill able herſelf, to bear up againſt aſſaults of affliction.</p>
                           <p>I pitied, I eſteemed, and oh! how ſoon I loved: nor was ſhe inſenſible to the fervor of my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when loſt in ſweet confuſion,

                           <p>My love I carefully concealed, as alſo my viſits to the cottage; I knew full well the ambition of my parents, and that though they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored me, they would ſooner ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice me, than their elevated hopes—how ſtrange that ambition ſhould have power over the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of nature—time, I thought, would weaken their pride and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the prejudices of education, and convince them that worth and beauty would dignify any ſtation.</p>
                           <p>My mother ſoon noticed a dejection in my manner, and my frequent abſence from home alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her exceedingly—ſhe was of an enterpriſing ſpirit, and reſolved
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035553_0069_1005563DCB97F8C8"/>
to find whether there was any cauſe for her apprehenſions.</p>
                           <p>She and my father, while I was abſent, called the ſervant, in whom I confided, he who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carried trifling preſents from me to the widow, and by threats and bribes ſubdued his fidelity; great was their rage on diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my attachment—but violence they knew would never ſucceed, they therefore concerted meaſures they were ſure would prove ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
                           <p>A few days after, my father pleaded buſineſs in London, and aſked me to accompany him, I could not heſitate or refuſe; but ſeized the firſt moment I could to repair to the cottage—the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

was ill, and confined to her bed, Iſabella's tears had ceaſed a little on beholding me—but when I mentioned my intended depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe ſtreamed afreſh.</p>
                           <p>The time is ſtill preſent to view; when kneeling by the bed ſide, the mother took our hands between hers, and wept over and bleſſed us—while I called upon high Heaven to witneſs I ever would protect her daughter.</p>
                           <p>The widow died ſhortly after my departure, and my mother only waited for her to be conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the earth, ere ſhe viſited her orphan.</p>

                           <p>Iſabella ſhuddered, ſhe would have ſaid my love was unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but her voice faultered; and my mother proceeded,—</p>

with a determination of remaining in my neſt, ſo ſay no more about it lovey, you ſhall buy the flock of ſheep, the poney for Jaſper, and have the great dyke in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den filled up.</p>
            <p>While the parſon alternately claſp'd his wife and children to his breaſt, he raiſed his mild eyes to heaven in thankfulneſs for their return.</p>
            <p>No, my Fanny, cried he, I will never mention an error, which, perhaps, has been ſerviceable, by teaching you forbearance, ſince thus I hold to my heart, its darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, be baniſhed every care.</p>
            <p>Mr. Montfort now was noticed, their obligations were inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the affectionate Owens ſhed tears upon the hand he
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035553_0099_10056076F204E6B0"/>
preſs'd; while he poured forth acknowledgements to him, for warning his artleſs family of their danger.</p>
            <p>Conſtantia from a window be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Coverly in an alcove in the garden, ſhe darted out of the parlour, nor ſtopt till ſhe gently touched his arm,—he quickly lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eyes, the book he had been reading dropped out of his hand, he doubted his ſenſes, ſo you wont ſpeak to me, Mr. Coverly? exclaimed ſhe.</p>
            <p>And are you really returned? cried he, catching her in his arms —ſo ſoon?—ſo unexpectedly?— oh Conſtantia! this is rapture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:035553_0100_1005607930C1F6D0"/>Are you glad I'm come back? ſaid ſhe—Oh Conſtantia, what a queſtion!</p>
            <p>Jaſper at this moment, halloo'd for them to come in directly; they haſtened to obey his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>The moment Coverly entered the parlour, Mr. Montfort eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caught his hand, and burſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears.</p>
            <p>Coverly gazed at him; a kind of benign awe overſpread his countenance, and he looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, as if to enquire who the reverend ſtranger was.</p>
            <p>He is indeed her ſon, ſaid Montfort, in every feature, I trace the loved reſemblance— Oh! come to my arms, adopted
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035553_0101_1005607AB74B9BF0"/>
child of my affections; ſole, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious remains of my adored Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</p>
            <p>What Sir? replied Coverly, did you then know the dear pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, of whom I was ſo early de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived?</p>
            <p>Know her, replied he— oh! how well did Montfort know and reverence her virtues?</p>
            <p>Montfort! exclaimed Coverly, looking ſorrowfully on him— Oh Sir! is it poſſible, in you I behold him.</p>
            <p>Yes, ſaid he, and long have I been in ſearch of you, as a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which ſhould bleſs me;—it is now found, nor will I loſe it, without my exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:035553_0102_1005607D9DAD88C0"/>Coverly was unable to reply; but the grateful tear of ſenſibility bedewed his cheek.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Owens now began to buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and provide ſomething for the entertainment of her gueſts;—on inſpecting the ſtate of her larder, ſhe found that Mr. Owens had not been very attentive, all ſhe could procure for ſupper was eggs, cheeſe and fruit;—at this ſimple fare, what contentment reigned, at the board of luxry never appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more ſmiling countenances.</p>
            <p>Montfort and Coverly were preſs'd to ſtay at the Glebe; but the former choſe to go to Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's houſe, but left Miſs Lucy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; with whom Jaſper had commenced a flirtation, which, had we heard, we would certainly
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035553_0103_1005607FBB2BDF78"/>
have put down as an original of the kind.</p>
            <p>Jaſper and Conſtantia roſe early in the morning, as neither could taſte the ſweets of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> from ſome particular ſenſations of their own; they met almoſt the ſame inſtant, in the alcove.</p>
            <p>Jaſper, after ſome prefacing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan talking of Lucy, and aſked his ſiſter's opinion of her; who gave a very favorable one.—After ſome hemming and ſtammering, he ſaid he propoſed ſending her a letter, by way of diſcloſing ſome tender ſentiments which ſhe had inſpired him with, and deſired her aſſiſtance;—I know, cried he, (flouriſhing his hand round his temples) girls have heads—heads fit for ſuch light frivolous matters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:035553_0104_1005608201FFA478"/>Well Jaſper—as there never was a letter without eyes, you muſt begin with them:—</p>
            <p>"Your eyes, dear madam, have pointed the ſhafts of Cupid, and transfixed thro' and thro' my heart with arrows;—in you madam, I perceive all conſtellations of charms of which youthful poets have ſo often ſung—What's the lilly—the jeſſamine—the roſe—the pink— or even the violet, that ſweeteſt of all flowers, when compared to you? The effulgence of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has dazzled me, and I wreſt the palm from the hands of Helen and Cleopatria to put it in your's"</p>
            <p>Jaſper, whoſe patience was wound up to the laſt extremity, ſtarted up—may I never tranſlate another ecclogue of Virgil, cried he, Con, but I wiſh you, I don't

Mr. and Mrs. Owens, I have been adviſing my Son to think of entering into the married ſtate.</p>
            <p>Aye and a moſt comfortable ſtate it ſometimes is, ſaid Mrs. Owens, as my Frank can tell you —eh, lovey?</p>
            <p>Coverly and Conſtantia bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; their eyes ſympathetically faſtened for a moment on each other.</p>
            <p>I know a young lady, reſumed Mr. Montfort, poſſeſſed of a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fortune, to whom I deſire to ſee him united.</p>
            <p>[At the mention of the word 'Fortune,' a ſudden gloom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt the countenance of Coverly, who had indulged the fond idea
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035553_0109_1005608CD0B88C50"/>
that Conſtantia was in the old gentleman's thoughts.]</p>
            <p>Yes, my ſon, continued he, ſuch an event would yield a ray of felicity to the cloſing evening of my life; I am not diſintereſted ſolely in my friendſhip, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this return for it?—my wealth, my moſt perfect eſteem ſhall then be yours.</p>
            <p>Coverly haſtily roſe from his ſeat; his cheeks were fluſhed, and his eyes ſparkled with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant haughtineſs:—</p>
            <p>Retain your wealth Sir, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, your eſteem I wiſhed to preſerve, but on theſe terms can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not purchaſe it.</p>
            <p>Worlds would be no equivalent for a union that a reluctant heart muſt render everlaſtingly wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:035553_0110_1005608FA836EFE8"/>Know Sir, I would not give up the delightful privilege of loving, though deſpairingly, one of the firſt in my opinion, of her ſex, for the ſordid advantage of riſing into ſplendor.</p>
            <p>When your friendſhip was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me, I ſketched out proſpects full of extacy, and looked to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating my happineſs with the only object who could afford me any; the fabric of my hopes is raſed to the duſt; but I'm inured to diſappointments, and though this is the ſevereſt ſtroke, I truſt it will be ſuſtained without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complaint.</p>
            <p>But ſurely Sir you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of your eſteem; my ſoul already ruffled by two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would feel yet more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with the world, ſhould the ſweet bond of friendſhip, it was entering into with you, be thus rudely broken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:035553_0111_1005609136D7C3B0"/>Deprive you of my eſteem, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Montfort, ruſhing into his arms, and falling on his neck, unable, from his powerful emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to utter more.</p>
            <p>True ſon of Iſabella, cried he, recovering, ſuch was her ſpirit, her nobleneſs, her fortitude; oh! thou who art bound in my heart and interwoven in all its affections, didſt thou ſuppoſe I would lead thee from thy pictured felicity? I mentioned a lady of fortune, and in my eſtimation ſhe has the moſt valuable of all poſſeſſions: Virtue, innocence and beauty, great is her dowry, ineſtimable her worth;— take to thy arms oh Coverly, take Conſtantia to thy noble breaſt!</p>
            <p>Coverly ſtarted! his uplifted claſp'd hands, and ſpeechleſs rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evinced more ſtrongly than words, his gratitude and joy; the deadly paleneſs of Conſtantia
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035553_0112_10056094269DF898"/>
gave way to natural bluſhes;— in the height of her agitation, her cup fell from her hand on Jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's foot, fortunately the contents were not very warm, yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſo, to make him leap from ſurprize, to the fartheſt part of the room.</p>
            <p>Need I ſay Mr. Montfort had occaſion to reiterate his words to Coverly, oh! no, he claſped his Conſtantia to his heart, a heart which had ſo long, ſo conſtantly, ſo ſadly ſighed for her.—Oh! Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Sincerity, how great was thy reward at that moment?</p>
            <p>And am I to call Conſtantia mine? cried he, in half broken accents;—no fears to oppoſe?— with thee to unite my fate;—ſay my beloved, am I really poſſeſſed of ſuch bliſs?</p>
            <p>Her tears fell—her tears of joy ſhe could not ſuppreſs,—yes, dear
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035553_0113_10056095AC234930"/>
Coverly, ſhe gently ſaid, ever precious to me will be the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this hour.</p>
            <p>Serenely, ſaid Montfort, may ye walk through life; and ſhould Providence afflict, from ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and love may balm be deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but oh! be every ill averted from your heads; thine be the roſes unmixed with thorns,—ſo ſhall my life, long obſcured in clouds, ſet at laſt with ſome degree of brightneſs.</p>
            <p>All now was gratitude and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements; till the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of thoſe ſenſations ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding, they began to grow a little rational and compoſed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Montfort, now noticed the dejection of Jaſper's looks; who was ſitting very ruefully rubbing his foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:035553_0114_100560981C2189C0"/>As for you my young hero, cried he, we all perceive that you are at leaſt, vulnerable in your heel, like the great Achilles;— and I make no doubt but your heart is alſo penetrable to the ſoft influence of a ſly urchin, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Love.</p>
            <p>I have in ſome degree, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty like Pope's Aerial, of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the human breaſt;—and I think I've diſcerned ſomething in your's and a certain lady's, which looks like ſympathetic feeling.</p>
            <p>Why, what Sir? exclaimed Jaſper, has Miſs Lucy diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—if ſhe has upon my—</p>
            <p>Here the parſon interrupted him, for he had an averſion to ſwearing, and ſaw an expreſſion in his countenance, that threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething tremendous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:035553_0115_1005609AD77E30D0"/>The anger of Jaſper quickly led to a diſcovery of its cauſe, and when the letter was produced, which he had not power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, from beholding the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of "Lucy Montfort," no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing except Conſtantia's confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, could equal that of the young lady's.</p>
            <p>His ſiſter's embarraſſment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them ſhe was the culprit: ſhe pleaded guilty,—received a chiding from Coverly,—a rebuke from her mother, for diſtreſſing the ſweet child,—and was told by her father, that ſhe had deviated from the Golden Rule.</p>
            <p>But it's impoſſible to deſcribe the tranſports of Jaſper—ſtarting up, forgetful of pain and ridicule, he caught Lucy's hand to his lips; and ſeized Mr. Montfort's with a ſqueeze, that made the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man haſtily ſtrive to diſengage it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:035553_0116_1005609D1B9D0BC8"/>His reſentment to his ſiſter was not quite appeaſed; and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, he would not write the epithalamium he had long ago planned againſt her marriage.</p>
            <p>To have my fair kinſwoman ſettled, ſaid Montfort, is now all I can deſire; 'tis certain ſhe and you, my friend Jaſper, know each other but a ſhort time; but in affairs of happineſs I always wave ceremony—there is an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs in both, which at once declares the diſpoſition, and ſhews time is not wanting to diſcover their propenſities;—why then ſhould there be any delay?</p>
            <p>Aye, why ſhould there? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Mrs. Owens, her eyes ſwimming in tears of delight, my maxim is to ſecure good when it's offered; ah, bleſs you, I'm not one of thoſe ſhilly ſhally folks that ſtands as if I did'nt know whether
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035553_0117_1005609EA1605B78"/>
to take or refuſe what I have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for.</p>
            <p>No, that you are not, my love, ſaid the parſon, don't you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how you threw me out of my chair, once in your hurry?— and how another day you broke the ſet of candle-cups your aunt Bridget gave you, by your haſte?</p>
            <p>Mr. Montfort interrupted the parſon's enumeration of accidents, by leading Jaſper to the bluſhing Lucy, who at firſt heſitated, but as her inclination coincided with his, (though modeſty deemed it neceſſary at firſt to oppoſe) ſhe ſoon yielded conſent to change her ſtate on the ſame day with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia; and received from the tranſported Jaſper a ſtring of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments quite in the ſublime or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Owens appeared ſcarcely ſenſible of what ſhe was doing; in vain her huſband preached mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, all was hurry and ſchemes
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035553_0118_100560A17546D310"/>
of grandeur; and in this derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ideas, ſhe was near demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſome of his manuſcript ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to put under confectionaries, had he not timely entered, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued them from her mercileſs hands.</p>
            <p>The wiſhed for morning at length arrived—the party walked to the church without any pomp, innocence and felicity were alone in their train, the birds from every bough appeared to ſing hymeneals, and to their gladdened eyes the earth wore a more ſmiling aſpect. —Montfort gave both ladies away, and the good parſon tied the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable knot.</p>
            <p>Having now I think (as Adam ſays) brought my ſtory to the ſum of earthly bliſs, I cannot conclude without firſt relating the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my heroes and heroines:</p>
            <p>Montfort, their generous friend, provided for all;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="unknown:035553_0119_100560A315A4B5E0"/>Coverley's houſe was enlarged, but ſtill retained all the ſimplicity of architecture; from its amiable inmates he experiences that ſoothing unremitting attention, which has diffuſed felicity through his mind; he has made it his conſtant abode, and terms it—"The Reſidence of True Content."</p>
            <p>Jaſper took orders, and has a beneficial living about five miles from the Glebe;—he perſeveres in that path which his father led him from his infantine days; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of conſcious rectitude, an amiable wife, and a blooming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny he boaſts a happineſs, even the great might envy.</p>
            <p>Pure and unruffled flow on the days of Coverly and Conſtantia. Montfort's tears often ſteal down, from the fulneſs of joy in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theirs; and, in thoſe moments he withdraws to ſolitude with his little God-daughter Iſabella, in whoſe features, he traces a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of his ever beloved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:035553_0120_100560A5FB44DDE8"/>The parſon and his wife, are as happy a couple as live;—and though ſhe ſometimes takes a ſhort flight from the neſt, ſhe always returns to her lovey with ſmiles of affection.</p>
            <p>Mr. Montfort ſeeks the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the wretched, chearing and relieving every child of ſorrow;— ſo that the poor inhabitants have reaſon to bleſs the hour he ſettled near the Glebe Houſe.</p>
            <p>We have long detained our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in a ſimple manſion, from which, perhaps, they thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be obſerved worthy regard—though the proſpect is plain and unvariegated, we truſt, no object appeared in it, that had not a tendency to prove that—a perſeverance in prudence and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue only can beſtow felicity.</p>
            <p>We now bid them FAREWELL, and hope if they have found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in The Glebe Houſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud, they will at leaſt be a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral power, and not condemn.</p>
