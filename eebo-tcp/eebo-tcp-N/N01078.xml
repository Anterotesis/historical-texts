            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE Life which the Children of God are called to lead in this World, is a Life of <hi>Faith,</hi> and not of ſenſe: for the ſupporting and ſtrengthning of which Faith, he hath laid in great and exceeding precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which they are to feed upon: and if they do not make a comfortable living on them, it is their own fault. Thoſe Promiſes have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in them to fortify us with reſolution to purſue the hardeſt Duties, and bear down all the Diſcouragements that thruſt in our way to ſtop it up, and bring us to a ſtand; and to give us light and conſolation in the darkeſt hours
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001286_0003_0FB22AFB0EE585B8"/>
of ſinking diſtreſs. If we could ſo fix our Truſt on God, and place our firm reliance on his power and veracity, <hi>we ſhould be like Mount Zion that cannot be moved.</hi> And indeed there is ſo much of Paradox in theſe Promiſes, that ſenſe is blundred at them, and carnal reaſon is run a ground at the contemplation of them, and Faith only can make true <hi>Engliſh</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>Such a Promiſe is this now under our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which not only do the Unbelieving World make a ridicule of, but the Godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſometimes at a loſs about it: Hence that puzzle which the Pſalmiſt was involved in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>begin.</hi> and probably there are a great many things in Providence, which a Believer cannot at preſent ſee through, nor is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile until he comes into a better light, as our Saviour told him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.7. <hi>What I do now thou knoweſt not, but thou ſhalt know.</hi> Only in the mean while he believes in hope againſt hope, and ſo comes to conquer the Temptation, and recovers his Tranquillity, as he did after much ſtrugling, by reſolving, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me by Counſel, and afterwards receive me to Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here tarry to enquire after the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers readings of theſe Words by <hi>Interpreters,</hi> or the different ſenſe put on them by Expoſitors, but only take notice of them ſo far as is needful for the right ſtating of the Truth which is to be remarked from them in regard of the preſent
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001286_0004_0FB22AFC839EA2C0"/>
deſign: For which two things may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Subject</hi> here ſpoken of; <hi>the Juſt.</hi> Which Word is to be underſtood according to the tenour of the New Covenant; for, in a legal ſenſe that is a great truth, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not.</hi> And in that reſpect, the Promiſe would be of a non-entity, and exclude every one of <hi>Adams</hi> race, from the Conſolation of it, and ſo become inſignificant, and have no manner of encouragement in it. But it graſps in it all that truly believe, and are accounted Righteous in Gods ſight, through the <hi>Imputation</hi> of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to them; and have received an inherent and inchoate <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> through the <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is very frequently to be underſtood in the word of God; and this is the man whom God reputes to be a <hi>Juſt Man,</hi> and to whom this Promiſe doth belong.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Predicate,</hi> or the thing aſſerted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all ſuch; for the Subject is declared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, and without limitation, amounts to an Univerſal: and that is, <hi>that there ſhall no Evil happen to him.</hi> This is a thing very myſterious, and hardly comprehended by us. The Word, <hi>Evil,</hi> that is here uſed, is uſed to expreſs both the Evil of Sin, and the Evil of Puniſhment or Miſery: and ſome there are that here apply it to the one, ſome to the other, and ſome to both;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001286_0005_0FB22B01429D1140"/>
and probably both may be included in them; for the Words are general, <hi>No Evil ſhall happen to them,</hi> which ſeems to aim at the kinds of Evil: and if we underſtand it in either of there ſenſes, there is difficulty in the aſſignation of it to one as well as the other, in regard of the manner in which this Promiſe is accompliſhed: for it is certain that Godly men do here encounter both with Sin and Sorrow, and if we allow none for Godly but ſuch as are clear of both, <hi>We muſt condemn the whole Generation of the Juſt.</hi> Nor are any free from theſe, till they come to the <hi>Spirits of Juſt Men made Perfect.</hi> And the Word which we render, <hi>Happen;</hi> in one <hi>Conjugation</hi> ſignifies, <hi>to Lament,</hi> and in another, <hi>to Occur,</hi> and ſome would have it in the firſt ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhall not be overwhelmed with any Evil: and that which we render no Evil, in the Original is <hi>all Evil:</hi> but every one that is acquainted with the Language knows, that nothing is more common, than to uſe this Word, diſtributively, for any: and I think that there can be no other, at leaſt no better ſenſe put upon theſe Words, than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhall meet with no ſuch Evil in this World, as ſhall prevent him, yea that ſhall not eventually further him to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Eternal Bleſſedneſs. And this is the thing that remains to be made good, in the proſecution of this,</p>
                  <div type="doctrine">
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001286_0006_0FB22B034D39BA18"/>
                     <head>
                        <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That a Godly Perſon ſhall meet with no Evil in this Life, but what ſhall turn to his great advantage in the iſſue.</head>
                     <p>That many general expreſſions in the Word of God are to be underſtood with a limitation, cannot be denied by him that would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach it of a contradiction: and yet the thing it ſelf hath a certain and excellent Truth couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; and ſo it is here, and this may be made good in reſpect of the Evil of Sin, but that it is aliene from my preſent purpoſe. I ſhall therefore confine the following Diſcourſe to the Evil of <hi>Affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To make way for the clearing of the Doctrine, a few things may be offered Introductory.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Good and Evil may come under a <hi>Phyſical</hi> and a <hi>Moral</hi> Conſideration. In the former ſenſe, a thing may be ſaid to be Good, when it is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the nature of Man, and adapted to his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional cravings. And in this regard, that which hath ſuch a nature put into it, as may afford to a Man the Support of his Life, the preſervation of his Health, the reſtoring of him to his Health, the gratification of his natural Appetites, that is good: and on this account Evil is whatſoever is contrary to this, and damnifies the Man in either of theſe: and this ariſeth from the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001286_0007_0FB22B04C5059560"/>
of the nature of the thing with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man for whoſe uſe it was made; or from its diſagreeableneſs to it in all theſe: this therefore that good Man Prayed for, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, 1 Chron. 4.10. <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt bleſs me indeed, and enlarge my coaſt, and that thine hand may be with me, and that thou wouldeſt keep me from Evil, that it may not grieve me.</hi> In the latter ſenſe, they are conſidered as they bear a reſpect to the Law of God, and are made helpful to us in our Serving of him as our laſt end; or on the other hand become hindrances to us in our faithful Obedience: On this account Sin is called Evil, and Chriſt Prayed that his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might be kept from it, Joh. 17.15. <hi>That thou wilt keep them from the Evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. A thing may be ſaid to be good Phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and evil Morally; and contrarily, evil Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically, and good Morally: Thus all the things that are adapted for the comfort of the mans natural life are good, becauſe they anſwer the next end they were made for: But when theſe are abuſed to the hurt of his Soul, they ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evil to him in that regard. Whereas that which in the former reſpect is reſented as evil, if it is made advantageous to the promoving of his Spiritual Welfare, is upon that account good to him; and for this we have ſuch remarks made in the Word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>Let their Table become a ſnare before them: and that which ſhould have been for their welfare, let it become a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001286_0008_0FB22B0645F94818"/>
trap.</hi> And Eccleſ. 5.13. <hi>There is a ſore evil that I have ſeen under the Sun, Riches kept for the Owners thereof to their hurt.</hi> Theſe things are good in themſelves, yet by mans miſimprovement of them, they become to him eventually evil, and do him the greateſt hurt, becauſe they undo his Soul. Whereas by a wiſe and gracious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſuch things as are the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to mens natural reſentments, they become to him ſalubrious.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Good or Evil of a thing is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either abſolutely, or as it bears reſpect of a <hi>Medium</hi> to an end. All things come under one of theſe two conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi> either as they are an <hi>End,</hi> or as they are <hi>Media.</hi> Now a thing under the conſideration of an end, hath ever the reſpect of good upon it; for good in the object is the motive of a rational Choice; and nothing can be made an end by a reaſonable Creature but under ſuch an apprehenſion: but it is not to be denied, but that a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to himſelf an evil end, under an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of good to his blinded judgment; and that is when he propoſeth to himſelf that, in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment whereof he will not make himſelf happy, but miſerable; and ſuch are the too frequent deſigns of deluded men, <hi>who call evil good, and good evil.</hi> And this is, either when he propoſeth that to himſelf as his laſt end, which is but a ſubordinate one; and though in its place it might be good, yet by thus diſplacing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001286_0009_0FB22B07E08B6BC0"/>
it, it becomes evil to him; as when a man makes his preſent outward accommodation his fartheſt deſign; or when he hath no farther reach in what he doth, but to bring to paſs a wicked purpoſe. But in the uſing of a thing as a <hi>Medium,</hi> ſuppoſing the end to be good, the <hi>Medium</hi> is then good; when it is both lawful, and hath a tendency in it to promove the thing ſought; and evil when it is either unlawful, or will obſtruct the deſign for which it is uſed: as when a man either ſeeketh gain in an evil caſe, or uſeth ſuch means as will hinder and not further his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which is truly ſerviceable to advance a mans laſt end, cannot in a Theological ſenſe be called evil, but muſt be confeſſed to be good. There is a laſt end, &amp; there be ſuch as are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate. The laſt end is the Glory of God, which the reaſonable Creature is, or ought to be bound for in all that he is concerned in; and there are ſubordinate ends, which men may lawfully purſue in their right order; a man may lawfully ſeek his preſent comfort, and uſe the approved means for the obtainment of it, and that which ſerves him herein is good in this regard: but if this hinders him in his purſuit of his laſt end, it certainly becomes evil to him. But that which whether it helps the former or no, doth yet become in the iſſue more ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the latter, it ought not to be called Evil, but Good; and on this ſcore we have the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts

acknowledgment, Pſal. 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus Premiſed, it follows that we proceed to apply this matter to the truth that lies before us; and to explicate this, Let us obſerve.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is the Lot of the Children of God to ſuffer Affliction in this Life.</hi> This is an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced truth, and no other than what our Saviour hath warned us of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. In this world you ſhall have tribulation;</hi> and the Apoſtles taught this every where, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. <hi>That we muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> And it is here to be remarked, that as the Life of the Godly is here a life of trouble, ſo there are no temporary troubles which mankind are liable to, but the Godly may encounter the like, and that not only for kind, but all the temporary circumſtances of them, inſomuch as there is no room at all here left to diſtinguiſh between the one and the other; this the wiſe man obſerves, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. <hi>No man can know love or hatred by all that is before him, and there is one event to the good and bad, &amp;c.</hi> And all the difference is, that to the one they come full of the Curſe, and are but the beginning of ſorrows; whereas to the others they are exempted from the Curſe, and have a Bleſſing annexed to them, which is not to be gathered from the thing it ſelf, but only from the effects, which, what it is, will be anon
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001286_0011_0FB22B0DC947CF08"/>
conſidered. But this is known only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and is to be judged of by the fruits.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That God is the Author of all the Afflictions which theſe do ſuffer.</hi> Some there be who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that when it is ſaid that no evil ſhall <hi>happen</hi> to theſe, it only intends, that nothing ſhall befal them caſually, but every thing ſhall be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the All-wiſe <hi>Counſel</hi> of God; which is indeed a truth in it ſelf; but the Wicked as well as the Godly are herein concerned; and beſides as to ſecond cauſes there are contingencies in theſe things. But this is not all the meaning: and the word not only ſignifies to <hi>Happen,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Evene,</hi> or come to paſs. And it is very certain that all events are according as they were fore-appointed, as he confeſſeth, <hi>Job</hi> 23.14. <hi>He performeth the thing that is appointed for me;</hi> and God aſſumes this to himſelf, and makes that challenge, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Is there any Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> And God, in his ordinary Providence, works, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and frequently by rational Agents, and ſuch as are malicious as well as voluntary; nevertheleſs they do what he hath ſeen good that it ſhall be done; thoſe therefore are called <hi>his hand, Pſal.</hi> 17.14. And it is our duty to look beyond ſecond cauſes in all the troubles that we undergo in this world, or elſe we ſhall never make a right and profitable improvement of them; hence that, Pſal. 39.9. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001286_0012_0FB22B0F45CC9A98"/>3. <hi>That God hath appointed theſe to Glory, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Afflictions which they do at preſent ſuffer.</hi> To this they were deſigned in his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſel, and this was ſecured to them in their Effectual Calling, which is one of thoſe <hi>Gifts of God which are without Repentance.</hi> If then God had not in his purpoſe reſolved to bring them to Glory, he would never have called them, but left them in their Unregeneracy, ſo that let their trials be never ſo many or great, it is no evidence, as ſome are ready in their dark hours to ſuſpect, that he either never Loved them, or that he hath forgotten to be gracious. We are therefore to conſider what he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to, <hi>viz. to Eternal Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. And this is an undeniable evidence that they can meet with nothing, though never ſo ſevere, that ſhall obſtruct their Salvation, by ſeparating of them from the love of God, which hath enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them: and of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks with the greateſt confidence, in, Rom. 8.38, 39. <hi>I am perſwaded that neither Death nor Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>That God ſends theſe Afflictions to prepare them for, and to bring them to this Glory.</hi> He is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Wiſe Agent, and muſt have ſome Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy deſign in all his Works, Pſal. 104.24. <hi>In Wiſdom haſt thou made them all.</hi> Now if Gods end in regard of theſe, be to Glorify himſelf in advancing of them unto Glory, all his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them are in Wiſdom accommodated to bring this about. There is a great deal needful
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001286_0013_0FB22B10D2FBD148"/>
to fit them for the Kingdom, and conduct them ſafe to it: and the whole way of God towards them in his Providence is to lead them thither. This was Chriſts buſineſs, Heb. 2.10. <hi>To bring many Sons to Glory:</hi> and their whole conduct is to accompliſh this, Pſal. 73.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me by Counſel, and afterward ſhalt receive me to Glory.</hi> And on this account we are told, Pſal. 25.10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth.</hi> Now Afflictions belong to this conduct, and are no little part of it. And if it be asked, Why doth God ſo Afflict his own? The anſwer is ready, Iſa. 27.9. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob, be purged, and all the fruit ſhall be to take away Sin.</hi> And on this account we are told that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come but when there is need of them, 1 Pet. 1.6. <hi>Ye are, if need be in heavineſs,</hi> &amp;c. And there is not one Affliction that a Believer meets with, but hath an Eye to this, for <hi>God Afflicts not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>As God uſeth theſe Media for, ſo he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly over-rule them to the promoving of this deſign. The Counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand,</hi> neither ſhall any thing defeat it: with this he comforts his People when the blackeſt Providences paſſed over them, Jer. 29.11. <hi>I know mine own thoughts, even thoughts of good will, and not evil, and to give an expected end.</hi> And hath he ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it? Inſtruments may intend hurt by what they do, but he will turn it to good; and every gracious Soul ſhall find it in the iſſue,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001286_0014_0FB22B12471AB1F0"/>
and may allot upon it as he, Job 22.10. <hi>When I am tryed, I ſhall come forth as Gold.</hi> He therefore always Sits by the Furnace, and looks carefully after it; and by a powerful Influence gives it its kindly operation. The Apoſtle could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelf in this, 2 Cor. 4.17. <hi>Our light Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> And every Affliction belongs to theſe <hi>all things which ſhall work together for the Good of Gods called,</hi> Rom. 8.28. And neither Satans Malice, nor wicked Mens rage ſhall be able to hinder it, but it ſhall be ſo in the event, Eccl. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>There is no Affliction that over-takes a Child of God, but what proceeds from his Love.</hi> We aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe Love to God, ſometimes on the account of his <hi>Beneficence,</hi> and this is common to Good and Evil, Math. 5.45. <hi>He maketh his Sun to ſhine on the Evil, and the Good, and cauſeth his rain to fall on the Juſt and the Unjuſt.</hi> Sometimes to his <hi>Benevolence,</hi> or purpoſe of everlaſting good to them; and this is peculiar to Some, and every true Believer hath an intereſt in this Love: yea this is it that Governs all the Providences that paſs over them. Is it Love that moves him to afflict them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord Loveth he chaſteneth.</hi> It is Love that preſides in the Affliction it ſelf, as to kind, degree, and continuance. It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hates them that he Afflicts them, nor
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001286_0015_0FB22B1623242F70"/>
is it becauſe he Loveth the Wicked, that they proſper; for, Pſal. 92.7. <hi>When all the Workers of iniquity proſper, it is that they may be deſtroyed for ever.</hi> Now as Love is an affection that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives and purſues the beſt good of the object of it, ſo it cannot willingly do it any Evil, for it is contrary to it: and though there may be the Anger of God at his Children manifeſted in the Affliction, yet it is the Anger of Love, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of a Father, and not of an Enemy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30. &amp;c. <hi>I will chaſten them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but my loving kindneſs I will not take from him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if we conſider what are the things that he deſigns and accompliſheth thereby, we ſhall be farther aſſured of it; for, all that he intends by it, in regard of them, will come under thoſe heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To Chaſten them for their Sin, and reclaim them from it.</hi> Sometimes they fall into Sin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Provoke him, and it is fit that they ſhould be humbled for it: and it is meet alſo that the World ſhould not be Scandalized at it; and this is one reaſon of their troubles: they are apt, when fallen into Sin to ly in it, and too often to go on farther: but God, when poſſibly they have been told of it, and ſolemnly warned about it, but have taken no notice of this; now ſends Affliction on them, and thereby makes them to reſent their follies, and brings them back again, ſuch was his experience, Pſal. 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray; but now have I kept thy

Now this muſt needs be Love, &amp; turn to their beſt Good; for we are aſſured that the contrary is a fearful Note of his hatred; Pſal. 87.21, 22. — <hi>Iſrael would none of me, ſo I gave them up to their own hearts luſts.</hi> Heb. 12.8. <hi>If ye be without Chaſtiſement, whereof all are</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, <hi>ye are baſtards, and not Sons.</hi>

But that Godly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may, and often do ſo dy, is certain: And is there no Evil in this?

                     <p>
                        <hi>USE.</hi> I ſhall wave all other Application which might have been offered, and confine my ſelf to preſenting, by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> a few practical Leſſons, which may be Servicable to the preſent Occaſion, and be helpful, as to us all in regard of the Afflictions of this preſent Life, which we ought to Live always in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of; ſo in particular to this Family whom God hath put into Mourning, under an awful bereavement, and bitterly circumſtanced. Let us acknowledge the Merciful kindneſs of God, which hath given ſo much juſt Matter of Conſolation on one hand, that in reſpect of the Perſon gone, there is no cauſe to Mourn for him as one that is without hope, having ſo many juſt grounds to conclude that he is gotten ſafe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the troubles of this Miſerable World, and lodged ſafe in the Arms and Boſom of CHRIST, <hi>Which is beſt of all.</hi> But our buſineſs is to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to turn it to our own advantage: And that they who are nextly concerned in this, may find that there is no Evil hapned to them hereby, but that it may be found to their Everlaſting Good:
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001286_0023_0FB2777D4C29FBB0"/>
and that we may all of us experience the like by all the Tryals of this Life which may paſs over us. And here,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Let not our expectation of Affliction put us into Conſternation.</hi> It is good for us always to fear it with a fear of expectation, elſe when it comes it will take us on Surprize, and in all likelihood find us unready, which becomes not a true Chriſtian; for, Prov. 28.14. <hi>Happy is the Man that feareth always.</hi> But we are apt to be put into Conſternation with it, which is more perplexing to us then the thing it ſelf. Whereas, becauſe it is poſſible that the thing feared may never come to paſs, it is imprudent to perplex our ſelves about it before hand: and it is enough to quiet us into a ſedate frame, to Conſider that if we are the Children of God, though it ſhall come, and come circumſtanced as bad as we imagined, yet it ſhall do us no real hurt: and if we can but wait, we ſhall find ſuch advantage from it, as ſhall make us to confeſs that we are ſufficiently recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſo he aſſures them, Heb. 12.11. <hi>Afterwards it yieldeth the Peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs to thoſe that are exerciſed thereby.</hi> Yea to make ſure of this, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath caſt up the account, and brought in the true reckoning of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>I reckon that the Sufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> And then what an unreaſonable thing is it, to put our ſelves into a fright about it?</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:001286_0024_0FB27782377CC5E0"/>II. <hi>Let us rightly Improve this Truth to help us to a ſuitable demeanure of our Selves; when we are under the Exerciſe of Grievous Afflictions.</hi> And there are ſuch Leſſons as theſe we ſhould Learn from it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Let it put us anew upon the Confirming of our Aſſurance, that we are ſuch Juſt Perſons.</hi> Our clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this is apt to be obſcured; &amp; the darkneſs of Providence too frequently raiſeth Clouds on our Mind about it: and this is very often the perplexity of a Chriſtian, &amp; he thinks that he could be quiet under the Affliction, were he but ſure of this. Now the beſt way ſo to be is to be often proving of our ſelves, according to the advice given, 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether you are in the faith: prove your own ſelves.</hi> This alſo will be a good way to keep us from doing any thing that will interpoſe to hide this light from us, or will provoke the Holy Spirit to withdraw the affording us his confirming Teſtimony. The Promiſe on which our hope is built, is not to be doubted of, ſo that there needs nothing to yield us ſatisfaction, &amp; afford us a triumph, but to know that we are the <hi>Heirs of this Promiſe.</hi> There are <hi>the things which accompany Salvation,</hi> and if we can find them in us we have now nothing to do, but to Suck out the ſweetneſs therein.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us Corroborate our Faith on the Promiſe and humbly Claim it of God.</hi> We are here to Live by Faith, and the whole dependence of our Faith is on the Promiſe, if that could fail, we might be miſerable; but if that will hold, we are ſafe.
<pb facs="unknown:001286_0025_0FB2778899CD9740"/>
If God him ſaid that no Evil ſhall befall us, we may be ſure that it will be ſo, though ſenſe ſhould bring in a contrary Verdict. Our work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to keep our Eyes upon this; to conſider the Contents of it, and then think believingly, who hath paſt it; the God who is Unchangable in his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Purpoſes, Mal.</hi> 3.6. The God who is faithful, and will therefore be as good as his Word, 1 Theſ. 5.24. <hi>Faithful is he who hath called you, who will do it.</hi> Who cannot repent of what he hath ſaid, 1 Sam. 15.29. <hi>The Strength of Iſrael cannot lye nor repent; for he is not a Man that he ſhould lye, nor a Son of Man that he ſhould repent.</hi> And is able to give Being to his Word, Eph. 3.20. <hi>To him that is able to do exceeding abundantly more than we ask or think,</hi> &amp;c. And let us remember that his Promiſes are nothing elſe but his Purpoſe made known for us to rely on. Let us then humbly challenge it of him, &amp; with our acknowledgment of our own unworthineſs, let us put him in mind of it; as he, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10, 12. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy Mercies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely do thee Good,</hi> &amp;c. Conſider that he expects this of us, Ezek. 30.37. <hi>I will be ſought to by the houſe of Iſrael to do this for them.</hi> And let us believe that it ſhall be ſo, and this will quiet our tumultuous thoughts: What ſaid he, Pſal. 27.13. <hi>I had fainted if I had not believed to ſee the Salvation of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us turn our Eyes from the Affliction, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Glory which this Affliction ſhall work for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001286_0026_0FB2778E935F88A0"/>
us.</hi> If we only pore upon the trouble, and fix there, we ſhall readily ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> once did, <hi>All theſe things are againſt me.</hi> But, though we may and ought to look on the Affliction it ſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuitably to affect our ſelves, and without it we cannot do our Duty, and God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to be ſottiſh &amp; ſtupid: yet we are not to tarry here, leſt our Spirits be leavened with it; but we are to look beyond this, and take a view of that which is to come. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us how he was helped to keep from fainting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſent Affliction, 2 Cor. 4.18. <hi>Whiles we look not at the things that are ſeen, but the things that are not ſeen,</hi> &amp;c. Let us look upon the Crown, Lift at it, and ſee how Weighty it is, and conſider the Eternal duration of it; and then believe that this is it that we are conducted to, and fitting for by all that we meet, and then draw proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from it, and this will raiſe us above the Temptation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us Enquire into the Mind of God concerning us in the Affliction.</hi> Whatſoever cauſualty there is in our trouble in regard of Second Cauſes, yet, as God is the Supream authour &amp; orderer of all the things that come to paſs in time; ſo it is our Duty humbly to enquire into his deſign, or what it comes for: thus did he, Job 10.2. <hi>Shew me I Pray thee, wherefore thou contendeſt with me.</hi> So he, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. <hi>beg.</hi> And as God always doth it for the Spiritual profit of his own, ſo, that we may thus profit by it, we muſt endeavour to acquaint our
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001286_0027_0FB27793EA70D288"/>
ſelves with the Meaning of it. Nor is a general perſwaſion that it is for our good, becauſe we are his Called, ſufficient for us; but we muſt by it be excited to our Duty, which that we may we muſt know it, and that whether for <hi>Correction,</hi> or for <hi>Tryal,</hi> and though we may not expect imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation, yet there are the <hi>Rules</hi> given us by God in his Holy Word, by which we may be directed in this: Only we muſt Pray to God to help us in it by his Spirit, as he did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.22, 24. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my Heart; try me &amp; know my thoughts; and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, &amp; lead me in the Way Everlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Let us improve it to the declared Ends of it.</hi> We are not only told that all our Afflictions are the Hand of God, but alſo that he hath gracious deſigns in them, regarding his own; and that they are <hi>to Teach us to profit:</hi> And that we may ſo profit by them, and find them Good and not Evil to us, we muſt apply them to theſe ends. What theſe are, we before Obſerved; and let us Wait on him for his Grace to Help us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Let us then apply them to Mortify our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Corruptions, to Promove our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all our Follies, to Wean us from this vain World, and abate our exorbitant Affections to the things here below; to make us more Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in our whole Courſe; and ſo animate our deſires after, and longings for the Heavenly Kingdom; to make us more ready for the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the more patiently &amp; cheerfully to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001286_0028_0FB22B1D87CE4E68"/>
Wait for our Approaching Change, <hi>Being with Loyns girt, Lamps burning, waiting for the Coming of our Lord: and how happy ſhall we then be, if when he cometh he ſhall find us ſo doing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Let us Corroborate our Love to God by this.</hi> We are too apt, under grievous Calamities, to maintain Prejudies againſt God in our Hearts, and we find how far this wrought on the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7. &amp;c. <hi>Will God caſt off for ever? Hath he forgotten to be gracious?</hi> &amp;c. But this ariſeth from miſtake, and becauſe we put a falſe gloſs on the Providence, elſe we ſhould not ſo do. Could we, as we ought, believe that all this is the product of his Everlaſting Love, and a part of that Allwiſe Counſel, which hath laid out our Way to Glory, and will by it certainly advance us thereunto, and both can and will make it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to this purpoſe; It would put more Charitable thoughts into us, and make us to ſay as he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75. <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that in very faithfulneſs thou haſt Afflicted me.</hi> And this would make us to Love the hand which diſpenſeth it to us. And could we ſo do, how comfortably would it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us under our greateſt diſtreſſes?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Let us by this Comfort our ſelves under all the Oppreſſing Circumſtances of our Trouble.</hi> We are too apt to pore more upon the Circumſtances than the thing it ſelf, and thereby to put more of Gall and Wormwood into our own Cup: Whereas this is indeed an Errour, and though
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001286_0029_0FB2776787D52080"/>
it is apt to make impreſſion on our ſenſes, yet it ought not to impede our Faith and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for, not only did infinite Wiſdom ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, but the thing it ſelf doth not put any real <hi>Obex</hi> to our Faith in the Promiſe, which we are to Live upon. Let the DEATH of our God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relation be accompliſhed with the greateſt Barbarity imaginable; all the hurt it did to him was but to help him to Glory, and what is it that we can deſire beyond that? If ſuch be well Lodged, all is well. And as to our ſelves, it cannot rationally becloud our hopes, for though the Chariot were of fire, yet the Conveyance was to the Kingdom, where we hope ere long to arrive: And with this let us comfort our ſelves for the preſent, That <hi>though they ſhall not return to us, we ſhall go to them.</hi> And if we Love Earth leſs, and Heaven more, by every removal of any of ours from hence thither, and this makes us the more diligently to <hi>wait for, &amp; haſten to the Coming and Kingdom of CHRIST,</hi> a few days more and our Sorrows ſhall be over, our Tears dryed up, and our Joys perfected.</p>

                  <p>TIS the Lot of GOD'S Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren while in this World, to meet with Troubles more or leſs. And through the remaining Naughtineſs of their Hearts, they are too prone to Murmur and Repine under them. Therefore Conſiderations to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Murmuring, and Quicken Patience, ſhould never be reckon'd unſeaſonable; and eſpecially when ſome ſore Tryal is actually upon them. And indeed it was a ſore Trial, which Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd this SERMON. I had thoughts of another Subject for the <hi>Lecture</hi> (as it fell to me in Courſe) but a few dayes before the <hi>Lecture</hi> came; I was Surpriz'd with the Sorrowful News, of a <hi>Barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der committed upon Mr.</hi> Simeon Stoddard; <hi>Merchant, in</hi> London: <hi>A Perſon of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſh'd Character, and of great Note for his Early and Steady Piety:</hi> Son to <hi>Simeon Stoddard Eſqr.</hi> in <hi>Boſton.</hi> A more full

account of this Barbarous Murder, may be ſeen in the <hi>Boſton News-Letter, Numb. 127.</hi> Twas this Sorrowful News, that turn'd my thoughts to the Text before us: Hoping that a Diſcourſe upon it, might be Uſefull to all that might hear it, eſpecially to the <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Parents,</hi> and other <hi>Relations,</hi> of the Worthy Perſon thus awfully Removed. And as this <hi>SERMON</hi> was Preached, more particularly for their Sakes; ſo at the deſire of the <hi>Honoured and Bereaved Father,</hi> it is now Printed. That all who have <hi>Heard</hi> this <hi>SERMON,</hi> or may <hi>Read</hi> it, may thereby be furthered in a Suitable carriage under Afflictions, is the Deſire and Prayer of the Unworthy Author,</p>

                  <p>DIVINE <hi>Sovereignty</hi> ought to be acknowledg'd and ador'd, even in all thoſe <hi>Afflictive Diſpenſations of Providence,</hi> which at any time we meet with. Quarrelling with God, is unbecoming for any Creatures, eſpecially thoſe who call themſelves his <hi>Subjects, Servants,</hi> and

                     <hi>Children.</hi> If God is pleaſed to lay his Hand hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon us, we ought quietly and patiently to Submit. Our Text informs us, That holy <hi>Aaron</hi> did ſo, under a very ſore Affliction. God had choſen <hi>Aaron</hi> and his <hi>Sons</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts Office,</hi> and order'd them to be imploy'd therein. His two Sons <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> acted contrary to the rules given by God, in ſome of their <hi>Official Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</hi> They offered <hi>Strange Fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not,</hi> verſe 1. Tis thought, that when they burnt <hi>Incenſe,</hi> they did not take <hi>Fire from Gods Altar,</hi> as they ſhould have done, but took <hi>common Fire</hi> for ſuch holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But whatever the particular error was, God was highly provoked with it, and bore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Teſtimony againſt it; for the Slew them both immediately. <hi>There went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they dyed before the Lord,</hi> verſe 2. Some think 'twas <hi>Lightning</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd them, but whether ſo or not, yet tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; <hi>God ſent a Fire which kill'd them.</hi> A couple of <hi>Promiſing Young Men, Young Miniſters,</hi> in their Health, Strength and Vigour; were thus <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly Smitten,</hi> yea kill'd by the Immediate Hand of God. Nay ſome think, that theſe two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had <hi>Drank too much,</hi> which occaſion'd that error for which they died. Becauſe God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gives a charge, That neither <hi>Aaron nor his Sons ſhould drink Wine, or ſtrong Drink when they went into the Tabernacle, leſt they dye: — And that they might put a difference between holy and unholy,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001286_0035_0FB277901DAFA3D0"/>
and between unclean and clean,</hi> verſe 8, 9, 10. And if <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> occaſion'd that error in theſe Young Men, which procur'd their awfull and ſudden Death; then ſurely their <hi>Death,</hi> muſt needs be a more <hi>Aggravated Affliction</hi> to their Pious <hi>Father.</hi> Verily the Death of two ſuch Young Men at once, and that in ſuch an awfull tremendous manner; muſt needs be a very ſore tryal, a very grievous Affliction to holy <hi>Aaron.</hi> Well, and how does <hi>Aaron</hi> behave himſelf under this ſore tryal? What, does he fall a vexing and fretting, does he murmur and repine againſt God? No, nothing of ſuch a carriage, but the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Our Text tells us, <hi>He held his Peace.</hi> That is, he did not ſpeak one murmuring diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Word, he did not blame Divine Providence; but patiently bore God's Hand, meekly and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly ſubmitted to his holy Sovereign Pleaſure, in this heavy and ſore Affliction. And <hi>Aaron</hi>'s car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage herein, is fit to be Imitated by all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, under their ſore tryals. Yea <hi>Aaron</hi>'s hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patient carriage herein is upon <hi>Divine Record, for our Imitation.</hi> For <hi>Whatſoever things were Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aforetime, were Written for our Learning,</hi> Rom. 15.4. From the Words therefore, we may Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this,</p>

Chriſtians muſt in ſome meaſure be <hi>Conformed to their Head,</hi> the bleſſed JESUS. He was a <hi>Man of Sorrows,</hi> and acquainted with grief. He <hi>Firſt Suffered,</hi> and then went into his Glory. He <hi>Firſt endured the Croſs,</hi> deſpiſing the ſhame; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſat down, on the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on high. Chriſtians muſt <hi>Suffer, before they Reign.</hi> But I need ſay no more at preſent, to evidence the firſt Propoſition, viz. <hi>That Chriſtians ſometimes meet with ſore Afflictions:</hi> but may proceed to the,</p>
                     <p>PROP. II. <hi>They ſhould quietly Submit to the Holy Sovereign Will of GOD, under all of them.</hi> They ſhould by no means quarrel with their Maker; nor contend with the Supream Sovereign Owner,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001286_0037_0FB2779E3912CF30"/>
and Governour of all things. They ſhould not fooliſhly tax, thoſe depths of Providence which they cannot fathom. But inſtead of this, they ſhould quietly Submit, lye at God's Foot, adore his Sovereignty, humbly Juſtify him in all his Proceedings; Patiently bearing whatever tryal he's pleaſed to exerciſe them withal.</p>
                     <p>Here we might Inquire,</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> What are thoſe Conſiderations which ſhould move Chriſtians, thus quietly to Submit to the Holy Sovereign Will of GOD, under all their ſore Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions?</q>
                     <p>For Anſwer, There are ſeveral Conſiderations, which ſhould move them hereunto. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome of them, As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>All our Afflictions are brought upon us, by God's Providence.</hi> Indeed <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>Meritorious</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe, of <hi>all Afflictions.</hi> Men are brought <hi>Low,</hi> for their <hi>Iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 106.43. <hi>Your Sins have with-holden good things from you,</hi> Jer. 5.25. Yet God's <hi>Providence,</hi> is the Supream <hi>Efficient</hi> cauſe of all our Troubles: <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Is there any evil</hi> (that is, Affliction) <hi>in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> No, there's none. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7. <hi>I form the light, I create darkneſs; I make Peace, I create Evil; I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi> By <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>Afflictions;</hi> and they are of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Creating.</hi> They riſe not out of the duſt, but are ſent by him who dwells in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001286_0038_0FB2779F4C368E70"/>
Heaven. If we meet with <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> tis of God's ſending: He <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Heals</hi> as he pleaſeth. If we are <hi>Diſappointed</hi> in our Undertakings; this alſo is of God. <hi>Tis of the Lord of Hoſts, that People labour in the very fire, and weary themſelves for very Vanity,</hi> Hab. 2.13. Tis through God's blaſt, that men <hi>Earn Wages,</hi> to put into <hi>Bags with holes.</hi> If Death ſnatches away our deareſt Relations; Death is but God's Meſſenger in ſo doing: for <hi>our Times are in Gods Hand,</hi> Pſal. 31.15. Yea if the Spite and Malice of Wicked Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, are never ſo plainly Inſtrumental, in bringing <hi>Afflictions</hi> upon us; yet we ſhould look on God's Providence, as the Supream Governing Efficient cauſe of thoſe Afflictions. The <hi>Devil</hi> could not be a <hi>Lying Spirit in the Mouths of Ahab</hi>'s <hi>Prophets;</hi> nor hurt <hi>Job</hi> in his <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Eſtate;</hi> nor <hi>Sift Peter with helliſh Temptations;</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>hurt an herd of Swine,</hi> without Divine Permiſſion. <hi>Satan</hi> can no more, nor longer, moleſt us; than God ſees meet to permit him. Though he's a <hi>Roaring Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> yet he's <hi>in Chains.</hi> So <hi>Men</hi> can do us no more harm, than what God is pleas'd to permit of. Even in the miſchiefs which they wickedly do to us, they are but Inſtruments of a Spotleſs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence. Though <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had robbed <hi>Job;</hi> yet <hi>Job</hi> ſayes, Chap. 1. v. 21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Name of the Lord. Judas</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were all Inſtrumental in Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Lord Jeſus: <hi>With wicked hands they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001286_0039_0FB277A608C87190"/>
did Crucify and Slay him,</hi> Act. 2.23. Yet we are told, Rom. 8.32. <hi>God ſpared not his own Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all.</hi> Twas God, that brought Death upon his only begotten Son; though wicked men were wicked Inſtruments of it. <hi>Shimei</hi> did wickedly, in reviling <hi>David</hi> as he did, yet <hi>David</hi> ſays, 2 Sam. 16.10. <hi>The Lord hath ſaid unto him, curſe David.</hi> What, did God bid and command <hi>Shimei,</hi> thus to curſe <hi>David?</hi> No, He forbad it, Exod. 22.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the gods, nor curſe the Ruler of thy People.</hi> But <hi>Davids</hi> meaning was, <hi>God in his Holy, Juſt and Sovereign Providence, had permitted Shimei thus wickedly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile him. David</hi> took notice of <hi>God's Hand,</hi> even in <hi>Mans Wickedneſs.</hi> When wicked men Afflict us, they are but Inſtruments of a Spotleſs Holy Providence therein: they are but a rod in God's Hand, Iſa. 10.5. <hi>O Aſſyrian, the rod of mine Anger, and the Staff in their hand is mine Indignation.</hi> Chap. 42. v. 24. <hi>Who gave Jacob for a Spoil, and Iſrael to the Robbers? Did not the Lord, he againſt whom we have Sinned?</hi> Yes, twas he indeed. If the vileſt and wickedeſt of men, do in the moſt wicked manner that can be, bring Affliction upon us; yet we ought to ſee and acknowledge God's Hand, even in that Affliction. Yea thoſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which are counted the moſt <hi>Caſual,</hi> and <hi>Accidental</hi> as to men and means; are as truly the effects of God's Holy Wiſe All-governing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as any thing elſe in the World is. Hence, if a Man is <hi>Cutting Wood,</hi> and his <hi>Ax flies off and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001286_0040_0FB277A890D3C128"/>
kill's his Neighbour that ſtands by,</hi> (Deut. 19.5.) <hi>God</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to deliver his Neighbour into his hand,</hi> Exod. 21.13. Well then, this Principle muſt be fixed upon our Souls, That <hi>all our Afflictions come from Gods Hand,</hi> whoſoever or whatſoever are the Means or Inſtruments of them. <hi>God does what he will, in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth: He does according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven, Earth, Sea, and in all deep places,</hi> Pſal. 135.6. Tis impoſſible we ſhould quietly Submit to God's Will, under our Afflictions; if we dont take notice of his Hand in them. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſays to God, Pſal. 39.9. <hi>I was dumb, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not my Mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Conſideration is,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That God has Supream Sovereign right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to do with us what he will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> We are often offended with Man, and that very juſtly, when they go beyond their line, and do thoſe things againſt us which they have no Authority for. But God has made all things out of nothing; and he preſerveth them all. <hi>All things are and were created for his pleaſure,</hi> Rev. 4.11. God has made all things for himſelf. And ſince he has thus made, and does preſerve all things; he muſt needs be the ſupream Lord, the Soveraign own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them, Pſal. 24.1. <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof; the World and they that dwell therein.</hi> Therefore God may diſpoſe of us and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001286_0041_0FB277ABF1194E30"/>
of what we have, as he ſees meet. <hi>He may do what he will with his own.</hi> We may not ſay to him, What doſt thou? or, Why doſt thou ſo? God may do as he will, make what diſtinction he pleaſeth between perſons. He may load one Man with <hi>Honour,</hi> and another with <hi>Contempt;</hi> may make one <hi>very Rich,</hi> and another as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably <hi>Poor;</hi> He may continue to one perſon his deſirable <hi>Relations,</hi> and take the Like from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, in what way and manner he will. For he gives none account of his matters. Men often meddle with things, which don't concern them; God never does ſo. He may do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will, for he is Sovereign Lord and owner of all Creatures. As the <hi>clay is in the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's hand, ſo are we in God's hand,</hi> Jer. 18.6. <hi>The thing formed, ſhould not ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> Rom. 9.20, 21. The conſideration, of Gods abſolute indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Supremacy and Sovereignity, ſhould prevent all Murmurings againſt his Providence. O Man, why doſt thou Murmur at thy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? did not God bring them? yea ſurely he did, whatſoever were the Inſtruments of them. And what, wilt thou find fault with God? Is not he Sovereign owner, and Governour of all Creatures? May not he do what he will with his own? Then, whiſt, hold thy peace, be ſtill and know that he is God.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="10" facs="unknown:001286_0042_0FB277AEB4DAE240"/>3. <hi>Our Afflictions are far leſs than our Iniquities deſerve.</hi> Indeed the Saints ſometimes meet with ſore troubles; the Holy Spirit calls them, <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous for the preſent,</hi> Heb. 12.11. Yet the very beſt of men deſerve far greater troubles, than any ever met with in this World. All men are <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> by <hi>natures,</hi> and more or leſs by <hi>practice</hi> too. <hi>There is not a Juſt man upon Earth, that doth good and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.20. Now we are told, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of Sin is Death.</hi> 'Tis Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death and Miſery. Therefore whatſoever trouble we meet with, ſhort of Eternal Death, ſhort of Everlaſting Vengeance, is far leſs than our Iniquities deſerve. 'Tis proper therefore to ſay, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39. <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his Sins?</hi> What, <hi>Living,</hi> and yet complain? That is groundleſs indeed. For Sin deſerves <hi>Death,</hi> therefore while <hi>Life</hi> is continued, he does not ſuffer ſo much as his Sin deſerves; and ſo 'tis unreaſonable for him to find fault. Indeed we may truly ſay with <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>We are not worthy of the leaſt of all the Mercies</hi> beſtow'd upon us. Under our greateſt loads of miſery, we may truly acknowledge with him, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. <hi>God has puniſhed us leſs than our Iniquities deſerve.</hi> Under the ſoreſt trials we ever meet with, we may truly ſay, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. <hi>'Tis of the Lords mercy we are not conſumed.</hi> Inſtead of Murmuring becauſe our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>ſo great,</hi> we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001286_0043_0FB277B05A06B458"/>
'tis a <hi>mercy,</hi> that they are not <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> even ſo as utterly to conſume and deſtroy us. If Chriſtians would but ſeriouſly conſider ſuch things as theſe; doubtleſs 'twould be very uſeful to prevent and ſuppreſs in them, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and repining under their ſoreſt Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. O Chriſtian, why doſt thou find fault? Has God wrong'd thee in any thing? Is he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt? Has he laid heavier burthens on thee, than thou deſerveſt? If he has not, thou haſt no reaſon to complain of his dealings. And ſurely he does not lay upon thee, more than thou deſerveſt. For the Judge of all the Earth will do right. For <hi>He's righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works,</hi> Pſal. 145.17. While thou art out of Hell, thy Miſery is not ſo great as thy Sin. Wherefore then doſt thou find fault? ſhall we Murmur at the receiving of <hi>Ten Stripes,</hi> when inſtead thereof we deſerve <hi>Ten Thouſand?</hi> This would be a groundleſs Murmuring; and ſuch are all the Murmurings of Men, againſt Afflictive Providences. Inſtead therefore of Murmuring and Repining, we ſhould Juſtifie God in all the trials he brings upon us, and ſay as he, Dan. 9.14. <hi>The Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doth, for we obeyed not his voice,</hi> So Mic. 7.9. <hi>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him.</hi> Indeed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our own ſinfulneſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould ſtifle all Murmurings under trouble.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001286_0044_0FB27796EFAD3340"/>4. <hi>This God who brings on us all our Afflictions, is our God.</hi> All ſincere Chriſtians, are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; they have taken God for <hi>their God.</hi> Our <hi>taking God for our God,</hi> implies in it, our <hi>Promiſing and ingaging to keep his Commands. Moſes</hi> does ſo interpret the matter, Deut. 26.17. <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his Statutes and Commands, and his Judgments, and to hearken to his Voice.</hi> Have we taken God, to be our <hi>Covenant-God?</hi> then we have <hi>Promis'd to Obey his Commandments.</hi> Now among other things he Commands us, <hi>To caſt our burthen and our cares upon him,</hi> Pſal. 55.22. 1 Pet. 5.7. And to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our Wayes to him,</hi> Pſal. 37.5. He requires, that we ſhould heartily Submit our ſelves, all our ways and concerns to him, to be guided, govern'd, diſpos'd of in his holy Sovereign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as he pleaſeth. He requires, that we ſhould be ſtill and know that he is God, that we ſhould lye quietly at the Feet of his Sovereignty. He cammands us, <hi>To be Patient in Tribulation,</hi> Rom. 12.12. When we take God <hi>for our God,</hi> we take him for our <hi>Portion;</hi> therefore whatever he takes from us, if he does not caſt us out of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-favour (which he never will do) he does not take away our Portion; and ſo we have no ground to complain. When we take him for our God, we engage to <hi>truſt in his Promiſes, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his Precepts,</hi> and <hi>ſubmit to his Providence.</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001286_0045_0FB277985F2FD748"/>
When therefore we Murmur and Repine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trouble, <hi>We act quite contrary to our own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Engagements:</hi> We break out Solemn Vows and Promiſes. We practically ſay, <hi>We repent of our bargain, or Covenant-Promiſes.</hi> We practically ſay, <hi>We would not have God to govern the World; or to be ſure, not to govern us and our affairs, ſince he takes ſuch a Liberty in dealing with us.</hi> We practically ſay, <hi>We know how to govern the World better than God does;</hi> and that <hi>we would be at our own diſpoſe and not at his.</hi> Our Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and diſcontent at Afflictions, is thus directly contrary to God's Precepts, and our Covenant Ingagements. Indeed, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine againſt the paſſages of Divine Providence, we Sin greatly. Diſcontent is a greater Sin, than many are aware of. Tis highly provoking to God, and often pulls down heavy Judgments. <hi>Rachel</hi> was diſcontent <hi>for want of Children,</hi> Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Gen. 30.1. <hi>Give me Children or elſe I dye.</hi> But indeed, <hi>Her having Children kill'd her:</hi> for ſhe <hi>Dyed in Travail with her ſecond Son,</hi> Gen. 35.18. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Murmur for want of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> God gives them <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but a <hi>Mortal Curſe and Plague with it,</hi> Numb. 11.33. <hi>While the fleſh was yet between their Teeth, are it was chewed, the wrath of God was kindled againſt the People, and the Lord ſmote the People with a very great Plague.</hi> Pſal. 106.15. <hi>He gave them their requeſt, but ſent Leanneſs into their Soul.</hi> Iſrael in a Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcontented fitt, <hi>Wiſh'd they had dyed in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001286_0046_0FB277B31B739E50"/>
Aegypt, or in the Wilderneſs.</hi> God was highly provok'd herewith, and took 'm at their Word, and ſaid, <hi>That they ſhould dye in the Wilderneſs,</hi> Numb. 14. chap. <hi>Six hundred thouſand Perſons</hi> dyed in the Wilderneſs, for their rebellious Murmuring and Diſcontent. Since Diſcontent and Murmuring under Afflictions, is thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Solemn Covenant-Ingagements; thus provoking to God, and dangerous to our ſelves, ſurely we ſhould Watch, Pray, and Strive againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>God has Promiſed, That all the Afflictions which his Children meet with, ſhall be Profitable unto them.</hi> God, can bring light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and good out of evil. He can call things that are not, as though they were. He can cauſe thoſe things to be for us, which ſeem to be moſt againſt us. The loſs of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was a great trouble to <hi>Jacob;</hi> yet 'twas leading to the preſervation of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> and of his <hi>Poſterity</hi>'s alſo. All things are poſſible with God, nothing is too hard for him. And this God who can do whatſoever he will, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, Rom. 8.28. <hi>All things ſhall work together for good, to thoſe that Love God, and are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpoſe.</hi> Why does God Afflict his Children? Is it becauſe he hates them? Or becauſe he grudges Proſperity to them? No indeed, he Loves 'm as the Apple of his Eye. He does not Afflict willingly, nor grieve the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001286_0047_0FB277B417C94B60"/>
Children of Men, Judg. 10.16. <hi>His Soul was grieved for the Miſery of Iſrael.</hi> In all their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions he was Afflicted. Tis, <hi>if need be,</hi> that he Afflicts the Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. Tis out of Love to their Souls, and for their good. Whom the Lord Loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth. He Afflicts them, <hi>to purge away Iniquity, and take away Sin,</hi> Iſa. 27.5. He chaſtens 'm, <hi>That they may not be condemned with the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.32. He does it <hi>for their profit, to make 'm partakers of his Holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.10. God Loves his Children, even when he ſeverely chaſtens them, every whit as well, as he does at any other time. He never ſends trouble on them, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns it for good, and will do good to them thereby. He ſends Affliction, as <hi>Phyſick,</hi> as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine</hi> for the good of their Souls: Sometimes as <hi>Sanative</hi> or <hi>Reſtorative Phyſick.</hi> He ſometimes chaſtens them, to awaken them out of their dull, drouzy, ſecure frames; to humble them for their paſt Sins; and to get their hearts more intenſely ſee, upon Spiritual things. He does it, <hi>To Humble them, prove them, and do them good at their latter end,</hi> Deut. 8.16. Sometimes he ſends trouble, as <hi>Preventive Phyſick,</hi> to <hi>Prevent their Sinning. Paul</hi>'s <hi>Thorn in the fleſh</hi> was ſent, <hi>leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7. Twas to prevent his being <hi>Proud,</hi> and <hi>High-rounded.</hi> It may be God who ſees the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and naughtineſs of our hearts, takes away
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001286_0048_0FB277B711E08DA8"/>
our <hi>Health, Credit, Eſtate, Deareſt Relatives,</hi> or ſome deſirable Injoyments or other; to <hi>prevent</hi> our being <hi>Proud of 'm,</hi> or <hi>Truſting in 'm,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>too much taken with 'm.</hi> It may be God ſees and knows, that great uninterrupted Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, would be dangerous, yea ruinous to us: therefore in Love to our Souls, he brings trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon us. Surely then it is moſt unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that Chriſtians ſhould Murmur and find fault with God; even then when he does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and is acting for, their greateſt even their eternal welfare. Conſiderate Perſons, dont uſe to Murmur at a faithful, skillful, compaſſionate <hi>Phyſitian</hi> to <hi>Surgeon,</hi> when he does the beſt he can, for their Health and Wellfare. Tis more unreaſonable, that Chriſtians ſhould Murmur againſt Afflictive Providences, ſince God is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promoting their Spiritual Wellfare, and that in thoſe methods, which infinite Wiſdom and Grace know to be the beſt. O Let us not puſh away that hand, which would heal us; nor Spurn at thoſe bowels, which compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately yern for our Wellfare. Perſons will ſometimes ſuffer great <hi>Inciſions</hi> to be made in their Fleſh, yea, ſuffer a <hi>Limb,</hi> a <hi>Leg</hi> or an <hi>Arm</hi> to be cut off, when tis needful to preſerve Life. Surely then, we ſhould not grudge to part with what's as dear as a <hi>Right Hand,</hi> or <hi>Right Eye;</hi> when parting with it, is neceſſary to preſerve our Souls. Compaſſionate <hi>Parents,</hi> often take from their <hi>Children</hi> thoſe things that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001286_0049_0FB277B885F33D38"/>
would hurt them. God never takes any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from his Children, but when he knows they had better be without it, than have it. He deſigns their good and wellfare, in every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his Providence to them; therefore they ſhould never Murmur at Adverſity.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Very eminent Saints, have met with great and ſore tryals in former times.</hi> God's <hi>Church,</hi> has been like a <hi>Buſh on a light fire,</hi> though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. <hi>Iſrael</hi> went through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and a <hi>Terrible Wilderneſs;</hi> in their paſſage to Canaan. The Saints that in all Ages have gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, have firſt met with ſore tryals on Earth. Yea ſome of the moſt Eminent of them, have met with very great and remarkable Afflictions. And pray what art thou better than they? Why ſhouldſt thou Murmur at Afflictions, ſince God is but leading thee to Heaven, in the ſame path wherein his Saints of Old have gone thither? What, muſt God cut out a new way to Heaven, for thee?

Haſt thou loſt thy <hi>Children?</hi> Nay, have they been taken away in a very <hi>Awfull Manner?</hi> This is no more than God's Precious Saints have met with. <hi>Eli</hi>'s <hi>two Sons</hi> were <hi>Slain</hi> by the Enemy, the <hi>Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Philiſtines,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.17.

now heard. <hi>Job</hi> loſt <hi>All his Children,</hi> even <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sons</hi> and <hi>Three Daughters,</hi> all in one day, and that in an awfull manner too. They were <hi>Feaſting in the Eldeſt Son's houſe,</hi> and a Storm threw it down, and killd 'm all, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.2.18, 19. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> Affliction in his <hi>Children,</hi> ſeems yet greater. His Son <hi>Amnon,</hi> had been guilty of an <hi>Inceſtuous Rape;</hi> he had <hi>Forced, Raviſhed his Siſter Tamar; Abſalom</hi> in revenge, <hi>Murders Amnon,</hi> 2 Sam. 13.14.28, 29. Thus <hi>David</hi> has one <hi>Wicked Son, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly Murder'd by another.</hi> Surely this muſt needs be a cutting and bitter Affliction, to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s holy Heart. Yea afterwards, <hi>Abſalom</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dies in his rebellious Wickedneſs, againſt his Royal Father. Alas, time would fail to mention, even the <hi>very great and remarkable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,</hi> which many of God's precious Saints have met with. And what are we, that we ſhould think to eſcape? Surely God deals with us, but <hi>as with his Children of Old,</hi> even <hi>when he layes his Hand heavy upon us,</hi> Heb. 12.7, 8. <hi>If ye endure chaſtening, God dealeth with you as with Sons; for what Son is he, whom the Father chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not? But if ye be without chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not Sons.</hi> Indeed if we Murmur at our Afflictions, we Murmur becauſe God deals with us, as he us'd to do with his Children; and how unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would this be?</p>

How often does he tempt them, to doubt that they are not God's Children, meerly becauſe they meet with Troubles? He's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſuggeſt to them, <hi>Surely if God Lov'd you, he would not Afflict you thus; if he was your Friend and Father, he would not chaſtiſe and diſtreſs you after this Rate.</hi> Thus he often tempts the Saints. But we ſhould not give place, to ſuch vain groundleſs ſuggeſtions as theſe are. The Devil himſelf, that <hi>Father of Lyes,</hi> can't ſuggeſt any thing more contrary to Scripture than this; Namely, <hi>That Gods Afflicting a Perſon, is a ſign that he does not Love him.</hi> For the Scripture ſaith expreſsly in ſo many words, Heb. 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord Loveth, he chaſteneth; and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> And our Lord Jeſus ſays, Rev. 3.19. <hi>As many as I Love, I rebuke and chaſten.</hi> Let us not therefore give way to Satan's Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but with the Sword of the Spirit (even the Word of God) let us fight againſt them. Let us firmly believe, that God may <hi>Dearly Love us,</hi> and yet <hi>Sorely Afflict us</hi> at the ſame time.</p>

God's love or hatred, is not to be learn'd meerly from the external diſpenſations of his Providence. Eccleſ. 9.2. <hi>All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked: to the good, and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that Sacrificeth, and to him that Sacrificeth not: as is the Good, ſo is the Sinner; and he that Sweareth, as he that feareth an Oath. Job</hi> was an Eminently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pious man, God himſelf ſays of him, Job. 1.8. <hi>There is none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth evil.</hi> And yet this remarkably holy man, met with diſtinguiſhing remarkable Afflictions; ſcarce any in the World ever met with ſuch trials as his were, all things conſidered. The greateſt Saints, have ſometimes the greateſt trials; While on the other hand, thoſe that are ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly Wicked, are incompaſs'd with great Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. The <hi>Ungodly</hi> do ſometimes <hi>Proſper in the World,</hi> they <hi>Increaſe in Riches, their Eyes ſtand out with fatneſs, they have more than heart can wiſh,</hi> Pſal. 73.7, 12. Sometimes the <hi>Wicked, Live, become Old,</hi> yea are <hi>Mighty in Power; they ſpend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the

grave,</hi> Job 21.7, 13. If we therefore ſee or hear, that ſome remarkable great Affliction is befaln ſuch or ſuch an one; we muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſay nor think, <hi>ſurely he's a greater Sinner than others.</hi> If we ſhould thus ſpeak, we ſhould <hi>offend againſt the Generation of God's Children.</hi> We ſhould but argue like the Ignorant <hi>Barbarous Heathen of Malta,</hi> when they ſaw the <hi>Viper faſten on Paul's hand,</hi> Act. 28.3, 4. Our Saviour would not have us think, <hi>That the greateſt Sufferers, are allways the greateſt Sinners;</hi> as we may plainly ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. <hi>begin.</hi> Poſſibly others may meet with greater trials than we; and yet we be greater Sinners than they. <hi>Babylon</hi> did flouriſh, while <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> lay in Ruinous heaps. <hi>Proſperity</hi> is often <hi>fatning the Wicked for ruin,</hi> while <hi>Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is <hi>ripening the Saints for Glory. Their light Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are but for a Moment, ſhall work for them a far more exceeding, and an eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>We ſhould be humble, for our unſuitable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage under our Afflictions.</hi> Have not all of us, reaſon to reflect on our ſelves with ſhame; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to our behaviour under trials? Alas, tis difficult to keep our hearts in any tollerable good temper, even in any condition. If we are in <hi>Proſperity,</hi> we are apt to be <hi>Proud, High-Minded,</hi> to <hi>forget God,</hi> to <hi>be ſlothful and ſluggiſh in duty.</hi> If we're in <hi>Adverſity,</hi> we're apt to <hi>Fret, Murmur</hi> and <hi>Repine.</hi> We're commonly too much like a <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock

How often have we faulted the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, of the Sovereign Lord and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all things! As oft as ever we have been diſcontent and fretfull under Trials, we have practically ſaid, <hi>That we know how to Govern the World, better than God does.</hi> We have practically charged the <hi>Great God, with doing amiſs.</hi> For if he had not done amiſs, why then were we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at his proceedings? Men dont uſe to be diſcontent, at what they think is done well. Indeed, Chriſtians are too apt to indulge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in themſelves, but they are highly Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in ſo doing. Our diſcontent does always carry in it, moſt ſhamefull charges againſt the bleſſed and Glorious God. <hi>Sedition</hi> in a State <hi>Mutiny</hi> in an Army, even rebellion againſt the Supream power; is juſtly reckoned a great Crime. But our Diſcontent and Murmuring, is a ſort of <hi>Sedition</hi> or <hi>Mutiny; in caſting off Subjection to Gods Government.</hi> And ſo far as we have been guilty in this matter, it becomes us to be deeply humbled before God. Great ſelf abaſement very well becomes us, for the ſtubborneſs and unrulineſs of our hearts, under the Diſcipline of Heaven.</p>

Let us therefore lye quietly at Gods Foot, under all the blows of his holy Hand. Let us Juſtify him in all he does, ſaying as <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> We ſhall get no good, by contending with the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Ruler of the World. If a mad <hi>Horſe</hi> will <hi>Kick and Fling,</hi> becauſe he's <hi>Fetter'd,</hi> he does but <hi>Gall himſelf the more.</hi> The more we give way to Murmuring under troubles, ſo much the more we diſhonour God, and hurt our ſelves. But the more quiet and ſubmiſſive we are, ſo much the more we pleaſe God and Profit our ſelves. Let us then heartily Submit to Divine Providence, and be willing that God ſhould have his own way. Let us ſincerely reſign our ſelves, and all our affairs to his diſpoſe; being heartily willing, that he ſhould do with us according to his Wiſe Sovereign Pleaſure. Let us heartily ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, 2 Sam. 15.26. <hi>Behold here am I, let him do unto me, as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> And eſpecially under all our Afflictions, let our main care be, <hi>to grow more Holy.</hi> Every Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>God's Rod,</hi> and his Rod has a <hi>Voice;</hi> and the <hi>Voice</hi> is, <hi>That we ſhould grow more Holy.

This in general, is the Meſſage, the Errand, on which every Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction comes from God unto us.
