            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE author takes this method to inform the Subſcribers, and others who heard the following Sermons, that as they were delivered only from ſome looſe and general hints, without the moſt diſtant thought of their being ever made more publick, he was rather diſagreeably affected at receiving a requeſt for printing them. But ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt has been preſented, he has endeavoured to recollect the ideas then ſuggeſted, and flatters himſelf that no material one is omitted. The ſermons will evidently retain their original features, though it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that by ſeveral additions they have grown to a greater ſize. To publiſh ſentiments on ſubjects ſo differently thought of, and diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the following, cannot be eligible. But as every perſon has a right to his own opinion, the author, little anxious what others may think or ſay of him, calmly ſubmits them to public cenſure. If they may, by the bleſſing of <hi>GOD,</hi> be the means of diffuſing a ſpirit of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, among different men who keep their minds open to conviction; and eſpecially if they ſo impreſs the mind of the reader, with a ſenſe of his loſs in <hi>Adam,</hi> as to convince him of the neceſſity of an intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> through whom juſtification and life are only to be obtained; and put him on proper meaſures to poſſeſs himſelf of covenant qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, for future happineſs, he will conſider himſelf amply compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated for all his pains; and though others may ſcoff and condemn, will abundantly rejoice.</p>

            <p>AMONG the preachers of the goſpel a great diverſity of practice prevails, not only as to the <hi>manner,</hi> but as to the <hi>matter</hi> of their <hi>publick</hi> exhibitions. Some almoſt conſtantly dwell on the moral precepts of the goſpel; whilſt others ſtudiouſly avoiding theſe topicks, entertain their hearers chiefly with the doctrinal parts of revelation. Theſe are extremes which all will carefully avoid who take St. Paul for their pattern, and mean to be governed by his advice. <hi>He kept back nothing that was profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his hearers. He teſtified both to the Jews and Greeks repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and ſhunned not to declare the whole counſel of God.</hi> Now as <hi>all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction and inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto every good work,</hi> every faithful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter will, by a ſuitable attention to all parts of revealed truth, endeavour <hi>to feed the church of God, which he hath purchaſed by his own blood.</hi> And though he will by no means neglect to explain
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023103_0005_0FBC3ABA84763640"/>
and enforce the moral precepts of the goſpel, pointing out to chriſtians the way of their duty; yet as the doctrines thereof, when properly interpreted, give us exalted ideas of the wiſdom, juſtice, and goodneſs of God, and furniſh the ſtrongeſt arguments to an holy temper, in which the eſſence of religion conſiſts, he <hi>muſt</hi> believe it to be his duty, at certain times, to diſcourſe on the peculiar doctrines of revelation; that having laid this foundation, he may build thereon that ſuperſtructure of moral and evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal duties, which, when enforced by motives derived from theſe doctrines, will, by the influence of the ſpirit, ſtrongly impel his hearers to thoſe pious and devout exerciſes of the heart, which qualify them for, and by the conſtitution of the covenant of grace, introduce them to the happineſs of the heavenly world. Deeply impreſſed with theſe thoughts, I ſhall this day <hi>earneſtly,</hi> though modeſtly, <hi>contend for the faith once delivered unto the ſaints;</hi> and without pretending to any ſuperior ſagacity or information, ſhall, according to my ideas of duty, proceed to give my ſentiments, concerning the <hi>lapſe</hi> and <hi>recovery</hi> of mankind; doctrines differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explained by different men; from which angry diſputes have ariſen in the chriſtian church, to the detriment of that <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is the bond of perfectneſs, the end of the commandment, and the fulfilling of the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the courſe of my reading, and from a long acquaintance with many of my fellow men, I have had the beſt reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that whilſt ſome have conſidered the fall as having no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious influence on the human race, ſubjecting them <hi>only</hi> to temporal death; others have carried their ſentiments to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary extreme, and view <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, in all ſenſes, the ſin of all his numerous deſcendants. They even go ſo far as to ſuppoſe that great numbers of infants are now ſuffering the extremeſt miſery in hell, merely on account of their being the unhappy children of a ſinful father, or from their participation of his guilt. They further believe that all mankind have <hi>totally</hi> loſt the image of God; the power of election, or liberty of choice; all moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as all principles of holineſs; and conſequently that they are <hi>totally corrupt,</hi> and <hi>wholly inclined</hi> to evil, and that <hi>continually.</hi> Now theſe great extremes appear to me to be wide from the real truth, and faulty in a certain degree. The truth, in this as in moſt other caſes, lies in a happy medium between them, as I ſhall endeavour to ſhew in the ſequel of this diſcourſe. In farther treating on which, I ſhall arrange my thoughts under the two following heads:
<list>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:023103_0006_0FBC3ABEF254FE98"/>
                  <item>I. SHALL ſay ſomething of the <hi>one man's diſobedience by which many were made ſinners.</hi> And</item>
                  <item>II. SHALL enquire how the many, or all, were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by his diſobedience.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER the firſt head we may obſerve, that by the <hi>one man,</hi> we are to underſtand Adam, the firſt of the human race, created in an extraordinary manner out of the duſt of the earth, but yet made in the image of God. Now this image conſiſted, not in the form of his body, but in the powers and qualities of his mind; as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dominion over all terreſtrial creatures. As God is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor, man bears ſome likeneſs to him, as dominion was given to him, <hi>over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the face of the earth.</hi> This part of the divine image, however impaired, is not totally loſt. But the moſt eſſential part of the image of God in which man was made, conſiſted in that perfection of his nature, which was endued with <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> with <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And in this reſpect he was <hi>made but a little lower than the angels, and crowned with glory and honor.</hi> Concerning God, we read, that <hi>his underſtanding is infinite; he talleth the number of the ſtars, and calleth them all by name.</hi> And has not man an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which, though infinitely inferior to his Maker's, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates him, when properly cultivated, to unfold a thouſand difficulties, to rove from ſtar to ſtar, to aſcertain the laws of the heavenly bodies, to calculate eclipſes, and to predict, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, many future and very diſtant events? Though this part of the divine image may be greatly effaced, yet none can with reaſon pretend that it is totally loſt. Again; he ſtill retains ſomething of the image of the Creator, as he is a moral agent, has a ſenſe of right and wrong, and a will to chuſe the good and refuſe the evil, though not, we may well ſuppoſe, in the degree that Adam enjoyed it before he fell; yet ſo as to make him, a ſubject of law, reſponſible for his actions, and capable of rewards and puniſhments. Laſtly, he was made in the image of God, not only as he had a power of acquiring a holy temper, but had a principle of holineſs implanted in his firſt formation. If we do not believe this, it is difficult to conceive how God could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this part of his work <hi>very good;</hi> or how <hi>Solomon</hi> could ſay, <hi>God made man upright, but they have ſought out many inventions.</hi> Or what conſiſtent meaning we can put on the Apoſtle's exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Epheſians, <hi>be renewed in the ſpirit of your minds, and put on the new man, who after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs?</hi> What more rational interpretation can we put on theſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023103_0007_0FBC3AC1800A0A50"/>
words, than that man was firſt created with the principles of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his heart; that he loſt them by his offence in eating the forbidden fruit; and his poſterity alſo; and that <hi>they</hi> muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to this temper, or recovered to this character, or never be fit for the kingdom of heaven? The concluſion therefore is, that this part of the divine image was loſt in the fall: and that though there ſtill remain many amiable qualities in the hearts of men, yet that they are deſtitute of all holineſs till renewed by the ſpirit of God. But what was that ſin of our firſt father by which he in part loſt the image of God, and entailed the ſame diſadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age on his numerous progeny? It was his tranſgreſſion of a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command not to eat of <hi>the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</hi> This prohibition was equivalent to a command to keep his ſenſes and his appetites under the control of reaſon. It was an eaſy taſk which the Lord of all ſaw fit to impoſe on his new formed creature, man. Though as a rational creature he was obliged to obey all the laws of his nature; yet on this ſimple condition his happineſs was ſuſpended; and this was made the term of his enjoying the continued favor of his Creator. And had he been obedient in this ſingle inſtance, he and his poſterity would have been continued in endleſs life. But wonderful to relate, this man, newly created, and formed in the divine image, with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent communications from his Maker, and the fate of his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity depending, tranſgreſſed the law and involved his offspring, together with himſelf, in a ſcene of wretchedneſs unutterable, had it not been for the advent of a Saviour! This ſin was perpetrated through the influence of that malicious fiend, <hi>who walks about ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> The Devil, in the form of a ſerpent, to which he communicated ſpeech, attacked the woman, <hi>the weaker veſſel,</hi> propounded a doubtful queſtion, then denied the truth of God's threatening, gave her a contrary promiſe, and uſed the name of God to confirm it. Thus ſubtilly did he manage in ſeducing our firſt parents from their duty! But though the grand adverſary was concerned in this temptation, yet the man and woman were highly culpable in entering into <hi>parlance</hi> with him, doubting the veracity of their Creator, and eating the withholden fruit: For it muſt here be remembered, that even the temptation of Satan is no excuſe for ſin. He can do no more than tempt, and if <hi>we reſiſt him he will flee from us.</hi> This ſin of the firſt founders of our race, was attended with aggravating circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and was a virtual violation of all the commands of the deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. The firſt was broken by withdrawing faith from God, and placing it in Satan: The ſecond, by giving a ſort of worſhip
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023103_0008_0FBC3AC294957C48"/>
to this malignant ſpirit, in preferring his declarations before thoſe of their liege or rightful Lord: The third by profaning the name of God in treating it with ſo much contempt as to credit the devil rather than Jehovah, when there was a contrariety in their declarations. And the fourth alſo, if what ſome ſurmiſe be true, that this ſin was committed on the Sabbath. The fifth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand requires obedience to ſuperiors. Eve therefore, in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting her huſband, and Adam in hearkening to his wife more than to God, really violated it. And what did they leſs than murder their children; when they could not but know if the threatening was fulfilled, it would prevent their exiſtence, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to deſtruction; directly in oppoſition to the ſixth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which requires us <hi>not to kill.</hi> The ſeventh command pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the indulgence of the ſenſual appetite. But did not Adam more attend to the propenſities of animal nature, than to the command of God in eating this fair and tempting fruit? And was the eighth unbroken by him when he manifeſted ſuch diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his preſent condition; and in order to better it, as he ſuppoſed, ſurreptitiouſly took the inhibited fruit, in the face of that authoritative injunction, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſteal.</hi> The ninth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not to <hi>bear falſe witneſs;</hi> and this virtually implies that we ſhould not receive a falſe accuſation againſt any. But did not Adam, in this inſtance, paſs a falſe judgment on the fruit, and admit the falſe accuſations of Satan againſt his ſovereign Lord? Adam and his happy companion had full liberty to range amidſt a wilderneſs of ſweets, and freely to regale themſelves with all that variety of delicious fruits, with which the garden of Eden abounded, excepting one ſingle tree. Did they not, therefore, diſcover the ſtrong prevalence of the covetous deſire, when they invaded the interdicted fruit, and preſumptuouſly partook of that to which they had no title? By this brief enumeration of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, it appears that their ſin was <hi>aggravated, extenſive</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated;</hi> amounting to a breach of all the ten commands; and if theſe commands, as <hi>moſt</hi> ſuppoſe, comprehended the whole circle of moral duties, <hi>then</hi> in this ſingle act, he violated the law of his nature, and was guilty of a crime of the deepeſt dye.</p>
            <p>I COME in the ſecond place to enquire how <hi>many,</hi> or all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>were made ſinners by his diſobedience.</hi> It ſeems by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of ſcripture, our only guide in this matter, that Adam's ſin was not in its influence confined to himſelf, but in ſome way or another deſcended to his children. He was their natural, if not their federal head, and his fortune therefore they muſt follow. Now though Adam was not naturally immortal, yet if he had been obedient in the ſingle inſtance of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023103_0009_0FBC3AC41E6E63D8"/>
fruit, he was, by partaking of the tree of life, <hi>to have lived for ever</hi> and his poſterity likewiſe. But in caſe of diſobedience, it was threatened that he ſhould die. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> And accordingly the ſentence was, <hi>duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> Now this ſentence was not confined to him alone, but extended to all that proceeded from his loins. Here two queſtions naturally ariſe. Firſt, what are we to underſtand by this death? And ſecondly, how comes it to fall upon Adam's poſterity? To the firſt queſtion, it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; if we conſider the words of the threatening in connexion with the ſentence afterwards paſſed, we ſhould ſuppoſe that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than temporal death, with the evils that precede and uſher it into the world was intended. But yet ſome aſſert, that <hi>temporal, ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> death are all meant by that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening. But this we know cannot be true, according to St. Paul's manner of expreſſing himſelf on the ſubject. Tho' <hi>natural,</hi> and even <hi>ſpiritual</hi> death may be intended thereby, yet <hi>eternal</hi> deſtruction, as it is commonly underſtood, could not be meant, if we take him as our expoſitor. For he tells us in the chapter of my text, ſpeaking of the conſequence of Adam's ſin, <hi>that death hath paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> Now it is not true that eternal death <hi>hath,</hi> or ever <hi>will paſs</hi> upon all men; for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will be received into heaven through the merit of Chriſt. I ſay, therefore, that nothing more than <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual death</hi> can poſſibly be meant by that term. As to temporal or natural death, that this will ſooner or later fall upon all the ſons of Adam by reaſon of his ſin, none deny. But how or by what means does this take place upon the offspring of Adam? How are we all thus made ſinners by him? I anſwer, by <hi>imputation.</hi> In this way natural death comes upon all the ſons of men. There are ſome, I am ſenſible, who chuſe not to hear any thing of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this ſenſe of the word; and even others are to be found, who, though they allow the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, deny in the moſt unaccountable manner, the imputation of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am's ſin. But as the word is capable of a rational interpretation in this ſenſe, and as it has been uſed by former divines, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore retain it, and aſſert that it is by the <hi>imputation</hi> of the legal effect of Adam's ſin, that all his children become mortal, and will ſooner or later die a natural death. If any diſlike the term, they cannot deny the doctrine, if they are believers in divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. St. Paul aſſerts it, and has uſed arguments to prove it, in the chapter of my text. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin.</hi> And in Corinthians he tells us, <hi>As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> And to prove
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023103_0010_0FBC3AC591C145D8"/>
his aſſertion in the twelfth verſe, he thus argues in the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ones; <hi>for until the law, death was in the world, yet death is not imputed where there is no law. Nevertheleſs, death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Adam to Moſes, even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adam's tranſgreſſion.</hi> The meaning of which is this, though there were both ſin and death in that long ſpace which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened between Adam and Moſes, yet as there was no poſitive command threatening death as the penalty of diſobedience, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that term, therefore men did not die for their own ſins, but for the diſobedience of Adam; for where there is no law ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to death for diſobedience, <hi>there</hi> certainly <hi>can be no tranſgreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. As Adam was not only ſubjected to natural death by his ſin, but was alſo condemned by the law of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a tranſgreſſor, having loſt that image of God which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in <hi>righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> and which was the ſupreme excellence of his nature; ſo his poſterity, by imputation, come into the world devoid of holy principles, and, conſequently, as not coming up to the requirements of the law of their nature, are in a ſtate of condemnation by it, even previouſly to their commiſſion of any actual tranſgreſſion. Though this, in the eye of the law, is an important defect, for which they are doomed, by the righteous conſtitution of heaven, to many diſabilities; yet it does not come up to our ideas of the formal nature of ſin; to conſtitute which there muſt be the conſent of the will, in a perſon, who is a free agent, or has arrived to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. It is a defect alſo which muſt be remedied, or they can never obtain juſtification at the bar of God; never become <hi>recti in l<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e.</hi> Whether this is the idea that ſome men mean to expreſs by our being born into the world in a ſtate of nature <hi>leſs perfect than Adam was when he firſt came out of the hands at his Maker,</hi> or what others intend by the <hi>corruption and depravity of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> I neither know nor care. It is an idea I have been led to adopt from reading the ſcriptures; without which I cannot run a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete parallel between Adam and Chriſt, who are heads of their reſpective ſeeds, and covenants, and counterparts to each other; nor give a full and conſiſtent interpretation of ſeveral paſſages in the New Teſtament. This is called by ſome ſpiritual death, and not improperly, if we do not include in the notion of it, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of a guilty conſcience; and the infliction of new ſorrows on the ſoul. The anguiſh of a guilty conſcience, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of poſitive pains on the ſoul, are the effects not of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, but of actual and perſonal ſin. But ſtill Adam's deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are <hi>ſpiritually</hi> dead, as they have no ſeeds of holineſs in their hearts, no exerciſes or ſenſations of the divine life; and <hi>judicially</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:023103_0011_0FBC3AC7E7B665A8"/>
as they are condemned by the mouth of the Lawgiver, or by his law. And being thus condemned by the law as dead to all holy ſenſations, they muſt, had it not been for the new conſtitution of grace, introduced by Chriſt, either been held for ever, under the bondage of the grave, or ſome way made poſitively wretched. But ſince the proviſion of a Saviour, there is now no room for ſuch a ſuppoſition; ſince he certainly juſtifies <hi>all</hi> from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of death; and all who <hi>believe</hi> in him from all other condemnation, whether ariſing from the legal effects of Adam's ſin imputed, or from their own actual tranſgreſſion; and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates them in the ſavor of God. Now, if thoſe who have never been guilty of perſonal diſobedience are to be raiſed from the dead as well as others; the preſumption is, from the known character of God, and his acknowledged benevolence, that they are raiſed, not for the purpoſe of being made poſitively wretched in hell; but happy in the preſence of God in heaven; all legal diſabilities being firſt removed, and an holy principle implanted, without which they ſhall never ſee the Lord. Now this, in a manner explicable to us, is done in the new birth; and therefore this new birth is neceſſary for all the ſons of Adam, of every age, character and condition. This ſeems to be the repreſentation of ſcripture, for it declares, <hi>except a man,</hi> it is tranſlated, but it ought to have been <hi>except any one</hi> (for that is the force of the Greek article <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>is born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> And what better reaſon can poſſibly be aſſigned for the abſolute neceſſity of the new birth, for all men univerſally, of every age, nation and character, whether they have been guilty of actual ſins or not, than the ſentiment I have been advancing under this head, namely, that all men are condemned by the law of God as being deſtitute of any ſeeds or principles of holineſs, until re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the ſpirit of God, and recovered thereto by the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual proceſs of regeneration. Upon the whole; the bible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents mankind by nature as univerſally condemned by the law, particularly in our context; <hi>the judgment was by one to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by the offence of one the judgment came upon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> Now that this condemnation was to ſomething more than natural death, may be fairly argued from this conſideration; that the juſtification by the obedience of Chriſt, intends more than a reſurrection from the grave. And as the condemnation on the one part, muſt be as extenſive as the juſtification on the other (ſaying only that Chriſt's obedience in <hi>merit</hi> ſo far exceeds Adam's diſobedience in <hi>demerit,</hi> as to deliver from perſonal as well as imputed ſins) hence the argument is <hi>highly probable,</hi> if not <hi>abſolutely concluſive,</hi> that merely by Adam's ſin his poſterity is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023103_0012_0FBC3ACC1D2DB618"/>
to other diſabilities than natural death; becauſe, by Chriſt's obedience they are exempted from other penal effects, beſides death. I therefore, on the truth of the foregoing obſervations, proceed to obſerve further, that if thoſe who have never been guilty of actual ſins (to which the conſent of the will is neceſſary) are condemned by the law to ſomething more than natural death, or in a ſenſe different from it, then ſurely thoſe who have made Adam's ſin, in the fulleſt ſenſe, their own, by the commiſſion of many actual offences, are condemned in a fuller or higher ſenſe: from the penal effects of which, however, the obedience of Chriſt is ſufficient to exempt them. Before I proceed to the next head of diſcourſe, it is neceſſary, to prevent any miſtakes, that I ſhould ſubjoin the following obſervation; that though Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am's ſin was in its legal effects imputed to his poſterity in the ſenſe above mentioned; yet we are not from thence to conclude, that it is, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word, the ſin of his deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. This is impoſſible. Sin is a quality intransferable. We may be ſufferers even to death by it; yet not conſcious of his guilt; nor is it poſſible to repent of it as we may and ought, of thoſe which we have perſonally committed, by the free conſent of our own wills. Adam, when he offended, was <hi>afraid, aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>conſcious of evil deſert;</hi> hence it is ſaid he perceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf naked; and endeavoured to hide himſelf from the preſence of the Lord. But though we ought to be aſhamed and repent of our own ſins, yet for Adam's offence we cannot feel any ſuch ſenſations. All therefore that is intended by the imputation of his ſin to his poſterity is, that the effects of it are ſet to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that we are treated as ſinners, and are ſubjected to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inconveniences on the account thereof. I will now illuſtrate my idea by the following example. In ſome European kingdoms, where the title of nobility obtains, if a nobleman is guilty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, together with his life, he forfeits his eſtate and honors; and this forfeiture deſcends to his children; they loſe their eſtate and honors by reaſon of his ſin. And yet, who in his ſenſes can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the ſin of treaſon perpetrated by the father is in any ſenſe, except its legal effects, the ſin of his children? In a ſenſe ſomewhat analogous, it may be obſerved; that often times pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, rendered infirm by a courſe of intemperance and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, propagate children under theſe unhappy circumſtances, who all their lives undergo great langours, and often times die pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely on that very account; and yet moſt certainly we cannot think that the debauchery of the parents was, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, the ſin of the children. Again; if we chuſe a repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative to legiſlate for us, and he from ſiniſter, or other evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023103_0013_0FBC3ACDDA883C80"/>
is induced to concur with others in the enaction of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and oppreſſive laws (as the caſe is ſuppoſable, and I believe has ſometimes been the truth of fact) the ſin conſidered as ſuch is peculiar to himſelf, but the evil effects fall upon his conſtituents, however innocent, till the laws are repealed, or ceaſe to operate. Thus Adam who was our natural, if not our federal head, has by his diſobedience entailed many miſeries upon us; and thus we are by imputation ſinners, or rather ſufferers through him. But then I go on and ſay farther, that <hi>through one man's diſobedience, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all</hi> were made ſinners <hi>actually</hi> or <hi>inherently.</hi> In order to conceive how this takes place we muſt conſider, that men are now born into the world, without a principle of holineſs in their hearts; with a leſs perfect nature than Adam, or in a ſtate of corruption and depravity; and being moreover ſubjected to death with the various evils and calamities connected with, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on it, do, under theſe ſeveral diſadvantages, unavoidably commit iniquity, when they arrive at the exerciſe of their rational or mental powers. To this ſad event, viz. <hi>actual ſin,</hi> each of the cauſes abovementioned contributes its reſpective proportion; but natural death has perhaps the main influence in the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. To perceive this, we need only advert to the Apoſtle's records in the 12th verſe of the chapter from whence our text was taken quoted before, and make a ſmall alteration in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; as there is great reaſon to believe the preſent one is faulty. The verſe is this; <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> death hath paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> From this verſe we collect with the utmoſt certainty, that Adam's ſin introduced ſin and death, into our world, together with all the temporal evils attendant on humanity, pain, ſickneſs, ſorrow and vanity. If it had been rightly tranſlated it would have told us very plainly in <hi>what way,</hi> or by what influence it occaſioned the reign of actual ſin among the children of men. To poſſeſs ourſelves of this idea we need only correct a ſmall error in the tranſlation of the latter clauſe of the verſe, and inſtead of the words <hi>for that,</hi> ſubſtitute the words <hi>upon which,</hi> or <hi>in conſequence of which, all have ſinned.</hi> The words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tranſlated for that, are not only capable of this interpretation, but this is their inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable meaning throughout the New Teſtament, as I could eaſily make evident; and alſo in other Greek authors, as has been make evident in a degree, by a learned writer, who lived in this century, and died with the deſerved character of a juſt and great critick. The proper meaning of the paſſage according to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation (which I ſuppoſe is perfectly juſt) is this, that death was the imputed effect of the firſt man's ſin; and that this death,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023103_0014_0FBC3ACF5B700470"/>
with all its preceding and attendant inconveniences, has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the univerſal reign of actual ſin, among all thoſe who come to a capacity of actual tranſgreſſion. Death has introduced great diſorders among the human ſpecies. It has deſtroyed that nice balance between their reaſon, appetites and paſſions, which God firſt eſtabliſhed. It has by reaſon of the curſe on the ground, which makes a livelihood difficult and hard to be obtained, even by enervating toll, called in ſcripture the <hi>ſweat of the brow,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned thoſe numerous frauds, chickanery and circumvention, which not only diſgrace human nature, but make the world a ſcene of woe. Had it not been for death, and the loſs of that image of God which conſiſted in <hi>true holineſs,</hi> the mind would have been clear, the affections calm; the appetites ſubordinate to reaſon, the man happy; all his various powers and affections being harmoniouſly ſubſervient to the end of his creation, and powerfully, though ſweetly impelling him, to a uniform obedience to law divine. But now being ſubjected by the righteous conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of heaven, to death and its attendant troubles, temptations are multiplied upon us from every ſide, that we cannot ſo fully reſiſt them, as to preſerve the rectitude of our conduct; but do <hi>all,</hi> in a greater or leſſer degree, actually offend. Poverty and riches, dominion and ſervitude, honour and infamy, the effects of the apoſtacy, have their peculiar temptations to ſin, which few or none reſiſt. Our fears of death ſubjecting us to bondage, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion diſcontent, anxious ſolicitude, and perplexing concern, which conſtitute the formal nature of ſin. And from the leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate of our nature, the conſequence of the fall, and the ſickneſs and death dependent on it, ariſe thoſe numerous <hi>luſts which war againſt the ſoul, and bring us into captivity to the law of ſin.</hi> From a clear perception of this the Apoſtle cried out. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> Some have ſuppoſed that this alludes to a practice prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome nations of tying a criminal to a dead <hi>ſtinking <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> by way of puniſhment. But if this were the alluſion, the true meaning of the phraſe is this, ſince my body ſubjected to death, entices me to ſo many ſins, who will deliver me from it, or from this <hi>mortal body?</hi> which is a proper tranſlation of the phraſe. And then adds, for his own comfort, as well as the conſolation of others, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> that this deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance is to be obtained, through the inſtitutions, grace, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of the Saviour. But then, though theſe appetites, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and deſires have become ſtronger, and reaſon weaker by means of the lapſe, yet they do not conſtitute the formal nature of ſin, till they gain the conſent of the will. Though we may <hi>be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023103_0015_0FBC3AD0D569C408"/>
tempted by our own heart's luſts, and enticed,</hi> yet it is only <hi>when luſt is conceived, that it bringeth forth ſin,</hi> and <hi>ſin when it is perfected,</hi> by giving the conſent of the heart, <hi>bringeth forth death.</hi> Thus I have ſhewn you how, by the diſobedience <hi>of one many are made ſinners.</hi> If my explanations of the manner, in which mankind become ſinners, in conſequence of Adam's ſin, be different from what has heretofore been common; yet the concluſion of the whole matter is, on the ſcheme above ſuggeſted, ſimilar to that of ancient divines, who made Adam's ſin, either mediately or immediately, the cauſe or occaſion of all the ſins of men. This ſhews that diſputes on this ſubject are for the moſt part not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; being either verbal; or rather about the modes of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; than againſt the truth, or exiſtence of the doctrine itſelf. I ſhall therefore cloſe what I have ſaid, under the doctrinal part of this ſubject, by this charitable obſervation, viz. that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes the fall of Adam to be the foundation of Chriſt's advent in our world, and that ſcheme of grace which is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the goſpel, believes all that is neceſſary, to regulate his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and form his temper, by leading him to a cheerful accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the redemption through the Saviour.</p>

               <p>FIRST, from what has been ſaid, we learn, that the ſin of the firſt man has introduced a tragical ſcene upon the ſtage of the preſent world. Death, pain, toil, vanity, and a thouſand dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſorders have entered by this door, and have made our earth, an hoſpital of diſeaſes, <hi>a place of ſkulls, a field of blood.</hi> From this ſource carnage and deſtruction are ſpread around us; doleful ſpectacles are preſented to our view, and the moſt heart breaking ſeparations frequently take place, among the deareſt friends, the moſt intimate connexions. Hence the roſy cheek, the ruby lips, and ivory teeth loſe their attractive charms; and thoſe who once poſſeſſed them are turned to uglineſs and deformity. Hence <hi>we hear the voice of lementation and mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and refuſing to be comforted, becauſe they are not.</hi> When we contemplate the miſeries of mankind, originating from this fountain, we are often compelled to ſhed the tear of compaſſion; though for the ſin that occaſioned them, we cannot properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; for repentance implies <hi>conſciouſneſs of guilt, ſelf condemnation,</hi> and <hi>change of conduct,</hi> which, though neceſſary for our own, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be for another's ſins.</p>

A ſerious review of the foregoing ſubject, ſhould make us all humble in our own ſight. <hi>Pride was never made for fallen man.</hi> Yet though our blood is under one common attainder, we find theſe ebullitions of pride which are truly ſurpriſing. One takes to himſelf important airs, on account of the noble or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient blood which runs in his veins. Another is proud of his beauty; third of the magnitude of his poſſeſſions, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his acres and the fullneſs of his coffers; a fourth of his rich attire; and a fifth, of his dignity and poſts of honor; and on theſe accounts are induced to deſpiſe their fellow men, not thus diſtinguiſhed. To ſuppreſs theſe riſings of vanity, let us all <hi>look to the rock whence we were hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence we were digged,</hi> to Adam and Eve our firſt progenitors; to the crime by which their dignity was leſſened, and the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to us, by which our glory is obſcured. The little paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try diſtinctions which take place among the children of men, are not worth regarding; <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> which will be ſoon levelled in the grave to which we are deſtined, where the rich and the poor, the honorable and the baſe, the beautiful and deformed, the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ignorant, will lie neglected in one undiſtinguiſhed and promiſcuous maſs. After the revolution of a few years, we muſt all go to that world <hi>from whoſe bourne no traveller returns;</hi> where theſe diſtinctions will be of no avail; and where real <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> ſhall alone be exalted. <hi>Let not therefore the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom; neither let the mighty man glory in his might; nor let the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe loving kindneſs, and judgment, and righteouſneſs in the earth.</hi>

UPON the explication given in the preceding diſcourſe, we learn, how to interpret and apply the following texts, and other ſimilar ones, to be found in the ſacred volume, which have been often quoted in this connexion, as an illuſtration of man's depravity, or fall. A few only ſhall I mention, and they are the following. <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me. That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh.

Though I ſhall not ſtop to give a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of each of theſe paſſages, I ſhall obſerve in general, that they do not prove that Adam's ſin is, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, the ſin of his deſcendants; but only that as men are born without any principles of holineſs, and are ſubjected to death, as a penal effect of the fall, they very early go aſtray after they have come to the uſe of their reaſon and moral powers; that all need to be
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023103_0017_0FBC3AD3D660B2E0"/>
regenerated, and whilſt under the diſadvantages to which death and the evils preceding it, ſubject us, we fall ſhort of the require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the law, and become actual ſinners, even in the firſt dawn of reaſon. The expreſſions are, ſome of them, highly figurative, and when reduced to a proper and literal meaning, intend no more, than that we are all born under ſuch diſabilities, as to be condemned by the law, and that being influenced, in our depraved nature, by a thouſand powerful temptations, we very ſoon become actual tranſgreſſors of it, clearly evincing that the original ſin of our firſt father, is the prolifie ſource of all, even the moſt early and aggravated perſonal offences. Here ſuffer me to ſay, that however ſome perſons deny the pernicious effects of Adam's ſin to his poſterity; yet every unprejudiced man, who reads the ſcripture with attention, muſt perceive that the fall of man, is the foundation of the whole ſcheme of goſpel grace. Hence the contraſt between Adam and Chriſt. And, in my opinion, a man might as well deny revelation in general, as to deny that the one man's diſobedience is the cauſe, in ſome way, or another, of all the ſins of mankind.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. IF men are, in conſequence of Adam's ſin, all born deſtitute of holineſs, hence we ſee the neceſſity of regeneration, or the new birth to all the children of men, infants not excepted. On no other foundation can this doctrine, which all believe, ſtand with ſo much propriety, as on this. <hi>As without holineſs no man or perſon can ſee the Lord;</hi> and as upon my principles chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are born without it; hence <hi>they,</hi> as well as the <hi>adult,</hi> muſt be regenerated, or muſt be excluded the kingdom of heaven. Some perſons, from this principle, who are great ſticklers for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute unconditional decrees, have concluded, that ſome infants, dying at that period, are ſent down to the miſeries of hell. But as I cannot believe the dreadful ſentiment, I give the following reaſons for my non-belief. 1ſt. If the ſentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Adam had been ſtrictly fulfilled, he never could have had any poſterity at all. But from anticipating a Saviour to come, his life was protracted, and opportunity granted for having children, who, without any fault of their own, are ſubjected to vanity and death. Now can we ſuppoſe that <hi>God who ſent his Son into the world, not to condemn it, but that it might through him be ſaved,</hi> would have raiſed any, who had never been guilty of any perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tranſgreſſions, from the grave, with a view to make them poſitively wretched? Where, on this ſuppoſition, is the grace of the Father, and the boundleſs compaſſion of his Son? No, he never would have diſturbed their aſhes, but left them peacefully <hi>is have ſlept out the Sabbath of the tomb,</hi> if he had not raiſed them
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023103_0018_0FBC3AD5A3BC4CD8"/>
for a better ſtate. Beſides, if this were not the caſe, how could it be ſaid of Adam's poſterity that the <hi>creature,</hi> meaning man, <hi>was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him, who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope.</hi> Theſe conſiderations make it extremely probable, that as a Saviour is provided, whoſe buſineſs, in part, was to reſtore the loſs we ſuſtained by the lapſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from the penal effects and diſabilities of the firſt man's ſin, that no one was ever denied, who had not made it to all moral purpoſes his own, by the free choice of his will, in actual diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. And that which is made probable from the character of God and his gracious deſign in ſending a Saviour into the world, is rendered almoſt a certainty from the words of Chriſt, who knew his Father's will, and ſtill ſpake very favorably of thoſe who fell in Adam, but <hi>had,</hi> and could <hi>have,</hi> no ſins of their own; <hi>ſuffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven:</hi> And again, ſpeaking to the adult, he ſays, <hi>except to be converted and become as little children, ye ſhall not elder into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> The pious and very ingenious Doctor Watts, entertained a peculiar ſentiment, on this head, which was, that the children of believing parents, who never live to years of diſcretion, ſhall be ſaved; but that the children of unbelievers will never be raiſed from the dead; ſhall always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under the dominion of the grave, in a ſtate of inſenſibility. He could not admit the ſhocking idea of thouſands of little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures weltering under the poſitive inflictions of the divine wrath! and to avoid it, had recourſe to the ſcheme of thought above ſuggeſted. But as this militates with the notion that all ſhall be raiſed to life, a doctrine clearly held forth in ſundry places of ſcripture, the more rational opinion is, that all who die in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, will, through the grace of the goſpel, and the merit of the Redeemer, be ſaved: but then it muſt be by paſſing through the new birth, like thoſe who are adult. The main difference is, that thoſe who have come to the exerciſe of their mental powers, and have been guilty of many perſonal ſins, muſt <hi>ſeek</hi> for this change, <hi>deſire</hi> to be <hi>born again,</hi> and made <hi>new creatures in Chriſt;</hi> otherwiſe their condition will be deplorable indeed: whereas, with regard to children the caſe is different; for as the diſability came without their fault, the recovery from it comes without their ſeeking. Let me therefore, by way of concluſion, exhort all who are ſtill in their ſins, and are conſequently unſanctified, and unpardoned, to ſeek thoſe gifts and gracious qualifications from Chriſt, the deliverer of our race, the friend of man; and to do it in the diligent uſe of thoſe means, which he has inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, by <hi>prayers, reading the word, meditation, and hearing.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023103_0019_0FBC3AD6D080BF28"/>
                  <hi>that faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Watch therefore at wiſdom's gates, and wait at the poſts of her doors; cry after knowledge, and lift up thy voice for underſtanding; ſeek for her as ſilver, and ſearch for her as for hid treaſures; then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God;</hi> for as he has <hi>never ſaid to any of the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek ye my face in vain;</hi> ſo we have abundant reaſon to believe, <hi>that none who thus come to God through Chriſt, ſhall in any wiſe be caſt out.</hi>—AMEN.</p>

            <p>THE apoſtacy and redemption of the human race are two moſt memorable events in the hiſtory of the world; events deſerving our particular <hi>notice,</hi> our <hi>admiration,</hi> and I had almoſt ſaid our <hi>gratitude;</hi> for ſuch is the preſent ſtate of mankind with reſpect to future happineſs, under the kingdom of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, that it cannot be ſaid that we are eventually loſers by the fall. Nay, it may well be queſtioned, whether the ſons of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in general, have not <hi>now</hi> a greater probability of ſecuring the laſting felicity of their ſouls, ſince Chriſt has died for them, than if they never had fallen. This ſeems to be an idea held forth by ſome paſſages of ſcripture; and on any other ſuppoſition, it is difficult to perceive how the <hi>ſeed of the woman</hi> has <hi>bruiſed the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head;</hi> or how in the conteſt between theſe two ſeeds, the advantage on the whole is gained by Chriſt. But be this as it will, the <hi>lapſe</hi> and <hi>recovery</hi> of mankind, may be contemplated with admiration. They diſplay the perfections of Deity in the moſt illuſtrious manner; they ſhew the wiſdom, juſtice, power and compaſſion of God, in the cleareſt and moſt conſpicuous
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023103_0020_0FBC3ADAD5C322F0"/>
light; as well as point out his ſovereignty. That he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſin to come into the world, through the temptation of the devil; that he ſhould bring good out of evil, provide a Saviour for fallen men, when he paſſed by the fallen angels; and that he ſhould grant peace and pardon to the rebellious, through the death and ſufferings of his own Son, are matters which we can aſcribe only to the inſcrutable wiſdom, boundleſs compaſſion, and adorable ſovereignty of God. Theſe are matters of delightful contemplation to pious minds; and though neither <hi>men</hi> nor <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> can comprehend theſe unfathomable counſels of heaven; yet they are the theme of their devout adoration and praiſe. <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth and good will towards men.</hi> The fall of which the heathens were ſenſible, (though they knew not to what cauſe to aſcribe it) came by Adam; but the recovery from it comes by one greater man, the Lord from heaven. This is the <hi>one</hi> intended in our text, <hi>through whoſe obedience many are made righteous.</hi> He is a counterpart to the <hi>firſt,</hi> and therefore called the <hi>ſecond Adam. He was made a quickening ſpirit, as the firſt man Adam was made a living ſoul.</hi> The ſcripture, in plain and unequivocal language, repreſents him as <hi>the Son of God, the firſt born of every creature, the brightneſs of his Father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon.</hi> Nay, it ſpeaks of him as an incarnate God, <hi>the word made fleſh.</hi> Hence ſays St. John in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his goſpel; <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, (the glory of the only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) full of grace and truth.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe is the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage in the 1ſt Timothy, iiid chapter, 16th verſe; <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. for he took the nature of man into a cloſe, though inexplicable union with his divine perſon. <hi>He took not on him the nature of angels,</hi> becauſe for them he did not appear as a Saviour; <hi>but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham, that he might redeem them from the grave.</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſays the Apoſtle to the Hebrews, <hi>for as much as the children were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame; that through death he might deſtroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi> The nature of man was contained in him, as well as in the firſt Adam; only with this very great advantage, that whereas the firſt was but a <hi>mere man,</hi> made <hi>in the likeneſs of God;</hi> the ſecond was a divine perſon made in the ſimilitude of man. Hence in the 2d chapter of Philippians, the Apoſtle thus ſpeaks concerning him: <hi>who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no rebutation; and took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023103_0021_0FBC3ADD9EE6C440"/>
and was made in the</hi> LIKENESS <hi>of men,</hi> &amp;c. Thus much concerning THE ONE <hi>through whoſe obedience many are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> We ſhall ſay ſomething concerning this obedience, and ſhew in what it conſiſted. In order to treat of it in a methodical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I ſhall divide it, according to the practice of ancient divines, into <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive.</hi> With reſpect to his <hi>active</hi> obedience, the following things may be obſerved. He was perfectly righteous or obedient prior to his aſſumption of the human nature, and remained ſo ever after; and leſt he ſhould be contaminated by his union with our nature, he <hi>was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and in a miraculous manner born of a <hi>pure virgin. Behold a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſhall conceive and bare a ſon, and ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> Iſaiah vii, 14. After that union which capacitated him to act as Mediator, his obedience was perfect in all inſtances. For though he was ſubject to the ſinleſs infirmities of mankind, and needed to eat, drink and ſup like thoſe for whom he mediated, yet he was never found chargeable with any ſin. His obedience was <hi>univerſal, ſincere, perſevering and perfect.</hi> Accordingly Iſaiah, in the 53d chapter, ſpeaking of what was then future, as though it had really taken place, ſays concerning him, <hi>He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</hi> And St. John, after his advent, declares; <hi>Ye know that he was manifeſt to take away our ſins, and in him is no ſin.</hi> Chriſt was not only <hi>negatively,</hi> but <hi>poſitively</hi> righteous. He not only did not tranſgreſs, but poſitively fulfilled all the requiſitions of the law, both ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and moral. <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now,</hi> ſaid he to John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, who endeavoured to diſſuade him from coming to his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>for thus it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> us to fulfil all righteouſneſs.</hi> If he had been a ſinner in any ſenſe of the word, he could not have made reconciliation for the ſins of the world; becauſe the oblation of a ſinful perſon would not have been an acceptable ſacrifice to God. Agreeably we have the following ſcriptural declaration: <hi>Such an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undeſired and ſeparate from ſinners; who <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not delay to offer up ſacrifice, firſt for his own ſins, and then for the people's; for this he did once, when he offered up himſelf: For the law maketh men high prieſts who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which is ſince the law, maketh the Son who is conſecrated for ever more.</hi> Thus much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>active</hi> obedience. His <hi>paſſive</hi> conſiſted in thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing ſufferings he underwent, whilſt he tabernacled in the fleſh; the indignities, the inſults and abuſes, which were thrown upon him, <hi>when he went about doing good both to the ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men;</hi> and eſpecially in that cruel and ignominious death, which he ſuffered on the croſs. To ſee therefore in one lively
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023103_0022_0FBC3ADF12AA9080"/>
view, what the Saviour ſuffered for our redemption; follow him in your minds to Mount Calvary; behold him ſuſpended on the accurſed tree, ſuffering excrutiating pains in his body, having his tendons ſtretched, and his fleſh lacerated by thoſe nails with which he was faſtened to the croſs; and alſo enduring that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme anguiſh of mind, under the hidings of his Father's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which cauſed him to cry out in the bitterneſs of his ſoul, <hi>My God! my God! why had thou forſaken me?</hi> Now by this <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience of Chriſt, <hi>many are made righteous,</hi> in the following manner, viz. by <hi>imputation</hi> and <hi>inheſion.</hi> And 1ſt by imputation. As Adam's ſin; ſo Chriſt's righteouſneſs is imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as by the firſt we are ſubjected to mortality, and muſt ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later die; ſo by the ſecond we ſhall be raiſed from the dead. Had not Chriſt ſtepped in to our aſſiſtance, and voluntarily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death for fallen man, it would have had perpetual dominion over their bodies. But <hi>now as in Adam all die; ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. There ſhall be a reſurrection both of the juſt and the unjuſt. The time is coming, when all that are in their graves ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and come forth; they that have done good to the reſurrection of life; and they that have done evil to the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> John v, 29. The grave cannot now boaſt a complete and laſting victory over the bodies of men; for Chriſt having ariſen the firſt fruits of them that ſleep, has become a mighty conqueror, and virtually ſays to death and the grave, <hi>Oh death, I will be thy plague! Oh grave, I will be thy deſtruction!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. HIS obedience is imputed for our juſtification, at the bar of God, from the condemning ſentence of the law. The Apoſtle Paul repreſents mankind, univerſally, both Jews and Gentiles, in a ſtate of condemnation, as having come ſhort of the moral law, or the law of their nature. By this, we are <hi>all</hi> condemned, whether young or old, till we are juſtified by the righteouſneſs or obedience of Chriſt. This juſtification, to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of moral agency, comes, as does the reſurrection, without their ſeeking. But to the adult it is the conſequence of faith, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and renewed temper. But immediately on their faith in Chriſt, they are <hi>juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law,</hi> either of nature or <hi>of Moſes.</hi> Now to ſee the neceſſity of this, we muſt obſerve, that it is inconſiſtent with the character of an holy and righteous God, to pronounce any one righteous unleſs he comes up to the demands of the law in all reſpects. But ſince the fall, no man is without ſin; there is not a juſt man on earth, who doeth good and ſinneth not. Hence it is impoſſible that any of the ſons of Adam ſhould be
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023103_0023_0FBC3AE09E034210"/>
juſtified at the bar of God, unleſs they have a righteouſneſs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to their own. Now this righteouſneſs they enjoy by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Even as David deſcribed the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works.</hi> Romans iv, 6. <hi>Chriſt has fulfilled the law, has magnified and made it honorable;</hi> has obeyed its precept and ſuffered its penalty; and by this means has atchieved a righteouſneſs highly delectable to his Father. Hence we read, <hi>that the Lord is well pleaſed for his righteouſneſs' ſake.</hi> Now this righteouſneſs is the matter of the believer's juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification before God; and it avails to his benefit by imputation; or in other words, it is ſet down to his account; as St. Paul tells Philemon, <hi>if Oneſimus had wronged or owed him any thing, to put that on his account.</hi> In ſhort, as a pious writer on another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor DODDRIDGE.</note>"all manner of imputation is a metaphor taken from books of account between debtor and creditor. To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute any act of ſin or obedience is to ſet it down to his account. The great God is repreſented in condeſcenſion to our manner of acting and conceiving things, as keeping an exact book of records, by which our final account ſhall be determined. And as the moſt perfect obedience is a debt which we owe to him as our Creator, Preſerver and Benefactor; ſo on the breach of his law we owe him ſome proper ſatisfaction. In this view, we are all, as the ſons of an apoſtate father, charged as inſolvent debtors in the book of God. Innumerable ſins are ſet down, or imputed to our account. And were things to go on in this courſe, we ſhould, ere long, be arreſted by the divine juſtice; and being incapable of payment, ſhould be caſt into the priſon of hell to come out no more. But God, in compaſſion to our calamitous ſtate, has found out a ſurety and a ranſom for us; has provided a ſatisfaction in the obedience and ſufferings of his Son. It is on the account of this, and from the complacency which God has in it, that all who are finally juſtified meet the divine acceptance, and are delivered from that condemnation which has paſſed upon us all, as appears from the verſe immediately preceding my text. In this caſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the metaphor mentioned above, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is in the book of God imputed or ſet down to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as that by which the debt is balanced, and they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to ſuch exemptions and favors as righteous perſons might expect from God. But then it is a fixed rule in the divine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, that this obedience of Chriſt ſhall be imputed to none but ſuch as believe in him, or have the ſeeds of holineſs in their hearts. But immediately upon this, they are treated as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſons, diſcharged from their obligations to puniſhment,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023103_0024_0FBC3AE212F9AA80"/>
and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the divine favor." Now agreeably to this, our righteouſneſs in ſcripture is plainly aſſerted to be in Chriſt; God <hi>hath made him to be ſin for us who know no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God through him.</hi> 2 Corinthians, vth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 21ſt verſe. In the ſame figurative manner are the following texts of ſcripture to be underſtood, viz. that we are juſtified by the obedience of Chriſt. <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, but the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</hi> Iſaiah <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>., <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, for which I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> Accordingly Chriſt is expreſsly called <hi>our righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> as in the Prophet Jeremiah. In a ſenſe analogous to this, he is called, <hi>our ſurely,</hi> or <hi>our ſponſor;</hi> and, for every believer, hath cancelled his obligation to puniſhment. His whole obedience on earth was for the ſake of ſinners. <hi>In the fulneſs of time God ſent forth his Son, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son, in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh; and for ſin, or being made a ſacrifice for ſin, hath condemned ſin in the fleſh; that the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> Theſe texts are only a ſmall part of what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſame purpoſe. So that it appears, no doctrine is more amply ſupported, than that of our juſtification through the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt. I have obſerved already, that theſe expreſſions are figurative; and the true literal meaning of them, I ſuppoſe, is the following, viz. That as man had fallen and broken the divine law, it was neceſſary that ſomething ſhould be done to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the injury, and ſave, harmleſs, the perfections of God in the juſtification and ſalvation of guilty men. If an eaſy pardon had been granted them, without any ſatisfaction made, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Deity, as a righteous and holy Governor, would have been leſſened in the view of his moral creatures. They would have ſuppoſed that ſin was a light and trivial matter, and would have been encouraged to trample on his laws and deſpiſe his authority for the future. But, to preſerve, in the view of ſurrounding intelligences, the dignity of his government, and the rectitude of his character, he ſaw fit to pardon their offences only on condition of his own Son, being a voluntary ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and ſuffering in their ſtead; hereby plainly demonſtrating, that his laws were not to be tranſgreſſed with impunity; that <hi>ſin is the abominable thing which his ſoul hateth;</hi> and that he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023103_0025_0FBC3AE4B12EDDB8"/>
a moral government over rational and free agents. Though no example exactly ſimilar to this can be produced among men, yet the matter may be in a degree illuſtrated, by the following ſtory of a King, who, in order to diſcourage the heinous practice of adultery among his ſubjects, ordained, that whoever was guilty of this crime in future, ſhould be puniſhed with the loſs of both his eyes. His only ſon was the firſt tranſgreſſor. He had great affection for him, and could not contemplate the idea of making him completely wretched, without the moſt painful ſenſations; and yet the dignity of his law and government <hi>muſt</hi> be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. In this exigency, in order at once to manifeſt his juſtice as a legiſlator, and his compaſſion as a father, he put out one of his own, and one of the eyes of his ſon. Thus, in a way ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what analagous, God hath ſet forth his Son, <hi>to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt; that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus.</hi> So that now in granting pardon to the penitent, on the ſufferings and merit of his Son, who willingly ſubmitted to die in their room, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>BEFORE I proceed to the next particular, I ſhall only make this obſervation, viz. that though it is abundantly evident from what has been already ſaid, that Chriſt's obedience is imputed in its legal reſult, or meritorious effects, to the believer, for his juſtification from the condemning ſentence of the law; yet it is not his <hi>inherent,</hi> or <hi>perſonal obedience.</hi> As ſin in this ſenſe cannot be transferred from one perſon to another; ſo neither can righteouſneſs. Sin and righteouſneſs, in this ſenſe, are the effects of moral agency; of perſonal obedience, and diſobedience; the abuſe or right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our own mental and moral faculties. Hence ſaith St. John, <hi>little children, be not deceived, he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous.</hi> There ſeems to be the greater neceſſity of mentioning this; ſince it is known in fact, that ſome perſons truſt to the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone, not only for juſtification at the bar of God in the preſent world, but for ſalvation at the tribunal of Chriſt in the future; and are ready to ſay that Chriſt has done all, and men have nothing to do in order to be ſaved. This is a dangerous miſtake, founded on the falſe apprehenſion that the perſonal obedience of the Saviour is, in the ſame ſenſe, the perſonal obedience of the ſinner, or rather of the believer. That this cannot be true, is evident from this ſingle conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that then every perſon, participating of Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through faith, muſt be equally holy, and equally entitled to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023103_0026_0FBC3AE5D21132C8"/>
reward. But the whole ſcope of the Bible teaches the contrary. It tells us that ſome are more righteous than others; and that different degrees of happineſs will be aſſigned to men in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate; that whilſt ſome ſhall ſhine only <hi>as the brightneſs of the firmament,</hi> others <hi>ſhall ſhine as the ſtars</hi> which are much more reſplendent, <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> All therefore that can poſſibly be meant by the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs to the believer is, that they are delivered from the condemnation of God's law, by means of it, and placed under a covenant of grace, by the terms of which, if they are ſincere, though not perfect in their obedience, they ſhall be accepted, and raiſed hereafter to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of happineſs exactly proportioned to their improvements in holy and virtuous obedience.</p>
            <p>THIS leads me to ſay thirdly, that by <hi>the obedience of one many are made inherently righteous.</hi> This inherent holineſs is abſolutely neceſſary to qualify any perſon for the kingdom of heaven; <hi>for without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Now this is the effect of Chriſt's obedience unto death, and not the mere conſequence of fallen man's own endeavours without divine aſſiſtance, and the operations of the ſpirit of God upon his heart. Man is now ſo loſt to every principle of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo ſunk in ſenſe, and under the dominion of corrupt fleſhly appetites, that unleſs his powers are ſtrengthened by divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, he would for ever go on in a way of diſobedience and rebellion. Chriſt therefore, that he might perfect his work of redemption, and become a complete Saviour, has not only vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the believer from the damnatory ſentence of a broken law, but tenders, by his ſpirit, help to comply with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the goſpel covenant. This ſpirit, in his beneficial ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, our Saviour purchaſed by his ſufferings; and when he aſcended to heaven, ſent him down to aſſiſt mankind under their great weakneſſes; to alleviate their burthens and to comfort their hearts; to arouſe them to a ſerious conſideration of their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intereſts; to mortify their luſts; to inſpire them with ſorrow for their ſins; to lead them to repentance; to ſanctify their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and animate them to the conſcientious performance of GOOD WORKS; or in the language of ſcripture, <hi>to reprove,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>the world, of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</hi> Now the ſpirit, which may be reſiſted, operates on the hearts of men in a way conſentaneous to their rational nature. And as reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures we ought to cooperate with him, and in this way to be <hi>workers together with God;</hi> that we may <hi>be ſealed to the day of redemption;</hi> or in the expreſs language of ſcripture, <hi>we muſt work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</hi>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:023103_0027_0FBC3AEB4C72EF78"/>BEFORE I come to the improvement, it is proper that I ſhould ſay ſomething to that particular mode of expreſſion in the text, from which ſome men have inferred the doctrine of <hi>univerſal ſalvation.</hi> The word <hi>many,</hi> in the former part of the text, intends <hi>all,</hi> as I have already told you. In the latter clauſe it is to be underſtood in a ſenſe equally extenſive. Now what rational and conſiſtent meaning can we put on this expreſſion, if we do not grant that <hi>all</hi> will be finally ſaved? As, therefore, I do not believe the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſalvation of all men, it becomes me to ſhow how this term can be explained in conſiſtency with my own, and the common perſuaſion. I anſwer in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, that by the obedience of Chriſt, <hi>all</hi> ſhall be raiſed from the dead, which is one thing ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idently intended <hi>by all being made righteous.</hi> 2dly. The ſacrifice of Chriſt was <hi>intentionally</hi> for <hi>all;</hi> and there is virtue enough in his death to atone, or ſatisfy for the ſins of <hi>all</hi> the ſons of Adam. Hence we read, <hi>that he died for all; that he taſted death for every man; that he was a propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins of the whole world;</hi> from which, and ſundry other ſimilar paſſages of ſcripture, we learn, that <hi>univerſal redemption</hi> is a true doctrine. My meaning is, Chriſt did not ſo die for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular number of mankind, as to exclude the remainder, or leave them in a hopeleſs condition; but by removing impediments out of the way, has rendered ſalvation poſſible to <hi>all,</hi> ſo that if they do not attain it, the fault is wholly their own. But 3dly. The nature of religion, as well as the nature of man, makes it for ever neceſſary that we ſhould maintain a diſtinction, between the <hi>offer,</hi> and the <hi>acceptance</hi> of ſalvation on the terms of the goſpel. The offer we muſt believe is by God in ſincerity made to <hi>all,</hi> and unleſs we would reflect great diſhonor on the ſincerity of our heavenly Father, muſt believe that ſpiritual aſſiſtances are tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>all,</hi> ſufficient to enable them to repent and believe. But then though this be very true, the nature of religion obliges us to conclude, that it is in the <hi>power,</hi> and experience teaches us that it is often times in the <hi>will</hi> of man, to reſiſt the ſtrivings of the ſpirit; <hi>to reject the counſel of God againſt themſelves, and receive his grace in vain.</hi> This reſults from that liberty in man which he ſtill retains, ſince the apoſtacy; and is neceſſary to conſtitute him a free agent, in the moſt proper ſenſe of the word: for the idea, <hi>that liberty conſiſts altogether in voluntarineſs,</hi> and <hi>is not to be oppoſed to neceſſity,</hi> muſt be rejected, as without ſufficient founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either in reaſon or ſcripture. Now, if this idea of liberty be rational, that the redemption from the curſe of the law be by Chriſt purchaſed for <hi>all;</hi> and grace ſufficient to enable them to comply with the conditions of the goſpel covenant, be offered to <hi>all,</hi> yet ſtill it is in the compaſs of man's <hi>power</hi> to reject the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023103_0028_0FBC3AEC94C9ABA8"/>
good. And that this is often done by the ſinful children of men, ſcripture and experience abundantly convince us. Some become holy, whilſt others remain wicked. And to theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent characters, a proper retribution is aſſigned by the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> of God, in the future world. The righteous at death will be admitted to eternal life; and why may we not ſuppoſe that the wicked, at the ſame period, ſhall be ſent down to eternal puniſhment? We have as much reaſon from revelation to believe the one as the other. St. Matthew, ſpeaking by inſpiration, tells us, <hi>theſe,</hi> that is the wicked of whom he had juſt before been ſpeaking, <hi>ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment; but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous into life eternal.</hi> Yet it is to be obſerved that the epithet in the Greek, is in both places the ſame, and therefore from this text we have as much reaſon to believe the eternal damnation of the wicked, as the eternal ſalvation of the righteous. But <hi>ſome</hi> tell us that the words <hi>for ever, everlaſting,</hi> &amp;c. do not always intend or imply a ſtrict eternity. It is readily granted. But does the text juſt now quoted, ſufficiently prove the eternal happineſs of the righteous, as all believe? Why does it not alſo prove the endleſs miſery of the wicked? The one is expreſſed in as ſtrong terms as the other. Still it has been ſaid by the fautors of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation, that God is held to fulfil his promiſes, but not his threatenings; becauſe if he does not fulfil his promiſes, he does an injury to his creatures, as diſappointing them of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected good: but if he forbears to execute his threatenings, he leaves his creatures better than they expected. Very true. But where is the truth and rectoral holineſs of the great Governor of the world, on this ſuppoſition? <hi>Let God be true though every man be a liar.</hi> Others tell us, that though all who die impenitent ſhall be doomed to miſery <hi>awfully long and ſevere,</hi> yet that they ſhall ſooner or later be recovered by means of their torments, to an holy temper, and their puniſhments ſhall finally ceaſe. But how can they certainly tell this? From what text in the Bible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently interpreted, do they infer this concluſion? How do they certainly know that the future world will be a world of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? St. John, in the Apocalypſe, ſeems to repreſent this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a different light; for ſpeaking of the time of death, or of the general judgment, he ſays, <hi>He that is unjuſt let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy let him be filthy ſtill; and he that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous let him be righteous ſtill; and he that is holy let him be holy ſtill.</hi> Rev. xxii chapter, 11 verſe. Theſe words, I think, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be better explained than by interpreting them to this ſenſe, that there will be no alteration in men's characters after death, and the time of probation ends with the preſent world. But granting we are miſtaken in our interpretation of them, and the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023103_0029_0FBC3AEE5399BEF8"/>
time of probation ſhall continue in the future world, through many ſucceſſive ſtates, how can we certainly ſay, that thoſe who die impenitent in this world, ſhall be recovered to a penitent temper in the future? If we acknowledge that men, in order to be righteous or wicked, muſt have liberty to chuſe or refuſe, to repent or rebel; and that ſuch a liberty conſtitutes them moral agents, the ſubjects of praiſe or blame, of rewards or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how can we certainly know how they will conduct under any given circumſtances? Is it poſſible for us, on this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to pronounce that any quantity of puniſhment, let it be ever ſo long and ſevere, will reclaim them to a better temper! And yet it is a matter of publick notoriety, that the beſt writers, in favor of univerſal ſalvation, believe that men are poſſeſſed of the liberty abovementioned, and that without an holy temper none can be happy. In aſſerting, therefore, that <hi>all</hi> ſhall be ſaved, ſuch perſons contradict their own principles, and cut up the ground on which they ſtand; or at leaſt form concluſions, which, from their premiſes, are infallibly precarious. Since therefore every text of ſcripture which ſeems to countenance the doctrine of <hi>the ſalvation of all men,</hi> is fully explained on the ſuppoſition of the doctrine of univerſal redemption, as I have above explained it; and ſince the notion that a certain degree of puniſhment, will inevitably recover the wicked to an holy temper, militates with the eſſential liberty of man; and eſpecially, ſince we know that the inſtituted means of grace, and all God's providential diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, intermingled with mercy and puniſhment, with ſeverity and kindneſs, have never, in this world, (confeſſedly a ſtate of probation,) been ſufficient to reclaim certain characters; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they die in a ſtate of impenitency, and conſequently out of favor with God; we may conclude, that the reaſonings of thoſe who are advocates for the final ſalvation of all men, are extremely inconcluſive and precarious. And hence we cannot act a more rational part, than to believe in the <hi>expreſs words,</hi> and <hi>moſt probably</hi> in the <hi>very ſenſe</hi> of ſcripture, that the <hi>wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment.</hi> But when I ſay this I will not diſſemble, that the doctrine of eternal torments for the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and tranſient acts of men, is attended with <hi>great</hi> difficulties, when viewed in the light of reaſon, and ſome <hi>ſmall</hi> ones when contemplated in the glaſs of revelation. It is impoſſible for me with certainty to declare, that all men ſhall not, through the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and the ſuperabounding merit of his ſon's obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to death, be finally reduced from miſery, after an awful pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of ſufferings, intenſe in degree and long in duration. Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoiced ſhould I be, could I pronounce this with certainty from the ſacred pages: for nothing more delights me than the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023103_0030_0FBC3AEFF13A2858"/>
contemplation of the happineſs of the <hi>whole world.</hi> But the force of truth, according to my preſent ideas, conſtrains me to believe otherwiſe. However, let this doctrine be decided as it will, yet of this one thing we may be abſolutely certain, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners act with great imprudence, who allow themſelves in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, under an expectation that they will be gainers by their impenetency in a courſe of ſin; for though we ſhould allow that there is great pleaſure in ſinning, even much greater than in keeping the divine commands; yet if God the ſupreme Lawgiver, be wiſe as well as righteous, we may preſume, that under his gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, the pains attending the puniſhment annexed to the breach of his laws, ſhall exceed all the pleaſures of ſin; for oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe he has ſo framed his laws as to be, on the whole, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to rebels. Now our ideas of God teach us that this cannot poſſibly be; becauſe he would not, on this ſuppoſition, be a wiſe Legiſlator. If there be really a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, both the puniſhments and the rewards, muſt be very inconſiderable indeed, not to make it worth a man's while to live a life of obedience: For if God's laws were given to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this obedience, he certainly muſt have annexed ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo long and ſevere to the breach of them, as to make it the intereſt of all to obey; and their exceeding great folly to tranſgreſs. It is in vain therefore for perſons to ſpend their time in zealous diſputes about the <hi>nature</hi> or the duration of <hi>hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> with a view to ſolace or encourage themſelves in ſin; for let this doctrine of final ſalvation for all men be decided as it will; of this we muſt have the fulleſt conviction, and the moſt indubitable aſſurance, that the impenitent ſinner ſhall, upon bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancing the pains and pleaſures of ſin, find himſelf a loſer; and muſt in the end confeſs that he ſinned contrary to all the dictates of wiſdom and prudence, and ſtands juſtly obnoxious to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of extreme folly: <hi>The fear of the Lord is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi> Thus, to make the word <hi>many,</hi> in the latter clauſe of the verſe, as extenſive as it is in the former, without recurring to the doctrine, that all men will eventually be ſaved, by the obedience of one, we have only gone upon the principle of <hi>univerſal redemption,</hi> which is doubtleſs an important truth, and have taken into our conſideration the liberty of the will in all matters of real and perſonal righteouſneſs, and its frequent abuſe in the refuſal of the greateſt good; for the many, in the fulleſt ſenſe of the word, ſhall be made righteous, as delivered from the power of the grave, in which no moral agency can be exerted; yet none are made righteous or inherently holy, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who voluntarily concur with the gracious purpoſes of God in the death of his dear Son; conſequently, though Chriſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023103_0031_0FBC3AF11EE14218"/>
died for all, that all through him might live ſpiritually and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as well as naturally; yet not all not concurring in this plan of grace, not rightly improving their own moral powers, they do not become inherently holy; and therefore <hi>periſh,</hi> though for them <hi>Chriſt died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN theſe diſcourſes, I have run a parallel between the ſin of Adam, and the obedience of Chriſt, and their reſpective effects on the children of men, the one reducing to death, the other raiſing to life; the one making them ſinners, and the other righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the one condemning, and the other juſtifying, &amp;c. Yet to the honor of my Saviour, and in compliance with the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſcripture, I am conſtrained to declare that the antitheſis, or parallel, is not, in all reſpects, exact; for the obedience of Chriſt avails to deliver from more penal effects, than thoſe to which we were ſubjected by Adam's diſobedience. There is more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the one, than demerit in the other. Hence the Apoſtle, in this very chapter, ſays; <hi>But not as the offence ſo alſo is the free gift; for if through the offence of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</hi> And again, <hi>not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift: for the judgment was by one ſin to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto juſtification; for if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which in few words may be explained to the following ſenſe; the obedience of Chriſt not only delivers the believer from all the penal effects of Adam's ſin, but from the evil conſequences of their own tranſgreſſions, be they ever ſo numerous.</p>

               <p n="1">1ſt. FROM the repreſentation given above, we learn, that we are under infinite obligations to God for the gift of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, for the redemption of fallen man from all the effect of Adam's and our own perſonal offences. Though it does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us to ſay, that God could not in any other way have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed man from the wretched conſequences of the <hi>fall,</hi> than by the death of his only begotten Son; yet we know that this was a moſt glorious method, by which at once to diſplay, his dignity as a righteous Governor, and his infinite compaſſion to fallen man.

all wiſdom and prudence. O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God; how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> Let us adore with moſt profound ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and gratitude, this aſtoniſhing method of ſalvation by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of his Son; and whilſt we rejoice that every man may be ſaved if he <hi>will,</hi> let us endeavour, by the right improvement of our own powers, to be in the happy number of thoſe to whom the Redeemer ſhall ſay, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> All that Chriſt has done and ſuffered for the apoſtate ſons of Adam, will no further avail the adult, than to raiſe them from the dead, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they believe and repent, and are found in the number of thoſe who comply with goſpel grace, in the religious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe moral powers, which God has given them, for the ſtrengthening of which he proffers the aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirit. Salvation is now made poſſible to us, but none will final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure it, notwithſtanding all that Chriſt has done and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs we diligently improve thoſe means of grace which are within our reach, and in the compaſs of our power. Though all moral impediments on the part of God are now removed by the death and mediatory undertaking of his Son; yet none can be ſaved who have arrived to years of reaſon, and do not improve it, in a hearty compliance with thoſe terms and conditions which the goſpel propoſes. Some perſons have made moſt dangerous miſtakes on this ſubject, as ſuppoſing that every thing is done for them by Chriſt; whereas the true ſtate of the caſe is this only, that our Saviour has delivered us from the condemning ſentence of the law, and placed us under the gracious conſtitution of the goſpel covenant, by which perfect obedience is not required for ſalvation. But then it requires a <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>holy obedience</hi> to the law of faith, in the performance of which our own endeavours are neceſſary: if we do not exert them, it had been better for us if Chriſt had never appeared in our world, and died in our ſtead. His death therefore does not ſuperſede the neceſſity of the diligent improvement of our time and talents; and when we have offended, of repentance; but only makes them available to pardon and final ſecurity. Too much cannot be ſaid on this ſubject in this connexion; for men are not mechanically made holy, nor ſent to heaven without their own voluntary conſent. We ſhall be raiſed from the dead, whether we chuſe or not; <hi>for there ſhall be a reſurrection both of the juſt and unjuſt;</hi> but none go to heaven if they have arrived to years of diſcretion, without a proper improvement of their own powers, in the uſe of thoſe means which Chriſt has purchaſed, and now ſincerely tenders to the children of men.</p>

You are not like the Jews of old, <hi>to go about to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of your own, in order for juſtification in the ſight of God,</hi> for your beſt performances as falling ſhort of the law, which requires <hi>perfect unſinning obedience,</hi> in this view are of no avail, and <hi>are but filthy rags.</hi> But that you may be intereſted in the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and may be not only juſtified, but ſanctified, and made meet for the kingdom of heaven, you muſt lean to him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, not only for pardon by his obedience, but for ſanctification by his ſpirit. As your greateſt exertions will not bring you to a full compliance with the moral law; ſo neither will your own endeavours, without the aſſiſtances of Chriſt's ſpirit, poſſeſs you of a covenant holineſs. Look to him therefore, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, as a whole and complete Saviour; <hi>whole and complete,</hi> as not only juſtifying you by his righteouſneſs, but as ſanctifying you by his holy ſpirit.
