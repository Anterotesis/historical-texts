            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT was not until after the termination of the late glorious conteÅ¿t, which made the people of the United States an indedendent nation, that any defect was diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the preÅ¿ent confederation. It was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Å¿ome of the ableÅ¿t patriots in America. It carried us Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully through the war; and the virtue and patriotiÅ¿m of the people, with their diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the common cauÅ¿e, Å¿upplied the want of power in CongreÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>The requiÅ¿ition of CongreÅ¿s for the five per cent. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿t was made before the peace, Å¿o early as the firÅ¿t of February, 1781, but was prevented taking effect by the refuÅ¿al of one Å¿tate; yet it is probable every Å¿tate in the union would have agreed to this meaÅ¿ure, at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, had it not been for the extravagant terms in which it was demanded. The requiÅ¿ition was new moulded in the year 1783, and accompanied with an additional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of certain Å¿upplementary funds for twenty-five years. Peace had now taken place, and the United States found themÅ¿elves labouring under a conÅ¿iderable foreign and domeÅ¿tic debt, incurred during the war. The requiÅ¿ition of 1783, was commenÅ¿urate with the intereÅ¿t of the debt, as it was then calculated; but it has been more accurately aÅ¿certaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:021344_0004_0FB31F02CE420640"/>It was at this time that the want of an efficient fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government was firÅ¿t complained of, and that the powers veÅ¿ted in CongreÅ¿s were found to be inadequate to the procuring of the benefits that Å¿hould reÅ¿ult from the union. The impoÅ¿t was granted by moÅ¿t of the Å¿tates, but many refuÅ¿ed the Å¿upplementary funds; the annual requiÅ¿itions were Å¿et at nought by Å¿ome of the Å¿tates, while others complied with them by legiÅ¿lative acts, but were tardy in their payments, and CongreÅ¿s found themÅ¿elves incapable of complying with their engagements, and Å¿upporting the federal government. It was found, that our national character was Å¿inking in the opinion of foreign nations. The CongreÅ¿s could make treaties of commerce, but could not enforce the obÅ¿ervance of them. We were Å¿uffering from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trictions of foreign nations, who had Å¿hackled our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, while we were unable to retaliate: and all now agreed that it would be advantageous to the union to enlarge the powers of CongreÅ¿s; that they Å¿hould be enabled in the ampleÅ¿t manner to regulate commerce, and to lay and collect duties on the imports throughout tho United States. With this view a convention was firÅ¿t propoÅ¿ed by Virginia, and finally recommended by CongreÅ¿s for the different Å¿tates to appoint deputies to meet in convention, "for the purpoÅ¿e of reviÅ¿ing and amending the preÅ¿ent articles of confederation, Å¿o as to make them adequate to the exigencies of the union." This recommendation the legiÅ¿latures of twelve Å¿tates complied with Å¿o haÅ¿tily as not to conÅ¿ult their conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents on the Å¿ubject; and though the different legiÅ¿la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had no authority from their conÅ¿tituents for the purpoÅ¿e, they probably apprehended the neceÅ¿Å¿ity would juÅ¿tify the meaÅ¿ure; and none of them extended their ideas, at that time, further than "reviÅ¿ing and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preÅ¿ent articles of confederation."

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:021344_0005_0FB31F04EA2615B8"/>The majority of the legiÅ¿lature of this commonwealth were at that time under the influence of the members from the city of Philadelphia. They agreed, that the deputies Å¿ent by them to convention, Å¿hould have no compenÅ¿ation for their Å¿ervices, which determination was calculated to prevent the election of any member who reÅ¿ided at a diÅ¿tance from the city. It was in vain for the minority to attempt electing delegates to the convention, who underÅ¿tood the circumÅ¿tances and the feelings of the people, and had a common intereÅ¿t with them. They found a diÅ¿poÅ¿ition in the leaders of the majority of the houÅ¿e to chooÅ¿e themÅ¿elves and Å¿ome of their depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The minority attempted to prevent this by agreeing to vote for Å¿ome of the leading mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who they knew had influence enough to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at any rate, in hopes of carring with them Å¿ome reÅ¿pectable citizens of Philadelphia, in whoÅ¿e prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and integrity they could have more confidence; but even in this they were diÅ¿appointed, except in one member: the eighth member was added at a Å¿ubÅ¿equent Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the aÅ¿Å¿embly.</p>
            <p>The continental convention met in the city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia at the time appointed.

were buÅ¿ily employed in alarming the fears of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with dangers which did not exiÅ¿t, and exciting their hopes of greater advantages from the expected plan than even the beÅ¿t government on earth can produce.</p>
            <p>The propoÅ¿ed plan had not many hours iÅ¿Å¿ued forth, from the womb of Å¿uÅ¿picious Å¿ecrecy, until Å¿uch as were prepared for the purpoÅ¿e, were carrying about pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for people to Å¿ign, Å¿ignifying their approbation of the Å¿yÅ¿tem, and requeÅ¿ting the legiÅ¿lature to call a convention. While every meaÅ¿ure was taken to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midate the people againÅ¿t oppoÅ¿ing it, the public papers teemed with the moÅ¿t violent threats againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e who Å¿hould dare to think for themÅ¿elves, and tar and feathers were liberally promiÅ¿ed to all thoÅ¿e who would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately join in Å¿upporting the propoÅ¿ed government, be it what it would. Under Å¿uch circumÅ¿tances, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in favour of calling a convention, were Å¿igned by great numbers in and about the city, before they had leiÅ¿ure to read and examine the Å¿yÅ¿tem, many of whom, now they are better acquainted with it, and have had time to inveÅ¿tigate its principles, are heartily oppoÅ¿ed to it. The petitions were Å¿peedily handed in to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿lature.</p>
            <p>Affairs were in this Å¿ituation, when on the 28th of September laÅ¿t, a reÅ¿olution was propoÅ¿ed to the aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by a member of the houÅ¿e who had been alÅ¿o a member of the federal convention, for calling a Å¿tate convention, to be elected within ten days, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e of examining and adopting the propoÅ¿ed conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the united Å¿tates, though at this time the houÅ¿e had not received it from CongreÅ¿s. This attempt was oppoÅ¿ed by a minority, who, after offering every argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their power to prevent the precipitate meaÅ¿ure, without effect, abÅ¿ented themÅ¿elves from the houÅ¿e, as the only alternative left them, to prevent the meaÅ¿ures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

We Å¿hall dwell no longer on this Å¿ubject, the people of PennÅ¿ylvania have been already acquainted therewith. We would only further obÅ¿erve, that every member of the legiÅ¿lature, previouÅ¿ly to taking his Å¿eat, by Å¿olemn oath or affirmation, declares, "that they will not do or conÅ¿ent to any act or thing whatever that Å¿hall have a tendency to leÅ¿Å¿en or abridge their rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, as declared in the conÅ¿titution of this Å¿tate." And that conÅ¿titution which they are Å¿o Å¿olemnly Å¿worn to Å¿upport, cannot legally be altered but by a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the council of cenÅ¿ors, who alone are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ed to propoÅ¿e alterations and amendments, and even theÅ¿e muÅ¿t be publiÅ¿hed at leaÅ¿t Å¿ix months, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration of the people. The propoÅ¿ed Å¿yÅ¿tem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for the United States, if adopted, will alter, and may annihilate the conÅ¿titution of PennÅ¿ylvania; and therefore the legiÅ¿lature had no authority whatever to recommend the calling a convention for that purpoÅ¿e. This proceeding could not be conÅ¿idered as binding on the people of this commonwealth. The houÅ¿e was formed by violence, Å¿ome of the members compoÅ¿ing it were detained by force, which alone would have vitiated any proceedings, to which they were otherwiÅ¿e compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but had the legiÅ¿lature been legally formed, this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s was abÅ¿olutely without their power.</p>
            <p>In this Å¿ituation of affairs were the Å¿ubÅ¿cribers elected members of the convention of PennÅ¿ylvania. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention called by a legiÅ¿lature in direct violation of their duty, and compoÅ¿ed in part of members, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to attend for that purpoÅ¿e, to conÅ¿ider of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution propoÅ¿ed by a convention of the United States, who were not appointed for the porpoÅ¿e of framing a new form of government, but whoÅ¿e powers were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿sly confined to altering and amending the preÅ¿ent articles of confederation. Therefore the members of the <note n="â " place="bottom">The continental convention, in direct violation of the 13th article of confederation, have declared, "that the ratification of nine Å¿tates Å¿hall be Å¿ufficient for the eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hment of this conÅ¿titution, between the Å¿tates Å¿o ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Å¿ame." Thus has the plighted faith of the Å¿tates been Å¿ported with! they had Å¿olemnly engaged that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation now Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting Å¿hould be inviolably preÅ¿erved by each of them, and the union thereby formed Å¿hould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, unleÅ¿s the Å¿ame Å¿hould be altered by mutual conÅ¿ent.</note>

continental convention, in propoÅ¿ing the plan, acted as individuals, and not as deputies from PennÅ¿ylvania â â the aÅ¿Å¿embly who called the Å¿tate convention acted as individuals, and not as the legiÅ¿lature of PennÅ¿ylvania; nor could they, or the convention choÅ¿en on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, have authority to do any act or thing, that can alter or annihilate the conÅ¿titution of PennÅ¿yl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania (both of which will be done by the new conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) nor are their proceedings, in our opinion, at all binding upon the people.</p>
            <p>The election for members of the convention was held at Å¿o early a period, and the want of information was Å¿o great, that Å¿ome of us did not know of it until after it was over, and we have reaÅ¿on to believe, that great numbers of the people of PennÅ¿ylvania have not yet had an opportunity of Å¿ufficiently examining the propoÅ¿ed conÅ¿titution. We apprehend that no change can take place that will affect the internal government or conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this commonwealth, unleÅ¿s a majority of the people Å¿hould evidence a wiÅ¿h for Å¿uch a change; but on examining the number of votes given for members of the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate convention, we find, that of upwards of Å¿eventy thouÅ¿and freemen who are entitled to vote in PennÅ¿ylvania, the whole convention has been elected by about thirteen thouÅ¿and voters, and though two-thirds of the members of the convention have thought proper to ratify the propoÅ¿ed conÅ¿titution, yet thoÅ¿e two-thirds were elected by the votes of only Å¿ix thouÅ¿and and eight hundred freemen.</p>

We were prohibited by an expreÅ¿s vote of the convention, from taking any queÅ¿tion on the Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate articles of the plan, and reduced to the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of adopting or rejecting <hi>in toto.</hi> It is true the majority permitted us to debate on each article, but reÅ¿trained us from propoÅ¿ing amendments. They alÅ¿o determined not to permit us to enter on the minutes our reaÅ¿ons of diÅ¿Å¿ent againÅ¿t the whole. Thus Å¿ituated we entered on the examination of the propoÅ¿ed Å¿yÅ¿tem of government, and found it to be Å¿uch as we could not adopt, without, as we conceived, Å¿urrendering up your deareÅ¿t rights. We offered our objections to the convention, and oppoÅ¿ed thoÅ¿e parts of the plan, which, in our opinion, would be injurious to you, in the beÅ¿t manner we were able; and cloÅ¿ed our arguments by offering the following propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions to the convention:</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t. The rights of conÅ¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Second. That in controverÅ¿ies reÅ¿pecting property,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021344_0010_0FB31F0E1CE26CA8"/>
and in Å¿uits between man and man, trial by jury Å¿hall remain as heretofore, as well in the federal courts, as in thoÅ¿e of the Å¿everal Å¿tates.</p>
            <p>Third. That in all capital and criminal proÅ¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a man has a right to demand the cauÅ¿e and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his accuÅ¿ation, as well in the federal courts as in thoÅ¿e of the Å¿everal Å¿tates; to be heard by himÅ¿elf and counÅ¿el; to be confronted with the accuÅ¿ers and witneÅ¿Å¿es; to call for evidence in his favor, and a Å¿peedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whoÅ¿e unanimous conÅ¿ent, he cannot be found guilty, nor can he be compelled to give evidence againÅ¿t himÅ¿elf; and that no man be deprived of his liberty, except by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</p>
            <p>Fourth. That exceÅ¿Å¿ive bail ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, nor exceÅ¿Å¿ive fines impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fifth. That warrants, unÅ¿upported by evidence, whereby any officer or meÅ¿Å¿enger may be commanded or required to Å¿earch Å¿uÅ¿pected places, or to Å¿eize any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on or perÅ¿ons, his or their property, not particularly deÅ¿cribed, are grievous and oppreÅ¿Å¿ive, and Å¿hall not be granted either by the magiÅ¿trates of the federal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or others.</p>
            <p>Sixth. That the people have a right to the freedom of Å¿peech, of writing and publiÅ¿hing their Å¿entiments; therefore, the freedom of the preÅ¿s Å¿hall not be reÅ¿train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any law of the united Å¿tates.</p>

            <p>Eighth. The inhabitants of the Å¿everal Å¿tates Å¿hall have liberty to fowl and hunt in Å¿eaÅ¿onable times, on the lands they hold, and on all other lands in the United

            <p>Ninth. That no law Å¿hall be paÅ¿Å¿ed to reÅ¿train the legiÅ¿latures of the Å¿everal Å¿tates from enacting laws for impoÅ¿ing taxes, except impoÅ¿ts and duties on goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or exported, and that no taxes, except impoÅ¿ts and duties on goods imported and exported, and poÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age on letters, Å¿hall be levied by the authority of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>Tenth. That the houÅ¿e of repreÅ¿entatives be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly increaÅ¿ed in number; that elections Å¿hall remain free; that the Å¿everal Å¿tates Å¿hall have power to regulate the elections for Å¿enators and repreÅ¿entatives, without being controuled either directly or indirectly by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference on the part of CongreÅ¿s; and that elections of repreÅ¿entatives be annual.</p>
            <p>Eleventh. That the power of organizing, arming, and diÅ¿ciplining the militia (the manner of diÅ¿ciplining the militia to be preÅ¿cribed by CongreÅ¿s) remain with the individual Å¿tates, and that CongreÅ¿s Å¿hall not have authority to call or march any of the militia out of their own Å¿tate, without the conÅ¿ent of Å¿uch Å¿tate, and for Å¿uch length of time only as Å¿uch Å¿tate Å¿hall agree.</p>
            <p>That the Å¿overeignty, freedom, and independency of the Å¿everal Å¿tates Å¿hall be retained, and every power, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿diction, and right, which is not by this conÅ¿titution expreÅ¿sly delegated to the United States in CongreÅ¿s aÅ¿Å¿embled.</p>
            <p>Twelfth. That the legiÅ¿lative, executive, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial powers be kept Å¿eparate; and to this end, that a conÅ¿titutional council be appointed, to adviÅ¿e and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the preÅ¿ident, who Å¿hall be reÅ¿ponÅ¿ible for the advice they give; hereby the Å¿enators would be relieved from almoÅ¿t conÅ¿tant attendance; and alÅ¿o that the judges be made completely independent.</p>
            <p>Thirteenth. That no treaty which Å¿hall be directly oppoÅ¿ed to the exiÅ¿ting laws of the United States in CongreÅ¿s aÅ¿Å¿embled, Å¿hall be valid until Å¿uch laws Å¿hall be repealed or made conformable to Å¿uch treaty; neither Å¿hall any treaties be valid which are in contradiction to

the conÅ¿titution of the United States, or the conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Å¿everal Å¿tates.</p>
            <p>Fourteenth. That the judiciary power of the United States Å¿hall be confined to caÅ¿es affecting ambaÅ¿Å¿adors, other public miniÅ¿ters, or conÅ¿uls; to caÅ¿es of admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and maritime juriÅ¿diction; to controverÅ¿ies to which the United States Å¿hall be a party; to controverÅ¿ies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two or more Å¿tates; between a Å¿tate and citizens of different Å¿tates, between citizens claiming lands under grants of different Å¿tates, and between a Å¿tate or the citizens thereof and foreign Å¿tates; and in criminal c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After reading theÅ¿e propoÅ¿itions, we declared our willingneÅ¿s to agree to the plan, provided it was Å¿o amended as to meet thoÅ¿e propoÅ¿itions, or Å¿omething Å¿imilar to them: and finally moved the convention do adjourn, to give the people of PennÅ¿ylvania time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>During the diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion, we met with many inÅ¿ults, and Å¿ome perÅ¿onal abuÅ¿e; we were not even treated with decency, during the Å¿itting of the convention, by the perÅ¿ons in the gallery of the houÅ¿e<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> however, we flatter our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It remains with you, whether you will think thoÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿timable privileges, which you have Å¿o ably contended for, Å¿hould be Å¿acrificed at the Å¿hrine of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m, or

whether you mean to contend for them with the Å¿ame Å¿pirit that has Å¿o often baffled the attempts of an ariÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocratic faction, to rivet the Å¿hackles of Å¿lavery on you, and you unborn poÅ¿terity.</p>
            <p>Our objections are compriÅ¿ed under three general heads of diÅ¿Å¿ent, viz.</p>
            <p>WE DISSENT, FirÅ¿t, BecauÅ¿e it is the opinion of the moÅ¿t celebrated writers on government, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by uniform experience, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a very extenÅ¿ive ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory cannot be governed on the principles of freedom otherwiÅ¿e than by a confederation of republics, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the powers of internal governments; but united in the management of their general and foreign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>If any doubt could have been entertained of the truth of the foregoing principle, it has been fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the conceÅ¿Å¿ion of Mr. WilÅ¿on, one of the majority on this queÅ¿tion, and who was one of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in the late general convention. In juÅ¿tice to him we will give his own words; they are as follows, viz. "The extent of country for which the new conÅ¿titution was required, produced another difficulty in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of the federal convention. It is the opinion of Å¿ome celebrated writers, that to a Å¿mall territory, the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical; to a middling territory (as MonteÅ¿quieu has termed it) the monarchial; and to an extenÅ¿ive terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the deÅ¿potic form of government, is beÅ¿t adapted. Regarding, then, the wide and almoÅ¿t unbounded juriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the United States, at firÅ¿t view, the hand of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m Å¿eemed neceÅ¿Å¿ary to controul, connect, and protect it; and hence the chief embarraÅ¿Å¿ment roÅ¿e. For we knew, that, although our conÅ¿tituents would cheerfully Å¿ubmit to the legiÅ¿lative reÅ¿traints of a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they would Å¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>cle them with deÅ¿potic power." And again, in another part of his Å¿peech, he continues, "Is it probable that the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olution of the Å¿tate governments, and the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of one conÅ¿olidated empire, would be eligible in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Å¿atisfactory to the people in its adminiÅ¿tration?

recited Å¿ections, is Å¿o unlimited in its nature, may be Å¿o comprehenÅ¿ive and boundleÅ¿s in its exerciÅ¿e, that this alone would be amply Å¿ufficient to annihilate the Å¿tate governments, and Å¿wallow them up in the grand vortex of general empire.</p>
            <p>The judicial powers, veÅ¿ted in CongreÅ¿s, are alÅ¿o Å¿o various and extenÅ¿ive, that by legal ingenuity they may be extended to every caÅ¿e, and thus abÅ¿orb the Å¿tate ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciaries: and when we conÅ¿ider the deciÅ¿ive influence that a general judiciary would have over the civil polity of the Å¿everal Å¿tates, we do not heÅ¿itate to pronounce, that this power, unaided by the legiÅ¿lative, would effect a conÅ¿olidation of the Å¿tates under one government.</p>
            <p>The powers of a court of equity, veÅ¿ted by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution in the tribunals of CongreÅ¿sâpowers which do not exiÅ¿t in the Å¿tate of PennÅ¿ylvania, unleÅ¿s Å¿o far as they can be incorporated with jury trialâwould, in this Å¿tate, greatly contribute to this event. The rich and wealthy Å¿uitor would eagerly lay hold of the infinite mazes, perplexities, and delays, which a court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, with the appellate powers of the Å¿upreme court, in fact, as well as law, would furniÅ¿h him with, and thus the poor man, being plunged in the bottomleÅ¿s pit of legal diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion, would drop his demand in deÅ¿pair.</p>
            <p>In Å¿hort, conÅ¿olidation pervades the whole conÅ¿titution. It begins with an annunciation that Å¿uch was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The main pillars of the fabric correÅ¿pond with it: and the concluding paragraph is a confirmation of it. The preamble begins with the words, "We the people of the United States," which is the Å¿tyle of a compact between individuals entering into a Å¿tate of Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and not that of a confederation of Å¿tates. The other features of conÅ¿olidation, we have before noticed.</p>
            <p>Thus we have fully eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed the poÅ¿ition, that the powers veÅ¿ted by this conÅ¿titution in CongreÅ¿s, will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a conÅ¿olidation of the Å¿tates under one government, which even the advocates of this conÅ¿titution admit, could not be done without the Å¿acrifice of all liberty.</p>
            <p>We diÅ¿Å¿ent, thirdly, becauÅ¿e, if it were practicable to govern Å¿o extenÅ¿ive a territory as theÅ¿e United States in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, on the plan of a conÅ¿olidated government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tent with the principles of liberty and the happineÅ¿s
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021344_0019_0FB31F1CDC23EB20"/>
of the people, yet the conÅ¿truction of this conÅ¿titution is not calculated to attain the object; for, independent of the nature of the caÅ¿e, it would of itÅ¿elf, neceÅ¿Å¿arily produce a deÅ¿potiÅ¿m, and that not by the uÅ¿ual grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but with the celerity that has hitherto only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended revolutions effected by the Å¿word.</p>
            <p>To eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the truth of this poÅ¿ition, a curÅ¿ory inveÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of the principles and form of this conÅ¿titution will Å¿uffice.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t conÅ¿ideration that this review Å¿uggeÅ¿ts, is the omiÅ¿Å¿ion of a bill of rights, aÅ¿certaining and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing thoÅ¿e inalienable and perÅ¿onal rights of men, without the full, free, and Å¿ecure enjoyment of which, there can be no liberty, and over which it is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary for a good government to have the controul. The principal of which are, the rights of conÅ¿cience, perÅ¿onal liberty, by the clear and unequivocal eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the writ of habeas corpus, jury trial in criminal and civil caÅ¿es, by an impartial jury of the vicinage or county, with the common law proceedings, for the Å¿afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the accuÅ¿ed in criminal proÅ¿ecutions, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the preÅ¿s, that Å¿courge of tyrants, and the grand bulwark of every other liberty and privilege. The Å¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations heretofore made in favour of them, in the Å¿tate conÅ¿titutions, are entirely Å¿uperÅ¿eded by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution.</p>
            <p>The legiÅ¿lature of a free country Å¿hould be Å¿o formed as to have a competent knowledge of its conÅ¿tituents, and enjoy their confidence. To produce theÅ¿e eÅ¿Å¿ential requiÅ¿ites, the repreÅ¿entation ought to be fair, equal, and Å¿ufficiently numerous to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s the Å¿ame intereÅ¿ts, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, opinions, and views, which the people themÅ¿elves would poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s, were they all aÅ¿Å¿embled; and Å¿o numerous as to prevent bribery and undue influence; and Å¿o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ponÅ¿ible to the people by frequent and fair elections, as to prevent their neglecting or Å¿acrificing the views and intereÅ¿ts of their conÅ¿tituents, to their own purÅ¿uits.</p>
            <p>We will now bring the legiÅ¿lature, under this conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, to the teÅ¿t of the foregoing principles, which will demonÅ¿trate, that it is deficient in every eÅ¿Å¿ential qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a juÅ¿t and Å¿afe repreÅ¿entation.</p>

members; that is, one for about every fifty thouÅ¿and inhabitants, to be choÅ¿en every two years. Thirty-three members will form a quorum for doing buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and Å¿eventeen of theÅ¿e, being the majority, determine the Å¿enÅ¿e of the houÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>The Å¿enate, the other conÅ¿tituent branch of the legiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of twenty-Å¿ix members, being two from each Å¿tate, appointed by their legiÅ¿latures every Å¿ix years; fourteen Å¿enators make a quorum; the majority of whom, eight, determines the Å¿enÅ¿e of that body: except in judging on impeachments, or in making treaties, or in expelling a member, when two thirds of the Å¿enators pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The preÅ¿ident is to have the controul over the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of laws, Å¿o far as to make the concurrence of two thirds of the repreÅ¿entatives and Å¿enators preÅ¿ent neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary, if he Å¿hould object to the laws.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that the liberties, happineÅ¿s, intereÅ¿ts, and great concerns of the whole United States, may be dependent upon the integrity, virtue, wiÅ¿dom, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of twenty-five or twenty-Å¿ix men. How inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate and unÅ¿afe a repreÅ¿entation! inadequate, becauÅ¿e the Å¿enÅ¿e and views of three or four millions of people, diffuÅ¿ed over Å¿o extenÅ¿ive a territory, compriÅ¿ing Å¿uch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious climates, products, habits, intereÅ¿ts, and opinions, cannot be collected in Å¿o Å¿mall a body; and beÅ¿ides, it is not a fair and equal repreÅ¿entation of the people, even in proportion to its number: for the Å¿malleÅ¿t Å¿tate has as much weight in the Å¿enate as the largeÅ¿t; and from the Å¿mallneÅ¿s of the number to be choÅ¿en for both branches of the legiÅ¿lature; and from the mode of election and appointment, which is under the controul of CongreÅ¿s; and from the nature of the thing, men of the moÅ¿t ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated rank in life, will alone be choÅ¿en.

the executive; by the arts and addreÅ¿s of the great and deÅ¿igning, and by direct bribery.</p>
            <p>The repreÅ¿entation is moreover inadequate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿afe, becauÅ¿e of the long terms for which it is appointed, and the mode of its appointment, by which CongreÅ¿s may not only controul the choice of the people, but may Å¿o manage as to diveÅ¿t the people of this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental right, and become Å¿elf-elected.</p>
            <p>The number of members in the houÅ¿e of repreÅ¿enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives may be increaÅ¿ed to one for every thirty thouÅ¿and inhabitants. But when we conÅ¿ider, that this cannot be done without the conÅ¿ent of the Å¿enate, who, from their Å¿hare in the legiÅ¿lative, in the executive, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial departments, and permanency of appointment, will be the great efficient body in this government, and whoÅ¿e weight and predominancy would be abridged by an increaÅ¿e of the repreÅ¿entatives, we are perÅ¿uaded that this is a circumÅ¿tance that cannot be expected. On the contrary, the number of repreÅ¿entatives will probably be continued at Å¿ixty-five, although the population of the country may Å¿well to treble what it now is; unleÅ¿s a revolution Å¿hould effect a change.</p>
            <p>We have before noticed the judicial power, as it would effect a conÅ¿olidation of the Å¿tates into one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. We will now examine it, as it would affect the liberties and welfare of the people, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing Å¿uch a government were practicable and proper.</p>
            <p>The judicial power, under the propoÅ¿ed conÅ¿titution, is founded on the well known principles of the civil law, by which the judge determines both on law and fact, and appeals are allowed from the inferior tribunals to the Å¿uperior, upon the whole queÅ¿tion; Å¿o that facts, as well as law, would be re-examined, and even new facts brought forward in the court of appeals; and to uÅ¿e the words of a very eminent civilian, "The cauÅ¿e is many times another thing before the court of appeals, than what it was at the time of the firÅ¿t Å¿entence."</p>
            <p>That this mode of proceeding is the one which muÅ¿t be adopted under this conÅ¿titution, is evident from the following circumÅ¿tances: FirÅ¿t, that the trial by jury, which is the grand characteriÅ¿tic of the common law, is Å¿ecured by the conÅ¿titution, only in criminal caÅ¿es,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021344_0022_0FB31F2210B05AA8"/>
Secondly, that the appeal both from law and fact is expreÅ¿sly eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, which is utterly inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the principles of the common law, and trials by jury. The only mode in which an appeal from law and fact can be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, is, by adopting the principles and practice of the civil law; unleÅ¿s the United States Å¿hould be drawn into the abÅ¿urdity of calling and Å¿wearing juries, merely for the purpoÅ¿e of contradicting their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, which would render juries contemptible, and worÅ¿e than uÅ¿eleÅ¿s. Thirdly, that the courts to be eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed, would decide on all caÅ¿es of law and equity, which is a well known characteriÅ¿tic of the civil law, and theÅ¿e courts would have conuÅ¿ance not only of the laws of the United States, and of treaties, and of caÅ¿es af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ambaÅ¿Å¿adors, but of all caÅ¿es of admiralty and maritime juriÅ¿diction, which laÅ¿t are matters belonging excluÅ¿ively to the civil law, in every nation in ChriÅ¿ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Not to enlarge upon the loÅ¿s of the invaluable right of trial by an unbiaÅ¿Å¿ed jury, Å¿o dear to every friend of liberty, the monÅ¿trous expence and inconveniencies of the mode of proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>g to be adopted, are Å¿uch, as will prove intolerable to the people of this country. The lengthy proceedings of the civil law courts in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery of England, and in the courts of Scotland and France, are Å¿uch, that few men of moderate fortunes can endure the expence of: the poor man muÅ¿t, therefore, Å¿ubmit to the wealthy. Length of purÅ¿e will too often prevail againÅ¿t right and juÅ¿tice. For inÅ¿tance, we are told by the learned judge BlackÅ¿tone, that a queÅ¿tion only on the property of an ox, of the value of three guineas, originating under the civil law proceedings in Scotland, after many interlocutory orders and Å¿entences below, was carried at length from the court of Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, the higheÅ¿t court in that part of Great-Britain, by way of appeal, to the houÅ¿e of lords, where the queÅ¿tion of law and fact was finally determined. He adds, that no pique or Å¿pirit could, in the court of king's bench, or common pleas, at WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter, have given countenance to Å¿uch a cauÅ¿e for a tenth part of the time, nor coÅ¿t a twentieth part of the expence. Yet the coÅ¿ts, in the courts of king's bench, and common pleas, in England,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021344_0023_0FB31F2319F635B0"/>
are infinitely greater than thoÅ¿e which the people of this country have ever experienced.</p>
            <p>We abhor the idea of loÅ¿ing the tranÅ¿cendent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of trial by jury, with the loÅ¿s of which, it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Å¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the Å¿ame time, we regret the intolerable delay, the enormous expences, and infinite vexation, to which the people of this country will be expoÅ¿ed, from the voluminous proceedings of the courts of civil law, and eÅ¿pecially from the appellate ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿diction, by means of which, a man may be drawn from the utmoÅ¿t boundaries of this extenÅ¿ive country, to the Å¿eat of the Å¿upreme court of the nation, to contend, perhaps, with a wealthy and powerful adverÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The conÅ¿equence of this eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment will be, an abÅ¿olute confirmation of the power of ariÅ¿tocratical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the courts of juÅ¿tice: for the common people will not be able to contend or Å¿truggle againÅ¿t it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trial by jury, in criminal caÅ¿es, may alÅ¿o be excluded, by declaring that the libeller, for inÅ¿tance, Å¿hall be liable to an action of debt for a Å¿pecified Å¿um, thus evading the common law proÅ¿ecution by indictment and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the common courÅ¿e of proceeding againÅ¿t a Å¿hip for breach of revenue laws, by information (which will be claÅ¿Å¿ed among civil cauÅ¿es,) will, at the civil law, be claÅ¿Å¿ed within the reÅ¿ort of a court where no jury inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes. BeÅ¿ides, the benefit of jury trial in caÅ¿es of a criminal nature, which cannot be evaded, will be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of little value, by calling the accuÅ¿ed to anÅ¿wer far from home, there being no proviÅ¿ion that the trial be by a jury of the neighbourhood or country.

               <hi>To conclude this head: we obÅ¿erve, that the judges of the courts of CongreÅ¿s would not be independent, as they are not debarred from holding other offices, during the pleaÅ¿ure of the preÅ¿ident and Å¿enate, and as they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Å¿upport, in part, from fees, alterable by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿lature.</hi>

               <hi>The next conÅ¿ideration that the conÅ¿titution preÅ¿ents, is the undue and dangerous mixture of the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the Å¿ame body poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing legiÅ¿lative, executive, and judicial powers. The Å¿enate is a conÅ¿tituent branch of the legiÅ¿lature; it has judicial power in judging on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments, and in this caÅ¿e unites in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure the characters of judge and party, as all the principal officers are appointed by the preÅ¿ident-general, with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Å¿enate, and therefore they derive their offices in part from the Å¿enate.

Indeed, there is no power, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, or liberty of the Å¿tate-governments, or of the people, but what may be affected by virtue of this power: for all treaties made by them, are to be the "Å¿upreme law of the land, any thing in the conÅ¿titution or laws of any Å¿tate notwithÅ¿tanding."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this great power may be exerciÅ¿ed by the preÅ¿ident and ten Å¿enators, being two thirds of fourteen, which is a quorum of that body. What an inducement would this offer to the miniÅ¿ters of foreign powers to compaÅ¿s, by bribery, Å¿uch conceÅ¿Å¿ions as could not otherwiÅ¿e be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? It is the unvaried uÅ¿age of all free Å¿tates, whenever treaties interfere with the poÅ¿itive laws of the land, to make the intervention of the legiÅ¿lature neceÅ¿Å¿ary to give them operation. This became neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and was afforded by the parliament of Great-Britain, in conÅ¿equence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such various, extenÅ¿ive, and important powers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in one body of men, are inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with all freedom. The celebrated MonteÅ¿quien tells us, that "when the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿lative and executive powers are united in the Å¿ame perÅ¿on, or in the Å¿ame body of magiÅ¿trates, there can be no liberty, becauÅ¿e apprehenÅ¿ions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021344_0025_0FB31F278B7B7BD0"/>
monarch or Å¿enate Å¿hould enact tyrannical laws, or execute them in a tyrannical manner."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, "there is no liberty, if the powers of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be not Å¿eparated from the legiÅ¿lative and executive powers. Were it joined with the legiÅ¿lative, the life and liberty of the Å¿ubject would be expoÅ¿ed to arbitrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul: for the judge would then be legiÅ¿lator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppreÅ¿Å¿or. There would be an end of every thing, were the Å¿ame man, or the Å¿ame body of the nobles, or of the people, to exerciÅ¿e thoÅ¿e three powers; that of enacting laws; that of executing the public reÅ¿olutions; and that of judging the crimes or differences of individuals."</p>
            <p>The preÅ¿ident-general is dangerouÅ¿ly connected with the Å¿enate. His coincidence with the views of the ruling junto in that body, is made eÅ¿Å¿ential to his weight and importance in the government, which will deÅ¿troy all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency and purity in the executive department; and having the power of pardoning, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a council, he may Å¿creen from puniÅ¿hment the moÅ¿t treaÅ¿onable attempts that may be made on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people, when inÅ¿tigated by his coadjutors in the Å¿enate. InÅ¿tead of this dangerous and improper mixture of the executive with the legiÅ¿lative and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, the Å¿upreme executive powers ought to have been placed in the preÅ¿ident, with a Å¿mall independent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, made perÅ¿onally reÅ¿ponÅ¿ible for every appointment to office, or other act, by having their opinions recorded; and that without the concurrence of the majority of the quorum of this council, the preÅ¿ident Å¿hould not be capable of taking any Å¿tep.</p>
            <p>We have before conÅ¿idered internal taxation, as it would affect the deÅ¿truction of the Å¿tate governments, and produce one conÅ¿olidated government. We will now conÅ¿ider that Å¿ubject as it affects the perÅ¿onal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the people.</p>
            <p>The power of direct taxation applies to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual: as CongreÅ¿s, under this new government, is expreÅ¿sly veÅ¿ted with the authority of laying a capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or poll-tax upon every perÅ¿on, to any amount. This is a tax, that, however oppreÅ¿Å¿ive in its nature, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021344_0026_0FB31F2AB45C4430"/>
unequal in its operation, is certain as to its produce, and Å¿imple in its collection. It cannot be evaded, like the objects of impoÅ¿t or exciÅ¿e; and will be paid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e all that a man hath, will he give for his head. This tax is Å¿o congenial to the nature of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m, that it has ever been a favourite under Å¿uch governments. Some of thoÅ¿e who were in the late general convention, from this Å¿tate, have long laboured to introduce a poll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax among us.</p>
            <p>The power of direct taxation will further apply to every individual: as CongreÅ¿s may tax land, cattle, trades, occupations, &amp;c. to any amount; and every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of internal taxation is of that nature, that, however oppreÅ¿Å¿ive, the people will have but this alternative, either to pay the tax, or let their property be taken, for all reÅ¿iÅ¿tence will be vain. The Å¿tanding army and Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect militia would enforce the collection.</p>
            <p>For the moderate exerciÅ¿e of this power, there is no controul left in the Å¿tate-governments, whole interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is deÅ¿troyed. No relief or redreÅ¿s of grievances can be extended, as heretofore, by them. There is not even a declaration of rights, to which the people may appeal for the vindication of their wrongs, in the courts of juÅ¿tice. They muÅ¿t, therefore, implicitly obey the moÅ¿t arbitrary laws: as the worÅ¿t of them will be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uant to the principles and form of the conÅ¿titution: and that Å¿trongeÅ¿t of all checks upon the conduct of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration, reÅ¿ponÅ¿ibility to the people, will not exiÅ¿t in this government. The permanency of the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Å¿enators and repreÅ¿entatives, and the controul the CongreÅ¿s have over their election, will place them independent of the Å¿entiments and reÅ¿entment of the people: and the adminiÅ¿tration having a greater intereÅ¿t in the government, than in the community, there will be no conÅ¿ideration to reÅ¿train them from oppreÅ¿Å¿ion and tyranny. In the government of this Å¿tate, under the old confederation, the members of the legiÅ¿lature are taken from among the people: and their intereÅ¿ts and welfare are Å¿o inÅ¿eparably connected with thoÅ¿e of their conÅ¿tituents, that they can derive no advantage from oppreÅ¿Å¿ive laws and taxes: for they would Å¿uffer in common with their fellow citizens; would partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021344_0027_0FB31F2C6C91D210"/>
in the burdens they impoÅ¿e on the community, as they muÅ¿t return to the common level after a Å¿hort period; and, notwithÅ¿tanding every exertion of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, every means of corruption, a neceÅ¿Å¿ary rotation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them from permanency in the legiÅ¿lature.</p>

               <hi>But theÅ¿e are not among the attributes of our preÅ¿ent union.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Å¿eaÅ¿on of peace too, not many years have elapÅ¿ed; and yet each of them has produced fatal examples of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, and Å¿ometimes of pointed oppoÅ¿ition to federal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. To the various remonÅ¿trances of CongreÅ¿s, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, for a gloomy, but unexaggerated narrative of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which our faith, honor, and happineÅ¿s, have Å¿uÅ¿tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the failure of the Å¿tates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But theÅ¿e evils are paÅ¿t; and Å¿ome may be led by an honeÅ¿t zeal to conclude that they cannot be repeated. Yes Å¿ir, they will be repeated as long as the confederation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿ts, and will bring with them other miÅ¿chiefs, Å¿pringing from the Å¿ame Å¿ource, which cannot be yet foreÅ¿een in their full array of terror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we examine the conÅ¿titution and laws of the Å¿everal Å¿tates, it is immediately diÅ¿covered that the law of nations is unprovided with Å¿anctions in many caÅ¿es, which deeply affect public dignity and public juÅ¿tice. The letter however of the confederation does not permit CongreÅ¿s to remedy theÅ¿e defects, and Å¿uch an authority, although evidently deducible from its Å¿pirit, cannot, without violation of the Å¿econd article, be aÅ¿Å¿umed. Is it not a political phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that the head of the confederacy Å¿hould be doomed to be plunged into war, from its wretched impotency to check offences againÅ¿t this law; and Å¿entenced to witneÅ¿s in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avaling anguiÅ¿h the infraction of their engagements to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Å¿overeigns?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And yet this is not the only grievous point of weakneÅ¿s. After a war Å¿hall be inevitable, the requiÅ¿itions of CongreÅ¿s for quotas of men or money, will again prove unproductive, and fallacious. Two cauÅ¿es will always conÅ¿pire to this baneful conÅ¿equence.</hi>
            </p>

one Å¿udden impulÅ¿e our part of the American continent has been thrown into a military poÅ¿ture, and that in the earlier annals of the war, our armies marched to the field on the mere recommendations of CongreÅ¿s. But ought we to argue from a conteÅ¿t, thus Å¿ignalized by the magnitude of its Å¿take, that as often as a flame Å¿hall be hereafter kindled, the Å¿ame enthuÅ¿iaÅ¿m will fill our legions, or renew them, as they may be filled by loÅ¿Å¿es?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If not, where Å¿hall we find protection? ImpreÅ¿Å¿ions, like thoÅ¿e, which prevent a compliance with requiÅ¿itions of regular forces, will deprive the American republic of the Å¿ervices of militia. But let us Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that they are attainable, and acknowledge, as I always Å¿hall, that they are the natural Å¿upport of a free government. When it is remembered, that in their abÅ¿ence agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muÅ¿t languiÅ¿h; that they are not habituated to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary expoÅ¿ures and the rigour of military diÅ¿cipline, and that the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of holding in readineÅ¿s Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ive detachments, carries the expence far beyond that of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿tmentsâthis reÅ¿ource ought to be adopted with caution.</p>
            <p>As Å¿trongly too am I perÅ¿uaded, that the requiÅ¿itions for money will not be more cordially received. For beÅ¿ides the diÅ¿truÅ¿t, which would prevail with reÅ¿pect to them alÅ¿o; beÅ¿ides the opinion, entertained by each Å¿tate of its own liberality and unÅ¿atisfied demands againÅ¿t the United States, there is another conÅ¿ideration, not leÅ¿s worthy of attention. The firÅ¿t rule for determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each quota the value of all lands granted or Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, and of the buildings and improvements thereon. It is no longer doubted, that an equitable, uniform mode of eÅ¿timating that value, is impracticable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore twelve Å¿tates have Å¿ubÅ¿tituted the number of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants under certain limitations, as the Å¿tandard acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But under the Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting articles of the union, the aÅ¿Å¿ent of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Å¿tate is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and has not yet been given. This does of itÅ¿elf leÅ¿Å¿en the hope of procuring a reven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AmidÅ¿t theÅ¿e diÅ¿appointments, it would afford Å¿ome conÅ¿olation, if when rebellion Å¿hall threaten any Å¿tate,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021344_0034_0FB31F39CC2C7098"/>
an ultimate aÅ¿ylum could be found under the wing of CongreÅ¿s. But it is at leaÅ¿t equivocal whether they can intrude forces into a Å¿tate, rent aÅ¿under by civil diÅ¿cord, even with the pureÅ¿t Å¿olicitude for our federal welfare, and on the moÅ¿t urgent entreaties of the Å¿tate itÅ¿elf. Nay the very allowance of this power would be pageantry alone, from the want of money and of men.</p>
            <p>To theÅ¿e defects of congreÅ¿Å¿ional power, the hiÅ¿tory of man has Å¿ubjoined others, not leÅ¿s alarming. I earneÅ¿tly pray, that the recollection of common Å¿uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which terminated in common glory, may check the Å¿allies of violence, and perpetuate mutual friendÅ¿hip between the Å¿tates. But I cannot preÅ¿ume, that we are Å¿uperior to thoÅ¿e unÅ¿ocial paÅ¿Å¿ions, which under like circumÅ¿tances have infeÅ¿ted more ancient nations. I cannot preÅ¿ume, that through all time, in the daily mixture of American citizens with each other, in the conflicts for commercial advantages, in the diÅ¿contents which the neighbourhood of territory has been Å¿een to engender in other quarters of the globe, and in the efforts of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intrigueâthirteen diÅ¿tinct communities under no effective Å¿uperintending controul (as the United States confeÅ¿Å¿edly now are, notwithÅ¿tanding the bold terms of the confederation) will avoid a hatred to each other deep and deadly.</p>
            <p>In the proÅ¿ecution of this enquiry, we Å¿hall find the general proÅ¿perity to decline under a Å¿yÅ¿tem thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerved. No Å¿ooner is the merchant prepared for fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ports, with the treaÅ¿ures which this new world kindly offers to his acceptance, than it is announced to him, that they are Å¿hut againÅ¿t American Å¿hipping, or opened under oppreÅ¿Å¿ive regulations. He urges Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿s to a counter-policy, and is anÅ¿wered only by a condolance on the general misfortune. He is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Å¿truck with the conviction, that until excluÅ¿ion Å¿hall be oppoÅ¿ed to excluÅ¿ion, and reÅ¿triction to reÅ¿triction, the American flag will be diÅ¿graced. For who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that thirteen legiÅ¿latures, viewing commerce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different regulations, and fancying themÅ¿elves diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from every obligation to concede the Å¿malleÅ¿t of their commercial advantages for the benefit of the whole, will be wrought into a concert of action and

defiance of every prejudice? Nor is this all: Let the great improvements be recounted, which have enriched and illuÅ¿trated Europe: Let it be noted, how few thoÅ¿e are, which will be abÅ¿olutely denied to the United States, comprehending within their boundaries the choiceÅ¿t bleÅ¿Å¿ings of climate, Å¿oil, and navigable waters; then let the moÅ¿t Å¿anguine patriot baniÅ¿h if he can, the mortifying belief, that all theÅ¿e muÅ¿t Å¿leep, until they Å¿hall be rouÅ¿ed by the vigour of a national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I have not exemplified the preceding remarks by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute details; becauÅ¿e they are evidently fortified by truth, and the conÅ¿ciouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the United States of America. I Å¿hall, therefore, no longer deplore the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneÅ¿s of the confederation to Å¿ecure our peace; but procced, with a truly unaffected diÅ¿truÅ¿t of my own opinions, to examine what order of powers the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States ought to enjoy? How they ought to be defended againÅ¿t encroachments? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can be interwoven in the confederation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an alteration of its very eÅ¿Å¿ence, or muÅ¿t be lodged in new hands? Shewing at the Å¿ame time the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, which Å¿eem to await us, from a diÅ¿Å¿olution of the union or partial confederacies.</p>
            <p>To mark the kind and degree of authority, which ought to be confided to the government of the United States, is no more than to reverÅ¿e the deÅ¿cription which I have already given, of the defects of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>From thence it will follow, that the operations of peace and war will be clogged without regular advances of money, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>t theÅ¿e will be Å¿low indeed, if depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on Å¿upplication alone. For what better name do requiÅ¿itions deÅ¿erve, which may be evaded or oppoÅ¿ed without the fear of coercion? But although coercion is an indiÅ¿penÅ¿able ingredient, it ought not to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againÅ¿t a Å¿tate, as a Å¿tate; it being impoÅ¿Å¿ible to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it except by blockading the trade of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, or carrying war into its bowels. Even if theÅ¿e violent Å¿chemes were eligible, in other reÅ¿pects, both of them might perhaps be defeated by the Å¿cantineÅ¿s of the public cheÅ¿t; would be tardy in their complete ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021344_0036_0FB31F3D91D300E8"/>
as the expence of the land and naval equipments muÅ¿t be firÅ¿t reimburÅ¿ed; and might drive the proÅ¿crib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Å¿tate into the deÅ¿perate reÅ¿olve of inviting foreign al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances. AgainÅ¿t each of them lie Å¿eparate unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objections. A blockade is not equally applicable to all the Å¿tates, they being differently circumÅ¿tanced in commerce and in ports; nay, an excommunication form the privilege of the union would be vain, becauÅ¿e every regulation or prohibition may be eaÅ¿ily eluded under the rights of American citizenÅ¿hip, or of foreign nations. But how Å¿hall we Å¿peak of the intruÅ¿ion of troops? Shall we arm citizens againÅ¿t citizens, and habituate them to Å¿hed kindred blood? Shall we riÅ¿que the inflicting of wounds which will generate a rancour never to be Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued? Would there be no room to fear, that an army accuÅ¿tomed to fight, for the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of authority, would Å¿alute an Emperor of their own? Let us not bring theÅ¿e things into jeopardy. Let us rather Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titute the Å¿ame proceÅ¿s by which individuals are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to contribute to the government of their own Å¿tates. InÅ¿tead of making requiÅ¿itions to the legiÅ¿latures it would appear more proper, that taxes Å¿hould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed by the federal head, under due modifications and guards; that the collectors Å¿hould demand from the citizens their reÅ¿pective quotas, and be Å¿upported as in the collection of ordinary taxes.</p>
            <p>It follows too, that, as the general government will be reÅ¿ponÅ¿ible to foreign nations, it ought to be able to annul any offenÅ¿ive meaÅ¿ure, or enforce any public right. Perhaps among the topics on which they may be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved or complain, the commercial intercourÅ¿e, and the manner in which contracts are diÅ¿charged, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titute the principal articles of clamour.</p>
            <p>It follows too, that the general government ought to be the Å¿upreme arbiter, for adjuÅ¿ting every contention among the Å¿tates. In all their connections, therefore, with each other, and particularly in commerce, which will probably create the greateÅ¿t diÅ¿cord, it ought to hold the reins.</p>
            <p>It follows too, that the general government ought to protect each Å¿tate againÅ¿t domeÅ¿tic as well as external violence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:021344_0037_0FB31F3ED4517638"/>And laÅ¿tly, it follows, that through the general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment alone, can we ever aÅ¿Å¿ume the rank to which we are entitled by our reÅ¿ources and Å¿ituation.</p>
            <p>Should the people of America Å¿urrender theÅ¿e powers, they can be paramount to the conÅ¿titutions and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary acts of legiÅ¿lation, only by being delegated by them. I do not pretend to affirm, but I venture to believe, that if the confederation had been Å¿olemnly queÅ¿tioned in oppoÅ¿ition to our conÅ¿titution, or even to one of our laws, poÅ¿terior to it, it muÅ¿t have given way. For never did it obtain a higher ratification, than a reÅ¿olution of aÅ¿Å¿embly in the daily form.</p>
            <p>This will be one Å¿ecurity againÅ¿t encroachment. But another not leÅ¿s effectual is, to exclude the individual Å¿tates from any agency in the national government, as far as it may be Å¿afe, and their interpoÅ¿ition may not be abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary.</p>
            <p>But now, Sir, permit me to declare, that in my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment, the powers by which alone the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of a general government can be accompliÅ¿hed, cannot be interwoven in the confederation, without a change in its very eÅ¿Å¿ence, or, in other words, that the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muÅ¿t be thrown aÅ¿ide. This is almoÅ¿t demonÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from the inefficacy of requiÅ¿itions, and from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity of converting them into acts of authority. My Å¿uffrage, as a citizen, is alÅ¿o for additional powers. But to whom Å¿hall we commit theÅ¿e acts of authority, theÅ¿e additional powers? To CongreÅ¿s? When I formerly lamented the defects in the juriÅ¿diction of CongreÅ¿s, I had no view to indicate any other opinion, than that the federal head ought not to be Å¿o circumÅ¿cribed. For free as I am at all times to profeÅ¿s my reverence for that body, and the individuals who compoÅ¿e it, I am yet equally free to make known my averÅ¿ion to repoÅ¿e Å¿uch a truÅ¿t in a tribunal Å¿o conÅ¿tituted. My objections are not the viÅ¿ions of theory, but the reÅ¿ult of my own obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in America, and of the experience of others abroad. 1. The legiÅ¿lative and executive are concentred in the Å¿ame perÅ¿ons. This, where real power exiÅ¿ts, muÅ¿t even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in tyranny. 2. The repreÅ¿entation of the Å¿tates bears no proportion to their importance. This is an unreaÅ¿onable Å¿ubjection of the will of the majority to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021344_0038_0FB31F404E1C51E8"/>
that of the minority. 3. The mode of election, and the liability <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>f being recalled, may too often render the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates rather partizans of their own Å¿tates than repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entatives of the Union. 4. Cabal and intrigue muÅ¿t conÅ¿equently gain an aÅ¿cendency in a courÅ¿e of years. 5. A Å¿ingle houÅ¿e of legiÅ¿lation, will Å¿ometimes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, perhaps paÅ¿Å¿ionate. 6. As long as Å¿even Å¿tates are required for the Å¿malleÅ¿t, and nine for the greateÅ¿t votes, may not Å¿o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>eign influence at Å¿ome future day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿inuate itÅ¿elf, Å¿o as to interrupt every active exertion? 7. To crown the whole, it is Å¿carce within the verge of poÅ¿Å¿ibility, that Å¿o numerous an aÅ¿Å¿embly Å¿hould acquire that Å¿ecrecy, diÅ¿patch, and vigour, which ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> the teÅ¿t of excellence in the executive department.</p>
            <p>My inference from theÅ¿e facts and principles, is, that the new powers muÅ¿t be depoÅ¿ited in a new body, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a conÅ¿olidation of the union, as far as the circumÅ¿tances of the Å¿tates will allow. Perhaps, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Å¿ome may mediate its diÅ¿Å¿olution, and others, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial confederacies.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t is an idea awful indeed, and irreconcileable with a very early, and hitherto uniform conviction, that without union, we muÅ¿t be undone. For, before the voice of war was heard, the pulÅ¿e of the then colonies was tried, and Å¿ound to beat in uniÅ¿on. The unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted labour of our enemies was to divide, and the policy of every CongreÅ¿s, to bind us together. But in no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was this truth more clearly diÅ¿played, than in the prudence with which independence was unfolded to the Å¿ight, and in the forbearance to declare it, until America almoÅ¿t unanimouÅ¿ly called for it. After we had thus launched into troubles, never before explored, and in the hour of heavy diÅ¿treÅ¿s, the remembrance of our Å¿ocial Å¿trength, not only forbade deÅ¿pair, but drew from CongreÅ¿s the moÅ¿t illuÅ¿trious repetition of their Å¿ettled purpoÅ¿e to deÅ¿piÅ¿e all terms, Å¿hort of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Behold, then, how Å¿ucceÅ¿sful and glorious we have been, while we acted in fraternal concord. But let us diÅ¿card the illuÅ¿ion, that by this Å¿ucceÅ¿s, and this glory, the creÅ¿t of danger has irrecoverably fallen. Our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are yet too youthful to have acquired Å¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021344_0039_0FB31F425330B458"/>
from habit. Our very quiet depends upon the duration of the union. Among the upright and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, few can read without emotion the future <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate of the Å¿tates, if Å¿evered from each other. Then Å¿hall we learn the full weight of foreign intrigue. Then Å¿hall we hear of partitions of our country. If a prince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the luÅ¿t of conqueÅ¿t, Å¿hould uÅ¿e one Å¿tate as the inÅ¿trument of enÅ¿laving othersâif every Å¿tate is to be wearied by perpetual alarms, and compelled to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain large military eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hmentsâif all queÅ¿tions are to be decided by an appeal to arms, where a difference of opinion cannot be removed by negociationâin a word, if all the direful misfortunes which haunt the peace of rival nations, are to triumph over the land, for what have we to contend? why have we exhauÅ¿ted our wealth? why have we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>But dreadful as the total diÅ¿Å¿olution of the union is to my mind, I entertain no leÅ¿s horror at the thought of partial confederacies. I have not the leaÅ¿t ground for Å¿uppoÅ¿ing, that an overture of this kind would be liÅ¿tened to by a Å¿ingle Å¿tate, and the preÅ¿umption is, that the politics of the greater part of the Å¿tates, flow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On Å¿uch an event, the Å¿trength of the union would be divided in two, or perhaps three parts. Has it Å¿o increaÅ¿ed Å¿ince the war as to be diviÅ¿ibleâand yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Å¿ufficient for our happineÅ¿s?</p>

               <hi>I Å¿aw, however, that the confederation was tottering from its own weakneÅ¿s, and that the Å¿itting of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a Å¿ignal of its total inÅ¿ufficiency. I was therefore ready to aÅ¿Å¿ent to a Å¿cheme of government, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed, and which went beyond the limits of the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, believing, that without being too extenÅ¿ive it would h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But when the plan which is now before the general aÅ¿Å¿embly, was on its paÅ¿Å¿age through the convention, I moved, that the Å¿tate conventions Å¿hould be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to amend, and that a Å¿econd general convention Å¿hould be holden, to diÅ¿cuÅ¿s the amendments, which Å¿hould be Å¿uggeÅ¿ted by them. This motion was in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure juÅ¿tified by the manner in which the confederation was forwarded originally, by congreÅ¿s to the Å¿tate legiÅ¿la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in many of which amendments were propoÅ¿ed, and thoÅ¿e amendments were afterwards examined in CongreÅ¿s. Such a motion was doubly expedient here as the delegation of Å¿o much more power was Å¿ought for. But it was negatived. I then expreÅ¿Å¿ed my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneÅ¿s to Å¿ign. My reaÅ¿ons were the following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is Å¿aid in the reÅ¿olutions which accompany the conÅ¿titution, that it is to be Å¿ubmitted to a convention of delegates choÅ¿en in each Å¿tate by the people thereof, for their aÅ¿Å¿ent and ratification. The meaning of theÅ¿e terms is allowed univerÅ¿ally to be, that the convention muÅ¿t either adopt the conÅ¿titution in the whole, or reject it in the whole, and is poÅ¿itively forbidden to amend. If therefore, I had Å¿igned, I Å¿hould have felt myÅ¿elf bound to be Å¿ilent as to amendments, and to endeavor to Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the conÅ¿titution without the correction of a letter. With this conÅ¿equence before my eyes, and with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to attempt an amendment, I was taught, by a regard for conÅ¿iÅ¿tency, not to Å¿ign.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My opinion always was, and Å¿till is, that every citizen of America, let the criÅ¿is be what it may, ought to have a full opportunity to propoÅ¿e, through his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿entatives, any amendment which, in his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, tends to the public welfare. By Å¿igning, I Å¿hould have contradicted this Å¿entiment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A conÅ¿titution ought to have the hearts of the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021344_0043_0FB31F494CA58C80"/>
people on its Å¿ide. But if at a future day it Å¿hould be burthenÅ¿ome after having been adopted in the whole, and they Å¿hould inÅ¿inuate that it was in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure forced upon them, by being confined to the Å¿ingle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative of taking or rejecting it altogether, under my impreÅ¿Å¿ions, and with my opinions, I Å¿hould not be able to juÅ¿tify myÅ¿elf had I Å¿igned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I was always Å¿atisfied, as I have now experienced, that this great Å¿ubject would be placed in new lights and attitudes by the criticiÅ¿m of the world, and that no man can aÅ¿Å¿ure himÅ¿elf how a conÅ¿titution will work for a courÅ¿e of years, until at leaÅ¿t he Å¿hall have heard the obÅ¿ervations of the people at large. I alÅ¿o fear more from inaccuracies in a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>Å¿titution, than from groÅ¿s er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in any other compoÅ¿ition; becauÅ¿e our deareÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿ts are to be regulated by it; and power, if looÅ¿ely given, eÅ¿pecially where it will be interpreted with great latitude, may bring Å¿orrow in its execution. Had I Å¿igned with theÅ¿e ideas, I Å¿hould have virtually Å¿hut my ears againÅ¿t the information which I ardently deÅ¿ired.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I was afraid, that if the conÅ¿titution was to be Å¿ubmitted to the people, to be wholly adopted or wholly rejected by them, they would not only reject it, but bid a laÅ¿ting farwel to the union. This formidable event I wiÅ¿hed to avert, by keeping myÅ¿elf free to propoÅ¿e amendmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>s, and thus, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, to remove the obÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to an effectual government. But it will be aÅ¿ked, whether all theÅ¿e arguments were not well weighed in convention. They were, Sir, with great candor. Nay, when I called to mind the reÅ¿pectability of thoÅ¿e, with whom I was aÅ¿Å¿ociated, I almoÅ¿t loÅ¿t confidence in theÅ¿e principles. On other occaÅ¿ions, I Å¿hould chearfully have yielded to a majority; on this, the Å¿ate of thouÅ¿ands, yet unborn, enjoined me not to yield until I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</p>
            <p>Again, may I be aÅ¿ked, why the mode pointed out in the conÅ¿titution for its amendment, may not be a Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Å¿ecurity againÅ¿t its imperfections, without now arreÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in its progreÅ¿s? My anÅ¿wers are, 1. That it is better to amend, while we have the conÅ¿titution in our power, while the paÅ¿Å¿ions of deÅ¿igning men are not yet enlifted, and while a bare majority of the Å¿tates may
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021344_0044_0FB31F4E67310908"/>
amend, than to wait for the uncertain aÅ¿Å¿ent of three fourths of the Å¿tates. 2. That a bad feature in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becomes more and more fixed every day. 3. That frequent changes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>f a conÅ¿titution, even if practicable, ought not to be wiÅ¿hed, but avoided as much as poÅ¿Å¿ible. And 4 That in the preÅ¿ent caÅ¿e, it may be queÅ¿tionable, whether, after the particular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of its operation Å¿hall be diÅ¿cerned, three fourths of the Å¿tates can be induced to amend.</p>
            <p>I confeÅ¿s, that it is no eaÅ¿y taÅ¿k, to deviÅ¿e a Å¿cheme which Å¿hall be Å¿uitable to the views of all. Many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients have occured to me, but none of them appear leÅ¿s exceptionable than this; that if our convention Å¿hould chuÅ¿e to amend, another federal convention be recommended: that in that federal convention the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments propoÅ¿ed by this or any other Å¿tate be diÅ¿cuÅ¿s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it incorporated in the conÅ¿titution or rejected, or if a proper number of the other Å¿tates Å¿hould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to accede to a Å¿econd convention, the conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be again laid before the Å¿ame Å¿tate conventions, which Å¿hall again aÅ¿Å¿emble on the Å¿ummons of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutives, and it Å¿hall be either wholly adopted, or wholly rejected, without a further power of amendment. I count Å¿uch a delay as nothing, in compariÅ¿on with Å¿o grand an object; eÅ¿pecially too as the privilege of amending muÅ¿t terminate after the uÅ¿e of it once.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hould now conclude this letter, which is already too long, were it not incumbent on me, from having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for amendments, to Å¿et forth the particulars, which I conceive to require correction. I undertake this with reluctance: becauÅ¿e it is remote from my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to catch the prejudices or prepoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions of any man. But as I mean only to manifeÅ¿t that I have not been actuated by caprice, and now to explain every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection at full length would be an immenÅ¿e labour, I Å¿hall content myÅ¿elf with enumerating certain heads, in which the conÅ¿titution is moÅ¿t repugnant to my wiÅ¿hes.</p>
            <p>The two firÅ¿t points are the equality of Å¿uffrage in the Å¿enate, and the Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion of commerce to a mere majority in the legiÅ¿lature, with no other check than the reviÅ¿ion of the preÅ¿ident. I conjecture that neither of theÅ¿e things can be corrected; and particularly the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021344_0045_0FB31F538CF517C8"/>
former, without which we muÅ¿t have riÅ¿en perhaps in diÅ¿order.</p>
            <p>But I am Å¿anguine in hoping that in every other juÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obnoxious cauÅ¿e, Virginia will be Å¿econded by a majority of the Å¿tates. I hope that Å¿he will be Å¿econded, 1. In cauÅ¿ing all ambiguities of expreÅ¿Å¿ion to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ely explained. 2. In rendering the preÅ¿ident ineligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after a given number of years. 3. In taking from him the power of nominating to the judiciary officers, or of filling up vacancies which there may happen dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the receÅ¿s of the Å¿enate, by granting commiÅ¿Å¿ions which Å¿hall expire at the end of their next Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions. 4. In taking from him the power of pardoning for treaÅ¿on at leaÅ¿t before conviction. 5. In drawing a line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the powers of CongreÅ¿s and individual Å¿tates; and in defining the former, Å¿o as to leave no claÅ¿hing of juriÅ¿dictions nor dangerous diÅ¿putes; and to prevent the one from being Å¿wallowed up by the other, under cover of general words, and implication. 6. In abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of the Å¿enate to make treaties Å¿upreme laws of the land. 8. In incapacitating the CongreÅ¿s to determine their own Å¿alaries. And 9. In limiting and defining the judicial power.</p>
            <p>The proper remedy muÅ¿t be conÅ¿igned to the wiÅ¿dom of the convention; and the final Å¿tep which Virginia Å¿hall purÅ¿ue, if her overtures Å¿hall be diÅ¿carded, muÅ¿t alÅ¿o reÅ¿t with them.</p>
            <p>You will excuÅ¿e me, Sir, for having been thus tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. My feelings and duty demanded this expoÅ¿ition; for through no other channel could I reÅ¿cue my omiÅ¿Å¿ion to Å¿ign from miÅ¿repreÅ¿entation, and no more effectual way could I exhibit to the general aÅ¿Å¿embly an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved hiÅ¿tory of my conduct.</p>

            <p>The late convention have Å¿ubmitted to your conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation a plan of a new federal government. The Å¿ubject is highly intereÅ¿ting to your future welfare. Whether it be calculated to promote the great ends of civil Å¿ocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, viz. the happineÅ¿s and proÅ¿perity of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it behoves you well to conÅ¿ider, uninfluenced by the authority of names. InÅ¿tead of that frenzy of enthuÅ¿iaÅ¿m, that has actuated the citizens of PennÅ¿ylvania, in their approbation of the propoÅ¿ed plan, before it was poÅ¿Å¿ible that it could be the reÅ¿ult of a rational inveÅ¿tigation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its principles: it ought to be diÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿ionately and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately examined, and its own intrinÅ¿ic merit, the only criterion of your patronage. If ever free and unbiaÅ¿Å¿ed diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion was proper or neceÅ¿Å¿ary, it is on Å¿uch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion. All the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of liberty and the deareÅ¿t privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of freemen, are now at Å¿take and dependent on your preÅ¿ent conduct. ThoÅ¿e who are competent to the taÅ¿k of developing the principles of governmnnt, ought to be encouraged to come forward, and thereby the better enable the people to make a proper judgment; for the Å¿cience of government is Å¿o abÅ¿trute, that few are able to judge for themÅ¿elves, without Å¿uch aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance the people are too apt to yield an implicit aÅ¿Å¿ent to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of thoÅ¿e characters, whoÅ¿e abilities are held in the higheÅ¿t eÅ¿teem, and to thoÅ¿e in whoÅ¿e integrity and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiÅ¿m they can confide; not conÅ¿idering that the love of domination is generally in proportion to talents, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and Å¿uperior acquirements; and that the men of the greateÅ¿t purity of intention may be made inÅ¿truments of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m in the hands of the artful and deÅ¿igning. If it were not for the Å¿tability and attachment which time and habit gives to forms of government, it would be in the power of the enlightened and aÅ¿piring few, if they Å¿hould combine, at any time to deÅ¿troy the beÅ¿t eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hments, and even make the people the inÅ¿truments of their own Å¿ubjugation.</p>
            <p>The late revolution having effaced in a great meaÅ¿ure all former habits, and the preÅ¿ent inÅ¿titutions are Å¿o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021344_0048_0FB31F59CD746D70"/>
that there exiÅ¿ts not that great reluctance to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Å¿o remarkable in old communities, which accords with reaÅ¿on, for the moÅ¿t comprehenÅ¿ive mind cannot forÅ¿ee the full operation of material changes on civil polity; it is the genius of the common law to reÅ¿iÅ¿t innovation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The wealthy and ambitious, who in every community think they have a right to lord it over their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have availed themÅ¿elves, very Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully, of this favourable diÅ¿poÅ¿ition; for the people thus unÅ¿ettled in their Å¿entiments, have been prepared to accede to any extreme of government; all the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es and difficulties they experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, preceeding from various cauÅ¿es, have been aÅ¿cribed to the impotency of the preÅ¿ent confederation, and thence they have been led to expect full relief from the adoption of the propoÅ¿ed Å¿yÅ¿tem of government; and in the other event, immediate ruin an annihilation as a nation. TheÅ¿e characters flatter themÅ¿elves that they have lulled all diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truÅ¿t and jealouÅ¿y of their new plan, by gaining the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the two men in whom America has the higheÅ¿t confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and now triumphantly exult in the completion of their long meditated Å¿chemes of power and aggrandiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I would be very far from inÅ¿inuating, that the two illuÅ¿trious perÅ¿onages alluded to, have not the welfare of their country at heart; but that the unÅ¿uÅ¿pecting goodneÅ¿s and zeal of the one has been impoÅ¿ed on in a Å¿ubject of which he muÅ¿t be neceÅ¿Å¿arily inexperienced, from his other arduous engagements; and that the weakneÅ¿s and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ion attendant on old age, has been practiÅ¿ed on in the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am fearful that the principles of government incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Mr. Adams's treatiÅ¿e, and enforced in the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eÅ¿Å¿ays and paragraphs in the newÅ¿papers, have miÅ¿led Å¿ome well deÅ¿igning members of the late convention. But it will appear in the Å¿equel, that the conÅ¿truction of the propoÅ¿ed plan of government is infinitely more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have been anxiouÅ¿ly expecting that Å¿ome enlightened patriot would, ere this, have taken up the pen to expoÅ¿e the Å¿utility, and counteract the baneful tendency of Å¿uch principles. Mr. Adams's</hi> fine qua non <hi>of a good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is three balancing powers, whoÅ¿e repelling qualities
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:021344_0049_0FB31F5BC763B940"/>
are to produce an equilibrium of intereÅ¿ts, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineÅ¿s of the whole community. He aÅ¿Å¿erts, that the adminiÅ¿trators of every government, will ever be actuated by views of private intereÅ¿t and ambition, to the prejudice of the public good; that therefore the only effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al method to Å¿ecure the rights of the people and promote their welfare, is to create an oppoÅ¿ition of intereÅ¿ts between the members of two diÅ¿tinct bodies, in the exerciÅ¿e of the powers of government, and balanced by thoÅ¿e of a third. This hypotheÅ¿is Å¿uppoÅ¿es human wiÅ¿dom competent to the taÅ¿k of inÅ¿tituting three co-equal orders in government, and a correÅ¿ponding weight in the community to enable them reÅ¿pectively to exerciÅ¿e their Å¿everal parts, and whoÅ¿e views and intereÅ¿ts Å¿hould be Å¿o diÅ¿tinct as to prevent a coalition of any two of them for the deÅ¿truction of the third. Mr. Adams, although he has traced the conÅ¿titution of every form of government that ever exiÅ¿ted, as far as hiÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affords materials, has not been able to adduce a Å¿ingle inÅ¿tance of Å¿uch a government; he indeed Å¿ays, that the BritiÅ¿h conÅ¿titution is Å¿uch in theory, but this is rather a confirmation that his principles are chimerical and not to be reduced to practice. If Å¿uch an organization of power were practicable, how long would it continue? not a day, for there is Å¿o great a diÅ¿parity in the talents, wiÅ¿dom, and induÅ¿try of mankind, that the Å¿cale would preÅ¿ently prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate to one or the other body, and with every acceÅ¿Å¿ion of power the means of further increaÅ¿e would be greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The Å¿tate of Å¿ociety in England is much more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to Å¿uch a Å¿cheme of government than that of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. There they have a powerful hereditary nobility, and real diÅ¿tinctions of rank and intereÅ¿ts; but even there, for want of that perfect equality of power and diÅ¿tinction of intereÅ¿ts, in the three orders of government, they exiÅ¿t but in name; the only operative and efficient check, upon the conduct of adminiÅ¿tration, is the Å¿enÅ¿e of the people at large.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SuppoÅ¿e a government could be formed and Å¿upport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Å¿uch principles, would it anÅ¿wer the great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿es of civil Å¿ociety? if the adminiÅ¿trators of every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are actuated by views of private intereÅ¿ts and ambition, how is the welfare and happineÅ¿s of the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munity to be the reÅ¿ult of Å¿uch jarring adverÅ¿e intereÅ¿ts</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:021344_0050_0FB31F5F4B778FE8"/>Therefore, as different orders in government will not produce the good of the whole, we muÅ¿t recur to other principles. I believe it will be found that the form of government, which holds thoÅ¿e intruÅ¿ted with power, in the greateÅ¿t reÅ¿ponÅ¿ibility to their conÅ¿tituents, the beÅ¿t calculated for freemen. A republican or free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, can only exiÅ¿t where the body of the people are virtuous, and where property is equally divided; in Å¿uch a government the people are the Å¿overeign, and their Å¿enÅ¿e or opinion is the criterion of every public meaÅ¿ure; for when this ceaÅ¿es to be the caÅ¿e, the nature of the government is changed, and an ariÅ¿tocracy, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or deÅ¿potiÅ¿m will riÅ¿e on its ruin. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t reÅ¿ponÅ¿ibility is to be attained, in a Å¿imple Å¿truction of government; for the great body of the people never Å¿teadily attend to the operations of government, and for want of due information are liable to be impoÅ¿ed on.â If you complicate the plan by various orders, the people will be perplexed and divided in their Å¿entiments about the Å¿ource of abuÅ¿es or miÅ¿conduct: Å¿ome will impute it to the Å¿enate, others to the houÅ¿e of repreÅ¿entatives, and Å¿o on, that the interpoÅ¿ition of the people may be rendered imperfect or perhaps wholly abortive. But if, imitating the conÅ¿titution of PennÅ¿ylvania, you veÅ¿t all the legiÅ¿lative power in one body of men (Å¿eparating the executive and judicial) elected for a Å¿hort period, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arily excluded by rotation from permanency, and guarded from precipitancy and Å¿urpriÅ¿e by delays im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed on its proceedings, you will create the moÅ¿t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reÅ¿ponÅ¿ibility, for then, whenever the people feel a grievance, they cannot miÅ¿take the authors, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the remedy with certainty and effect, diÅ¿cardin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having premiÅ¿ed thus much, I Å¿hall now proceed to the examination of the propoÅ¿ed plan of government; and I truÅ¿t Å¿hall make it appear to the meaneÅ¿t capacity, that it has none of the eÅ¿Å¿ential requiÅ¿ites of a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that it is neither founded on thoÅ¿e ballancing reÅ¿training powers, recommended by Mr. Adams and attempted in the BritiÅ¿h conÅ¿titution, or poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of

            <p>The judicial power to be veÅ¿ted in one Å¿upreme court, and in Å¿uch inferior courts as the CongreÅ¿s may from time to time ordain and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>The objects of juriÅ¿diction recited above, are Å¿o nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and the Å¿hades of diÅ¿tinction between civil cauÅ¿es are oftentimes Å¿o Å¿light, that it is more than probable that the Å¿tate judicatories would be wholly Å¿uperceded; for in conteÅ¿ts about juriÅ¿diction, the federal court, as the moÅ¿t powerful, would ever prevail. Every perÅ¿on acquainted with the hiÅ¿tory of the courts in England, knows by what ingenious Å¿ophiÅ¿ms they have, at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent periods, extended the Å¿phere of their juriÅ¿diction over objects out of the line of their inÅ¿titution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their very nature, courts of a criminal juriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction obtaining cognizance in civil cauÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>To put the omnipotency of CongreÅ¿s over the Å¿tate government and judicatories out of all doubt, the 6th article ordains, that "this conÅ¿titution and the laws of the United States, which Å¿hall be made in purÅ¿uance thereof, and all treaties made or which Å¿hall be made under the authority of the United States, Å¿hall be the Å¿upreme law of the land, and the judges in every Å¿tate Å¿hall be bound thereby, any thing in the conÅ¿titution or laws of any Å¿tate to the contrary notwithÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>

            <p>If the foregoing be a juÅ¿t commentâif the United States are to be melted down into one empire, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you to conÅ¿ider whether Å¿uch a government, however conÅ¿tructed, would be eligible in Å¿o extended a territory; and whether it would be practicable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tent with freedom? It is the opinion of the greateÅ¿t writers, that a very extenÅ¿ive country cannot be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on democratical principles, on any other plan, than a confederation of a number of Å¿mall republics, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the powers of internal government, but united in the management of their foreign and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>It would not be difficult to prove, that any thing Å¿hort of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m, could not bind Å¿o great a country under one government; and that whatever plan you might, at the firÅ¿t Å¿etting out, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, it would iÅ¿Å¿ue in a deÅ¿potiÅ¿m.</p>
            <p>If one general government could be inÅ¿tituted, and maintained on principles of freedom, it would not be Å¿o competent to attend to the various local concerns and wants of every particular diÅ¿trict; as well as the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar governments, who are near the Å¿cene, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of Å¿uperior means of information: beÅ¿ides, if the buÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the <hi>whole</hi> union is to be managed by one govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there would not be time. Do we not already Å¿ee, that the inhabitants in a number of larger Å¿tates, who are remote from the Å¿eat of government, are loudly complaining of the inconveniencies and diÅ¿advantages they are Å¿ubjected to, on this account, and that, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comforts of local government, they are Å¿eparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Å¿maller diviÅ¿ions.</p>

            <p>Thus we Å¿ee the houÅ¿e of repreÅ¿entatives are, on the part of the people, to balance the Å¿enate, who I Å¿uppoÅ¿e will be compoÅ¿ed of the <hi>better Å¿ort,</hi> the <hi>well born,</hi> &amp;c. The number of the repreÅ¿entatives (being only one for every 30,000) appears to be too few, either to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the requiÅ¿ite information, of the wants, local cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances and Å¿entiments of Å¿o extenÅ¿ive an empire, or to prevent corruption and undue influence in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e of Å¿uch great powers; the term for which they are to be choÅ¿en, too long to preÅ¿erve a due dependence and accountability to their conÅ¿tituents; and the mode and places of their election not Å¿ufficiently aÅ¿certained;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:021344_0055_0FB31F6E089B1C18"/>
for as CongreÅ¿s have the controul over both, they may govern the choice, by ordering the <hi>repreÅ¿entatives</hi> of a <hi>whole</hi> Å¿tate to be <hi>elected</hi> in <hi>one</hi> place, and that too may be the moÅ¿t <hi>inconvenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Å¿enate, the great efficient body in this plan of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is conÅ¿tituted on the moÅ¿t unequal principles. The Å¿malleÅ¿t Å¿tate in the union has equal weight with the great Å¿tates of Virginia, MaÅ¿Å¿achuÅ¿etts, or PennÅ¿yl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. The Å¿enate, beÅ¿ides its legiÅ¿lative functions, has a very conÅ¿iderable Å¿hare in the executive; none of the principal appointments to office can be made without its advice and conÅ¿ent. The term and mode of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, will lead to permanency; the members are choÅ¿en for Å¿ix years, the mode is under the controul of CongreÅ¿s, and as there is no excluÅ¿ion by rotation, they may be continued for life, which from their extenÅ¿ive means of influence, would follow of courÅ¿e. The preÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who would be a mere pageant of Å¿tate, unleÅ¿s he coincides with the views of the Å¿enate, would either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the head of the ariÅ¿tocratic junto in that body, or its minion; beÅ¿ides, their influence being the moÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, could the beÅ¿t Å¿ecure his re-election to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>And from his power of granting pardons, he might Å¿kreen from puniÅ¿hment the moÅ¿t treaÅ¿onable attempts on the liberties of the people, when inÅ¿tigated by the Å¿enate.</p>
            <p>From this inveÅ¿tigation into the organization of this government, it appears, that it is devoid of all reÅ¿ponÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or accountability to the great body of the people, and that Å¿o far from being a regular balanced govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would be, in practice, a <hi>permanent</hi> ARISTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRACY.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The framers of it, actuated by the true Å¿pirit of Å¿uch a government, which ever abominates and Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿es all free enquiry, and diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion, have made no proviÅ¿ion for the</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the preÅ¿s, <hi>that grand</hi> palladium of freedom, <hi>and</hi> Å¿courge of tyrants; <hi>but obÅ¿erved a total Å¿ilence on that head. It is the opinion of Å¿ome great writers, that if the liberty of the preÅ¿s, by an inÅ¿titution of religion, or otherwiÅ¿e, could be rendered</hi> Å¿acred <hi>even in</hi> Turkey, <hi>that deÅ¿potiÅ¿m would fly before it. And it is worthy of remark, that there is no declaration of perÅ¿onal rights, premiÅ¿ed in
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021344_0056_0FB31F6ECB63AE10"/>
moÅ¿t free conÅ¿titutions; and that the trial by</hi> jury <hi>in</hi> civil <hi>caÅ¿es is taken away; for what other conÅ¿truction can be put on the following, viz. Art.</hi> 3. <hi>Å¿ect.</hi> 2. "<hi>In all caÅ¿es affecting ambaÅ¿Å¿adors, other public miniÅ¿ters and conÅ¿uls, and thoÅ¿e in which a Å¿tate Å¿hall be a party, the Å¿upreme court Å¿hall have</hi> original <hi>juriÅ¿diction. In all the other caÅ¿es above mentioned, the Å¿upreme court Å¿hall have</hi> appellate <hi>juriÅ¿diction, both as to law and fact!" It would be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in juriÅ¿prudence, as well as evidently improper to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an appeal from the verdict of a jury, on the matter of fact; therefore it implies and allows of a diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿ion of the jury in civil caÅ¿es, and eÅ¿pecially when it is conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that jury trial in criminal caÅ¿es is expreÅ¿Å¿ly Å¿tipulated for, but not in civil caÅ¿es.</hi>

Men of an aÅ¿piring and tyrannical diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, Å¿enÅ¿ible of this truth, have ever been inimical to the preÅ¿s, and have conÅ¿idered the Å¿hackling of it, as the firÅ¿t Å¿tep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the accompliÅ¿hment of their hateful domination, and the entire Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ion of all liberty of public diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿Å¿ion, as neceÅ¿Å¿ary to its Å¿upport.

            <p>The abolition of that grand palladium of freedom, the liberty of the preÅ¿s, in the propoÅ¿ed plan of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the conduct of its authors, and patrons, is a Å¿triking exemplification of theÅ¿e obÅ¿ervations.

Whatever Å¿pecious reaÅ¿ons may be aÅ¿Å¿igned for Å¿ecrecy during the framing of the plan, no good one can exiÅ¿t, for leading the people blindfold into the implicit adoption of it.

            <p>The virtuous and Å¿pirited exertions of a few patriots, have, at length, rouÅ¿ed the people from their fatal infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, to a due Å¿enÅ¿e of the importance of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure before them. The glare and faÅ¿cination of names is rapidly abating, and the Å¿ubject begins to be canvaÅ¿Å¿ed on its own merits; and Å¿o Å¿erious and general has been the impreÅ¿Å¿ion of the objections urged againÅ¿t the new plan, on the minds of the people, that its advocates, finding mere declamation and Å¿currility will no longer avail, are reluctantly driven to defend it on the ground of argument. Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on,</hi> one of the deputies of this Å¿tate in the late convention, has found it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to come forward. From Å¿o able a lawyer, and Å¿o profound a politician, what might not be expected, if this new act of convention be the heavenly diÅ¿penÅ¿ation which Å¿ome repreÅ¿ent it. Its divinity would certainly be illuÅ¿trated by one of the principal inÅ¿truments of the Revelation; for this gentleman has that tranÅ¿cendent merit!

            <p>Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> has recourÅ¿e to the moÅ¿t Å¿limÅ¿ey Å¿ophiÅ¿try in his attempt to refute the charge that the new plan of general government will Å¿upercede and render powerleÅ¿s the Å¿tate governments.

The Å¿ame compariÅ¿on in the caÅ¿e of the BritiÅ¿h parliament aÅ¿Å¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tax the colonies, is made in the Xth of the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Letters, and was not miÅ¿underÅ¿tood in 1768 by any. He Å¿ays, that the exiÅ¿tence of the propoÅ¿ed federal plan depends on the exiÅ¿tence of the Å¿tate governments, as the Å¿enators are to be appointed by the Å¿everal legiÅ¿la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are alÅ¿o to nominate the electors who chooÅ¿e the preÅ¿ident of the United States; and that hence all fears of the Å¿everal Å¿tates being melted down into one empire, are groundleÅ¿s and imaginary.

The Å¿enate Å¿at as formerly; conÅ¿uls, tribunes, of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cenÅ¿ors and other officers, were annually choÅ¿en as before, and the forms of republican government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.

Every <hi>Å¿enatus conÅ¿ultum</hi> was dictated by him or his miniÅ¿ters, and every Roman found himÅ¿elf conÅ¿trained to Å¿ubmit in all things to the deÅ¿pot.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> aÅ¿ks, What controul can proceed from the federal government to Å¿hackle or deÅ¿troy that <hi>Å¿acred pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium</hi> of national freedom, the <hi>liberty of the preÅ¿s?</hi>" What? cannot CongreÅ¿s, when poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of the immenÅ¿e authority, propoÅ¿ed to be devolved, reÅ¿train the printers, and put them under regulation. Recollect that the omnipotence of the federal legiÅ¿lature over the Å¿tate eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hments is recognized by a Å¿pecial article, viz. "that this conÅ¿titution and the laws of the United States which Å¿hall be made in purÅ¿uance thereof, and all treaties made,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021344_0061_0FB31F79C9238DC8"/>
or which Å¿hall be made, under the authority of the United States, Å¿hall be the <hi>Å¿upreme law</hi> of the land; and the judges in every Å¿tate Å¿hall be bound thereby, any thing in the <hi>conÅ¿titutions</hi> or laws of any Å¿tate to the contrary notwithÅ¿tanding." After Å¿uch a declaration, what Å¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity does the <hi>conÅ¿titutions</hi> of the Å¿everal Å¿tates afford for <hi>the liberty of the preÅ¿s, and other invaluable perÅ¿onal rights,</hi> not provided for by the new plan? Does not this Å¿weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauÅ¿e Å¿ubject every thing to the controul of CongreÅ¿s?</p>
            <p>In the plan of confederation of 1778, now exiÅ¿ting, it was thought proper by article the 2d, to declare, that "each Å¿tate retains its Å¿overeignty, freedom and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and every power, juriÅ¿diction and right, which is not by this confederation expreÅ¿sly delegated to the United States in CongreÅ¿s aÅ¿Å¿embled." <hi>PoÅ¿itive</hi> grant was not <hi>then</hi> thought Å¿ufficiently deÅ¿criptive and reÅ¿train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon CongreÅ¿s, and the omiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿uch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>now,</hi> when Å¿uch great devolutions of power are propoÅ¿ed, manifeÅ¿ts the deÅ¿ign of reducing the Å¿everal Å¿tates to Å¿hadows. But Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> tells you that every right and power not Å¿pecially granted to CongreÅ¿s is conÅ¿idered as withheld. How does this appear? Is this principle eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by the proper authority? Has the convention made Å¿uch a Å¿tipulation? By no means. Quite the reverÅ¿e; the laws of CongreÅ¿s are to be "the <hi>Å¿upreme law</hi> of the land, any thing in the <hi>conÅ¿titutions</hi> or laws of any Å¿tate to the contrary notwithÅ¿tanding," and conÅ¿equently, would be <hi>paramount</hi> to all Å¿tate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. The luÅ¿t of power is Å¿o univerÅ¿al, that a Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative unaÅ¿certained rule of conÅ¿truction would be a <hi>poor</hi> Å¿ecurity for the liberties of the people.</p>
            <p>Such a body as the intended CongreÅ¿s, unleÅ¿s parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inhibited and reÅ¿trained, muÅ¿t graÅ¿p at omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and before long Å¿wallow up the legiÅ¿lative, the executive, and the judicial powers of the Å¿everal Å¿tates.</p>
            <p>In addition to the reÅ¿pectable authorities quoted in my firÅ¿t number, to Å¿hew that the right of <hi>taxation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the powers of government, I beg leave to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Farmer's Letters, Å¿ee particularly letter 9th, in which Mr. DickenÅ¿on has clearly proved, that if the BritiÅ¿h parliament aÅ¿Å¿umed the power of taxing the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, <hi>internally,</hi> as well as <hi>externally,</hi> and it Å¿hould be
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021344_0062_0FB31F7AC9A17058"/>
Å¿ubmitted to, the Å¿everal colony legiÅ¿latures would Å¿oon become contemptible, and before long fall into diÅ¿uÅ¿e. Nothing, Å¿ays he, would be left for them to do, higher than to frame bye-laws for empounding of cattle, or the yoking of hogs.</p>
            <p>By the propoÅ¿ed plan, there are divers caÅ¿es of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial authority to be given to the courts of the United States, beÅ¿ides the two mentioned by Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on.</hi> In maritime cauÅ¿es about property, jury trial has not been uÅ¿ual; but in Å¿uits in <hi>equity,</hi> with all due deference to Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on's</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿ional abilities (which he calls to his aid) jury trial, as to facts, is in full exerciÅ¿e. Will this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿peritus Å¿ay, that if the queÅ¿tion in equity Å¿hould be, did <hi>John Doe</hi> make a will, that the chancellor of England would decide upon it? He well knows, that in this caÅ¿e, there being no mode of jury trial before the chancellor, the queÅ¿tion would be referred to the court of king's bench for diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion according to the common law, and when the judge in equity Å¿hould receive the verdict, the fact Å¿o eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, could never be re-examined or controverted. Maritime cauÅ¿es, and thoÅ¿e appertaining to a court of equity, are, however, but <hi>two</hi> of the many and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ive Å¿ubjects of federal cognizance mentioned in the plan. This juriÅ¿diction will embrace all Å¿uits ariÅ¿ing under the laws of impoÅ¿t, exciÅ¿e, and other revenue of the United States. In England, if goods be Å¿eized, if a Å¿hip be proÅ¿ecuted for non-compliance with, or breach of the laws of the cuÅ¿toms, or thoÅ¿e for regulating trade, in the court of exchequer, the claimant is Å¿ecured of the tranÅ¿cendant privilege of EngliÅ¿hmen, <hi>trial by a jury of his peers.</hi> Why not in the United States of America? This juriÅ¿diction alÅ¿o goes to all caÅ¿es under the laws of the United States, that is to Å¿ay, under all Å¿tatutes and ordinances of CongreÅ¿s. How far this may extend, it is eaÅ¿y to foreÅ¿ee; for upon the decay of the Å¿tate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of legiÅ¿lation, in conÅ¿equence of the loÅ¿s of the <hi>purÅ¿e Å¿trings,</hi> it will be found neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the federal legiÅ¿la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make laws upon every Å¿ubject of legiÅ¿lation.â Hence the Å¿tate courts of juÅ¿tice, like the barony and hundred courts of England, will be eclipÅ¿ed, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually fall into diÅ¿uÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>The juriÅ¿diction of the federal court goes, likewiÅ¿e, to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021344_0063_0FB31F865F2DAC98"/>
the laws to be created by treaties made by the preÅ¿ident and Å¿enate (a Å¿pecies of legiÅ¿lation) with other nations; 'to all caÅ¿es affecting foreign miniÅ¿ters and conÅ¿uls; to controverÅ¿ies wherein the United States Å¿hall be a party; to controverÅ¿ies between citizens of different Å¿tates," as when an inhabitant of <hi>New-York</hi> has a demand on an inhabitant of <hi>New-JerÅ¿ey.</hi> This laÅ¿t is a very invidious juriÅ¿diction, implying an improper diÅ¿truÅ¿t of the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and juÅ¿tice of the tribunals of the Å¿tates. It will include all legal debates between foreigners in Britain or elÅ¿ewhere, and the people of this country. A rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on hath been aÅ¿Å¿igned for it, viz. "That large tracts of land, in neighbouring Å¿tates, are claimed under royal or other grants, diÅ¿puted by the Å¿tates where the lands lie, Å¿o that juÅ¿tice cannot be expected from the Å¿tate tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals." SuppoÅ¿e it were proper indeed to provide for Å¿uch caÅ¿e, why include all caÅ¿es, and for all time to come? Demands as to lands for 21 years would have Å¿atisfied this. A London merchant Å¿hall come to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and Å¿ue for his Å¿uppoÅ¿ed debt, and the citizen of this country Å¿hall be deprived of jury trial, and Å¿ubjected to an appeal (though nothing but the <hi>fact</hi> is diÅ¿puted) to a court 500 or 1000 miles from home; when if this American has a claim upon an inhabitant of England, his adverÅ¿ary is Å¿ecured of the privilege of jury trial. This juriÅ¿diction goes alÅ¿o to controverÅ¿ies between any Å¿tate and its citizens, which though probably not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may hereafter be Å¿et up as a ground to diveÅ¿t the Å¿tates, Å¿everally, of the trial of criminals; inaÅ¿much as every charge of felony and miÅ¿demeanour, is a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿y between a Å¿tate and the citizens of the Å¿ame: that is to Å¿ay, the Å¿tate is plaintiff, and the party accuÅ¿ed is defendant in the proÅ¿ecution. In all debts about juriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, as was obÅ¿erved before, the paramount courts of CongreÅ¿s will decide, and the judges of the Å¿tate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Å¿ub graviore lege,</hi> under the paramount law, muÅ¿t acquieÅ¿ce.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> Å¿ays, that it would have been impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have made a general rule for jury trial in the civil caÅ¿es aÅ¿Å¿igned to the federal judiciary, becauÅ¿e of the want of uniformity in the mode of jury trial as practiÅ¿ed by the Å¿everal Å¿tates. This objection proves
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021344_0064_0FB31F8937BE7260"/>
too much, and therefore amounts to nothing. If it precludes the mode of common law in civil caÅ¿es, it certainly does in criminal. Yet in theÅ¿e we are told, "the oppreÅ¿Å¿ion of government is effectually barred, by declaring, that in all criminal caÅ¿es <hi>trial by jury</hi> Å¿hall be preÅ¿erved." AÅ¿toniÅ¿hing, that proviÅ¿ion could not be made for a jury in civil controverÅ¿ies, of 12 men, whoÅ¿e verdict Å¿hould be unanimous, <hi>to be taken from the vicinage;</hi> a precaution which is omitted as to trial of crimes, which may be any where in the Å¿tate within which they have been committed. So that an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of <hi>Kentucky</hi> may be tried for treaÅ¿on at <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The abolition of jury trial in civil caÅ¿es, is the more conÅ¿iderable, as at length the courts of CongreÅ¿s will Å¿uperÅ¿ede the Å¿tate courts, when Å¿uch mode of trial will fall into diÅ¿uÅ¿e among the people of the United States.</p>
            <p>The northern nations of the European continent, have all loÅ¿t this invaluable privilege: <hi>Sweden,</hi> the laÅ¿t of them, by the artifices of the <hi>ariÅ¿tocratic</hi> Å¿enate, which depreÅ¿Å¿ed the king, and reduced the houÅ¿e of commons to inÅ¿ignificance. But the nation, a few years ago, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the abÅ¿olute authority of a monarch to the <hi>vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> domination of the <hi>well-born</hi> few, an end was Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly put to their power</p>
            <p>"The policy of this right of juries (Å¿ays judge Black-Å¿tone) to decide upon <hi>fact,</hi> is founded on this: that if the power of judging were entirely truÅ¿ted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿trates, or any Å¿elect body of men named by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive authority, their deciÅ¿ions, in Å¿pite of their own natural integrity, would have a bias towards thoÅ¿e of their own rank and dignity; for it is not to be expected, that the <hi>few</hi> Å¿hould be attentive to the rights of the many. This, therefore, preÅ¿erves in the hands of the people, that Å¿hare which they ought to have in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration of juÅ¿tice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens."</p>
            <p>The attempt of governor <hi>Colden,</hi> of New-York, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the revolution, to re-examine the <hi>facts,</hi> and to re-conÅ¿ider the <hi>damages,</hi> in the caÅ¿e of <hi>ForÅ¿ey</hi> againÅ¿t <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> produced, about the year 1764, a flame of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic and Å¿ucceÅ¿sful oppoÅ¿ition, that will not be eaÅ¿ily forgotten</p>

               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:021344_0065_0FB31F8B00BED778"/>To manage the various and extenÅ¿ive judicial autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, propoÅ¿ed to be veÅ¿ted in CongreÅ¿s, there will be one or more inferior courts immediately requiÅ¿ite in each Å¿tate; and laws and regulations muÅ¿t be forthwith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to direct the judges; here is a wide door for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to enter. Contracts made under the acts of the Å¿tates reÅ¿pectively, will come before courts acting under new laws and new modes of proceeding, not thought of when they were entered into. An inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of PennÅ¿ylvania, reÅ¿iding at Pittsburgh, finds the goods of his debtor, who reÅ¿ides in Virginia, within the reach of his attachment; but no writ can be had to authoriÅ¿e the marÅ¿hal, Å¿heriff, or other officer of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿s to Å¿eize the property about to be removed, nearer than 200 miles: Å¿uppoÅ¿e that at CarliÅ¿le, for inÅ¿tance, Å¿uch a writ may be had, mean while the object eÅ¿capes. Or if an inferior court, whoÅ¿e judges have ample Å¿ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in every county, would not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence be enormous? Every reader can extend in his imagination, the inÅ¿tances of difficulty which would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from this needleÅ¿s interference with the judicial rights of the Å¿eparate Å¿tates, and which, as much as any other circumÅ¿tance in the new plan, implies that the diÅ¿Å¿olution of their forms of government is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> Å¿kips very lightly over the danger appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended from the Å¿tanding army allowed by the new plan. This grand machine of power and oppreÅ¿Å¿ion may be made a fatal inÅ¿trument to overturn the public liberties, eÅ¿pecially as the funds to Å¿upport the troops may be granted for <hi>two</hi> years, whereas in Britain, the grants ever Å¿ince the revolution in 1688, have been <hi>from year to year.</hi> A Å¿tanding army with regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion of pay and contingencies, would afford a Å¿trong temptation to Å¿ome ambitious man to Å¿tep up into the throne, and to Å¿eize abÅ¿olute power. The keeping on foot a hired military force <hi>in time of peace,</hi> ought not to be gone into, unleÅ¿s <hi>two thirds</hi> of the members of the federal legiÅ¿lature agree to the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of the meaÅ¿ure, and adjuÅ¿t the numbers employed. Surely Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> is not Å¿erious when he adduces the inÅ¿tance of the troops now Å¿tationed on the Ohio as a proof of the propriety
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021344_0066_0FB31F8C0AFD0CA0"/>
of a Å¿tanding army. They are a mere occaÅ¿ional ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament for the purpoÅ¿e of reÅ¿training divers hoÅ¿tile tribes of Å¿avages. It is contended, that under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent confederation, CongreÅ¿s poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s the power of raiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies at pleaÅ¿ure; but the opportunity which the Å¿tates Å¿everally have of withholding the Å¿upplies neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary to keep theÅ¿e armies on foot, is a Å¿ufficient check on the <hi>preÅ¿ent</hi> CongreÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> aÅ¿Å¿erts, that never was charge made with leÅ¿s reaÅ¿on, than that which predicts the inÅ¿titution of a <hi>baneful ariÅ¿tocracy</hi> in the federal Å¿enate. In my firÅ¿t number, I Å¿tated, that this body would be a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal repreÅ¿entation of the Å¿everal Å¿tates, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being appointed for the long term of Å¿ix years, and there being no excluÅ¿ion by rotation, they might be continued for life, which would follow of courÅ¿e from their extenÅ¿ive means of influence, and that poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing a conÅ¿iderable Å¿hare in the <hi>executive</hi> as well as <hi>legiÅ¿lative,</hi> it would become a <hi>paramount ariÅ¿tocracy,</hi> and Å¿wallow up the other orders in the government.</p>
            <p>That theÅ¿e fears are not imaginary, a knowledge of the hiÅ¿tory of other nations, where the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have been injudiciouÅ¿ly placed, will fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monÅ¿trate. Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> Å¿ays, "the Å¿enate branches into two characters; the one legiÅ¿lative and the other execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. In its legiÅ¿lative character it can effect no purpoÅ¿e without the co-operation of the houÅ¿e of repreÅ¿entatives, and in its executive character it can accompliÅ¿h no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject without the concurrence of the preÅ¿ident. Thus fettered, I do not know any act which the Å¿enate can of itÅ¿elf perform, and Å¿uch dependence neceÅ¿Å¿arily precludes every idea of influence and Å¿uperiority." This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿s is very Å¿pecious, but experience demonÅ¿trates, that checks in government, unleÅ¿s accompanied with <hi>ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi> power, and <hi>independently</hi> placed, prove <hi>merely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,</hi> and will be <hi>inoperative.</hi> Is it probable, that the preÅ¿ident of the United States, limited as he is in power, and dependent on the will of the Å¿enate, in appointments to office, will either have the firmneÅ¿s or inclination to exerciÅ¿e his prerogative of a conditional controul upon the proceedings of that body, however injurious they may be to the public welfare: it will be his intereÅ¿t to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021344_0067_0FB31F918488C440"/>
coincide with the views of the Å¿enate, and thus become the head of the ariÅ¿tocratic junto. The king of England is a conÅ¿tituent part of the legiÅ¿lature, but although an hereditary monarch, in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the whole executive power, including the unreÅ¿trained appointment to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and an immenÅ¿e revenue, enjoys but in <hi>name</hi> the prerogative of a negative upon the parliament. Even the king of England, circumÅ¿tanced as he is, has not dared to exerciÅ¿e it for near a century paÅ¿t. The check of the houÅ¿e of repreÅ¿entatives upon the Å¿enate will likewiÅ¿e be rendered nugatory for want of due weight in the democratic branch, and from their conÅ¿titution, <hi>they</hi> may become Å¿o <hi>independent</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> as to be indifferent of its intereÅ¿ts: nay, as CongreÅ¿s would have the controul over the mode and place of their election, by ordering the repreÅ¿entatives of a <hi>whole</hi> Å¿tate to be elected at <hi>one</hi> place, and that too the moÅ¿t <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,</hi> the ruling power may govern the <hi>choice,</hi> and thus the houÅ¿e of repreÅ¿entatives may be compoÅ¿ed of the <hi>creatures</hi> of the Å¿enate. Still the <hi>Å¿emblance</hi> of checks, may remain, but without <hi>operation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This mixture of the legiÅ¿lative and executive more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over highly tends to corruption. The chief improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in government, in modern times, has been the complete Å¿eparation of the great diÅ¿tinctions of power; placing the <hi>legiÅ¿lative</hi> in different hands from thoÅ¿e which hold the <hi>executive;</hi> and again Å¿evering the <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> part from the ordinary <hi>adminiÅ¿trative.</hi> "When the legiÅ¿lative and executive powers (Å¿ays MonteÅ¿quieu) are united in the Å¿ame perÅ¿on, or in the Å¿ame body of magiÅ¿trates, there can be no liberty."</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿es himÅ¿elf nor Å¿atisfied with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of the federal Å¿enate, and apologizes for it, by alledging a Å¿ort of compromiÅ¿e. It is well known that Å¿ome members of convention, apprized of the miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of Å¿uch a compound of authority, propoÅ¿ed to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ign the Å¿upreme executive powers to the preÅ¿ident and a Å¿mall council, made perÅ¿onally reÅ¿ponÅ¿ible for every appointment to office, or other act by having their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions recorded; and that without the concurrence of the majority of the quorum of this council, the preÅ¿ident Å¿hould not be capable of taking any Å¿tep. Such a check
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021344_0068_0FB31F9443A891B8"/>
upon the chief magiÅ¿trate would admirably Å¿ecure the power of pardoning, now propoÅ¿ed to be exerciÅ¿ed by the preÅ¿ident alone, from abuÅ¿e. For as it is placed, he may Å¿helter the traitors whom he himÅ¿elf, or his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutors in the Å¿enate, have excited to plot againÅ¿t the liberties of the nation.</p>
            <p>The delegation of the power of taxation to CongreÅ¿s as far as duties on imported commodities, has not been objected to. But to extend this to exciÅ¿es, and every Å¿pecies to internal taxation, would neceÅ¿Å¿arily require Å¿o many ordinances of CongreÅ¿s, affecting the body of the people, as would perpetually interfere with the Å¿tate laws and perÅ¿onal concerns of the people. This alone would directly tend to annihilate the particular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the people, fatigued with the operations of two maÅ¿ters, would be apt to rid themÅ¿elves of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But we are cautioned againÅ¿t being alarmed with imaginary evils, for Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> has predicted that the great revenue of the United States, will be raiÅ¿ed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿t. Is there any ground for this? Will the impoÅ¿ts Å¿upply the Å¿ums neceÅ¿Å¿ary to pay the intereÅ¿t and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the foreign loan, to defray the great additional expence of the new conÅ¿titution; for the policy of the new government will lead it to inÅ¿titute numerous and lucrative civil offices, to extend its influenee and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Å¿warms of expectants, the people having in fact no controul upon their disburÅ¿ements, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford pay and Å¿upport the Å¿uppoÅ¿ed Å¿tanding army, that darling and long wiÅ¿hed for object of the <hi>well born</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; and which, if we may judge from the principles of the intended government, will be no trifling eÅ¿tab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hment, for cantonments of troops in every diÅ¿trict of America, will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to compel the Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion of the people to the arbitrary dictates of the ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? I Å¿ay will the impoÅ¿t be adequate? By no means. To anÅ¿wer theÅ¿e there muÅ¿t be exciÅ¿es and other indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect duties impoÅ¿ed, and as land taxes will operate too unequally to be agreeable to the wealthy ariÅ¿trocracy in the Å¿enate who will be poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of the government, <hi>poll taxes</hi> will be Å¿ubÅ¿tituted as provided for in the new plan for the doctrine then will be, <hi>that Å¿laves ought to pay for wearing their heads.</hi>

               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:021344_0069_0FB31F95184EE680"/>As the taxes neceÅ¿Å¿ary for theÅ¿e purpoÅ¿es, will drain your pockets of every penny, what is to become of that virtuous and meritorious claÅ¿s of citizens the public creditors. However well diÅ¿poÅ¿ed the people of the United States may be to do them juÅ¿tice, it would not be in their power: and, <hi>after waiting year after year,</hi> without proÅ¿pect of the payment of the intereÅ¿t or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the debt, they will be conÅ¿trained to Å¿acrifice their certificates in the purchaÅ¿e of waÅ¿te lands in the diÅ¿tant wilds of the weÅ¿tern territory.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing illuÅ¿tration of the powers to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to CongreÅ¿s, it is evident that the general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would neceÅ¿Å¿arily annihilate the particular governments, and that the Å¿ecurity of the perÅ¿onal rights of the people by the Å¿tate conÅ¿titutions is Å¿uperceded and deÅ¿troyed; hence reÅ¿ults the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿uch Å¿ecurity being provided for by a bill of rights to be inÅ¿erted in the new plan of federal government.

monopolies in trade or arts, other than to authors of books or inventors of uÅ¿eful arts, for a reaÅ¿onable time, ought not to be Å¿uffered; that the right of the people to aÅ¿Å¿emble peaceably for the purpoÅ¿e of conÅ¿ult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about public matters, and petitioning or remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trating to the federal legiÅ¿lature ought not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; that <hi>the liberty of the preÅ¿s be holden Å¿acred;</hi> that the people have a right to hold themÅ¿elves, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, papers, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, free from Å¿earch or Å¿eized; and that therefore warrants, without oaths or affirmations firÅ¿t made, affording a Å¿ufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or meÅ¿Å¿enger may be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or required to Å¿earch Å¿uÅ¿pected places, or to Å¿eize any perÅ¿on or his property, not particularly deÅ¿cribed, are contrary to that right and ought not to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that Å¿tanding armies in time of peace are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to liberty, and ought not to be permitted but when abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary; all which is omitted to be done in the propoÅ¿ed government.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on</hi> Å¿ays, the new plan does not arrogate perfection, for it provides a mode of alteration and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if found neceÅ¿Å¿ary. This is one among the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous deceptions attempted on this occaÅ¿ion. True there is a mode preÅ¿cribed for this purpoÅ¿e. But it is barely poÅ¿Å¿ible that amendments may be made. The faÅ¿cination of power muÅ¿t firÅ¿t ceaÅ¿e, the nature of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind undergo a revolution, that is not to be expected on this Å¿ide of eternity. For to effect this (Art. 9.) it is provided, that if <hi>two thirds</hi> of both houÅ¿es of the federal legiÅ¿lature Å¿hall propoÅ¿e them; or when two thirds of the Å¿everal Å¿tates, by their legiÅ¿latures, Å¿hall apply for them the federal aÅ¿Å¿embly Å¿hall call a convention for propoÅ¿ing amendments, which when ratified by three-fourths of the Å¿tate legiÅ¿latures, or conventions, as CongreÅ¿s Å¿hal Å¿ee beÅ¿t, Å¿hall controul and alter the propoÅ¿ed confede<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration. Does hiÅ¿tory abound with examples of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary relinquiÅ¿hment of power, however injurious to the community? No; it would require a general and Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿sful riÅ¿ing of the people to effect any thing of this nature.âThis proviÅ¿ion therefore is more Å¿ound.</p>
            <p>The oppoÅ¿ition of the new plan (Å¿ays Mr. <hi>WiÅ¿on</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from intereÅ¿ted men, viz. the officers of the Å¿tate

governments. He had before denied that the propoÅ¿ed tranfer of powers to CongreÅ¿s would annihilate the Å¿tate governments. But he here lays aÅ¿ide the maÅ¿que and avows the fact.

It will be the misfortune of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to add to the number of examples of this kind, if the propoÅ¿ed plan of government Å¿hould be adopted; but I truÅ¿t, Å¿hort as the time allowed you for conÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, you will be Å¿o fully convinced of the truth of this, as to eÅ¿cape the impending danger; it is only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿trip the monÅ¿ter of its aÅ¿Å¿umed garb, and to exhibit it in its native colours, to excite the univerÅ¿al ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and rejection of every virtuous and patriotic mind.</p>
            <p>For the Å¿ake of my dear country, for the honour of human nature, I hope, and am perÅ¿uaded, the good Å¿enÅ¿e of the people will enable them to riÅ¿e Å¿uperior to the moÅ¿t formidable conÅ¿piracy againÅ¿t the liberties of a free and enlightened nation, that the world has ever witneÅ¿Å¿ed.

            <p>The eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of a government, is a Å¿ubject of Å¿uch momentous and laÅ¿ting concern, that it Å¿hould not be gone into without the cleareÅ¿t conviction of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; which can only be the reÅ¿ult of the fulleÅ¿t diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿Å¿ion, the moÅ¿t thorough inveÅ¿tigation and diÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿ionate conÅ¿ideration of its nature, principles, and conÅ¿truction. You are now called upon to make this deciÅ¿ion, which involves in it, not only your fate, but that of your poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity for ages to come. Your determination will either enÅ¿ure the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of thoÅ¿e bleÅ¿Å¿ings, which render life deÅ¿irable, or entail thoÅ¿e evils which make exiÅ¿tence a curÅ¿e: that Å¿uch are conÅ¿equences of a wiÅ¿e or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per organization of government, the hiÅ¿tory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind abundantly teÅ¿tifies. If you viewed the magnitude of the object in its true light, you would join with me in Å¿entiment, that the new government ought not to be implicitly admitted. ConÅ¿ider then, duly, before you

leap, for after the Rubicon is once paÅ¿Å¿ed, there will be no retreat.</p>
            <p>If you were even well aÅ¿Å¿ured, that the utmoÅ¿t purity of intention predominated in the production of the propoÅ¿ed government, Å¿uch is the imperfection of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiÅ¿dom and knowledge, that it would not be wiÅ¿e in you to adopt it with precipitation <hi>in toto,</hi> for all former experience muÅ¿t teach you the propriety of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion on Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions, to correct the errors, and Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the deficiencies that may appear neceÅ¿Å¿ary. In every government, whoÅ¿e object is the public welfare, the laws are Å¿ubjected to repeated reviÅ¿ions, in Å¿ome by different orders in the government, in others by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the judgments of the people, and deliberative forms of procedure. A knowledge of this, as well as of other Å¿tates, will Å¿hew, that if every inÅ¿tance where a law has been paÅ¿Å¿ed without the uÅ¿ual precautions, it has been productive of great inconvenience and evils, and frequently has not anÅ¿wered the end in view, a Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement becoming neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿upply its deficiencies.</p>
            <p>What then are we to think of the motives and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igns of thoÅ¿e men who are urging the implicit and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate adoption of the propoÅ¿ed government? Are they fearful, that if you exerciÅ¿e your good Å¿enÅ¿e and diÅ¿cernment, you will diÅ¿cover the maÅ¿qued ariÅ¿tocracy that they are attempting to Å¿muggle upon you, under the Å¿uÅ¿picious garb of republicaniÅ¿m? When we find that the principal agents in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, are the very men who fabricated the form of government, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be concluÅ¿ive evidence of their ins;idious deÅ¿ign to deprive us of our liberties. The circumÅ¿tances attending this matter, are Å¿uch as Å¿hould in a peculiar manner excite your Å¿uÅ¿picion; it might not be uÅ¿eleÅ¿s to take a review of Å¿ome of them.</p>

Experience having Å¿hewn great defects in the preÅ¿ent confederatian, particularly in the regulating of commerce and maritime affairs, it became the univerÅ¿al wiÅ¿h of America to grant further powers, Å¿o as to make the federal government adequate to the ends of its inÅ¿titution. The anxiety on this head was greatly increaÅ¿ed, from the impoveriÅ¿hment and diÅ¿treÅ¿s occaÅ¿ioned by the extenÅ¿ive importations of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign merchandize and luxuries, and conÅ¿equent drain of Å¿pecie Å¿ince the peace: thus the people were in the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of a drowning man, eager to catch at any thing that promiÅ¿ed relief, however deluÅ¿ory. Such an opportunity for the acquiÅ¿ition of <hi>undue</hi> power, has never been viewed with indifference by the ambitious and deÅ¿igning in any age or nation, and it has accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly been too Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully improved by Å¿uch men among us. The deputies from this Å¿tate (with the exception of two) and moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e from the other Å¿tates in the union were unfortunately of this complexion, and many of them of Å¿uch Å¿uperior endowments, that in an <hi>ex parte</hi> diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of the Å¿ubject, by Å¿pecious gloÅ¿Å¿es, they have gained the concurrence of Å¿ome well-diÅ¿poÅ¿ed men in whom their country have great confidence, which has given great Å¿anction to their Å¿cheme of power.</p>

Thus CaeÅ¿ar, when he Å¿eized the Roman liberties, cauÅ¿ed himÅ¿elf to be choÅ¿en dictator (which was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient office) continued the Å¿enate, the conÅ¿uls, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, the cenÅ¿ors, and all other offices and forms of the commonwealth; and yet changed Rome from the moÅ¿t free, to the moÅ¿t tyrannical government in the world.</p>
            <p>The convention, after veÅ¿ting all the great and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent powers of Å¿overeignty in the general government, inÅ¿idiouÅ¿ly declared, by Å¿ection 4th of article 4th, "that the United States Å¿hall guarantee to every Å¿tate in this union, a republican form of government;" but of what avail will be the <hi>form</hi> without the <hi>reality</hi> of freedom?</p>
            <p>The late convention, in the majeÅ¿ty of its aÅ¿Å¿umed omnipotence, have not even condeÅ¿cended to Å¿ubmit the plan of the new government to the conÅ¿ideration of the people, the true Å¿ource of authority, but have called upon them by their Å¿everal conventions, "to aÅ¿Å¿ent to, and ratify"<note n="*" place="bottom">See a reÅ¿olution of Convention accompanying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument of the propoÅ¿ed government.</note>

            <p>THAT the preÅ¿ent confederation is inadequate to the objects of the union, Å¿eems to be univerÅ¿ally allowed. The only queÅ¿tion is, what additional powers are wanting to give due energy to the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? We Å¿hould, however, be careful in forming our opinions on this Å¿ubject, not to impute the temporary and extraordinary difficulties that have hitherto impeded the execution of the confederation, to defects in the Å¿yÅ¿tem itÅ¿elf. Taxation is, in every government, a very delicate and difficult Å¿ubject; hence it has been the policy of all wiÅ¿e Å¿tateÅ¿men, as far as circumÅ¿tances permitted, to lead the people by Å¿mall beginnings, and almoÅ¿t imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible degrees; into the habits of taxation; where the contrary conduct has been purÅ¿ued, it has ever fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of full Å¿ucceÅ¿s, not unfrequently proving the ruin of the projectors. The impoÅ¿ing of a burdenÅ¿ome tax at once on a people, without the uÅ¿ual gradations, is the Å¿evereÅ¿t teÅ¿t that any government can be put to; deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiÅ¿m it Å¿elf has often prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this Å¿itua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs, we Å¿till had the Å¿ame powerful enemy to contend with, who had even more numerous and better appointed armies in the field, than at any former time. Our allies were applied to in this exigence, but the pecuniary aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance that we could procure from them, was Å¿oon exhauÅ¿ted; the only reÅ¿ource now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, was to obtain by direct taxation, the monies neceÅ¿Å¿ary for our defence; the hiÅ¿tory of mankind does not furniÅ¿h a Å¿imilar inÅ¿tance of an attempt to levy Å¿uch enormous taxes at once, of a people Å¿o wholly unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we review the proceedings of the Å¿tates, we Å¿hall find that they gave every Å¿anction and authority to the requiÅ¿itions of CongreÅ¿s, that their
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:021344_0084_0FB31D5C54EC1058"/>
laws could confer; that they attempted to collect the Å¿ums called for, in the Å¿ame manner as is propoÅ¿ed to be done in future by the general government, inÅ¿tead of the Å¿tate legiÅ¿latures.</p>
            <p>It is a maxim, that a government ought to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious not to govern over much, for when the cord of power is drawn too tight, it generally proves its deÅ¿truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the impracticability of complying with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions of CongreÅ¿s has leÅ¿Å¿ened the Å¿enÅ¿e of obligation and duty in the people, and thus weakened the ties of the union; the opinion of power in a free government is much more efficacious than the exerciÅ¿e of it; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the maturity of time and repeated practice to give it due energy and certainty to the operations of government, eÅ¿pecially to Å¿uch as affect the purÅ¿es of the people.</p>
            <p>The thirteen SwiÅ¿s Cantons confederated by more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and weaker ties than theÅ¿e United States are by the preÅ¿ent articles of confederation, have not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿trengthening their union by veÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their general diet with further or greater powers; this national body has only the management of their foreign concerns, and in caÅ¿e of a war can onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am perÅ¿uaded, that a due conÅ¿ideration will evince, that the preÅ¿ent inefficacy of the requiÅ¿itions of CongreÅ¿s is not owing to a defect in the confederation, but the peculiar circumÅ¿tances of the times.</p>
            <p>The wheels of the general government having been thus clogged, and the arrearages of taxes Å¿till accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, it may be aÅ¿ked what proÅ¿pect is there of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment reÅ¿uming its proper tone, unleÅ¿s more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulÅ¿ory powers are granted? To this it may be anÅ¿wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the produce of impoÅ¿ts on commerce which all agree to veÅ¿t in CongreÅ¿s, together with the immenÅ¿e tracts of land at their diÅ¿poÅ¿al, will rapidly leÅ¿Å¿en and eventually diÅ¿charge the preÅ¿ent incumbrances; when
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021344_0085_0FB31D5D98ECD048"/>
this takes place, the mode by requiÅ¿ition will be found perfectly adequate to the extraordinary exigencies of the union. CongreÅ¿s have lately Å¿old land to the amount of eight millions of dollars, which is a conÅ¿iderable portion of the whole debt.</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented that the intereÅ¿ted and deÅ¿igning have availed themÅ¿elves Å¿o Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully of the preÅ¿ent criÅ¿is, and under the Å¿pecious pretence of having diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a <hi>panacea</hi> for all the ills of the people, they are about eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing a Å¿yÅ¿tem of government that will prove more deÅ¿tructive to them, than the wooden horÅ¿e filled with Å¿oldiers did in ancient times to the city of Troy; this horÅ¿e was introduced by their hoÅ¿tile enemy the Grecians, by a proÅ¿titution of the Å¿acred rites of their religion; in like manner, my fellow citizens, are aÅ¿pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deÅ¿pots among yourÅ¿elves, proÅ¿tituting the name of a WaÅ¿hington to cloak their deÅ¿igns upon your liberties.</p>
            <p>I would aÅ¿k how is the propoÅ¿ed government to Å¿how, or down thoÅ¿e treaÅ¿ures upon every claÅ¿s of citizens as is Å¿o induÅ¿triouÅ¿ly inculcated and Å¿o fondly believed?â Is it by the addition of numerous and expenÅ¿ive eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hments? Is it by doubling our judiciaries, inÅ¿tituting federal courts in every county of every Å¿tate? Is it by a Å¿uperb preÅ¿idential court? Is it by a large Å¿tanding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? In Å¿hort, is it by putting it in the power of the future government to levy money at pleaÅ¿ure, and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this government Å¿o independent of the people as to enable the adminiÅ¿tration to gratify every corrupt paÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, to riot on your Å¿poils, without check or controul?</p>
            <p>A transfer to CongreÅ¿s of the power of impoÅ¿ing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ts on commerce, and the unlimited regulation of trade, I believe is all that is wanting to render Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca as proÅ¿perous as it is in the power of any form of government to render her; this properly underÅ¿tood would meet the views of all the honeÅ¿t and well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>What gave birth to the Continental Convention?â Was it not the Å¿ituation of our commerce, which lay at the mercy of every foreign power, who from motives of intereÅ¿t or enmity could reÅ¿trict and controul it, without riÅ¿queing a retaliation on the part of America, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿s
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021344_0086_0FB31D615D2931D8"/>
was impotent on this Å¿ubject? Such indeed was the caÅ¿e with reÅ¿pect to Britain, whoÅ¿e hoÅ¿tile regulations gave Å¿uch a Å¿tab to our navigation as to threaten its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, it became the intereÅ¿t of the American mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to give a preference to foreign bottoms; hence the diÅ¿treÅ¿s of our Å¿eamen, Å¿hip-wrights, and every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic art dependent on navigation.</p>
            <p>By theÅ¿e regulations too we were limited in markets for our produce, our veÅ¿Å¿els were excluded from their WeÅ¿t-India iÅ¿lands, many of our Å¿taple commodities were denied entrance in Britain; hence the huÅ¿b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ndmen were diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed by the demand for their crops being leÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ened, and their prices reduced. This is the Å¿ource to which may be traced every evil we experience, that can be relieved by a more energetic government. Recollect the language of complaint for years paÅ¿t, compare the recommendations of CongreÅ¿s founded on Å¿uch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, pointing out the remedy; examine the reaÅ¿ons aÅ¿Å¿igned by the different Å¿tates for appointing delegates to the late convention, view the powers veÅ¿ted in that body; they all harmonize in one Å¿entiment, that the due regulation of trade and navigation was the anxious wiÅ¿h of every claÅ¿s of citizens, was the great object of calling the convention.</p>
            <p>This object being provided for by the propoÅ¿ed conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the people overlook, and are not Å¿enÅ¿ible of the needleÅ¿s Å¿acrifice they are making for it. Of what avail will be a proÅ¿perous Å¿tate of commerce, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of it will be at the abÅ¿olute diÅ¿poÅ¿al of an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and unchecked government, who may levy at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure the moÅ¿t oppreÅ¿Å¿ive taxes; who may deÅ¿troy every principle of freedom; who may even deÅ¿troy the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of complaining.</p>
            <p>If you are in doubt about the nature and principles of the propoÅ¿ed government, view the conduct of its authors and patrons, that affords the beÅ¿t explanation, the moÅ¿t Å¿triking comment.</p>

Some of their writers for inÅ¿tance, paint the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es of every claÅ¿s of citizens with all the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing language of eloquence, as if this was a demonÅ¿trati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the excellence, or even of the Å¿afety of the new plan, which notwithÅ¿tanding the reality of this diÅ¿treÅ¿s, may be a Å¿yÅ¿tem of tyranny and oppreÅ¿Å¿ion; other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

            <p>That the powers of CongreÅ¿s ought to be Å¿trengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all allow, but is this a concluÅ¿ive proof of the neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity to adopt the propoÅ¿ed plan; is it a proof that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the late convention in the firÅ¿t eÅ¿Å¿ay upon Å¿o arduous and difficult a Å¿ubject, harmonized in their ideas, that a future convention will not, or that after a full inveÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and mature conÅ¿ideration of the objections, they will not plan a better government, and one more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Å¿entiments of America; or is it any proof that they can never again agree in any plan?

            <p>MR.

                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>, his words are Å¿o remarkable, that I cannot forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing them; they are as follows, viz. "The extent of country for which the new conÅ¿titution was required, produced another difficulty in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of the federal convention. It is the opinion of Å¿ome celebrated wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that to a Å¿mall territory, the democratical, to a middling territory, as MonteÅ¿quien has termed it, the monarchical, and, to an extenÅ¿ive territory, the deÅ¿potic form of government is the beÅ¿t adapted. Regarding, then, the wide and almoÅ¿t unbounded juriÅ¿diction of the States, at firÅ¿t view the hand of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m Å¿eemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary to controul, connect, and protect it; and hence the chief embarraÅ¿Å¿ment aroÅ¿e. For, we knew, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our conÅ¿tituents would chearfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly Å¿ubmit to the legiÅ¿lative reÅ¿traints of a free government, they would Å¿purn at every attempt to Å¿hackle them with deÅ¿potic power." See page five of the printed Å¿peech. And again in page Å¿even, he Å¿ays, "Is it probable, that the diÅ¿Å¿olution of the Å¿tate governments, and the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one conÅ¿olidated empire, would be eligible in its nature, and Å¿atisfactory to the people in its admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tration? I think not, as I have given reaÅ¿ons to Å¿hew, that Å¿o extenÅ¿ive a territory could not be governed, connected, and preÅ¿erved, but by the Å¿upremacy of deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic power. All the exertions of the moÅ¿t potent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of Rome, were not capable of keeping that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire together, which, in extent, was far inferior to the dominion of America."</p>
            <p>This great point having been now confirmed by the conceÅ¿Å¿ion of Mr WilÅ¿on, though indeed it was Å¿elf evident before, and the writers againÅ¿t the propoÅ¿ed plan of government, having proved to demonÅ¿tration, that the powers propoÅ¿ed to be veÅ¿ted in CongreÅ¿s, will neceÅ¿Å¿arily annihilate and abÅ¿orb the legiÅ¿latures and judiciaries, and produce from their wreck one conÅ¿oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated government, the queÅ¿tion is determined. Every man therefore who has the welfare of his country at heart, every man who values his own liberty and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s, in Å¿hort, every deÅ¿cription of perÅ¿ons, except thoÅ¿e aÅ¿piring deÅ¿pots who hope to benefit by the miÅ¿ery and vaÅ¿Å¿alage of their countrymen, muÅ¿t now concur in

rejecting the propoÅ¿ed Å¿yÅ¿tem of government, muÅ¿t now unite in branding its authors with the Å¿tigma of eternal infamy. The anniverÅ¿ary of this great eÅ¿cape from the fangs of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m, ought to be celebrated as long as liberty Å¿hall continue to be dear to the citizens of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>I will repeat Å¿ome of my principal arguments, and add Å¿ome further remarks, on the Å¿ubject of conÅ¿oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>The legiÅ¿lative is the higheÅ¿t delegated power in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; all other are Å¿ubordinate to it. The cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated MonteÅ¿quie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, what can be more comprehenÅ¿ive than theÅ¿e words? Every Å¿pecies of taxation, whether external or internal, are included. Whatever taxes, duties, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d exciÅ¿es, that the CongreÅ¿s may deem neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the general welfare, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed on the citizens of theÅ¿e Å¿tates and levied by their officers. The CongreÅ¿s are to be the abÅ¿olute judges of the propriety of Å¿uch taxes, in Å¿hort they may conÅ¿true every purpoÅ¿e for which the Å¿tate legiÅ¿latures now lay taxes, to be for the general welfare, they may Å¿eize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Å¿ource of taxation, and thus make it impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Å¿tates to have the Å¿malleÅ¿t revenue; and if a Å¿tate Å¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ld preÅ¿ume to impoÅ¿e a tax or exciÅ¿e, that would interfere with the federal tax or exciÅ¿e, CongreÅ¿s may Å¿oon terminate the contention, by repealing the Å¿tate law, by virtue of the following Å¿ection; "To make all laws which Å¿hall be neceÅ¿Å¿ary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers veÅ¿ted by this conÅ¿titution in the government of the United States, or in any department thereof." Indeed every law of the Å¿tates may be controuled by this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

to Å¿wallow them up in the grand vortex of general empire. But the legiÅ¿lative has an able auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the judicial department, for a reference to my Å¿econd number will Å¿hew, that this may be made greatly inÅ¿trumental in effecting a conÅ¿olidation; as the federal judiciary would abÅ¿orb all others. LeÅ¿t the foregoing powers Å¿hould not Å¿uffice to conÅ¿olidate the United States into one empire, the convention, as if determined to prevent the poÅ¿Å¿ibility of a doubt, as if to prevent all claÅ¿hing by the oppoÅ¿ition of Å¿tate powers, as if to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all Å¿truggle for Å¿tate importance, as if to level all obÅ¿tacles to the Å¿upremacy of univerÅ¿al Å¿way, which in Å¿o extenÅ¿ive a territory would be an iron handed deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiÅ¿m, have ordained by article the 6th, <hi>"That this conÅ¿titution, and the laws of the United States, which Å¿hall be made in purÅ¿uance thereof, and all treaties made, or which Å¿hall be made, under the authority of the United States, Å¿hall be the Å¿upreme law of the land; and the judges in every Å¿tate Å¿hall be bound thereby, any thing in the conÅ¿titution or laws of any Å¿tate to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words, <hi>"purÅ¿uant to the conÅ¿titution,"</hi> will be no reÅ¿triction to the authority of CongreÅ¿s; for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Å¿ections give them unlimited legiÅ¿lation; their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded power of taxation does alone include all others, as whoever has the purÅ¿e Å¿trings will have full dominion. But the convention has Å¿uperadded another power, by which the CongreÅ¿s may Å¿tamp with the Å¿anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conÅ¿titution every poÅ¿Å¿ible law; it is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following clauÅ¿e: "To make all laws which Å¿hall be neceÅ¿Å¿ary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers veÅ¿ted by this conÅ¿titution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof."

            </p>
            <p>There is no reÅ¿ervation made in the whole of this plan in favour of the rights of the Å¿eparate Å¿tates. In the preÅ¿ent plan of confederation made in the year 1778, it was thought neceÅ¿Å¿ary by article the 2d to declare, that <hi>each Å¿tate retains its Å¿overeignty, freedom, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and every power, juriÅ¿diction, and right, which is not by this confederation expreÅ¿sly delegated to the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States in CongreÅ¿s aÅ¿Å¿embled.</hi> PoÅ¿itive grant was not thought Å¿ufficiently deÅ¿criptive and reÅ¿trictive upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿s, and the omiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿uch a declaration now, when Å¿uch great devolutions of power are propoÅ¿ed, manifeÅ¿ts the deÅ¿ign of conÅ¿olidating the Å¿tates.</p>
            <p>What reÅ¿triction does Mr. WilÅ¿on pretend there is in the new conÅ¿titution to the Å¿upremacy of deÅ¿potic Å¿way over the United States? What barrier does he aÅ¿Å¿ign for the Å¿ecurity of the Å¿tate governments? Why truly a mere cobweb of a limit! By interpoÅ¿ing the Å¿hield of what will become mere form, to check the reality of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He Å¿ays, that the exiÅ¿tence of the Å¿tate governments are eÅ¿Å¿ential to the organization of CongreÅ¿s, that the former is made the neceÅ¿Å¿ary baÅ¿is of the latter, for the federal Å¿enators and preÅ¿ident are to be appointed by the Å¿tate legiÅ¿latures; and that hence all fears of a conÅ¿oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation are groundleÅ¿s and imaginary. It muÅ¿t be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ed, as reaÅ¿on and argument would have been foreign to the defence of the propoÅ¿ed plan of government, Mr. WilÅ¿on has diÅ¿played much ingenuity on this occaÅ¿ion; he has involved the Å¿ubject in all the mazes of Å¿ophiÅ¿try, and by Å¿ubtil diÅ¿tinctions he has eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed principles and poÅ¿itions, that exiÅ¿t only in his own fertile imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a Å¿oleciÅ¿m in politics for two co-ordinate Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignties to exiÅ¿t together; you muÅ¿t Å¿eparate the Å¿phere of their juriÅ¿diction, or after running the race of dominion for Å¿ome time, one would neceÅ¿Å¿arily triumph over the other; but in the mean time the Å¿ubjects of it would be harraÅ¿Å¿ed with double impoÅ¿itions to Å¿upport the contention; however, the Å¿trife between CongreÅ¿s and the Å¿tates could not be of long continuance, for the former has a deciÅ¿ive Å¿uperiority in the outÅ¿et, and has
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021344_0094_0FB31D7315DF26D0"/>
moreover the power by the very conÅ¿titution itÅ¿elf to terminate it when expedient.</p>
            <p>As this neceÅ¿Å¿ary connexion, as it has been termed, between the Å¿tate governments and the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has been made a point of great magnitude by the advocates of the new plan, as it is the only obÅ¿tacle alledged by them againÅ¿t a conÅ¿olidation, it ought to be well conÅ¿idered. It is declared by the propoÅ¿ed plan, that the federal Å¿enators, and the electors who chooÅ¿e the preÅ¿ident of the United States, Å¿hall be appointed by the Å¿tate legiÅ¿latures for the long period of Å¿ix and four years reÅ¿pectively; how will this connexion prevent the Å¿tate legiÅ¿latures being diveÅ¿ted of every important, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry efficient power? may not they, will not they dwindle into mere boards of appointment, as has ever happened in other nations to public bodies, who in Å¿imilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances have been Å¿o weak as to part with the eÅ¿Å¿entials of power? does not hiÅ¿tory abound with Å¿uch inÅ¿tances? And this may be the mighty amount of this inÅ¿eparable connexion which is Å¿o much dwelt upon as the Å¿ecurity of the Å¿tate governments. Yet even this Å¿hadow of a limit againÅ¿t conÅ¿olidation may be annihilated by the imperial fiat, without any violation of even the forms of the conÅ¿titution; Å¿ection 4th of article 1Å¿t has made a proviÅ¿ion for this, when the people are Å¿ufficiently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued with the uÅ¿eleÅ¿s expence of maintaining the forms of departed power and Å¿ecurity, and when they Å¿hall pray to be relieved from the impoÅ¿ition. This Å¿ection cannot be too often repeated, as it gives Å¿uch a latitude to the deÅ¿igning, as it revokes every other part of the conÅ¿titution that may be tolerable, and as it may enable the adminiÅ¿tration under it to complete the Å¿yÅ¿tem of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m: It is in the following words, viz. "The times, places, and manner of holding elections for Å¿ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and repreÅ¿entatives, Å¿hall be preÅ¿cribed in each Å¿tate by the legiÅ¿lature thereof; but the CongreÅ¿s may by law at any time make or alter Å¿uch regulations, except as to the place of chooÅ¿ing Å¿enators." The only appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant reÅ¿triction in this clauÅ¿e is, as to the place of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Å¿enators, but even this may be rendered of no avail; for as the CongreÅ¿s have the controul over the time of appointment of both Å¿enators and repreÅ¿entatives,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021344_0095_0FB31D75CE0F9430"/>
they may, under the pretence of an apprehenÅ¿ion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaÅ¿ion, upon the pretence of the turbulence of what they may Å¿tile a faction, and indeed pretences are never wanting to the deÅ¿igning, they may poÅ¿tpone the time of the election of the Å¿enators and the repreÅ¿entatives from period to period to perpetuity: Thus they may, and if they may they certainly will, from the luÅ¿t of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion Å¿o inherent in the mind of man, relieve the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the trouble of attending elections by conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cending to create themÅ¿elves. Has not Mr. WilÅ¿on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed it in fact? Has he not Å¿aid in the convention that it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary that CongreÅ¿s Å¿hould poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s this power, as the means of its own preÅ¿ervation; otherwiÅ¿e Å¿ays he, an invaÅ¿ion, a civil war, a faction, or a Å¿eceÅ¿Å¿ion of a minority of the aÅ¿Å¿embly, might prevent the repreÅ¿enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Å¿tate in CongreÅ¿s.</p>

it is that luÅ¿t of dominion that is inherent in every mind, in a greater or leÅ¿s degree; this is Å¿o univerÅ¿al and ever active a paÅ¿Å¿ion as to influence all our anceÅ¿tors; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Å¿ituation and qualifications of men only modifies and varies the complexion and operation of it.</p>
            <p>For this darling pre-eminence and Å¿uperiority, the merchant, already poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of a competency, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures his all in the purÅ¿uit of greater wealth; it is for this, that men of all deÅ¿criptions, after having amaÅ¿Å¿ed fortunes, Å¿till perÅ¿evere in the toils of labour; in Å¿hort, this is the great principle of exertion in the votaries of riches, learning, and Å¿ame.</p>
            <p>In a Å¿avage Å¿tate, pre-eminence is the reÅ¿ult of bodily Å¿trength and intrepidity, which compels Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion from all Å¿uch as have the misfortune to be leÅ¿s able; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great end of civil government is, to protect the weak from the oppreÅ¿Å¿ion of the powerful, to put every man upon the level of equal liberty; but here again the Å¿ame luÅ¿t of dominion by different means fruÅ¿trates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t always this Å¿alutary intention. In a poliÅ¿hed Å¿tate of Å¿ociety, wealth, talents, addreÅ¿s and intrigue are the qualities that attain Å¿uperiority in the great Å¿phere of government.</p>
            <p>The moÅ¿t Å¿triking illuÅ¿tration of the prevalence of this luÅ¿t of dominion is, that the moÅ¿t Å¿trenuous aÅ¿Å¿ertors of liberty in all ages, after Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully triumphing over tyranny, have themÅ¿elves become tyrants, when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uÅ¿picious confidence of an admiring people have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truÅ¿ted them with unchecked power: Rare are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances of Å¿elf-denial, or conÅ¿iÅ¿tency of conduct in the votaries of liberty, when they have become poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of the reins of authority; it has been the peculiar felicity of this country, that her <hi>great deliverer</hi> did not prove a <hi>Cromwell,</hi> nor a <hi>Monk.</hi>

and perÅ¿everance of its citizens, at Å¿uch great expence of blood and treaÅ¿ure, when they are about to fall a prey to the machinations of a profligate junto at home, who, Å¿eizing the favourable moment, when the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and extraordinary difficulties of the people have thrown them off their guard, and lulled that jealouÅ¿y of power Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿ential to the preÅ¿ervation of freedom, have been too Å¿ucceÅ¿sful in the Å¿acrilegious attempt; however I am confident that this formidable conÅ¿piracy will end in the confuÅ¿ion and infamy of its authors; that, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary, the avenging Å¿word of an abuÅ¿ed people will humble theÅ¿e aÅ¿piring deÅ¿pots to the duÅ¿t, and that their fate, like that of Charles the FirÅ¿t of England, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Å¿uch attempts in future, and prove the confirmation of the liberties of America until time Å¿hall be no more.</p>
            <p>One would imagine, by the inÅ¿olent conduct of thoÅ¿e harpies of power, they had already triumphed over the liberties of the people; that the chains were rivetted, and tyranny eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed. They tell us all farther oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition will be in vain, as this Å¿tate has paÅ¿Å¿ed the Rubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. Do they imagine the freemen of PennÅ¿ylvania will be thus trepanned out of their liberties; that they will Å¿ubmit without a Å¿truggle? They muÅ¿t indeed be inebriated with the luÅ¿t of dominion, to indulge Å¿uch chimerical ideas. Will the act of one Å¿ixth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this too, founded on deception and Å¿urpriÅ¿e, bind the community. Is it thus that the altar of liberty Å¿o recently crimÅ¿oned with the blood of our worthies, is it to be proÅ¿trated, and deÅ¿potiÅ¿m reared on its ruins? Certainly not. The Å¿olemn mummery that has been acting in the name of the people of PennÅ¿ylvania, will be treated with the deÅ¿erved contempt, it has Å¿erved, indeed, to expoÅ¿e the principles of the men concerned, and to draw a line of diÅ¿crimination between the real and affected patriots.</p>
            <p>ImpreÅ¿Å¿ed with an high opinion of the underÅ¿tanding and Å¿pirit of my fellow citizens, I have in no Å¿tage of this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s entertained a doubt of its eventual defeat; the momentary deluÅ¿ion, ariÅ¿ing from an unreÅ¿erved confidence placed in Å¿ome of the characters whoÅ¿e names Å¿anctioned this Å¿cheme of power, did not diÅ¿courage me: I foreÅ¿aw that this blind admiration would diÅ¿cover it, native deformity.</p>

of arbitrary power, expands every faculty: as the field to fame and riches is open to all, it Å¿timulates univerÅ¿al exertion and exhibits a lively picture of emulation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duÅ¿try and happineÅ¿s. The unfortunate and oppreÅ¿Å¿ed of all nations fly to this grand aÅ¿ylum, where liberty is ever protected, and induÅ¿try crowned with Å¿ucceÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>But as it is by compariÅ¿on only, that men eÅ¿timate the value of any good, they are not Å¿enÅ¿ible of the worth of theÅ¿e bleÅ¿Å¿ings they enjoy until they are deprived of them; hence, from ignorance of the horrors of Å¿lavery, nations that have been in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of that rareÅ¿t of bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ings, liberty, have Å¿o eaÅ¿ily parted with it: When groaning under the yoke of tyranny, what perils would they not encounter, what conÅ¿ideration would they not give to regain the ineÅ¿timable jewel they had loÅ¿t; but the jealouÅ¿y of deÅ¿potiÅ¿m guards every avenue to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and confirms its empire at the expence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted people, whoÅ¿e property is made inÅ¿trumental to their miÅ¿ery; for the rapacious hand of power Å¿eizes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every thing, deÅ¿pair preÅ¿ently Å¿ucceeds, and every noble faculty of the mind being depreÅ¿Å¿ed, and all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to induÅ¿try and exertion being removed, the people are adapted to the nature of the government, and drag out a liÅ¿tleÅ¿s exiÅ¿tence.</p>
            <p>If ever America Å¿hould be enÅ¿laved, it will be from this cauÅ¿e, that they are not Å¿enÅ¿ible of their peculiar felicity, that they are not aware of the value of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly boon committed to their care and protection; and if the preÅ¿ent conÅ¿piracy fails, as I have no doubt will be the caÅ¿e, it will be the triumph of reaÅ¿on and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ophy, as theÅ¿e united Å¿tates have never felt the iron hand of power, or experienced the wretchedneÅ¿s of Å¿la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>

Å¿tamps, or tea, that America oppoÅ¿ed; they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered as Å¿ignals of approaching deÅ¿potiÅ¿m, as prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents whereon the Å¿uperÅ¿tructure of arbitrary Å¿way was to be reared.</p>
            <p>NotwithÅ¿tanding Å¿uch illuÅ¿trious evidence of the good Å¿enÅ¿e and Å¿pirit of the people of theÅ¿e united Å¿tates, and contrary to all former experience of mankind, which demonÅ¿trates, that it is only by gradual and impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degrees that nations have hitherto been enÅ¿laved, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caÅ¿e of conqueÅ¿t by the Å¿word; the authors of the preÅ¿ent conÅ¿piracy are attempting to Å¿eize upon abÅ¿olute power at one graÅ¿p; impatient of dominion, they have adopted a deciÅ¿ive line of conduct, which if Å¿ucceÅ¿sful would obliterate every trace of liberty. I congratulate my fellow citizens, that the infatuated confidence of their enemies has Å¿o blinded their ambition, that their defeat muÅ¿t be certain and eaÅ¿y; if imitating the refined policy of Å¿ucceÅ¿sful deÅ¿pots, they had attacked the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of liberty by Å¿ap, and gradually undermined its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, they would have Å¿tood a fairer chance of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deÅ¿ign; but in this enlightened age thus raÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attempt to carry the fortreÅ¿s by Å¿torm, is folly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. They have even expoÅ¿ed Å¿ome of their batteries prematurely, and thereby unfolded every latent view; for the unlimited power of taxation would alone have been amply Å¿ufficient for every purpoÅ¿e; by a proper application of this, the will and pleaÅ¿ure of the rulers would of courÅ¿e have become the Å¿upreme law of the land; therefore there was no uÅ¿e in pourtraying the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate object, by Å¿uperadding the form to the reality of Å¿upremacy in the following clauÅ¿es, viz. that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers the new congreÅ¿s to make all laws that, may be neceÅ¿Å¿ary and proper for carrying into execution any of their powers by virtue of which every poÅ¿Å¿ible law will be conÅ¿titutional, as they are to be the Å¿ole judges of the propriety of Å¿uch laws; that which ordains that their acts Å¿hall be the Å¿upreme law of the land, any thing in the laws or conÅ¿titution of any Å¿tate to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding; that which gives congreÅ¿s the abÅ¿olute controul over the time and mode of its appointment and election, whereby, independent of any other means; they may eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h hereditary deÅ¿potiÅ¿m; that which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿es

            <p>So flagrant, Å¿o audacious a conÅ¿piracy againÅ¿t the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of a free people, is without precedent; mankind in the darkeÅ¿t ages, have never been Å¿o inÅ¿ultedâeven then tyrants found it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to pay Å¿ome reÅ¿pect to the habits and feelings of the people; and nothing but the name of a WaÅ¿hington could have occaÅ¿ioned a moment's heÅ¿itation about the nature of the new plan, or Å¿aved its authors from the execration and vengeance of the people, which eventually will prove an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their treaÅ¿on, for America will reÅ¿ent the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition practiÅ¿ed upon the unÅ¿uÅ¿picious zeal of her <hi>illuÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deliverer,</hi> and vindicate her character from the aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perÅ¿ions of theÅ¿e enemies of her happineÅ¿s and fame.</p>
            <p>The advocates of this plan have artfully attempted to veil over the true nature and principles of it, with the names of thoÅ¿e reÅ¿pectable characters that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ummate cunning and addreÅ¿s they have prevailed upon to Å¿ign it, and what ought to convince the people of the deception and excite their apprehenÅ¿ions, is, that with every advantage which education, the Å¿cience of government, and of law, the knowledge of hiÅ¿tory, and Å¿uperior talents and endowments furniÅ¿h the authors and advocates of this plan, they have, from its publication, exerted all their power and influence to prevent all diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿Å¿ion of the Å¿ubject, and when this could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, they have conÅ¿tantly avoided the ground of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and recurred to declamation, Å¿ophiÅ¿try, and perÅ¿onal abuÅ¿e, but principally relied upon the magic of names. Would this have been their conduct, if their cauÅ¿e had been a good one? No: they would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited veÅ¿tigation, and convinced the underÅ¿tandings of the people.</p>
            <p>But Å¿uch policy indicates great ignorance of the good Å¿enÅ¿e and Å¿pirit of the people; for if the Å¿anction of every convention throughout the union was obtained by the means theÅ¿e men are practiÅ¿ing, yet their triumph would be momentary, the favorite object would Å¿till

However, the complexion of Å¿everal of the more conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Å¿tates does not promiÅ¿e even this point of Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿s.

            <p>The preÅ¿ent conÅ¿piracy is a continental exertion of the <hi>well-born</hi> of America to obtain that darling domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which they have not been able to accompliÅ¿h in their reÅ¿pective Å¿tates. Of what complexion were the deputies of this Å¿tate in the general convention? Six out of eight were the inveterate enemies of our ineÅ¿timable conÅ¿titution, and the principles of that faction that for ten years paÅ¿t have kept the people in continual alarm for their liberties.

uÅ¿ual gradations to abÅ¿olute power, and have attempted to Å¿eize at once upon the Å¿upremacy of dominion. The new inÅ¿trument of government does indeed make a Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious parade of Å¿ome remaining privileges, and inÅ¿ults the underÅ¿tandings of the people with the Å¿emblance of liberty in Å¿ome of its artful and deceptive clauÅ¿es, which form but a flimÅ¿y veil over the reality of tyranny, Å¿o weakly endeavoured to be concealed from the eye of freedom. For, of what avail are the few inadequate Å¿tipulations in favor of the rights of the people, when they may be effectually counteracted and deÅ¿troyed by virtue of other clauÅ¿es; when theÅ¿e enable the rulers to renounce all dependence on their conÅ¿tituents, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the latter tenants at will of every concern? The new conÅ¿titution is in fact a <hi>carte blanche,</hi> a Å¿urrender at diÅ¿cretion to the will and pleaÅ¿ure of our rulers; as this has been demonÅ¿trated to be the caÅ¿e, by the inveÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation and diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion that have taken place, I truÅ¿t the Å¿ame good Å¿enÅ¿e and Å¿pirit which have hitherto enabled the people to triumph over the wiles of ambition, will be again exerted for their Å¿alvation. The accounts from various parts of the country correÅ¿pond with my warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t hopes, and juÅ¿tify my early predictions of the eventual defeat of this Å¿cheme of power and office making.</p>
            <p>The genius of liberty has Å¿ounded the alarm, and the dormant Å¿pirit of her votaries is reviving with enthuÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aÅ¿tic ardor; the like unanimity which formerly diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hed them in their conflict with foreign deÅ¿pots, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e to crown their virtuous oppoÅ¿ition on the preÅ¿ent occaÅ¿ion, with Å¿ignal Å¿ucceÅ¿s. The Å¿tructure of deÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿m that has been reared in this Å¿tate, upon deception and Å¿urpriÅ¿e, will vaniÅ¿h like the baÅ¿eleÅ¿s fabric of a dream, and leave not a trace behind.</p>

but yet, like the election of a Mr. Sedgwick for the little town of Stockbridge, which has been adduced as evidence of the unanimity of the weÅ¿tern counties of MaÅ¿Å¿achuÅ¿etts Å¿tate in favour of the new conÅ¿titution, when the fact is far otherwiÅ¿e, this act of a few individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als will be founded forth over the continent as a teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the zealous attachment of the county of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton to the new conÅ¿titution. By Å¿uch wretched and momentary deceptions do theÅ¿e harpies of power endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give the complexion of Å¿trength to their cauÅ¿e. To prevent the detection of Å¿uch impoÅ¿itions, to prevent the reflection of the rays of light from Å¿tate to Å¿tate, which producing general illumination, would diÅ¿Å¿ipate the miÅ¿t of deception, and thereby prove fatal to the new conÅ¿titution, all intercourÅ¿e between the patriots of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica is as far as poÅ¿Å¿ible cut off; whilÅ¿t on the other hand, the conÅ¿pirators have the moÅ¿t exact information, a common concert is every where evident, they move in uniÅ¿on.

            <p>It is a fact that can be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, that during almoÅ¿t the whole of the time that the late convention of this Å¿tate were aÅ¿Å¿embled, the newÅ¿-papers publiÅ¿hed in New-York, by Mr. Greenleaf, which contain the eÅ¿Å¿ays writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there againÅ¿t the new government, Å¿uch as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic ones of Brutus, Cincinnatus, Cato, &amp;c.

            <p>The more I conÅ¿ider the manoeuvres that are practiÅ¿ing, the more am I alarmedâforeÅ¿eeing that the juggle can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long be concealed, and that the Å¿pirit of the people will not brook the impoÅ¿ition, they have guarded, as they Å¿uppoÅ¿e, againÅ¿t any danger ariÅ¿ing from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition of the people, and rendered their Å¿truggles for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty impotent and ridiculous. What otherwiÅ¿e is the meaning of diÅ¿arming the militia, for the purpoÅ¿e, as it is Å¿aid, of repairing their muÅ¿quets at Å¿uch a particular period?
