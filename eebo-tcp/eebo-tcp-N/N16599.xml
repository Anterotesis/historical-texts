            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT was not until after the termination of the late glorious conteſt, which made the people of the United States an indedendent nation, that any defect was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the preſent confederation. It was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome of the ableſt patriots in America. It carried us ſucceſsfully through the war; and the virtue and patriotiſm of the people, with their diſpoſition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the common cauſe, ſupplied the want of power in Congreſs.</p>
            <p>The requiſition of Congreſs for the five per cent. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt was made before the peace, ſo early as the firſt of February, 1781, but was prevented taking effect by the refuſal of one ſtate; yet it is probable every ſtate in the union would have agreed to this meaſure, at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, had it not been for the extravagant terms in which it was demanded. The requiſition was new moulded in the year 1783, and accompanied with an additional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of certain ſupplementary funds for twenty-five years. Peace had now taken place, and the United States found themſelves labouring under a conſiderable foreign and domeſtic debt, incurred during the war. The requiſition of 1783, was commenſurate with the intereſt of the debt, as it was then calculated; but it has been more accurately aſcertaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:021344_0004_0FB31F02CE420640"/>It was at this time that the want of an efficient fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government was firſt complained of, and that the powers veſted in Congreſs were found to be inadequate to the procuring of the benefits that ſhould reſult from the union. The impoſt was granted by moſt of the ſtates, but many refuſed the ſupplementary funds; the annual requiſitions were ſet at nought by ſome of the ſtates, while others complied with them by legiſlative acts, but were tardy in their payments, and Congreſs found themſelves incapable of complying with their engagements, and ſupporting the federal government. It was found, that our national character was ſinking in the opinion of foreign nations. The Congreſs could make treaties of commerce, but could not enforce the obſervance of them. We were ſuffering from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions of foreign nations, who had ſhackled our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, while we were unable to retaliate: and all now agreed that it would be advantageous to the union to enlarge the powers of Congreſs; that they ſhould be enabled in the ampleſt manner to regulate commerce, and to lay and collect duties on the imports throughout tho United States. With this view a convention was firſt propoſed by Virginia, and finally recommended by Congreſs for the different ſtates to appoint deputies to meet in convention, "for the purpoſe of reviſing and amending the preſent articles of confederation, ſo as to make them adequate to the exigencies of the union." This recommendation the legiſlatures of twelve ſtates complied with ſo haſtily as not to conſult their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents on the ſubject; and though the different legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had no authority from their conſtituents for the purpoſe, they probably apprehended the neceſſity would juſtify the meaſure; and none of them extended their ideas, at that time, further than "reviſing and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent articles of confederation." Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> though it is probable that ſome of the members of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:021344_0005_0FB31F04EA2615B8"/>The majority of the legiſlature of this commonwealth were at that time under the influence of the members from the city of Philadelphia. They agreed, that the deputies ſent by them to convention, ſhould have no compenſation for their ſervices, which determination was calculated to prevent the election of any member who reſided at a diſtance from the city. It was in vain for the minority to attempt electing delegates to the convention, who underſtood the circumſtances and the feelings of the people, and had a common intereſt with them. They found a diſpoſition in the leaders of the majority of the houſe to chooſe themſelves and ſome of their depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts. The minority attempted to prevent this by agreeing to vote for ſome of the leading mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who they knew had influence enough to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at any rate, in hopes of carring with them ſome reſpectable citizens of Philadelphia, in whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and integrity they could have more confidence; but even in this they were diſappointed, except in one member: the eighth member was added at a ſubſequent ſeſſion of the aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The continental convention met in the city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia at the time appointed. It was compoſed of ſome men of excellent characters; of others, who were more remarkable for their ambition and cunning, than their patriotiſm; and of ſome who had been opponents to the conſtitution of this commonwealth. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſat upwards of four months. The doors were kept ſhut, and the members brought under the moſt ſolemn engagements of ſecrecy.<note n="*" place="bottom">The journals of the conclave are ſtill cancealed.</note> Some of thoſe who oppoſed their going ſo far beyond their powers, retired, hopeleſs, from the convention; others had the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to refuſe ſigning the plan altogether; and many who did ſign it, did it not as a ſyſtem they wholly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, but as the beſt that could be the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

were buſily employed in alarming the fears of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with dangers which did not exiſt, and exciting their hopes of greater advantages from the expected plan than even the beſt government on earth can produce.</p>
            <p>The propoſed plan had not many hours iſſued forth, from the womb of ſuſpicious ſecrecy, until ſuch as were prepared for the purpoſe, were carrying about pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for people to ſign, ſignifying their approbation of the ſyſtem, and requeſting the legiſlature to call a convention. While every meaſure was taken to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midate the people againſt oppoſing it, the public papers teemed with the moſt violent threats againſt thoſe who ſhould dare to think for themſelves, and tar and feathers were liberally promiſed to all thoſe who would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately join in ſupporting the propoſed government, be it what it would. Under ſuch circumſtances, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in favour of calling a convention, were ſigned by great numbers in and about the city, before they had leiſure to read and examine the ſyſtem, many of whom, now they are better acquainted with it, and have had time to inveſtigate its principles, are heartily oppoſed to it. The petitions were ſpeedily handed in to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature.</p>
            <p>Affairs were in this ſituation, when on the 28th of September laſt, a reſolution was propoſed to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by a member of the houſe who had been alſo a member of the federal convention, for calling a ſtate convention, to be elected within ten days, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of examining and adopting the propoſed conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the united ſtates, though at this time the houſe had not received it from Congreſs. This attempt was oppoſed by a minority, who, after offering every argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their power to prevent the precipitate meaſure, without effect, abſented themſelves from the houſe, as the only alternative left them, to prevent the meaſures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

We ſhall dwell no longer on this ſubject, the people of Pennſylvania have been already acquainted therewith. We would only further obſerve, that every member of the legiſlature, previouſly to taking his ſeat, by ſolemn oath or affirmation, declares, "that they will not do or conſent to any act or thing whatever that ſhall have a tendency to leſſen or abridge their rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, as declared in the conſtitution of this ſtate." And that conſtitution which they are ſo ſolemnly ſworn to ſupport, cannot legally be altered but by a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the council of cenſors, who alone are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed to propoſe alterations and amendments, and even theſe muſt be publiſhed at leaſt ſix months, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the people. The propoſed ſyſtem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for the United States, if adopted, will alter, and may annihilate the conſtitution of Pennſylvania; and therefore the legiſlature had no authority whatever to recommend the calling a convention for that purpoſe. This proceeding could not be conſidered as binding on the people of this commonwealth. The houſe was formed by violence, ſome of the members compoſing it were detained by force, which alone would have vitiated any proceedings, to which they were otherwiſe compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but had the legiſlature been legally formed, this buſineſs was abſolutely without their power.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation of affairs were the ſubſcribers elected members of the convention of Pennſylvania. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention called by a legiſlature in direct violation of their duty, and compoſed in part of members, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to attend for that purpoſe, to conſider of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution propoſed by a convention of the United States, who were not appointed for the porpoſe of framing a new form of government, but whoſe powers were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly confined to altering and amending the preſent articles of confederation. Therefore the members of the <note n="†" place="bottom">The continental convention, in direct violation of the 13th article of confederation, have declared, "that the ratification of nine ſtates ſhall be ſufficient for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of this conſtitution, between the ſtates ſo ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame." Thus has the plighted faith of the ſtates been ſported with! they had ſolemnly engaged that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation now ſubſiſting ſhould be inviolably preſerved by each of them, and the union thereby formed ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, unleſs the ſame ſhould be altered by mutual conſent.</note>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021344_0008_0FB31F0943F91318"/>
continental convention, in propoſing the plan, acted as individuals, and not as deputies from Pennſylvania †— the aſſembly who called the ſtate convention acted as individuals, and not as the legiſlature of Pennſylvania; nor could they, or the convention choſen on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, have authority to do any act or thing, that can alter or annihilate the conſtitution of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania (both of which will be done by the new conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) nor are their proceedings, in our opinion, at all binding upon the people.</p>
            <p>The election for members of the convention was held at ſo early a period, and the want of information was ſo great, that ſome of us did not know of it until after it was over, and we have reaſon to believe, that great numbers of the people of Pennſylvania have not yet had an opportunity of ſufficiently examining the propoſed conſtitution. We apprehend that no change can take place that will affect the internal government or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this commonwealth, unleſs a majority of the people ſhould evidence a wiſh for ſuch a change; but on examining the number of votes given for members of the preſent ſtate convention, we find, that of upwards of ſeventy thouſand freemen who are entitled to vote in Pennſylvania, the whole convention has been elected by about thirteen thouſand voters, and though two-thirds of the members of the convention have thought proper to ratify the propoſed conſtitution, yet thoſe two-thirds were elected by the votes of only ſix thouſand and eight hundred freemen.</p>
            <p>In the city of Philadelphia, and ſome of the eaſtern counties, the junto that took the lead in the buſineſs agreed to vote for none but ſuch as would ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to adopt the ſyſtem <hi>in toto,</hi> without exerciſing their judgment.

To ſuch lengths did the tools of deſpotiſm carry their outrage, that in the night of the election for members of convention in the city of Philadelphia, ſeveral of the ſubſcribers (being then in the city to tranſact your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs) were groſsly abuſed and inſulted, while they were quiet in their lodgings; though they did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, nor had any thing to do with ſaid election; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The convention met, and the ſame diſpoſition was ſoon manifeſted in conſidering the propoſed conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that had been exhibited in every other ſtage of the buſineſs. We were prohibited by an expreſs vote of the convention, from taking any queſtion on the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate articles of the plan, and reduced to the neceſſity of adopting or rejecting <hi>in toto.</hi> It is true the majority permitted us to debate on each article, but reſtrained us from propoſing amendments. They alſo determined not to permit us to enter on the minutes our reaſons of diſſent againſt the whole. Thus ſituated we entered on the examination of the propoſed ſyſtem of government, and found it to be ſuch as we could not adopt, without, as we conceived, ſurrendering up your deareſt rights. We offered our objections to the convention, and oppoſed thoſe parts of the plan, which, in our opinion, would be injurious to you, in the beſt manner we were able; and cloſed our arguments by offering the following propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to the convention:</p>
            <p>Firſt. The rights of conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ence ſhall be held in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ither the legiſlative, executive, nor ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial powers of the united ſtates, ſhall have authority to alter, abrogate, or infringe any part of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral ſtates, which provide for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of liberty in matters of religion.</p>
            <p>Second. That in controverſies reſpecting property,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021344_0010_0FB31F0E1CE26CA8"/>
and in ſuits between man and man, trial by jury ſhall remain as heretofore, as well in the federal courts, as in thoſe of the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
            <p>Third. That in all capital and criminal proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a man has a right to demand the cauſe and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his accuſation, as well in the federal courts as in thoſe of the ſeveral ſtates; to be heard by himſelf and counſel; to be confronted with the accuſers and witneſſes; to call for evidence in his favor, and a ſpeedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whoſe unanimous conſent, he cannot be found guilty, nor can he be compelled to give evidence againſt himſelf; and that no man be deprived of his liberty, except by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</p>
            <p>Fourth. That exceſſive bail ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, nor exceſſive fines impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, nor cruel nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual puniſhments inflicted.</p>
            <p>Fifth. That warrants, unſupported by evidence, whereby any officer or meſſenger may be commanded or required to ſearch ſuſpected places, or to ſeize any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons, his or their property, not particularly deſcribed, are grievous and oppreſſive, and ſhall not be granted either by the magiſtrates of the federal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or others.</p>
            <p>Sixth. That the people have a right to the freedom of ſpeech, of writing and publiſhing their ſentiments; therefore, the freedom of the preſs ſhall not be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any law of the united ſtates.</p>
            <p>Seventh. The people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themſelves and their own ſtate or the United States, or for the purpoſe of killing game; and no law ſhall be paſſed for diſarming the people of any of them, unleſs for crimes committed, or real danger of public injury from individuals; and as ſtanding armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the civil powers.</p>
            <p>Eighth. The inhabitants of the ſeveral ſtates ſhall have liberty to fowl and hunt in ſeaſonable times, on the lands they hold, and on all other lands in the United
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021344_0011_0FB31F1039C48360"/>
States not encloſed, and in like manner to fiſh in all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable waters and others not private property, without being reſtrained therein by any laws to be paſſed by the legiſlature of the United States.</p>
            <p>Ninth. That no law ſhall be paſſed to reſtrain the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates from enacting laws for impoſing taxes, except impoſts and duties on goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or exported, and that no taxes, except impoſts and duties on goods imported and exported, and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age on letters, ſhall be levied by the authority of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
            <p>Tenth. That the houſe of repreſentatives be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly increaſed in number; that elections ſhall remain free; that the ſeveral ſtates ſhall have power to regulate the elections for ſenators and repreſentatives, without being controuled either directly or indirectly by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference on the part of Congreſs; and that elections of repreſentatives be annual.</p>
            <p>Eleventh. That the power of organizing, arming, and diſciplining the militia (the manner of diſciplining the militia to be preſcribed by Congreſs) remain with the individual ſtates, and that Congreſs ſhall not have authority to call or march any of the militia out of their own ſtate, without the conſent of ſuch ſtate, and for ſuch length of time only as ſuch ſtate ſhall agree.</p>
            <p>That the ſovereignty, freedom, and independency of the ſeveral ſtates ſhall be retained, and every power, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and right, which is not by this conſtitution expreſsly delegated to the United States in Congreſs aſſembled.</p>
            <p>Twelfth. That the legiſlative, executive, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial powers be kept ſeparate; and to this end, that a conſtitutional council be appointed, to adviſe and aſſiſt the preſident, who ſhall be reſponſible for the advice they give; hereby the ſenators would be relieved from almoſt conſtant attendance; and alſo that the judges be made completely independent.</p>
            <p>Thirteenth. That no treaty which ſhall be directly oppoſed to the exiſting laws of the United States in Congreſs aſſembled, ſhall be valid until ſuch laws ſhall be repealed or made conformable to ſuch treaty; neither ſhall any treaties be valid which are in contradiction to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021344_0012_0FB31F1122F904A8"/>
the conſtitution of the United States, or the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
            <p>Fourteenth. That the judiciary power of the United States ſhall be confined to caſes affecting ambaſſadors, other public miniſters, or conſuls; to caſes of admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and maritime juriſdiction; to controverſies to which the United States ſhall be a party; to controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two or more ſtates; between a ſtate and citizens of different ſtates, between citizens claiming lands under grants of different ſtates, and between a ſtate or the citizens thereof and foreign ſtates; and in criminal c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſes, to ſuch only a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are expreſsly enumerated in the conſtitution; and that the United States in Congreſs aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mbled, ſhall not have power to enact laws, which ſhall alter the laws of deſcents and diſtribution of the effects of deceaſed perſons, the titles of land or goods, or the regulation of contracts in the individual ſtates.</p>
            <p>After reading theſe propoſitions, we declared our willingneſs to agree to the plan, provided it was ſo amended as to meet thoſe propoſitions, or ſomething ſimilar to them: and finally moved the convention do adjourn, to give the people of Pennſylvania time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o conſider the ſubject, and determine for themſelves; but theſe were all rej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cted, and the final vote was taken, when our duty to you induced us to vote againſt the propoſed plan, and to decline ſigning the ratification of the ſame.</p>
            <p>During the diſcuſſion, we met with many inſults, and ſome perſonal abuſe; we were not even treated with decency, during the ſitting of the convention, by the perſons in the gallery of the houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, we flatter our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elves, that in contending for the preſervation of thoſe invaluable rights you have thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>roper to commit to our charge, we acted with a ſpirit becoming freemen, and being deſirous tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you might know the principles which actuated our conduct, and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited from infering our reaſons of diſſent on the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of the convention, we have ſubjoined them for your conſideration, as to you alone we are accountable. It remains with you, whether you will think thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable privileges, which you have ſo ably contended for, ſhould be ſacrificed at the ſhrine of deſpotiſm, or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021344_0013_0FB31F12901C1988"/>
whether you mean to contend for them with the ſame ſpirit that has ſo often baffled the attempts of an ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocratic faction, to rivet the ſhackles of ſlavery on you, and you unborn poſterity.</p>
            <p>Our objections are compriſed under three general heads of diſſent, viz.</p>
            <p>WE DISSENT, Firſt, Becauſe it is the opinion of the moſt celebrated writers on government, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by uniform experience, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a very extenſive ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory cannot be governed on the principles of freedom otherwiſe than by a confederation of republics, poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the powers of internal governments; but united in the management of their general and foreign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>If any doubt could have been entertained of the truth of the foregoing principle, it has been fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the conceſſion of Mr. Wilſon, one of the majority on this queſtion, and who was one of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in the late general convention. In juſtice to him we will give his own words; they are as follows, viz. "The extent of country for which the new conſtitution was required, produced another difficulty in the buſineſs of the federal convention. It is the opinion of ſome celebrated writers, that to a ſmall territory, the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical; to a middling territory (as Monteſquieu has termed it) the monarchial; and to an extenſive terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the deſpotic form of government, is beſt adapted. Regarding, then, the wide and almoſt unbounded juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the United States, at firſt view, the hand of deſpotiſm ſeemed neceſſary to controul, connect, and protect it; and hence the chief embarraſſment roſe. For we knew, that, although our conſtituents would cheerfully ſubmit to the legiſlative reſtraints of a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they would ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cle them with deſpotic power." And again, in another part of his ſpeech, he continues, "Is it probable that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the ſtate governments, and the eſtabliſhment of one conſolidated empire, would be eligible in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſatisfactory to the people in its adminiſtration? I think not, as I have given reaſons to ſhew, that ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive a territory could not be governed, connected, and preſerved, but by the ſupremacy of deſpotic power.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021344_0014_0FB31F148D7C1E30"/>
All the exertions of the moſt potent emperors of Rome were not capable of keeping that empire together, which in extent was far inferior to the dominion of America."</p>
            <p>We diſſent, ſecondly, becauſe the powers veſted in Congreſs by this conſtitution, muſt neceſſarily annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and abſorb the legiſlative, executive, and judicial powers of the ſeveral ſtates, and produce from their ruins one conſolidated government, which, from the nature of things, will be an iron-handed deſpotiſm, as nothing ſhort of the ſupremacy of deſpotic ſway could connect and govern theſe United States under one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>As the truth of this poſition is of ſuch deciſive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, it ought to be fully inveſtigated, and if it is founded, to be clearly aſcertained; for, ſhould it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that the powers veſted by this conſtitution in Congreſs, will have ſuch an effect, as neceſſarily to produce one conſolidated government, the queſtion then will be reduced to this ſhort iſſue, viz. whether ſatiated with the bleſſings of liberty; whether repenting of the folly of ſo recently aſſerting their unalienable rights, againſt foreign deſpots, at the expence of ſo much blood and treaſure, and ſuch painful and arduous ſtruggles, the people of America are now willing to reſign every privilege of freemen, and ſubmit to the domination of an abſolute government, that will embrace all America in one chain of deſpotiſm; or whether they will, with virtuous indignation, ſpurn at the ſhackles prepared for them, and confirm their liberties by a conduct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming freemen?</p>
            <p>That the new government will not be a confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſtates, as it ought, but one conſolidated govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, founded upon the deſtruction of the ſeveral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of the ſtates, we ſhall now ſhew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The powers of Congreſs, under the new conſtitution, are complete and unlimited over the purſe and the ſword, and are perfectly independent of, and ſupreme over, the ſtate governments, whoſe intervention in theſe great points is entirely deſtroyed. By virtue of their power of taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Congreſs may command the whole, or any part of the property of the people. They may impoſe what impoſts
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021344_0015_0FB31F160A4253D8"/>
upon commerce; they may impoſe what land-taxes, poll-taxes, exciſes, duties on all written inſtruments, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on every other article that they may judge proper; in ſhort, every ſpecies of taxation, whether of an external or internal nature, is compriſed in ſection the</hi> 8th, <hi>of article the</hi> 1ſt, <hi>viz. "The Congreſs ſhall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and exciſes, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As there is no one article of taxation reſerved to the ſtate governments, the Congreſs may monopolite every ſource of revenue, and thus indirectly demoliſh the ſtate governments, for without funds they could not exiſt; the taxes, duties, and exciſes impoſed by Congreſs may be ſo high as to render it impracticable to levy any further ſums on the ſame articles; but whether this ſhould be the caſe or not, if the ſtate governments ſhould preſume to impoſe taxes, duties, or exciſes, on the ſame articles with Congreſs, the latter may abrogate and repeal the laws whereby they are impoſed, upon the allegation that they interfere with the due collection of their taxes, duties, or exciſes, by virtue of the following clauſe, part of ſection 8th, article 1ſt, viz. "To make all laws which ſhall be neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers veſted by this conſtitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Congreſs might gloſs over this conduct by conſtruing every purpoſe for which the ſtate legiſlatures now lay taxes to be for the "general welfare," and therefore of their juriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the ſupremacy of the laws of the United States, is eſtabliſhed by article</hi> 6th, <hi>viz. "That this conſtitution and the laws of the United States, which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which ſhall be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land; and the judges in every ſtate ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the conſtitution or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding." It has been alledged, that the words "purſuant to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution," are a reſtriction upon the authority of Congreſs; but when it is conſidered, that by other ſections they are inveſted with every efficient power of government, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021344_0016_0FB31F171AEE97A0"/>
which may be exerciſed to the abſolute deſtruction of the ſtate governments, without any violation of even the forms of the conſtitution, this ſeeming reſtriction, as well as every other reſtriction in it appears to us to be nugatory and deluſive, and only introduced as a blind upon the real na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the government.

recited ſections, is ſo unlimited in its nature, may be ſo comprehenſive and boundleſs in its exerciſe, that this alone would be amply ſufficient to annihilate the ſtate governments, and ſwallow them up in the grand vortex of general empire.</p>
            <p>The judicial powers, veſted in Congreſs, are alſo ſo various and extenſive, that by legal ingenuity they may be extended to every caſe, and thus abſorb the ſtate ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciaries: and when we conſider the deciſive influence that a general judiciary would have over the civil polity of the ſeveral ſtates, we do not heſitate to pronounce, that this power, unaided by the legiſlative, would effect a conſolidation of the ſtates under one government.</p>
            <p>The powers of a court of equity, veſted by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the tribunals of Congreſs—powers which do not exiſt in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, unleſs ſo far as they can be incorporated with jury trial—would, in this ſtate, greatly contribute to this event. The rich and wealthy ſuitor would eagerly lay hold of the infinite mazes, perplexities, and delays, which a court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, with the appellate powers of the ſupreme court, in fact, as well as law, would furniſh him with, and thus the poor man, being plunged in the bottomleſs pit of legal diſcuſſion, would drop his demand in deſpair.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, conſolidation pervades the whole conſtitution. It begins with an annunciation that ſuch was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The main pillars of the fabric correſpond with it: and the concluding paragraph is a confirmation of it. The preamble begins with the words, "We the people of the United States," which is the ſtyle of a compact between individuals entering into a ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and not that of a confederation of ſtates. The other features of conſolidation, we have before noticed.</p>
            <p>Thus we have fully eſtabliſhed the poſition, that the powers veſted by this conſtitution in Congreſs, will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a conſolidation of the ſtates under one government, which even the advocates of this conſtitution admit, could not be done without the ſacrifice of all liberty.</p>
            <p>We diſſent, thirdly, becauſe, if it were practicable to govern ſo extenſive a territory as theſe United States in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, on the plan of a conſolidated government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the principles of liberty and the happineſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021344_0019_0FB31F1CDC23EB20"/>
of the people, yet the conſtruction of this conſtitution is not calculated to attain the object; for, independent of the nature of the caſe, it would of itſelf, neceſſarily produce a deſpotiſm, and that not by the uſual grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but with the celerity that has hitherto only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended revolutions effected by the ſword.</p>
            <p>To eſtabliſh the truth of this poſition, a curſory inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of the principles and form of this conſtitution will ſuffice.</p>
            <p>The firſt conſideration that this review ſuggeſts, is the omiſſion of a bill of rights, aſcertaining and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally eſtabliſhing thoſe inalienable and perſonal rights of men, without the full, free, and ſecure enjoyment of which, there can be no liberty, and over which it is not neceſſary for a good government to have the controul. The principal of which are, the rights of conſcience, perſonal liberty, by the clear and unequivocal eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the writ of habeas corpus, jury trial in criminal and civil caſes, by an impartial jury of the vicinage or county, with the common law proceedings, for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the accuſed in criminal proſecutions, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the preſs, that ſcourge of tyrants, and the grand bulwark of every other liberty and privilege. The ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations heretofore made in favour of them, in the ſtate conſtitutions, are entirely ſuperſeded by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>The legiſlature of a free country ſhould be ſo formed as to have a competent knowledge of its conſtituents, and enjoy their confidence. To produce theſe eſſential requiſites, the repreſentation ought to be fair, equal, and ſufficiently numerous to poſſeſs the ſame intereſts, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, opinions, and views, which the people themſelves would poſſeſs, were they all aſſembled; and ſo numerous as to prevent bribery and undue influence; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible to the people by frequent and fair elections, as to prevent their neglecting or ſacrificing the views and intereſts of their conſtituents, to their own purſuits.</p>
            <p>We will now bring the legiſlature, under this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, to the teſt of the foregoing principles, which will demonſtrate, that it is deficient in every eſſential qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a juſt and ſafe repreſentation.</p>
            <p>The houſe of repreſentatives is to conſiſt of ſixty-fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021344_0020_0FB31F1E9B829E28"/>
members; that is, one for about every fifty thouſand inhabitants, to be choſen every two years. Thirty-three members will form a quorum for doing buſineſs, and ſeventeen of theſe, being the majority, determine the ſenſe of the houſe.</p>
            <p>The ſenate, the other conſtituent branch of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, conſiſts of twenty-ſix members, being two from each ſtate, appointed by their legiſlatures every ſix years; fourteen ſenators make a quorum; the majority of whom, eight, determines the ſenſe of that body: except in judging on impeachments, or in making treaties, or in expelling a member, when two thirds of the ſenators pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent, muſt concur.</p>
            <p>The preſident is to have the controul over the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of laws, ſo far as to make the concurrence of two thirds of the repreſentatives and ſenators preſent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if he ſhould object to the laws.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that the liberties, happineſs, intereſts, and great concerns of the whole United States, may be dependent upon the integrity, virtue, wiſdom, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of twenty-five or twenty-ſix men. How inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate and unſafe a repreſentation! inadequate, becauſe the ſenſe and views of three or four millions of people, diffuſed over ſo extenſive a territory, compriſing ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious climates, products, habits, intereſts, and opinions, cannot be collected in ſo ſmall a body; and beſides, it is not a fair and equal repreſentation of the people, even in proportion to its number: for the ſmalleſt ſtate has as much weight in the ſenate as the largeſt; and from the ſmallneſs of the number to be choſen for both branches of the legiſlature; and from the mode of election and appointment, which is under the controul of Congreſs; and from the nature of the thing, men of the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated rank in life, will alone be choſen. The other orders in ſociety, ſuch as farmers, traders, and mechanics, who all ought to have a competent number of their beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed then in the legiſlature, will be totally unrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
            <p>The repreſentation is unſafe, becauſe in the exerciſe of ſuch great powers and truſts, it is ſo expoſed to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and undue influence, by the gift of the numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places of honour and emolument, at the diſpoſal of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021344_0021_0FB31F201460EB40"/>
the executive; by the arts and addreſs of the great and deſigning, and by direct bribery.</p>
            <p>The repreſentation is moreover inadequate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, becauſe of the long terms for which it is appointed, and the mode of its appointment, by which Congreſs may not only controul the choice of the people, but may ſo manage as to diveſt the people of this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental right, and become ſelf-elected.</p>
            <p>The number of members in the houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives may be increaſed to one for every thirty thouſand inhabitants. But when we conſider, that this cannot be done without the conſent of the ſenate, who, from their ſhare in the legiſlative, in the executive, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial departments, and permanency of appointment, will be the great efficient body in this government, and whoſe weight and predominancy would be abridged by an increaſe of the repreſentatives, we are perſuaded that this is a circumſtance that cannot be expected. On the contrary, the number of repreſentatives will probably be continued at ſixty-five, although the population of the country may ſwell to treble what it now is; unleſs a revolution ſhould effect a change.</p>
            <p>We have before noticed the judicial power, as it would effect a conſolidation of the ſtates into one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. We will now examine it, as it would affect the liberties and welfare of the people, ſuppoſing ſuch a government were practicable and proper.</p>
            <p>The judicial power, under the propoſed conſtitution, is founded on the well known principles of the civil law, by which the judge determines both on law and fact, and appeals are allowed from the inferior tribunals to the ſuperior, upon the whole queſtion; ſo that facts, as well as law, would be re-examined, and even new facts brought forward in the court of appeals; and to uſe the words of a very eminent civilian, "The cauſe is many times another thing before the court of appeals, than what it was at the time of the firſt ſentence."</p>
            <p>That this mode of proceeding is the one which muſt be adopted under this conſtitution, is evident from the following circumſtances: Firſt, that the trial by jury, which is the grand characteriſtic of the common law, is ſecured by the conſtitution, only in criminal caſes,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021344_0022_0FB31F2210B05AA8"/>
Secondly, that the appeal both from law and fact is expreſsly eſtabliſhed, which is utterly inconſiſtent with the principles of the common law, and trials by jury. The only mode in which an appeal from law and fact can be eſtabliſhed, is, by adopting the principles and practice of the civil law; unleſs the United States ſhould be drawn into the abſurdity of calling and ſwearing juries, merely for the purpoſe of contradicting their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, which would render juries contemptible, and worſe than uſeleſs. Thirdly, that the courts to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, would decide on all caſes of law and equity, which is a well known characteriſtic of the civil law, and theſe courts would have conuſance not only of the laws of the United States, and of treaties, and of caſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ambaſſadors, but of all caſes of admiralty and maritime juriſdiction, which laſt are matters belonging excluſively to the civil law, in every nation in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Not to enlarge upon the loſs of the invaluable right of trial by an unbiaſſed jury, ſo dear to every friend of liberty, the monſtrous expence and inconveniencies of the mode of proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>g to be adopted, are ſuch, as will prove intolerable to the people of this country. The lengthy proceedings of the civil law courts in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery of England, and in the courts of Scotland and France, are ſuch, that few men of moderate fortunes can endure the expence of: the poor man muſt, therefore, ſubmit to the wealthy. Length of purſe will too often prevail againſt right and juſtice. For inſtance, we are told by the learned judge Blackſtone, that a queſtion only on the property of an ox, of the value of three guineas, originating under the civil law proceedings in Scotland, after many interlocutory orders and ſentences below, was carried at length from the court of ſeſſions, the higheſt court in that part of Great-Britain, by way of appeal, to the houſe of lords, where the queſtion of law and fact was finally determined. He adds, that no pique or ſpirit could, in the court of king's bench, or common pleas, at Weſtminſter, have given countenance to ſuch a cauſe for a tenth part of the time, nor coſt a twentieth part of the expence. Yet the coſts, in the courts of king's bench, and common pleas, in England,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021344_0023_0FB31F2319F635B0"/>
are infinitely greater than thoſe which the people of this country have ever experienced.</p>
            <p>We abhor the idea of loſing the tranſcendent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of trial by jury, with the loſs of which, it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me learned author, that in Sweden the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the commons were extinguiſhed by an ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic ſenate: and that trial by jury, and the liberty of the people, went out together. At the ſame time, we regret the intolerable delay, the enormous expences, and infinite vexation, to which the people of this country will be expoſed, from the voluminous proceedings of the courts of civil law, and eſpecially from the appellate ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, by means of which, a man may be drawn from the utmoſt boundaries of this extenſive country, to the ſeat of the ſupreme court of the nation, to contend, perhaps, with a wealthy and powerful adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The conſequence of this eſtabliſhment will be, an abſolute confirmation of the power of ariſtocratical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the courts of juſtice: for the common people will not be able to contend or ſtruggle againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trial by jury, in criminal caſes, may alſo be excluded, by declaring that the libeller, for inſtance, ſhall be liable to an action of debt for a ſpecified ſum, thus evading the common law proſecution by indictment and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ial by jury. And the common courſe of proceeding againſt a ſhip for breach of revenue laws, by information (which will be claſſed among civil cauſes,) will, at the civil law, be claſſed within the reſort of a court where no jury inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes. Beſides, the benefit of jury trial in caſes of a criminal nature, which cannot be evaded, will be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of little value, by calling the accuſed to anſwer far from home, there being no proviſion that the trial be by a jury of the neighbourhood or country. Thus, an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of Pittſburgh, on a charge of a crime committed on the banks of the Ohio, may be obliged to defend himſelf at the ſide of the Delaware, and ſo vice verſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude this head: we obſerve, that the judges of the courts of Congreſs would not be independent, as they are not debarred from holding other offices, during the pleaſure of the preſident and ſenate, and as they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their ſupport, in part, from fees, alterable by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature.</hi>

               <hi>The next conſideration that the conſtitution preſents, is the undue and dangerous mixture of the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the ſame body poſſeſſing legiſlative, executive, and judicial powers. The ſenate is a conſtituent branch of the legiſlature; it has judicial power in judging on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments, and in this caſe unites in ſome meaſure the characters of judge and party, as all the principal officers are appointed by the preſident-general, with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſenate, and therefore they derive their offices in part from the ſenate.

            <p>
               <hi>And this great power may be exerciſed by the preſident and ten ſenators, being two thirds of fourteen, which is a quorum of that body. What an inducement would this offer to the miniſters of foreign powers to compaſs, by bribery, ſuch conceſſions as could not otherwiſe be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? It is the unvaried uſage of all free ſtates, whenever treaties interfere with the poſitive laws of the land, to make the intervention of the legiſlature neceſſary to give them operation. This became neceſſary, and was afforded by the parliament of Great-Britain, in conſequence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the late commercial treaty between that kingdom and France. As the ſenate judges on impeachments, who is to try the members of the ſenate, for the abuſe of this power? And none of the great appointments to office can be made without the conſent of the ſenate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such various, extenſive, and important powers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in one body of men, are inconſiſtent with all freedom. The celebrated Monteſquien tells us, that "when the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative and executive powers are united in the ſame perſon, or in the ſame body of magiſtrates, there can be no liberty, becauſe apprehenſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay ariſe, leſt the ſame
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021344_0025_0FB31F278B7B7BD0"/>
monarch or ſenate ſhould enact tyrannical laws, or execute them in a tyrannical manner."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, "there is no liberty, if the powers of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be not ſeparated from the legiſlative and executive powers. Were it joined with the legiſlative, the life and liberty of the ſubject would be expoſed to arbitrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul: for the judge would then be legiſlator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppreſſor. There would be an end of every thing, were the ſame man, or the ſame body of the nobles, or of the people, to exerciſe thoſe three powers; that of enacting laws; that of executing the public reſolutions; and that of judging the crimes or differences of individuals."</p>
            <p>The preſident-general is dangerouſly connected with the ſenate. His coincidence with the views of the ruling junto in that body, is made eſſential to his weight and importance in the government, which will deſtroy all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency and purity in the executive department; and having the power of pardoning, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a council, he may ſcreen from puniſhment the moſt treaſonable attempts that may be made on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people, when inſtigated by his coadjutors in the ſenate. Inſtead of this dangerous and improper mixture of the executive with the legiſlative and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, the ſupreme executive powers ought to have been placed in the preſident, with a ſmall independent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, made perſonally reſponſible for every appointment to office, or other act, by having their opinions recorded; and that without the concurrence of the majority of the quorum of this council, the preſident ſhould not be capable of taking any ſtep.</p>
            <p>We have before conſidered internal taxation, as it would affect the deſtruction of the ſtate governments, and produce one conſolidated government. We will now conſider that ſubject as it affects the perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the people.</p>
            <p>The power of direct taxation applies to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual: as Congreſs, under this new government, is expreſsly veſted with the authority of laying a capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or poll-tax upon every perſon, to any amount. This is a tax, that, however oppreſſive in its nature, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021344_0026_0FB31F2AB45C4430"/>
unequal in its operation, is certain as to its produce, and ſimple in its collection. It cannot be evaded, like the objects of impoſt or exciſe; and will be paid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that a man hath, will he give for his head. This tax is ſo congenial to the nature of deſpotiſm, that it has ever been a favourite under ſuch governments. Some of thoſe who were in the late general convention, from this ſtate, have long laboured to introduce a poll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax among us.</p>
            <p>The power of direct taxation will further apply to every individual: as Congreſs may tax land, cattle, trades, occupations, &amp;c. to any amount; and every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of internal taxation is of that nature, that, however oppreſſive, the people will have but this alternative, either to pay the tax, or let their property be taken, for all reſiſtence will be vain. The ſtanding army and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect militia would enforce the collection.</p>
            <p>For the moderate exerciſe of this power, there is no controul left in the ſtate-governments, whole interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is deſtroyed. No relief or redreſs of grievances can be extended, as heretofore, by them. There is not even a declaration of rights, to which the people may appeal for the vindication of their wrongs, in the courts of juſtice. They muſt, therefore, implicitly obey the moſt arbitrary laws: as the worſt of them will be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the principles and form of the conſtitution: and that ſtrongeſt of all checks upon the conduct of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, reſponſibility to the people, will not exiſt in this government. The permanency of the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſenators and repreſentatives, and the controul the Congreſs have over their election, will place them independent of the ſentiments and reſentment of the people: and the adminiſtration having a greater intereſt in the government, than in the community, there will be no conſideration to reſtrain them from oppreſſion and tyranny. In the government of this ſtate, under the old confederation, the members of the legiſlature are taken from among the people: and their intereſts and welfare are ſo inſeparably connected with thoſe of their conſtituents, that they can derive no advantage from oppreſſive laws and taxes: for they would ſuffer in common with their fellow citizens; would partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021344_0027_0FB31F2C6C91D210"/>
in the burdens they impoſe on the community, as they muſt return to the common level after a ſhort period; and, notwithſtanding every exertion of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, every means of corruption, a neceſſary rotation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them from permanency in the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>This large ſtate is to have but ten members in that Congreſs, which is to have the liberty, propert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and deareſt concerns of every individual in this vaſt country, at abſolute command: and even theſe ten perſons, who are to be our only guardians—who are to ſuperſede the legiſlature of Pennſylvania—will not be of the choice of the people, nor amenable to them. From the mode of their election and appointment, they will conſiſt of the lordly and high minded—of men who will have no congenial feelings with the people, but a perfect indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for, and contempt of them. They will conſiſt of thoſe harpies of power, that prey upon the very vitals—that riot on the miſeries of the community. But we will ſuppoſe, although in all pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To attain this, the majority of the deputies of the twelve other ſtates in Congreſs muſt be alike well diſpoſed—muſt alike forego the ſweets of power—and relinquiſh the purſuits of ambition, which, from the nature of things, is not to be expected. If the people part with a reſponſible repre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE conſtitution, which I encloſed to the general aſſembly in a late official letter, appears without

               </gap>dered rather important to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at leaſt, by being miſunderſtood by ſome, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented by o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hers.—As I diſdain to conceal the rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons for witholding my ſubſcription, I have always been, ſtill am, and ever ſhall be, ready to proclaim them to the world. To the legiſlature, therefore, by whom I was deputed to the federal convention, I beg leave now to addreſs them: aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cting no indifference to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic opinion, but reſolved not to court it by an unmanly ſacrifice of my own judgment.</p>
            <p>As this explanation with involve a ſummary, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral review of our federal ſituation, you will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rdon me, I truſt, although I ſhould tranſgreſs the uſual bounds of a letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before my departure for the convention, I believed, that the confederation was not ſo emin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntly defective, as it had been ſuppoſed. But after I had entered into a free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with thoſe who were beſt informed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and intereſt of each ſtate; after I had compared the intelligence derived from them, with the properties which ought to characteriſe the government of our union, I became perſuaded, that the confederation was diſtitute of every energy, which a conſtitution of the United States ought to poſſeſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the objects propoſed by its inſtitution were, that it ſhould be a ſhield againſt foreign hoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity, and a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort againſt domeſtic commotion; that it ſhould cheriſh trade, and promote the proſperity of the ſtates under its care.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But theſe are not among the attributes of our preſent union. Severe experience under the preſſure of war— a ruinous weakneſs manifeſted ſince the return of peace; and the contemplation of thoſe dangers, which darken the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſpect, have condemned the hope of grandeur and of ſafety under the auſpices of the confederation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the exigencies of war, indeed, the hiſtory of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects is but ſhort; the final ratification having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed until the beginning of the year</hi> 1781. <hi>But however ſhort, this period is diſtinguiſhed by melancholy teſtimonies of its inability to maintain in harmony, the ſocial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the ſtates, to defend Congreſs againſt encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021344_0032_0FB31F369A572DE8"/>
on their rights, and to obtain, by requiſitions, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the federal treaſury, or recruits to the federal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I ſhall not attempt an enumeration of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances; but leave to your own remembrance and the records of Congreſs, the ſupport of the aſſertions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ſeaſon of peace too, not many years have elapſed; and yet each of them has produced fatal examples of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, and ſometimes of pointed oppoſition to federal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. To the various remonſtrances of Congreſs, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, for a gloomy, but unexaggerated narrative of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which our faith, honor, and happineſs, have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the failure of the ſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But theſe evils are paſt; and ſome may be led by an honeſt zeal to conclude that they cannot be repeated. Yes ſir, they will be repeated as long as the confederation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and will bring with them other miſchiefs, ſpringing from the ſame ſource, which cannot be yet foreſeen in their full array of terror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we examine the conſtitution and laws of the ſeveral ſtates, it is immediately diſcovered that the law of nations is unprovided with ſanctions in many caſes, which deeply affect public dignity and public juſtice. The letter however of the confederation does not permit Congreſs to remedy theſe defects, and ſuch an authority, although evidently deducible from its ſpirit, cannot, without violation of the ſecond article, be aſſumed. Is it not a political phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that the head of the confederacy ſhould be doomed to be plunged into war, from its wretched impotency to check offences againſt this law; and ſentenced to witneſs in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avaling anguiſh the infraction of their engagements to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſovereigns?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And yet this is not the only grievous point of weakneſs. After a war ſhall be inevitable, the requiſitions of Congreſs for quotas of men or money, will again prove unproductive, and fallacious. Two cauſes will always conſpire to this baneful conſequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> government can be ſtable, which hangs on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inclination alone, unbiaſſed by the coercion; and</hi> 2, <hi>from the very connection between ſtates bound to proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate contributions, jealouſies and ſuſpicions naturally ariſe, which at leaſt chill the ardour, if they do not excite the murmurs of the whole. I do not forget indeed, that by
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021344_0033_0FB31F380EF164C8"/>
one ſudden impulſe our part of the American continent has been thrown into a military poſture, and that in the earlier annals of the war, our armies marched to the field on the mere recommendations of Congreſs. But ought we to argue from a conteſt, thus ſignalized by the magnitude of its ſtake, that as often as a flame ſhall be hereafter kindled, the ſame enthuſiaſm will fill our legions, or renew them, as they may be filled by loſſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If not, where ſhall we find protection? Impreſſions, like thoſe, which prevent a compliance with requiſitions of regular forces, will deprive the American republic of the ſervices of militia. But let us ſuppoſe, that they are attainable, and acknowledge, as I always ſhall, that they are the natural ſupport of a free government. When it is remembered, that in their abſence agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt languiſh; that they are not habituated to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary expoſures and the rigour of military diſcipline, and that the neceſſity of holding in readineſs ſucceſſive detachments, carries the expence far beyond that of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtments—this reſource ought to be adopted with caution.</p>
            <p>As ſtrongly too am I perſuaded, that the requiſitions for money will not be more cordially received. For beſides the diſtruſt, which would prevail with reſpect to them alſo; beſides the opinion, entertained by each ſtate of its own liberality and unſatisfied demands againſt the United States, there is another conſideration, not leſs worthy of attention. The firſt rule for determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each quota the value of all lands granted or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, and of the buildings and improvements thereon. It is no longer doubted, that an equitable, uniform mode of eſtimating that value, is impracticable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore twelve ſtates have ſubſtituted the number of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants under certain limitations, as the ſtandard acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which money is to be furniſhed. But under the ſubſiſting articles of the union, the aſſent of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth ſtate is neceſſary, and has not yet been given. This does of itſelf leſſen the hope of procuring a reven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e for federal uſes; and the miſcarriage of the impoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rivets our deſpondency.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe diſappointments, it would afford ſome conſolation, if when rebellion ſhall threaten any ſtate,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021344_0034_0FB31F39CC2C7098"/>
an ultimate aſylum could be found under the wing of Congreſs. But it is at leaſt equivocal whether they can intrude forces into a ſtate, rent aſunder by civil diſcord, even with the pureſt ſolicitude for our federal welfare, and on the moſt urgent entreaties of the ſtate itſelf. Nay the very allowance of this power would be pageantry alone, from the want of money and of men.</p>
            <p>To theſe defects of congreſſional power, the hiſtory of man has ſubjoined others, not leſs alarming. I earneſtly pray, that the recollection of common ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which terminated in common glory, may check the ſallies of violence, and perpetuate mutual friendſhip between the ſtates. But I cannot preſume, that we are ſuperior to thoſe unſocial paſſions, which under like circumſtances have infeſted more ancient nations. I cannot preſume, that through all time, in the daily mixture of American citizens with each other, in the conflicts for commercial advantages, in the diſcontents which the neighbourhood of territory has been ſeen to engender in other quarters of the globe, and in the efforts of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intrigue—thirteen diſtinct communities under no effective ſuperintending controul (as the United States confeſſedly now are, notwithſtanding the bold terms of the confederation) will avoid a hatred to each other deep and deadly.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this enquiry, we ſhall find the general proſperity to decline under a ſyſtem thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerved. No ſooner is the merchant prepared for fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ports, with the treaſures which this new world kindly offers to his acceptance, than it is announced to him, that they are ſhut againſt American ſhipping, or opened under oppreſſive regulations. He urges Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to a counter-policy, and is anſwered only by a condolance on the general misfortune. He is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſtruck with the conviction, that until excluſion ſhall be oppoſed to excluſion, and reſtriction to reſtriction, the American flag will be diſgraced. For who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that thirteen legiſlatures, viewing commerce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different regulations, and fancying themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from every obligation to concede the ſmalleſt of their commercial advantages for the benefit of the whole, will be wrought into a concert of action and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021344_0035_0FB31F3C84E67888"/>
defiance of every prejudice? Nor is this all: Let the great improvements be recounted, which have enriched and illuſtrated Europe: Let it be noted, how few thoſe are, which will be abſolutely denied to the United States, comprehending within their boundaries the choiceſt bleſſings of climate, ſoil, and navigable waters; then let the moſt ſanguine patriot baniſh if he can, the mortifying belief, that all theſe muſt ſleep, until they ſhall be rouſed by the vigour of a national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I have not exemplified the preceding remarks by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute details; becauſe they are evidently fortified by truth, and the conſciouſneſs of the United States of America. I ſhall, therefore, no longer deplore the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs of the confederation to ſecure our peace; but procced, with a truly unaffected diſtruſt of my own opinions, to examine what order of powers the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States ought to enjoy? How they ought to be defended againſt encroachments? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can be interwoven in the confederation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an alteration of its very eſſence, or muſt be lodged in new hands? Shewing at the ſame time the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which ſeem to await us, from a diſſolution of the union or partial confederacies.</p>
            <p>To mark the kind and degree of authority, which ought to be confided to the government of the United States, is no more than to reverſe the deſcription which I have already given, of the defects of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>From thence it will follow, that the operations of peace and war will be clogged without regular advances of money, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>t theſe will be ſlow indeed, if depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on ſupplication alone. For what better name do requiſitions deſerve, which may be evaded or oppoſed without the fear of coercion? But although coercion is an indiſpenſable ingredient, it ought not to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt a ſtate, as a ſtate; it being impoſſible to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it except by blockading the trade of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, or carrying war into its bowels. Even if theſe violent ſchemes were eligible, in other reſpects, both of them might perhaps be defeated by the ſcantineſs of the public cheſt; would be tardy in their complete ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021344_0036_0FB31F3D91D300E8"/>
as the expence of the land and naval equipments muſt be firſt reimburſed; and might drive the proſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate into the deſperate reſolve of inviting foreign al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances. Againſt each of them lie ſeparate unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objections. A blockade is not equally applicable to all the ſtates, they being differently circumſtanced in commerce and in ports; nay, an excommunication form the privilege of the union would be vain, becauſe every regulation or prohibition may be eaſily eluded under the rights of American citizenſhip, or of foreign nations. But how ſhall we ſpeak of the intruſion of troops? Shall we arm citizens againſt citizens, and habituate them to ſhed kindred blood? Shall we riſque the inflicting of wounds which will generate a rancour never to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued? Would there be no room to fear, that an army accuſtomed to fight, for the eſtabliſhment of authority, would ſalute an Emperor of their own? Let us not bring theſe things into jeopardy. Let us rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the ſame proceſs by which individuals are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to contribute to the government of their own ſtates. Inſtead of making requiſitions to the legiſlatures it would appear more proper, that taxes ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the federal head, under due modifications and guards; that the collectors ſhould demand from the citizens their reſpective quotas, and be ſupported as in the collection of ordinary taxes.</p>
            <p>It follows too, that, as the general government will be reſponſible to foreign nations, it ought to be able to annul any offenſive meaſure, or enforce any public right. Perhaps among the topics on which they may be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved or complain, the commercial intercourſe, and the manner in which contracts are diſcharged, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the principal articles of clamour.</p>
            <p>It follows too, that the general government ought to be the ſupreme arbiter, for adjuſting every contention among the ſtates. In all their connections, therefore, with each other, and particularly in commerce, which will probably create the greateſt diſcord, it ought to hold the reins.</p>
            <p>It follows too, that the general government ought to protect each ſtate againſt domeſtic as well as external violence.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:021344_0037_0FB31F3ED4517638"/>And laſtly, it follows, that through the general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment alone, can we ever aſſume the rank to which we are entitled by our reſources and ſituation.</p>
            <p>Should the people of America ſurrender theſe powers, they can be paramount to the conſtitutions and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary acts of legiſlation, only by being delegated by them. I do not pretend to affirm, but I venture to believe, that if the confederation had been ſolemnly queſtioned in oppoſition to our conſtitution, or even to one of our laws, poſterior to it, it muſt have given way. For never did it obtain a higher ratification, than a reſolution of aſſembly in the daily form.</p>
            <p>This will be one ſecurity againſt encroachment. But another not leſs effectual is, to exclude the individual ſtates from any agency in the national government, as far as it may be ſafe, and their interpoſition may not be abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But now, Sir, permit me to declare, that in my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment, the powers by which alone the bleſſings of a general government can be accompliſhed, cannot be interwoven in the confederation, without a change in its very eſſence, or, in other words, that the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be thrown aſide. This is almoſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from the inefficacy of requiſitions, and from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of converting them into acts of authority. My ſuffrage, as a citizen, is alſo for additional powers. But to whom ſhall we commit theſe acts of authority, theſe additional powers? To Congreſs? When I formerly lamented the defects in the juriſdiction of Congreſs, I had no view to indicate any other opinion, than that the federal head ought not to be ſo circumſcribed. For free as I am at all times to profeſs my reverence for that body, and the individuals who compoſe it, I am yet equally free to make known my averſion to repoſe ſuch a truſt in a tribunal ſo conſtituted. My objections are not the viſions of theory, but the reſult of my own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in America, and of the experience of others abroad. 1. The legiſlative and executive are concentred in the ſame perſons. This, where real power exiſts, muſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in tyranny. 2. The repreſentation of the ſtates bears no proportion to their importance. This is an unreaſonable ſubjection of the will of the majority to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021344_0038_0FB31F404E1C51E8"/>
that of the minority. 3. The mode of election, and the liability <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f being recalled, may too often render the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates rather partizans of their own ſtates than repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the Union. 4. Cabal and intrigue muſt conſequently gain an aſcendency in a courſe of years. 5. A ſingle houſe of legiſlation, will ſometimes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, perhaps paſſionate. 6. As long as ſeven ſtates are required for the ſmalleſt, and nine for the greateſt votes, may not ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eign influence at ſome future day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate itſelf, ſo as to interrupt every active exertion? 7. To crown the whole, it is ſcarce within the verge of poſſibility, that ſo numerous an aſſembly ſhould acquire that ſecrecy, diſpatch, and vigour, which ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the teſt of excellence in the executive department.</p>
            <p>My inference from theſe facts and principles, is, that the new powers muſt be depoſited in a new body, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a conſolidation of the union, as far as the circumſtances of the ſtates will allow. Perhaps, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſome may mediate its diſſolution, and others, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial confederacies.</p>
            <p>The firſt is an idea awful indeed, and irreconcileable with a very early, and hitherto uniform conviction, that without union, we muſt be undone. For, before the voice of war was heard, the pulſe of the then colonies was tried, and ſound to beat in uniſon. The unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted labour of our enemies was to divide, and the policy of every Congreſs, to bind us together. But in no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was this truth more clearly diſplayed, than in the prudence with which independence was unfolded to the ſight, and in the forbearance to declare it, until America almoſt unanimouſly called for it. After we had thus launched into troubles, never before explored, and in the hour of heavy diſtreſs, the remembrance of our ſocial ſtrength, not only forbade deſpair, but drew from Congreſs the moſt illuſtrious repetition of their ſettled purpoſe to deſpiſe all terms, ſhort of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Behold, then, how ſucceſsful and glorious we have been, while we acted in fraternal concord. But let us diſcard the illuſion, that by this ſucceſs, and this glory, the creſt of danger has irrecoverably fallen. Our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are yet too youthful to have acquired ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021344_0039_0FB31F425330B458"/>
from habit. Our very quiet depends upon the duration of the union. Among the upright and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, few can read without emotion the future <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate of the ſtates, if ſevered from each other. Then ſhall we learn the full weight of foreign intrigue. Then ſhall we hear of partitions of our country. If a prince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the luſt of conqueſt, ſhould uſe one ſtate as the inſtrument of enſlaving others—if every ſtate is to be wearied by perpetual alarms, and compelled to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain large military eſtabliſhments—if all queſtions are to be decided by an appeal to arms, where a difference of opinion cannot be removed by negociation—in a word, if all the direful misfortunes which haunt the peace of rival nations, are to triumph over the land, for what have we to contend? why have we exhauſted our wealth? why have we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ely betrayed the heroic martyrs of the federal cauſe?</p>
            <p>But dreadful as the total diſſolution of the union is to my mind, I entertain no leſs horror at the thought of partial confederacies. I have not the leaſt ground for ſuppoſing, that an overture of this kind would be liſtened to by a ſingle ſtate, and the preſumption is, that the politics of the greater part of the ſtates, flow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom the warmeſt attachment to an union of the whole. If, however, a leſſer confederacy could be obtained by Virginia, let me conjure my countrymen, well to weigh the probable conſequences, before they attempt to form it.</p>
            <p>On ſuch an event, the ſtrength of the union would be divided in two, or perhaps three parts. Has it ſo increaſed ſince the war as to be diviſible—and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſufficient for our happineſs?</p>
            <p>The utmoſt limit of any partial confederacy, which Virginia could expect to form, would comprehend the three ſouthern ſtates, and her nearneſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>Again may I aſk, whether the oppul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:021344_0040_0FB31F43589ACC30"/>At all times muſt a ſouthern confederacy ſupport ſhips of war, and ſoldiery? As ſoon would a navy move from the foreſt, and an army ſpring from the earth, as ſuch a confederacy, indebted, impoveriſhed, in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and deſtitute of men, could, for ſome years at leaſt, provide an ample defence for itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let it not be forgotten, that nations, which can enforce their rights, have large claims againſt the United States, and that the creditor may inſiſt on payment from any of them. Which of them would probably be the victim? The moſt productive, and the moſt expoſed. When vexeſt by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſals or war, the ſouthern ſtates will ſue for alliance on this continent or beyond ſea. If for the former, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an union of the whole is decided; if for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, America will, I fear, re-act the ſcenes of confuſion and bloodſhed, exhibited among moſt of thoſe nations, which have, too late, repented the folly of relying on auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Two or more confederacies cannot but be competitors for power. The ancient friendſhip between the citizens of America, being thus cut off, bitterneſs and hoſtility will ſucceed in its place; in order to prepare againſt ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger, we ſhall be compelled to veſt ſome where or other power approaching near to military government.</hi>

               <hi>The annals of the world have abounded ſo much with inſtances of a divided people being a prey to foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, that I ſhall not reſtrain my apprehenſions of it, ſhould our union be torn aſunder.

               <hi>In ſhort, Sir, I am fatigued with ſummoning up to my imagination the miſeries which will harraſs the United States, if torn from each other, and which will not end until they are ſuperſeded by freſh miſchiefs under the yoke of a tyrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come, therefore, to the laſt, and perhaps only refuge in our difficulties, a conſolidation of the union, as far as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will permit. To fulfil this deſirable object, the conſtitution was framed by the federal convention.

I was ſent to exerciſe my judgment, and to exerciſe it was my fixed determination; being inſtructed by even an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect acquaintance with mankind, that ſelf-approbation is the only true reward which a political career can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, and that popularity would have been but another name for perfidy, if to ſecure it, I had given up the freedom of thinking for myſelf.</hi>

               <hi>It would have been a peculiar pleaſure to me to have aſcertained before I left Virginia, the temper and genius of my fellow citizens, conſidered relatively to a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo ſubſtantially differing from the confederation as that which is now ſubmitted. But this was, for many obvious reaſons, impoſſible; and I was thereby deprived of what I thought the neceſſary guides.</hi>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:021344_0042_0FB31F4840B36D98"/>
               <hi>I ſaw, however, that the confederation was tottering from its own weakneſs, and that the ſitting of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a ſignal of its total inſufficiency. I was therefore ready to aſſent to a ſcheme of government, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and which went beyond the limits of the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, believing, that without being too extenſive it would h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve preſerved our tranquility, until that temper and that genius ſhould be collected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the plan which is now before the general aſſembly, was on its paſſage through the convention, I moved, that the ſtate conventions ſhould be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to amend, and that a ſecond general convention ſhould be holden, to diſcuſs the amendments, which ſhould be ſuggeſted by them. This motion was in ſome meaſure juſtified by the manner in which the confederation was forwarded originally, by congreſs to the ſtate legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in many of which amendments were propoſed, and thoſe amendments were afterwards examined in Congreſs. Such a motion was doubly expedient here as the delegation of ſo much more power was ſought for. But it was negatived. I then expreſſed my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to ſign. My reaſons were the following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſaid in the reſolutions which accompany the conſtitution, that it is to be ſubmitted to a convention of delegates choſen in each ſtate by the people thereof, for their aſſent and ratification. The meaning of theſe terms is allowed univerſally to be, that the convention muſt either adopt the conſtitution in the whole, or reject it in the whole, and is poſitively forbidden to amend. If therefore, I had ſigned, I ſhould have felt myſelf bound to be ſilent as to amendments, and to endeavor to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the conſtitution without the correction of a letter. With this conſequence before my eyes, and with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to attempt an amendment, I was taught, by a regard for conſiſtency, not to ſign.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My opinion always was, and ſtill is, that every citizen of America, let the criſis be what it may, ought to have a full opportunity to propoſe, through his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, any amendment which, in his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, tends to the public welfare. By ſigning, I ſhould have contradicted this ſentiment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A conſtitution ought to have the hearts of the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021344_0043_0FB31F494CA58C80"/>
people on its ſide. But if at a future day it ſhould be burthenſome after having been adopted in the whole, and they ſhould inſinuate that it was in ſome meaſure forced upon them, by being confined to the ſingle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative of taking or rejecting it altogether, under my impreſſions, and with my opinions, I ſhould not be able to juſtify myſelf had I ſigned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I was always ſatisfied, as I have now experienced, that this great ſubject would be placed in new lights and attitudes by the criticiſm of the world, and that no man can aſſure himſelf how a conſtitution will work for a courſe of years, until at leaſt he ſhall have heard the obſervations of the people at large. I alſo fear more from inaccuracies in a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtitution, than from groſs er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in any other compoſition; becauſe our deareſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts are to be regulated by it; and power, if looſely given, eſpecially where it will be interpreted with great latitude, may bring ſorrow in its execution. Had I ſigned with theſe ideas, I ſhould have virtually ſhut my ears againſt the information which I ardently deſired.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I was afraid, that if the conſtitution was to be ſubmitted to the people, to be wholly adopted or wholly rejected by them, they would not only reject it, but bid a laſting farwel to the union. This formidable event I wiſhed to avert, by keeping myſelf free to propoſe amendmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and thus, if poſſible, to remove the obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to an effectual government. But it will be aſked, whether all theſe arguments were not well weighed in convention. They were, Sir, with great candor. Nay, when I called to mind the reſpectability of thoſe, with whom I was aſſociated, I almoſt loſt confidence in theſe principles. On other occaſions, I ſhould chearfully have yielded to a majority; on this, the ſate of thouſands, yet unborn, enjoined me not to yield until I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</p>
            <p>Again, may I be aſked, why the mode pointed out in the conſtitution for its amendment, may not be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſecurity againſt its imperfections, without now arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in its progreſs? My anſwers are, 1. That it is better to amend, while we have the conſtitution in our power, while the paſſions of deſigning men are not yet enlifted, and while a bare majority of the ſtates may
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021344_0044_0FB31F4E67310908"/>
amend, than to wait for the uncertain aſſent of three fourths of the ſtates. 2. That a bad feature in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becomes more and more fixed every day. 3. That frequent changes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f a conſtitution, even if practicable, ought not to be wiſhed, but avoided as much as poſſible. And 4 That in the preſent caſe, it may be queſtionable, whether, after the particular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of its operation ſhall be diſcerned, three fourths of the ſtates can be induced to amend.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, that it is no eaſy taſk, to deviſe a ſcheme which ſhall be ſuitable to the views of all. Many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients have occured to me, but none of them appear leſs exceptionable than this; that if our convention ſhould chuſe to amend, another federal convention be recommended: that in that federal convention the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments propoſed by this or any other ſtate be diſcuſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it incorporated in the conſtitution or rejected, or if a proper number of the other ſtates ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to accede to a ſecond convention, the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be again laid before the ſame ſtate conventions, which ſhall again aſſemble on the ſummons of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutives, and it ſhall be either wholly adopted, or wholly rejected, without a further power of amendment. I count ſuch a delay as nothing, in compariſon with ſo grand an object; eſpecially too as the privilege of amending muſt terminate after the uſe of it once.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now conclude this letter, which is already too long, were it not incumbent on me, from having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for amendments, to ſet forth the particulars, which I conceive to require correction. I undertake this with reluctance: becauſe it is remote from my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to catch the prejudices or prepoſſeſſions of any man. But as I mean only to manifeſt that I have not been actuated by caprice, and now to explain every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection at full length would be an immenſe labour, I ſhall content myſelf with enumerating certain heads, in which the conſtitution is moſt repugnant to my wiſhes.</p>
            <p>The two firſt points are the equality of ſuffrage in the ſenate, and the ſubmiſſion of commerce to a mere majority in the legiſlature, with no other check than the reviſion of the preſident. I conjecture that neither of theſe things can be corrected; and particularly the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021344_0045_0FB31F538CF517C8"/>
former, without which we muſt have riſen perhaps in diſorder.</p>
            <p>But I am ſanguine in hoping that in every other juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obnoxious cauſe, Virginia will be ſeconded by a majority of the ſtates. I hope that ſhe will be ſeconded, 1. In cauſing all ambiguities of expreſſion to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely explained. 2. In rendering the preſident ineligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after a given number of years. 3. In taking from him the power of nominating to the judiciary officers, or of filling up vacancies which there may happen dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the receſs of the ſenate, by granting commiſſions which ſhall expire at the end of their next ſeſſions. 4.

            <p>The late convention have ſubmitted to your conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation a plan of a new federal government. The ſubject is highly intereſting to your future welfare. Whether it be calculated to promote the great ends of civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, viz. the happineſs and proſperity of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it behoves you well to conſider, uninfluenced by the authority of names. Inſtead of that frenzy of enthuſiaſm, that has actuated the citizens of Pennſylvania, in their approbation of the propoſed plan, before it was poſſible that it could be the reſult of a rational inveſtigation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its principles: it ought to be diſpaſſionately and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately examined, and its own intrinſic merit, the only criterion of your patronage. If ever free and unbiaſſed diſcuſſion was proper or neceſſary, it is on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. All the bleſſings of liberty and the deareſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of freemen, are now at ſtake and dependent on your preſent conduct. Thoſe who are competent to the taſk of developing the principles of governmnnt, ought to be encouraged to come forward, and thereby the better enable the people to make a proper judgment; for the ſcience of government is ſo abſtrute, that few are able to judge for themſelves, without ſuch aſſiſtance the people are too apt to yield an implicit aſſent to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of thoſe characters, whoſe abilities are held in the higheſt eſteem, and to thoſe in whoſe integrity and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm they can confide; not conſidering that the love of domination is generally in proportion to talents, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and ſuperior acquirements; and that the men of the greateſt purity of intention may be made inſtruments of deſpotiſm in the hands of the artful and deſigning. If it were not for the ſtability and attachment which time and habit gives to forms of government, it would be in the power of the enlightened and aſpiring few, if they ſhould combine, at any time to deſtroy the beſt eſtabliſhments, and even make the people the inſtruments of their own ſubjugation.</p>
            <p>The late revolution having effaced in a great meaſure all former habits, and the preſent inſtitutions are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021344_0048_0FB31F59CD746D70"/>
that there exiſts not that great reluctance to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſo remarkable in old communities, which accords with reaſon, for the moſt comprehenſive mind cannot forſee the full operation of material changes on civil polity; it is the genius of the common law to reſiſt innovation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The wealthy and ambitious, who in every community think they have a right to lord it over their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have availed themſelves, very ſucceſsfully, of this favourable diſpoſition; for the people thus unſettled in their ſentiments, have been prepared to accede to any extreme of government; all the diſtreſſes and difficulties they experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, preceeding from various cauſes, have been aſcribed to the impotency of the preſent confederation, and thence they have been led to expect full relief from the adoption of the propoſed ſyſtem of government; and in the other event, immediate ruin an annihilation as a nation. Theſe characters flatter themſelves that they have lulled all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt and jealouſy of their new plan, by gaining the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the two men in whom America has the higheſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and now triumphantly exult in the completion of their long meditated ſchemes of power and aggrandiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I would be very far from inſinuating, that the two illuſtrious perſonages alluded to, have not the welfare of their country at heart; but that the unſuſpecting goodneſs and zeal of the one has been impoſed on in a ſubject of which he muſt be neceſſarily inexperienced, from his other arduous engagements; and that the weakneſs and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion attendant on old age, has been practiſed on in the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am fearful that the principles of government incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Mr. Adams's treatiſe, and enforced in the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſſays and paragraphs in the newſpapers, have miſled ſome well deſigning members of the late convention. But it will appear in the ſequel, that the conſtruction of the propoſed plan of government is infinitely more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have been anxiouſly expecting that ſome enlightened patriot would, ere this, have taken up the pen to expoſe the ſutility, and counteract the baneful tendency of ſuch principles. Mr. Adams's</hi> fine qua non <hi>of a good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is three balancing powers, whoſe repelling qualities
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:021344_0049_0FB31F5BC763B940"/>
are to produce an equilibrium of intereſts, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs of the whole community. He aſſerts, that the adminiſtrators of every government, will ever be actuated by views of private intereſt and ambition, to the prejudice of the public good; that therefore the only effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al method to ſecure the rights of the people and promote their welfare, is to create an oppoſition of intereſts between the members of two diſtinct bodies, in the exerciſe of the powers of government, and balanced by thoſe of a third. This hypotheſis ſuppoſes human wiſdom competent to the taſk of inſtituting three co-equal orders in government, and a correſponding weight in the community to enable them reſpectively to exerciſe their ſeveral parts, and whoſe views and intereſts ſhould be ſo diſtinct as to prevent a coalition of any two of them for the deſtruction of the third. Mr. Adams, although he has traced the conſtitution of every form of government that ever exiſted, as far as hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affords materials, has not been able to adduce a ſingle inſtance of ſuch a government; he indeed ſays, that the Britiſh conſtitution is ſuch in theory, but this is rather a confirmation that his principles are chimerical and not to be reduced to practice. If ſuch an organization of power were practicable, how long would it continue? not a day, for there is ſo great a diſparity in the talents, wiſdom, and induſtry of mankind, that the ſcale would preſently prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate to one or the other body, and with every acceſſion of power the means of further increaſe would be greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The ſtate of ſociety in England is much more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to ſuch a ſcheme of government than that of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. There they have a powerful hereditary nobility, and real diſtinctions of rank and intereſts; but even there, for want of that perfect equality of power and diſtinction of intereſts, in the three orders of government, they exiſt but in name; the only operative and efficient check, upon the conduct of adminiſtration, is the ſenſe of the people at large.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe a government could be formed and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch principles, would it anſwer the great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of civil ſociety? if the adminiſtrators of every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are actuated by views of private intereſts and ambition, how is the welfare and happineſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munity to be the reſult of ſuch jarring adverſe intereſts</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:021344_0050_0FB31F5F4B778FE8"/>Therefore, as different orders in government will not produce the good of the whole, we muſt recur to other principles. I believe it will be found that the form of government, which holds thoſe intruſted with power, in the greateſt reſponſibility to their conſtituents, the beſt calculated for freemen. A republican or free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, can only exiſt where the body of the people are virtuous, and where property is equally divided; in ſuch a government the people are the ſovereign, and their ſenſe or opinion is the criterion of every public meaſure; for when this ceaſes to be the caſe, the nature of the government is changed, and an ariſtocracy, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or deſpotiſm will riſe on its ruin. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reſponſibility is to be attained, in a ſimple ſtruction of government; for the great body of the people never ſteadily attend to the operations of government, and for want of due information are liable to be impoſed on.— If you complicate the plan by various orders, the people will be perplexed and divided in their ſentiments about the ſource of abuſes or miſconduct: ſome will impute it to the ſenate, others to the houſe of repreſentatives, and ſo on, that the interpoſition of the people may be rendered imperfect or perhaps wholly abortive. But if, imitating the conſtitution of Pennſylvania, you veſt all the legiſlative power in one body of men (ſeparating the executive and judicial) elected for a ſhort period, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily excluded by rotation from permanency, and guarded from precipitancy and ſurpriſe by delays im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on its proceedings, you will create the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſponſibility, for then, whenever the people feel a grievance, they cannot miſtake the authors, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the remedy with certainty and effect, diſcardin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed thus much, I ſhall now proceed to the examination of the propoſed plan of government; and I truſt ſhall make it appear to the meaneſt capacity, that it has none of the eſſential requiſites of a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that it is neither founded on thoſe ballancing reſtraining powers, recommended by Mr. Adams and attempted in the Britiſh conſtitution, or poſſeſſed of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:021344_0051_0FB31F6465527180"/>
that reſponſibility to its conſtituents, which in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is the only effectual ſecurity for the liberties and happineſs of the people; but on the contrary, that it is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the propoſed plan of government, "the Congreſs are to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and exciſes, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and <hi>general welfare</hi> of the United States; but all duties, impoſts, and exciſes, ſhall be uniform throughout the United States." Now what can be more comprehenſive than theſe words; not content by other ſections of this plan, to grant all the great executive powers of a confederation, and a <hi>ſtanding army in time of peace,</hi> that grand engine of oppreſſion, and moreover the abſolute controul over the commerce of the United States, and all external objects of revenue, ſuch as unlimited impoſts upon imports, &amp;c. they are to be veſted with every ſpecies of <hi>internal</hi> taxation: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever taxes, duties, and exciſes that they may deem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the <hi>general welfare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The judicial power, by 1ſt ſection of article 3d, ſhall extend to all caſes, in law, and equity, ariſing under this conſtitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which ſhall be made under their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to all caſes affecting ambaſſadors, other public miniſters, and conſuls; to all caſes of admiralty
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:021344_0052_0FB31F6639A17AA0"/>
and maritime juriſdiction, to controverſies to which the United States ſhall be a party, to controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two or more ſtates, between a ſtate, and citizens of another ſtate, between citizens of different ſtates, between citizens of the ſame ſtate claiming lands under grants of different ſtates, and between a ſtate, or the citizens thereof, and foreign ſtates, citizens or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>The judicial power to be veſted in one ſupreme court, and in ſuch inferior courts as the Congreſs may from time to time ordain and eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>The objects of juriſdiction recited above, are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and the ſhades of diſtinction between civil cauſes are oftentimes ſo ſlight, that it is more than probable that the ſtate judicatories would be wholly ſuperceded; for in conteſts about juriſdiction, the federal court, as the moſt powerful, would ever prevail. Every perſon acquainted with the hiſtory of the courts in England, knows by what ingenious ſophiſms they have, at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent periods, extended the ſphere of their juriſdiction over objects out of the line of their inſtitution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their very nature, courts of a criminal juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction obtaining cognizance in civil cauſes.</p>
            <p>To put the omnipotency of Congreſs over the ſtate government and judicatories out of all doubt, the 6th article ordains, that "this conſtitution and the laws of the United States, which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof, and all treaties made or which ſhall be made under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land, and the judges in every ſtate ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
            <p>By theſe ſections, the all-prevailing power of taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch extenſive legiſlative and judicial powers are veſted in the general government, as muſt in their operation, neceſſarily abſorb the ſtate legiſlatures and judicatories; and that ſuch was in the contemplation of the framers of it, will appear from the proviſion made for ſuch event, in another part of it, but that fearful of alarming the people by ſo great an innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they have ſuffered the forms of the ſeparate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021344_0053_0FB31F67CC79CD48"/>
to remain, as a blind. By ſection 4th of the 1ſt art. "the times, places, and manner of holding elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for ſenators and repreſentatives, ſhall be preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in each ſtate by the legiſlature thereof; <hi>but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may at any time, by law, make or alter ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, except as to the place of chooſing ſenators.</hi>"— The plain conſtruction of which is, that when the ſtate legiſlatures drop out of ſight, from the neceſſary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this government, the Congreſs are to provide for the election and appointment of repreſentatives and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators.</p>
            <p>If the foregoing be a juſt comment—if the United States are to be melted down into one empire, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you to conſider whether ſuch a government, however conſtructed, would be eligible in ſo extended a territory; and whether it would be practicable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with freedom? It is the opinion of the greateſt writers, that a very extenſive country cannot be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on democratical principles, on any other plan, than a confederation of a number of ſmall republics, poſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the powers of internal government, but united in the management of their foreign and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>It would not be difficult to prove, that any thing ſhort of deſpotiſm, could not bind ſo great a country under one government; and that whatever plan you might, at the firſt ſetting out, eſtabliſh, it would iſſue in a deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>If one general government could be inſtituted, and maintained on principles of freedom, it would not be ſo competent to attend to the various local concerns and wants of every particular diſtrict; as well as the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar governments, who are near the ſcene, and poſſeſſed of ſuperior means of information: beſides, if the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>whole</hi> union is to be managed by one govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there would not be time. Do we not already ſee, that the inhabitants in a number of larger ſtates, who are remote from the ſeat of government, are loudly complaining of the inconveniencies and diſadvantages they are ſubjected to, on this account, and that, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comforts of local government, they are ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſmaller diviſions.</p>

The number of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives ſhall not exceed one for every 30,000 inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
            <p>The ſenate, the other conſtituent branch of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, is formed by the legiſlature of each ſtate, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two ſenators, for the term of ſix years.</p>
            <p>The executive power, by Art. 2, ſect. 1, is to be veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a preſident of the United States of America, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for four years: ſection 2, gives him "power, by and with the conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the ſenators preſent concur; and he ſhall nominate, and by and with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſenate, ſhall appoint ambaſſadors, other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic miniſters and conſuls, judges of the ſupreme court, and all other officers of the United States, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments are not herein otherwiſe provided for, and which ſhall be eſtabliſhed by law, &amp;c. And by another ſection he has the abſolute power of granting reprieves and pardons for treaſon, and all other high crimes and miſdemeanors, except in caſes of impeachment.</p>
            <p>The foregoing is the outlines of the plan.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the houſe of repreſentatives are, on the part of the people, to balance the ſenate, who I ſuppoſe will be compoſed of the <hi>better ſort,</hi> the <hi>well born,</hi> &amp;c. The number of the repreſentatives (being only one for every 30,000) appears to be too few, either to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the requiſite information, of the wants, local cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and ſentiments of ſo extenſive an empire, or to prevent corruption and undue influence in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſuch great powers; the term for which they are to be choſen, too long to preſerve a due dependence and accountability to their conſtituents; and the mode and places of their election not ſufficiently aſcertained;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:021344_0055_0FB31F6E089B1C18"/>
for as Congreſs have the controul over both, they may govern the choice, by ordering the <hi>repreſentatives</hi> of a <hi>whole</hi> ſtate to be <hi>elected</hi> in <hi>one</hi> place, and that too may be the moſt <hi>inconvenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſenate, the great efficient body in this plan of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is conſtituted on the moſt unequal principles. The ſmalleſt ſtate in the union has equal weight with the great ſtates of Virginia, Maſſachuſetts, or Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. The ſenate, beſides its legiſlative functions, has a very conſiderable ſhare in the executive; none of the principal appointments to office can be made without its advice and conſent. The term and mode of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, will lead to permanency; the members are choſen for ſix years, the mode is under the controul of Congreſs, and as there is no excluſion by rotation, they may be continued for life, which from their extenſive means of influence, would follow of courſe. The preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who would be a mere pageant of ſtate, unleſs he coincides with the views of the ſenate, would either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the head of the ariſtocratic junto in that body, or its minion; beſides, their influence being the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, could the beſt ſecure his re-election to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>And from his power of granting pardons, he might ſkreen from puniſhment the moſt treaſonable attempts on the liberties of the people, when inſtigated by the ſenate.</p>
            <p>From this inveſtigation into the organization of this government, it appears, that it is devoid of all reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or accountability to the great body of the people, and that ſo far from being a regular balanced govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would be, in practice, a <hi>permanent</hi> ARISTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRACY.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The framers of it, actuated by the true ſpirit of ſuch a government, which ever abominates and ſuppreſſes all free enquiry, and diſcuſſion, have made no proviſion for the</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the preſs, <hi>that grand</hi> palladium of freedom, <hi>and</hi> ſcourge of tyrants; <hi>but obſerved a total ſilence on that head. It is the opinion of ſome great writers, that if the liberty of the preſs, by an inſtitution of religion, or otherwiſe, could be rendered</hi> ſacred <hi>even in</hi> Turkey, <hi>that deſpotiſm would fly before it. And it is worthy of remark, that there is no declaration of perſonal rights, premiſed in
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021344_0056_0FB31F6ECB63AE10"/>
moſt free conſtitutions; and that the trial by</hi> jury <hi>in</hi> civil <hi>caſes is taken away; for what other conſtruction can be put on the following, viz. Art.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. "<hi>In all caſes affecting ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls, and thoſe in which a ſtate ſhall be a party, the ſupreme court ſhall have</hi> original <hi>juriſdiction. In all the other caſes above mentioned, the ſupreme court ſhall have</hi> appellate <hi>juriſdiction, both as to law and fact!" It would be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in juriſprudence, as well as evidently improper to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an appeal from the verdict of a jury, on the matter of fact; therefore it implies and allows of a diſmiſſion of the jury in civil caſes, and eſpecially when it is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that jury trial in criminal caſes is expreſſly ſtipulated for, but not in civil caſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But our ſituation is repreſented to be ſo</hi> critically <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that, however reprehenſible and exceptionable the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed plan of government may be, there is no alternative between the adoption of it and abſolute ruin. My fellow citizens, things are not at that criſis, it is the argument of tyrants; the preſent diſtracted ſtate of Europe ſecures us from injury on that quarter, and as to domeſtic diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we have not ſo much to fear from them, as to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate us into this form of government, without it is a ſafe and a proper one.

               <hi>Beſides, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that the firſt eſſay on ſo difficult a ſubject, is ſo well digeſted as it ought to be; if the propoſed plan, after a mature deliberation, ſhould meet the approbation of the reſpective ſtates, the matter will end; but if it ſhould be found to be fraught with dangers and inconveniences, a future general Convention being in poſſeſſion of the objections, will be the better enabled to plan a ſuitable government.</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure, it is next to impoſſible to enſlave a free nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſtate of ſociety muſt be very corrupt and baſe indeed, when the people, in poſſeſſion of ſuch a monitor as the preſs, can be induced to exchange the heaven-born bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of liberty, for the galling chains of deſpotiſm. Men of an aſpiring and tyrannical diſpoſition, ſenſible of this truth, have ever been inimical to the preſs, and have conſidered the ſhackling of it, as the firſt ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the accompliſhment of their hateful domination, and the entire ſuppreſſion of all liberty of public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, as neceſſary to its ſupport. For even a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army, that grand engine of oppreſſion, if it were as numerous as the abilities of any nation could maintain, would not be equal to the purpoſes of deſpotiſm over an enlightened people.</p>
            <p>The abolition of that grand palladium of freedom, the liberty of the preſs, in the propoſed plan of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the conduct of its authors, and patrons, is a ſtriking exemplification of theſe obſervations. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſſigned for the omiſſion of a <hi>bill of rights,</hi> ſecuring the <hi>liberty of the preſs,</hi> and <hi>other invaluable perſonal rights,</hi> is an inſult on the underſtanding of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The injunction of ſecrecy impoſed on the members of the late Convention during their deliberation, was obviouſly dictated by the genius of ariſtocracy; it was deemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic to unfold the principles of the intended government to the people, as this would have fruſtrated the object in view.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The projectors of the new plan, ſuppoſed that an ex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te diſcuſſion of the ſubject, was more likely to obtain unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the Convention; which would give it ſuch a ſanction

in the public opinion, as to baniſh all diſtruſt, and lead the people into an implicit adoption of it without examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The greateſt minds are forcibly impreſſed by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate circumſtances with which they are connected; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſphere men move in, the prevailing ſentiments of thoſe they converſe with, have an inſenſible and irreſiſtible influence on the wiſeſt and beſt of mankind, ſo that when we conſider the abilities, talents, ingenuity, and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate addreſs of a number of the members of the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, whoſe principles are deſpotic, can we be ſurpriſed that men of the beſt intentions have been miſled in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult ſcience of government? It is derogating from the character of the</hi> illuſtrious and highly revered WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, <hi>to ſuppoſe him fallible on a ſubject that muſt be in a great meaſure novel to him?

               <hi>The new plan was accordingly uſhered to the public with ſuch a ſplendor of names, as inſpired the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited confidence; the people were diſpoſed to receive upon truſt, without any examination on their part, what would have proved either a</hi> bleſſing <hi>or a</hi> curſe <hi>to them and their poſterity.

The authors of the new plan, conſcious that it would not ſtand the teſt of enlightened patriotiſm, tyrannical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavoured to preclude all inveſtigation. If their views were laudable—if they were honeſt—the contrary would have been their conduct, they would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the freeſt diſcuſſion. Whatever ſpecious reaſons may be aſſigned for ſecrecy during the framing of the plan, no good one can exiſt, for leading the people blindfold into the implicit adoption of it.

            <p>The virtuous and ſpirited exertions of a few patriots, have, at length, rouſed the people from their fatal infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, to a due ſenſe of the importance of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure before them. The glare and faſcination of names is rapidly abating, and the ſubject begins to be canvaſſed on its own merits; and ſo ſerious and general has been the impreſſion of the objections urged againſt the new plan, on the minds of the people, that its advocates, finding mere declamation and ſcurrility will no longer avail, are reluctantly driven to defend it on the ground of argument. Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> one of the deputies of this ſtate in the late convention, has found it neceſſary to come forward. From ſo able a lawyer, and ſo profound a politician, what might not be expected, if this new act of convention be the heavenly diſpenſation which ſome repreſent it. Its divinity would certainly be illuſtrated by one of the principal inſtruments of the Revelation; for this gentleman has that tranſcendent merit! But if on the other hand, this able advocate has failed to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it from the objections of its adverſaries, muſt we
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021344_0060_0FB31F77CA62A548"/>
not conſider it as the production of <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>intereſted</hi> men.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> has recourſe to the moſt ſlimſey ſophiſtry in his attempt to refute the charge that the new plan of general government will ſupercede and render powerleſs the ſtate governments. His quibble upon the term <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,</hi> as ſometimes equivalent to communities which poſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The ſame compariſon in the caſe of the Britiſh parliament aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tax the colonies, is made in the Xth of the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Letters, and was not miſunderſtood in 1768 by any. He ſays, that the exiſtence of the propoſed federal plan depends on the exiſtence of the ſtate governments, as the ſenators are to be appointed by the ſeveral legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are alſo to nominate the electors who chooſe the preſident of the United States; and that hence all fears of the ſeveral ſtates being melted down into one empire, are groundleſs and imaginary.

               </gap>heir exceſſes, the ſhadows of the ancient conſtitution held up to amuſe the people. The ſenate ſat as formerly; conſuls, tribunes, of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cenſors and other officers, were annually choſen as before, and the forms of republican government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Yet all this was in <hi>appearance</hi> only. Every <hi>ſenatus conſultum</hi> was dictated by him or his miniſters, and every Roman found himſelf conſtrained to ſubmit in all things to the deſpot.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> aſks, What controul can proceed from the federal government to ſhackle or deſtroy that <hi>ſacred pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium</hi> of national freedom, the <hi>liberty of the preſs?</hi>" What? cannot Congreſs, when poſſeſſed of the immenſe authority, propoſed to be devolved, reſtrain the printers, and put them under regulation. Recollect that the omnipotence of the federal legiſlature over the ſtate eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments is recognized by a ſpecial article, viz. "that this conſtitution and the laws of the United States which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof, and all treaties made,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021344_0061_0FB31F79C9238DC8"/>
or which ſhall be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the <hi>ſupreme law</hi> of the land; and the judges in every ſtate ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding." After ſuch a declaration, what ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity does the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the ſeveral ſtates afford for <hi>the liberty of the preſs, and other invaluable perſonal rights,</hi> not provided for by the new plan? Does not this ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe ſubject every thing to the controul of Congreſs?</p>
            <p>In the plan of confederation of 1778, now exiſting, it was thought proper by article the 2d, to declare, that "each ſtate retains its ſovereignty, freedom and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and every power, juriſdiction and right, which is not by this confederation expreſsly delegated to the United States in Congreſs aſſembled." <hi>Poſitive</hi> grant was not <hi>then</hi> thought ſufficiently deſcriptive and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Congreſs, and the omiſſion of ſuch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>now,</hi> when ſuch great devolutions of power are propoſed, manifeſts the deſign of reducing the ſeveral ſtates to ſhadows. But Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> tells you that every right and power not ſpecially granted to Congreſs is conſidered as withheld. How does this appear? Is this principle eſtabliſhed by the proper authority? Has the convention made ſuch a ſtipulation? By no means. Quite the reverſe; the laws of Congreſs are to be "the <hi>ſupreme law</hi> of the land, any thing in the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding," and conſequently, would be <hi>paramount</hi> to all ſtate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. The luſt of power is ſo univerſal, that a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative unaſcertained rule of conſtruction would be a <hi>poor</hi> ſecurity for the liberties of the people.</p>
            <p>Such a body as the intended Congreſs, unleſs parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inhibited and reſtrained, muſt graſp at omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and before long ſwallow up the legiſlative, the executive, and the judicial powers of the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
            <p>In addition to the reſpectable authorities quoted in my firſt number, to ſhew that the right of <hi>taxation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the powers of government, I beg leave to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Farmer's Letters, ſee particularly letter 9th, in which Mr. Dickenſon has clearly proved, that if the Britiſh parliament aſſumed the power of taxing the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, <hi>internally,</hi> as well as <hi>externally,</hi> and it ſhould be
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021344_0062_0FB31F7AC9A17058"/>
ſubmitted to, the ſeveral colony legiſlatures would ſoon become contemptible, and before long fall into diſuſe. Nothing, ſays he, would be left for them to do, higher than to frame bye-laws for empounding of cattle, or the yoking of hogs.</p>
            <p>By the propoſed plan, there are divers caſes of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial authority to be given to the courts of the United States, beſides the two mentioned by Mr. <hi>Wilſon.</hi> In maritime cauſes about property, jury trial has not been uſual; but in ſuits in <hi>equity,</hi> with all due deference to Mr. <hi>Wilſon's</hi> profeſſional abilities (which he calls to his aid) jury trial, as to facts, is in full exerciſe. Will this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſperitus ſay, that if the queſtion in equity ſhould be, did <hi>John Doe</hi> make a will, that the chancellor of England would decide upon it? He well knows, that in this caſe, there being no mode of jury trial before the chancellor, the queſtion would be referred to the court of king's bench for diſcuſſion according to the common law, and when the judge in equity ſhould receive the verdict, the fact ſo eſtabliſhed, could never be re-examined or controverted. Maritime cauſes, and thoſe appertaining to a court of equity, are, however, but <hi>two</hi> of the many and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſubjects of federal cognizance mentioned in the plan. This juriſdiction will embrace all ſuits ariſing under the laws of impoſt, exciſe, and other revenue of the United States. In England, if goods be ſeized, if a ſhip be proſecuted for non-compliance with, or breach of the laws of the cuſtoms, or thoſe for regulating trade, in the court of exchequer, the claimant is ſecured of the tranſcendant privilege of Engliſhmen, <hi>trial by a jury of his peers.</hi> Why not in the United States of America? This juriſdiction alſo goes to all caſes under the laws of the United States, that is to ſay, under all ſtatutes and ordinances of Congreſs. How far this may extend, it is eaſy to foreſee; for upon the decay of the ſtate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of legiſlation, in conſequence of the loſs of the <hi>purſe ſtrings,</hi> it will be found neceſſary for the federal legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make laws upon every ſubject of legiſlation.— Hence the ſtate courts of juſtice, like the barony and hundred courts of England, will be eclipſed, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually fall into diſuſe.</p>
            <p>The juriſdiction of the federal court goes, likewiſe, to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021344_0063_0FB31F865F2DAC98"/>
the laws to be created by treaties made by the preſident and ſenate (a ſpecies of legiſlation) with other nations; 'to all caſes affecting foreign miniſters and conſuls; to controverſies wherein the United States ſhall be a party; to controverſies between citizens of different ſtates," as when an inhabitant of <hi>New-York</hi> has a demand on an inhabitant of <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi> This laſt is a very invidious juriſdiction, implying an improper diſtruſt of the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and juſtice of the tribunals of the ſtates. It will include all legal debates between foreigners in Britain or elſewhere, and the people of this country. A rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath been aſſigned for it, viz. "That large tracts of land, in neighbouring ſtates, are claimed under royal or other grants, diſputed by the ſtates where the lands lie, ſo that juſtice cannot be expected from the ſtate tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals." Suppoſe it were proper indeed to provide for ſuch caſe, why include all caſes, and for all time to come? Demands as to lands for 21 years would have ſatisfied this. A London merchant ſhall come to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and ſue for his ſuppoſed debt, and the citizen of this country ſhall be deprived of jury trial, and ſubjected to an appeal (though nothing but the <hi>fact</hi> is diſputed) to a court 500 or 1000 miles from home; when if this American has a claim upon an inhabitant of England, his adverſary is ſecured of the privilege of jury trial. This juriſdiction goes alſo to controverſies between any ſtate and its citizens, which though probably not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may hereafter be ſet up as a ground to diveſt the ſtates, ſeverally, of the trial of criminals; inaſmuch as every charge of felony and miſdemeanour, is a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between a ſtate and the citizens of the ſame: that is to ſay, the ſtate is plaintiff, and the party accuſed is defendant in the proſecution. In all debts about juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, as was obſerved before, the paramount courts of Congreſs will decide, and the judges of the ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſub graviore lege,</hi> under the paramount law, muſt acquieſce.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> ſays, that it would have been impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have made a general rule for jury trial in the civil caſes aſſigned to the federal judiciary, becauſe of the want of uniformity in the mode of jury trial as practiſed by the ſeveral ſtates. This objection proves
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021344_0064_0FB31F8937BE7260"/>
too much, and therefore amounts to nothing. If it precludes the mode of common law in civil caſes, it certainly does in criminal. Yet in theſe we are told, "the oppreſſion of government is effectually barred, by declaring, that in all criminal caſes <hi>trial by jury</hi> ſhall be preſerved." Aſtoniſhing, that proviſion could not be made for a jury in civil controverſies, of 12 men, whoſe verdict ſhould be unanimous, <hi>to be taken from the vicinage;</hi> a precaution which is omitted as to trial of crimes, which may be any where in the ſtate within which they have been committed. So that an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of <hi>Kentucky</hi> may be tried for treaſon at <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The abolition of jury trial in civil caſes, is the more conſiderable, as at length the courts of Congreſs will ſuperſede the ſtate courts, when ſuch mode of trial will fall into diſuſe among the people of the United States.</p>
            <p>The northern nations of the European continent, have all loſt this invaluable privilege: <hi>Sweden,</hi> the laſt of them, by the artifices of the <hi>ariſtocratic</hi> ſenate, which depreſſed the king, and reduced the houſe of commons to inſignificance. But the nation, a few years ago, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the abſolute authority of a monarch to the <hi>vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> domination of the <hi>well-born</hi> few, an end was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly put to their power</p>
            <p>"The policy of this right of juries (ſays judge Black-ſtone) to decide upon <hi>fact,</hi> is founded on this: that if the power of judging were entirely truſted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, or any ſelect body of men named by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive authority, their deciſions, in ſpite of their own natural integrity, would have a bias towards thoſe of their own rank and dignity; for it is not to be expected, that the <hi>few</hi> ſhould be attentive to the rights of the many. This, therefore, preſerves in the hands of the people, that ſhare which they ought to have in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens."</p>
            <p>The attempt of governor <hi>Colden,</hi> of New-York, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the revolution, to re-examine the <hi>facts,</hi> and to re-conſider the <hi>damages,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Forſey</hi> againſt <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> produced, about the year 1764, a flame of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic and ſucceſsful oppoſition, that will not be eaſily forgotten</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:021344_0065_0FB31F8B00BED778"/>To manage the various and extenſive judicial autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, propoſed to be veſted in Congreſs, there will be one or more inferior courts immediately requiſite in each ſtate; and laws and regulations muſt be forthwith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to direct the judges; here is a wide door for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to enter. Contracts made under the acts of the ſtates reſpectively, will come before courts acting under new laws and new modes of proceeding, not thought of when they were entered into. An inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of Pennſylvania, reſiding at Pittsburgh, finds the goods of his debtor, who reſides in Virginia, within the reach of his attachment; but no writ can be had to authoriſe the marſhal, ſheriff, or other officer of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to ſeize the property about to be removed, nearer than 200 miles: ſuppoſe that at Carliſle, for inſtance, ſuch a writ may be had, mean while the object eſcapes. Or if an inferior court, whoſe judges have ample ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, be eſtabliſhed in every county, would not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence be enormous? Every reader can extend in his imagination, the inſtances of difficulty which would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from this needleſs interference with the judicial rights of the ſeparate ſtates, and which, as much as any other circumſtance in the new plan, implies that the diſſolution of their forms of government is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> ſkips very lightly over the danger appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended from the ſtanding army allowed by the new plan. This grand machine of power and oppreſſion may be made a fatal inſtrument to overturn the public liberties, eſpecially as the funds to ſupport the troops may be granted for <hi>two</hi> years, whereas in Britain, the grants ever ſince the revolution in 1688, have been <hi>from year to year.</hi> A ſtanding army with regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of pay and contingencies, would afford a ſtrong temptation to ſome ambitious man to ſtep up into the throne, and to ſeize abſolute power. The keeping on foot a hired military force <hi>in time of peace,</hi> ought not to be gone into, unleſs <hi>two thirds</hi> of the members of the federal legiſlature agree to the neceſſity of the meaſure, and adjuſt the numbers employed. Surely Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> is not ſerious when he adduces the inſtance of the troops now ſtationed on the Ohio as a proof of the propriety
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021344_0066_0FB31F8C0AFD0CA0"/>
of a ſtanding army. They are a mere occaſional ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament for the purpoſe of reſtraining divers hoſtile tribes of ſavages. It is contended, that under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent confederation, Congreſs poſſeſs the power of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies at pleaſure; but the opportunity which the ſtates ſeverally have of withholding the ſupplies neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to keep theſe armies on foot, is a ſufficient check on the <hi>preſent</hi> Congreſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> aſſerts, that never was charge made with leſs reaſon, than that which predicts the inſtitution of a <hi>baneful ariſtocracy</hi> in the federal ſenate. In my firſt number, I ſtated, that this body would be a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal repreſentation of the ſeveral ſtates, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being appointed for the long term of ſix years, and there being no excluſion by rotation, they might be continued for life, which would follow of courſe from their extenſive means of influence, and that poſſeſſing a conſiderable ſhare in the <hi>executive</hi> as well as <hi>legiſlative,</hi> it would become a <hi>paramount ariſtocracy,</hi> and ſwallow up the other orders in the government.</p>
            <p>That theſe fears are not imaginary, a knowledge of the hiſtory of other nations, where the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have been injudiciouſly placed, will fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate. Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> ſays, "the ſenate branches into two characters; the one legiſlative and the other execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. In its legiſlative character it can effect no purpoſe without the co-operation of the houſe of repreſentatives, and in its executive character it can accompliſh no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject without the concurrence of the preſident. Thus fettered, I do not know any act which the ſenate can of itſelf perform, and ſuch dependence neceſſarily precludes every idea of influence and ſuperiority." This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs is very ſpecious, but experience demonſtrates, that checks in government, unleſs accompanied with <hi>ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi> power, and <hi>independently</hi> placed, prove <hi>merely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,</hi> and will be <hi>inoperative.</hi> Is it probable, that the preſident of the United States, limited as he is in power, and dependent on the will of the ſenate, in appointments to office, will either have the firmneſs or inclination to exerciſe his prerogative of a conditional controul upon the proceedings of that body, however injurious they may be to the public welfare: it will be his intereſt to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021344_0067_0FB31F918488C440"/>
coincide with the views of the ſenate, and thus become the head of the ariſtocratic junto. The king of England is a conſtituent part of the legiſlature, but although an hereditary monarch, in poſſeſſion of the whole executive power, including the unreſtrained appointment to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and an immenſe revenue, enjoys but in <hi>name</hi> the prerogative of a negative upon the parliament. Even the king of England, circumſtanced as he is, has not dared to exerciſe it for near a century paſt. The check of the houſe of repreſentatives upon the ſenate will likewiſe be rendered nugatory for want of due weight in the democratic branch, and from their conſtitution, <hi>they</hi> may become ſo <hi>independent</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> as to be indifferent of its intereſts: nay, as Congreſs would have the controul over the mode and place of their election, by ordering the repreſentatives of a <hi>whole</hi> ſtate to be elected at <hi>one</hi> place, and that too the moſt <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,</hi> the ruling power may govern the <hi>choice,</hi> and thus the houſe of repreſentatives may be compoſed of the <hi>creatures</hi> of the ſenate. Still the <hi>ſemblance</hi> of checks, may remain, but without <hi>operation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This mixture of the legiſlative and executive more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over highly tends to corruption. The chief improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in government, in modern times, has been the complete ſeparation of the great diſtinctions of power; placing the <hi>legiſlative</hi> in different hands from thoſe which hold the <hi>executive;</hi> and again ſevering the <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> part from the ordinary <hi>adminiſtrative.</hi> "When the legiſlative and executive powers (ſays Monteſquieu) are united in the ſame perſon, or in the ſame body of magiſtrates, there can be no liberty."</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> confeſſes himſelf nor ſatisfied with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of the federal ſenate, and apologizes for it, by alledging a ſort of compromiſe. It is well known that ſome members of convention, apprized of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of ſuch a compound of authority, propoſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the ſupreme executive powers to the preſident and a ſmall council, made perſonally reſponſible for every appointment to office, or other act by having their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions recorded; and that without the concurrence of the majority of the quorum of this council, the preſident ſhould not be capable of taking any ſtep. Such a check
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021344_0068_0FB31F9443A891B8"/>
upon the chief magiſtrate would admirably ſecure the power of pardoning, now propoſed to be exerciſed by the preſident alone, from abuſe. For as it is placed, he may ſhelter the traitors whom he himſelf, or his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutors in the ſenate, have excited to plot againſt the liberties of the nation.</p>
            <p>The delegation of the power of taxation to Congreſs as far as duties on imported commodities, has not been objected to. But to extend this to exciſes, and every ſpecies to internal taxation, would neceſſarily require ſo many ordinances of Congreſs, affecting the body of the people, as would perpetually interfere with the ſtate laws and perſonal concerns of the people. This alone would directly tend to annihilate the particular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the people, fatigued with the operations of two maſters, would be apt to rid themſelves of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But we are cautioned againſt being alarmed with imaginary evils, for Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> has predicted that the great revenue of the United States, will be raiſed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt. Is there any ground for this? Will the impoſts ſupply the ſums neceſſary to pay the intereſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the foreign loan, to defray the great additional expence of the new conſtitution; for the policy of the new government will lead it to inſtitute numerous and lucrative civil offices, to extend its influenee and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſwarms of expectants, the people having in fact no controul upon their disburſements, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford pay and ſupport the ſuppoſed ſtanding army, that darling and long wiſhed for object of the <hi>well born</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; and which, if we may judge from the principles of the intended government, will be no trifling eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, for cantonments of troops in every diſtrict of America, will be neceſſary to compel the ſubmiſſion of the people to the arbitrary dictates of the ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? I ſay will the impoſt be adequate? By no means. To anſwer theſe there muſt be exciſes and other indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect duties impoſed, and as land taxes will operate too unequally to be agreeable to the wealthy ariſtrocracy in the ſenate who will be poſſeſſed of the government, <hi>poll taxes</hi> will be ſubſtituted as provided for in the new plan for the doctrine then will be, <hi>that ſlaves ought to pay for wearing their heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:021344_0069_0FB31F95184EE680"/>As the taxes neceſſary for theſe purpoſes, will drain your pockets of every penny, what is to become of that virtuous and meritorious claſs of citizens the public creditors. However well diſpoſed the people of the United States may be to do them juſtice, it would not be in their power: and, <hi>after waiting year after year,</hi> without proſpect of the payment of the intereſt or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the debt, they will be conſtrained to ſacrifice their certificates in the purchaſe of waſte lands in the diſtant wilds of the weſtern territory.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing illuſtration of the powers to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to Congreſs, it is evident that the general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would neceſſarily annihilate the particular governments, and that the ſecurity of the perſonal rights of the people by the ſtate conſtitutions is ſuperceded and deſtroyed; hence reſults the neceſſity of ſuch ſecurity being provided for by a bill of rights to be inſerted in the new plan of federal government. What excuſe can be then made for the omiſſion of this grand palladium, this barrier between <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion.</hi> For univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal experience demonſtrates the neceſſity of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs declarations and reſtrictions, to protect the rights and liberties of mankind, from the ſilent, powerful and ever active conſpiracy of thoſe who govern.</p>
            <p>The new plan, it is true, does propoſe to ſecure the people of the benefit of perſonal liberty by the <hi>habeas corpus;</hi> and trial by jury for all crimes, except in caſes of impeachme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> but there is no declaration, that all men have a natural and unalienable right to worſhip almighty God, according to the dictates of their own conſcience and underſtanding; and that no man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worſhip, or erect or ſupport any place of worſhip, or maintain any miniſter, contrary to, or againſt his own free will and conſent; and that no authority can or ought to be veſted in, or aſſumed by any power whatever that ſhall in any caſe interfere with, or in any manner controul, the right of conſcience in the free exerciſe of religious worſhip; that the trial by jury in civil cauſes as criminal proſecutions ſhall be held ſacred; that the requiring of exceſſive bail, impoſing of exceſſive fines and cruel and unuſual puniſhments be forbidden; that
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:021344_0070_0FB31F968F571408"/>
monopolies in trade or arts, other than to authors of books or inventors of uſeful arts, for a reaſonable time, ought not to be ſuffered; that the right of the people to aſſemble peaceably for the purpoſe of conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about public matters, and petitioning or remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating to the federal legiſlature ought not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; that <hi>the liberty of the preſs be holden ſacred;</hi> that the people have a right to hold themſelves, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, papers, and poſſeſſions, free from ſearch or ſeized; and that therefore warrants, without oaths or affirmations firſt made, affording a ſufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or meſſenger may be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or required to ſearch ſuſpected places, or to ſeize any perſon or his property, not particularly deſcribed, are contrary to that right and ought not to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that ſtanding armies in time of peace are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to liberty, and ought not to be permitted but when abſolutely neceſſary; all which is omitted to be done in the propoſed government.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> ſays, the new plan does not arrogate perfection, for it provides a mode of alteration and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if found neceſſary. This is one among the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous deceptions attempted on this occaſion. True there is a mode preſcribed for this purpoſe. But it is barely poſſible that amendments may be made. The faſcination of power muſt firſt ceaſe, the nature of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind undergo a revolution, that is not to be expected on this ſide of eternity. For to effect this (Art. 9.) it is provided, that if <hi>two thirds</hi> of both houſes of the federal legiſlature ſhall propoſe them; or when two thirds of the ſeveral ſtates, by their legiſlatures, ſhall apply for them the federal aſſembly ſhall call a convention for propoſing amendments, which when ratified by three-fourths of the ſtate legiſlatures, or conventions, as Congreſs ſhal ſee beſt, ſhall controul and alter the propoſed confede<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration. Does hiſtory abound with examples of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary relinquiſhment of power, however injurious to the community? No; it would require a general and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful riſing of the people to effect any thing of this nature.—This proviſion therefore is more ſound.</p>
            <p>The oppoſition of the new plan (ſays Mr. <hi>Wiſon</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from intereſted men, viz. the officers of the ſtate
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:021344_0071_0FB31F98879423C8"/>
governments. He had before denied that the propoſed tranfer of powers to Congreſs would annihilate the ſtate governments. But he here lays aſide the maſque and avows the fact. For, the truth of the charge againſt them muſt entirely reſt on ſuch conſequence of the new plan. For if the ſtate eſtabliſhments are to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired, why ſhould officers, peculiarly connected with them, be intereſted to oppoſe the adoption of the new plan. Except the collector of the impoſt, judge of the admiralty and the collector of exciſe (none of whom have been reckoned of the oppoſition) they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have nothing to apprehend. But the charge is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and may with propriety be retorted on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of office and emolument under the intended government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The oppoſition is not ſo partial and intereſted as Mr.</hi> Wilſon <hi>aſſerts. It conſiſts of a reſpectable yeomanry throughout the union, of characters far removed above the reach of his unſupported aſſertions. It compriſes many worthy members of the late convention, and a majority of the preſent Congreſs, for a motion made in that honorable body, for their</hi> approbation <hi>and</hi> recommendation <hi>of the new plan, was, after two days animated diſcuſſion, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently withdrawn by its advocates, and a ſimple</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Upon the laſt motion being made, thoſe who had ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly and ſucceſsfully oppoſed Congreſs giving any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of approbation or recommendation to this ſyſtem of oppreſſion, ſaid, "We have no objection to tranſmit the new plan of government to the ſeveral ſtates, that they may have an opportunity of judging for themſelves on ſo momentous a ſubject." Whereupon it was unanimouſly agreed to in the following words, viz. "Congreſs hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received the report of the Convention lately aſſembled in Philadelphia, <hi>Reſolved unanimouſly,</hi> That the ſaid report, with the reſolutions and letter accompanying the ſame, be <hi>tranſmitted</hi> to the ſeveral legiſlatures, in order to be ſubmitted to a Convention of delegates, choſen in each ſtate by the people thereof, in conformity to the reſolves of the Convention, made and provided in that caſe."</note>
               <hi>of the plan to the ſeveral ſtates could only be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:021344_0072_0FB31F9A4BCD9F28"/>
yet this has been palmed upon the people as the approbation of Congreſs; and to ſtrengthen the deception, the bells of the city of Philadelphia, were rung for a whole day.</hi>

patriotiſm; but ſuch is the curſed nature of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, ſo prevalent in the minds of men, that it would ſacrifice every thing to its ſelfiſh gratification; hence the faireſt opportunities of advancing the happineſs of humanity, are ſo far from being properly improved, that they are too often covered with the votaries of power and domination, into the means of obtaining their nefarious ends. It will be the misfortune of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to add to the number of examples of this kind, if the propoſed plan of government ſhould be adopted; but I truſt, ſhort as the time allowed you for conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, you will be ſo fully convinced of the truth of this, as to eſcape the impending danger; it is only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſtrip the monſter of its aſſumed garb, and to exhibit it in its native colours, to excite the univerſal ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and rejection of every virtuous and patriotic mind.</p>

            <p>The eſtabliſhment of a government, is a ſubject of ſuch momentous and laſting concern, that it ſhould not be gone into without the cleareſt conviction of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; which can only be the reſult of the fulleſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, the moſt thorough inveſtigation and diſpaſſionate conſideration of its nature, principles, and conſtruction. You are now called upon to make this deciſion, which involves in it, not only your fate, but that of your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity for ages to come. Your determination will either enſure the poſſeſſion of thoſe bleſſings, which render life deſirable, or entail thoſe evils which make exiſtence a curſe: that ſuch are conſequences of a wiſe or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per organization of government, the hiſtory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind abundantly teſtifies. If you viewed the magnitude of the object in its true light, you would join with me in ſentiment, that the new government ought not to be implicitly admitted. Conſider then, duly, before you

leap, for after the Rubicon is once paſſed, there will be no retreat.</p>
            <p>If you were even well aſſured, that the utmoſt purity of intention predominated in the production of the propoſed government, ſuch is the imperfection of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſdom and knowledge, that it would not be wiſe in you to adopt it with precipitation <hi>in toto,</hi> for all former experience muſt teach you the propriety of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion on ſuch occaſions, to correct the errors, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the deficiencies that may appear neceſſary. In every government, whoſe object is the public welfare, the laws are ſubjected to repeated reviſions, in ſome by different orders in the government, in others by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the judgments of the people, and deliberative forms of procedure. A knowledge of this, as well as of other ſtates, will ſhew, that if every inſtance where a law has been paſſed without the uſual precautions, it has been productive of great inconvenience and evils, and frequently has not anſwered the end in view, a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement becoming neceſſary to ſupply its deficiencies.</p>
            <p>What then are we to think of the motives and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of thoſe men who are urging the implicit and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate adoption of the propoſed government? Are they fearful, that if you exerciſe your good ſenſe and diſcernment, you will diſcover the maſqued ariſtocracy that they are attempting to ſmuggle upon you, under the ſuſpicious garb of republicaniſm? When we find that the principal agents in this buſineſs, are the very men who fabricated the form of government, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be concluſive evidence of their ins;idious deſign to deprive us of our liberties. The circumſtances attending this matter, are ſuch as ſhould in a peculiar manner excite your ſuſpicion; it might not be uſeleſs to take a review of ſome of them.</p>

the ſeveral ſtates, is now attempting through the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the future Congreſs. Experience having ſhewn great defects in the preſent confederatian, particularly in the regulating of commerce and maritime affairs, it became the univerſal wiſh of America to grant further powers, ſo as to make the federal government adequate to the ends of its inſtitution. The anxiety on this head was greatly increaſed, from the impoveriſhment and diſtreſs occaſioned by the extenſive importations of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign merchandize and luxuries, and conſequent drain of ſpecie ſince the peace: thus the people were in the diſpoſition of a drowning man, eager to catch at any thing that promiſed relief, however deluſory. Such an opportunity for the acquiſition of <hi>undue</hi> power, has never been viewed with indifference by the ambitious and deſigning in any age or nation, and it has accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly been too ſucceſsfully improved by ſuch men among us. The deputies from this ſtate (with the exception of two) and moſt of thoſe from the other ſtates in the union were unfortunately of this complexion, and many of them of ſuch ſuperior endowments, that in an <hi>ex parte</hi> diſcuſſion of the ſubject, by ſpecious gloſſes, they have gained the concurrence of ſome well-diſpoſed men in whom their country have great confidence, which has given great ſanction to their ſcheme of power.</p>
            <p>A compariſon of the authority under which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention acted, and their form of government, will ſhew that they have deſpiſed their delegated power, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſovereignty; that they have entirely annihilated the old confederation, and the particular governments of the ſeveral ſtates, and inſtead thereof have eſtabliſhed one general government that is to pervade the union; conſtituted on the moſt <hi>unequal</hi> principle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus Caeſar, when he ſeized the Roman liberties, cauſed himſelf to be choſen dictator (which was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient office) continued the ſenate, the conſuls, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, the cenſors, and all other offices and forms of the commonwealth; and yet changed Rome from the moſt free, to the moſt tyrannical government in the world.</p>
            <p>The convention, after veſting all the great and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent powers of ſovereignty in the general government, inſidiouſly declared, by ſection 4th of article 4th, "that the United States ſhall guarantee to every ſtate in this union, a republican form of government;" but of what avail will be the <hi>form</hi> without the <hi>reality</hi> of freedom?</p>
            <p>The late convention, in the majeſty of its aſſumed omnipotence, have not even condeſcended to ſubmit the plan of the new government to the conſideration of the people, the true ſource of authority, but have called upon them by their ſeveral conventions, "to aſſent to, and ratify"<note n="*" place="bottom">See a reſolution of Convention accompanying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the propoſed government.</note>

            <p>The authors and advocates of the new plan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that its eſtabliſhment can only be obtained from the ignorance of the people of its true nature, and their unbounded confidence in ſome of the men concurring, have hurried on its adoption with a precipitation that betrays their deſign; before many had ſeen the new plan, and before they had time to examine it, they, by

                  <p>The proviſions made by the Convention of Pennſylvania, which ſat in <hi>1776</hi> for amending the Conſtitution, is guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with admirable wiſdom and caution. A council of cenſors is to be holden every ſeven years, which ſhall have power (two thirds of the whole number elected agreeing) to propoſe amendments of the ſame government, and to call a Convention to adopt and eſtabliſh theſe propoſitions: but the alterations muſt be "promulgated <hi>at leaſt</hi> ſix months before the day appointed for the <hi>election</hi> of ſuch Convention, for the <hi>previous conſideration</hi> of the people, that they may have an opportunity of inſtructing their dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates on the ſubject." The preſent meaſures explain the conduct of a certain party of Cenſors who ſat in <hi>1784,</hi> (much fewer than two thirds of the whole) that propoſed to aboliſh the 47th article of the conſtitution, whereby the manner of amending the ſame was regulated.</p>

In order to put the matter beyond all recall, they have proceeded a ſtep farther, they have made the deputies nominated for the ſtate convention, of this city, and elſewhere, pledge their ſacred honour, previous to their election, that they would implicitly adopt the propoſed government, <hi>in toto;</hi> thus, ſhort as the period is, before the final fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A good cauſe does not ſtand in need of ſuch means; it ſcorns all indirect advantages and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed help, and truſts alone to its own native merit and intrinſic ſtrength: the lion is never known to make uſe of cunning, nor can a good cauſe ſuffer by a free and thorough examination. It is knavery that ſeeks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. Actors do not care that any one ſhould look into the tiring room, nor jugglers or ſharpers into their hands or boxes.</p>
            <p>Every exertion has been made to ſuppreſs diſcuſſion by ſhackling the preſs; but as this could not be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>this</hi> ſtate, the people are warned not to liſten to the adverſaries of the propoſed plan, leſt they ſhould impoſe upon them, and thereby prevent the adoption of this bleſſed government. What figure would a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer make in a court of juſtice, if he ſhould deſire the judges not to hear the counſel of the other ſide, leſt they ſhould perplex the cauſe and miſlead the court?

            <p>All who are friends to liberty are friends to reaſon, the champion of liberty; and none are foes to liberty but thoſe who have truth and reaſon for their foes. He who has dark purpoſes to ſerve, muſt uſe dark means; light would diſcover him, and reaſon expoſe him: he muſt endeavour to ſhut out both, and make them look frightful by giving them ill names.</p>
            <p>Liberty only flouriſhes where reaſon and knowledge are encouraged; and wherever the latter are ſtifled, the former is extinguiſhed. In Turkey printing is forbid, enquiry is dangerous, and free ſpeaking is capital; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are all inconſiſtent with the nature of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

            <p>I ſhall now proceed in the conſideration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the propoſed plan of government —By ſect. 4th of art. 1ſt, of the propoſed government, it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, "that the times, places, and manner of holding elections for ſenators and repreſentatives ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in each ſtate by the legiſlature thereof; <hi>but the Congreſs may at any time by law make or alter ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, except as to the place of chuſing ſenators.</hi>" Will not this ſection put it in the power of the future Congreſs to aboliſh the ſuffrage by ballot, ſo indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in a free government.—Monteſquieu, in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of laws, vol. 1, page 12, ſays, "that in a democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy there can be no exerciſe of ſovereignty but by the ſuffrages of the people, which are their will; now the ſovereign's will is the ſovereign himſelf. The laws, therefore, which eſtabliſh the right of ſuffrage, are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental to this government. In fact it is as impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to regulate in a republic, in what manner, by whom, and concerning what ſuffrages are to be given, as it is in a monarchy to know who is the prince, and after what manner he ought to govern. This valuable privilege of voting by ballot, ought not to reſt on the diſcretion of the government, but be irrevocably eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Will not the above quoted ſect. alſo, authoriſe the future Congreſs to lengthen the term for which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators and repreſentatives are to be elected, from 6 and 2 years reſpectively, to any period, even for life? as the parliament of England voted themſelves from triennial to ſeptennial; and as the long parliament under Charles the 1ſt became perpetual?</p>
            <p>Sect. 8th, of art. 1ſt, veſts Congreſs with power "to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, ſuppreſs inſurrections and repel invaſions; to provide for the organizing, arming and diſciplining the militia, and for governing ſuch part of them as may be employed in the ſervice of the United States, reſerving to the ſtates reſpectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſcipline preſcribed by Congreſs."—

               </gap>m the firſt ſettlement of this country, until the commencement of the late war, the taxes were ſo light and trivial as to be ſcarcely felt by the people; when we engaged in the expenſive conteſt with Great Britain, the Congreſs, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the difficulty of levying the monies neceſſary to its ſupport, by direct taxation, had recourſe to an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:021344_0083_0FB31D5A51440F28"/>
of the public reſources, by emitting hills of credit, and thus poſtponed the neceſſity of taxation for ſeveral years; this means was purſued to a moſt ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous length: but about the year 1780 or 1781, it was wholly exhauſted; commerce had been ſuſpended for near ſix years; the huſbandman, for want of a market, limited his crops to his own ſubſiſtence; the frequent calls of the militia, and long continuance in actual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the devaſtations of the enemy, the ſubſiſtence of our own armies, the evils of the depreciation of the paper money, which fell chiefly upon the patriotic and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of the community, had all concurred to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great diſtreſs throughout America. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs, we ſtill had the ſame powerful enemy to contend with, who had even more numerous and better appointed armies in the field, than at any former time. Our allies were applied to in this exigence, but the pecuniary aſſiſtance that we could procure from them, was ſoon exhauſted; the only reſource now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, was to obtain by direct taxation, the monies neceſſary for our defence; the hiſtory of mankind does not furniſh a ſimilar inſtance of an attempt to levy ſuch enormous taxes at once, of a people ſo wholly unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inured to them—the lamp of ſacred liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt indeed have burned with unſullied luſtre, every ſordid principle of the mind muſt have been then extinct, when the people not only ſubmitted to the grievous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, but chearfully exerted themſelves to comply with the calls of their country; their abilities, however, were not equal to furniſh the neceſſary ſums—indeed the requiſition of the year 1782, amounted to the whole income of their farms and other property, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the means of their ſubſiſtence; perhaps the ſtrained exertions of two years, would not have ſufficed to the diſcharge of this requiſition; to whom then, can we impute the difficulties of the people to a due compliance with the requiſitions of Congreſs to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the confederation, for any government, however energetic, in ſimilar circumſtances, would have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the ſame fate. If we review the proceedings of the ſtates, we ſhall find that they gave every ſanction and authority to the requiſitions of Congreſs, that their
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:021344_0084_0FB31D5C54EC1058"/>
laws could confer; that they attempted to collect the ſums called for, in the ſame manner as is propoſed to be done in future by the general government, inſtead of the ſtate legiſlatures.</p>
            <p>It is a maxim, that a government ought to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious not to govern over much, for when the cord of power is drawn too tight, it generally proves its deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the impracticability of complying with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Congreſs has leſſened the ſenſe of obligation and duty in the people, and thus weakened the ties of the union; the opinion of power in a free government is much more efficacious than the exerciſe of it; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the maturity of time and repeated practice to give it due energy and certainty to the operations of government, eſpecially to ſuch as affect the purſes of the people.</p>
            <p>The thirteen Swiſs Cantons confederated by more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and weaker ties than theſe United States are by the preſent articles of confederation, have not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the neceſſity of ſtrengthening their union by veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their general diet with further or greater powers; this national body has only the management of their foreign concerns, and in caſe of a war can onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> call by requiſition on the ſeveral Cantons for the neceſſary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, who are ſovereign and independent in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and local exerciſe of government; and yet this rope of ſand, as our confederation has been termed, which is ſo ſimilar to that, has held together for ages without any apparent chain.</p>
            <p>I am perſuaded, that a due conſideration will evince, that the preſent inefficacy of the requiſitions of Congreſs is not owing to a defect in the confederation, but the peculiar circumſtances of the times.</p>
            <p>The wheels of the general government having been thus clogged, and the arrearages of taxes ſtill accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, it may be aſked what proſpect is there of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment reſuming its proper tone, unleſs more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſory powers are granted? To this it may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the produce of impoſts on commerce which all agree to veſt in Congreſs, together with the immenſe tracts of land at their diſpoſal, will rapidly leſſen and eventually diſcharge the preſent incumbrances; when
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021344_0085_0FB31D5D98ECD048"/>
this takes place, the mode by requiſition will be found perfectly adequate to the extraordinary exigencies of the union. Congreſs have lately ſold land to the amount of eight millions of dollars, which is a conſiderable portion of the whole debt.</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented that the intereſted and deſigning have availed themſelves ſo ſucceſsfully of the preſent criſis, and under the ſpecious pretence of having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a <hi>panacea</hi> for all the ills of the people, they are about eſtabliſhing a ſyſtem of government that will prove more deſtructive to them, than the wooden horſe filled with ſoldiers did in ancient times to the city of Troy; this horſe was introduced by their hoſtile enemy the Grecians, by a proſtitution of the ſacred rites of their religion; in like manner, my fellow citizens, are aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſpots among yourſelves, proſtituting the name of a Waſhington to cloak their deſigns upon your liberties.</p>
            <p>I would aſk how is the propoſed government to ſhow, or down thoſe treaſures upon every claſs of citizens as is ſo induſtriouſly inculcated and ſo fondly believed?— Is it by the addition of numerous and expenſive eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments? Is it by doubling our judiciaries, inſtituting federal courts in every county of every ſtate? Is it by a ſuperb preſidential court? Is it by a large ſtanding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? In ſhort, is it by putting it in the power of the future government to levy money at pleaſure, and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this government ſo independent of the people as to enable the adminiſtration to gratify every corrupt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, to riot on your ſpoils, without check or controul?</p>
            <p>A transfer to Congreſs of the power of impoſing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts on commerce, and the unlimited regulation of trade, I believe is all that is wanting to render Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca as proſperous as it is in the power of any form of government to render her; this properly underſtood would meet the views of all the honeſt and well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>What gave birth to the Continental Convention?— Was it not the ſituation of our commerce, which lay at the mercy of every foreign power, who from motives of intereſt or enmity could reſtrict and controul it, without riſqueing a retaliation on the part of America, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021344_0086_0FB31D615D2931D8"/>
was impotent on this ſubject? Such indeed was the caſe with reſpect to Britain, whoſe hoſtile regulations gave ſuch a ſtab to our navigation as to threaten its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, it became the intereſt of the American mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to give a preference to foreign bottoms; hence the diſtreſs of our ſeamen, ſhip-wrights, and every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic art dependent on navigation.</p>
            <p>By theſe regulations too we were limited in markets for our produce, our veſſels were excluded from their Weſt-India iſlands, many of our ſtaple commodities were denied entrance in Britain; hence the huſb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndmen were diſtreſſed by the demand for their crops being leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, and their prices reduced. This is the ſource to which may be traced every evil we experience, that can be relieved by a more energetic government. Recollect the language of complaint for years paſt, compare the recommendations of Congreſs founded on ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, pointing out the remedy; examine the reaſons aſſigned by the different ſtates for appointing delegates to the late convention, view the powers veſted in that body; they all harmonize in one ſentiment, that the due regulation of trade and navigation was the anxious wiſh of every claſs of citizens, was the great object of calling the convention.</p>
            <p>This object being provided for by the propoſed conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the people overlook, and are not ſenſible of the needleſs ſacrifice they are making for it. Of what avail will be a proſperous ſtate of commerce, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of it will be at the abſolute diſpoſal of an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and unchecked government, who may levy at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the moſt oppreſſive taxes; who may deſtroy every principle of freedom; who may even deſtroy the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of complaining.</p>
            <p>If you are in doubt about the nature and principles of the propoſed government, view the conduct of its authors and patrons, that affords the beſt explanation, the moſt ſtriking comment.</p>
            <p>The evil genius of darkneſs preſided at its birth, it came forth under the veil of myſtery, its true features being carefully concealed, and every deceptive art has been and is practiſing to have this ſpurious brat receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the genuine offspring of heaven-born liberty. So

fearful are its patrons that you ſhould diſcern the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that they have hurried on its adoption with the greateſt precipitation; they have endeavoured alſo to preclude all inveſtigation, they have endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidate all oppoſition; by ſuch means as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of her exit, is about bidding an eternal adieu to this once happy people.</p>
            <p>After ſo recent a triumph over Britiſh deſpots, after ſuch torrents of blood and treaſure have been ſpent, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter involving ourſelves in the diſtreſſes of an arduous war, and incurring ſuch a debt, for the expreſs purpoſe of aſſerting the rights of humanity, it is truly aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a ſet of men among ourſelves ſhould have the effrontery to attempt the deſtruction of our liberties.— But in this enlightened age to hope to dupe the people by the arts they are practiſing, is ſtill more extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. How do the advocates of the propoſed government combat the objections urged againſt it? Not even by an attempt to diſprove them, for that would the more fully confirm their truth, but by a ſpecies of reaſoning that is very congenial to that contempt of the underſtandings of the people that they ſo eminently poſſeſs, and which policy cannot even prevent frequent ebullitions of; they ſeem to think that the oratory and faſcination of great names and mere ſound will ſuffice to enſure ſucceſs;— that the people may be diverted from a conſideration of the merits of the plan, by bold aſſertions and mere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation. Some of their writers for inſtance, paint the diſtreſſes of every claſs of citizens with all the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing language of eloquence, as if this was a demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the excellence, or even of the ſafety of the new plan, which notwithſtanding the reality of this diſtreſs, may be a ſyſtem of tyranny and oppreſſion; other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

But they all ſedulouſly avoid the fair field of argument, a rational inveſtigation into the organization of the propoſed government. I hope the good ſenſe of the people will detect the fallacy of ſuch conduct, will diſcover the baſe juggle, and with becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolution reſent the impoſition.</p>
            <p>That the powers of Congreſs ought to be ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all allow, but is this a concluſive proof of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to adopt the propoſed plan; is it a proof that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the late convention in the firſt eſſay upon ſo arduous and difficult a ſubject, harmonized in their ideas, that a future convention will not, or that after a full inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and mature conſideration of the objections, they will not plan a better government, and one more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſentiments of America; or is it any proof that they can never again agree in any plan? The late convention muſt indeed have been inſpired, as ſome of its advocates have aſſerted, to admit the truth of theſe poſitions, or even to admit the poſſibility of the propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed government being ſuch a one as America ought to adopt; for this body went upon original ground foreign from their intentions or powers, they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been wholly uninformed of the ſentiments of their conſtituents in reſpect to this form of government, as it was not in their contemplation when the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was appointed to erect a new government, but to ſtrengthen the old one. Indeed they ſeem to have been determined to monopolize the excluſive merit of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:021344_0089_0FB31D665210C568"/>
or rather, as if darkneſs was eſſential to its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, they precluded all communication with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by cloſing their doors; thus the well diſpoſed members, unaſſiſted by public information and opinion, were induced, by thoſe arts that are now practiſing on the people, to give their ſanction to this ſyſtem of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm.</p>
            <p>Is there any reaſon to preſume that a new Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not agree upon a better plan of government? Quite the contrar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>MR. WILSON, in a ſpeech delivered in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention on Saturday the 24th inſtant, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, nay forceably proved, that one conſolidated go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will not anſwer for ſo extenſive a territory as the United States includes, that ſlavery would be the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021344_0090_0FB31D6A22A9CF50"/>
neceſſary fate of the people under ſuch a government<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, his words are ſo remarkable, that I cannot forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing them; they are as follows, viz. "The extent of country for which the new conſtitution was required, produced another difficulty in the buſineſs of the federal convention. It is the opinion of ſome celebrated wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that to a ſmall territory, the democratical, to a middling territory, as Monteſquien has termed it, the monarchical, and, to an extenſive territory, the deſpotic form of government is the beſt adapted. Regarding, then, the wide and almoſt unbounded juriſdiction of the States, at firſt view the hand of deſpotiſm ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to controul, connect, and protect it; and hence the chief embarraſſment aroſe. For, we knew, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our conſtituents would chearfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly ſubmit to the legiſlative reſtraints of a free government, they would ſpurn at every attempt to ſhackle them with deſpotic power." See page five of the printed ſpeech. And again in page ſeven, he ſays, "Is it probable, that the diſſolution of the ſtate governments, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one conſolidated empire, would be eligible in its nature, and ſatisfactory to the people in its admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration? I think not, as I have given reaſons to ſhew, that ſo extenſive a territory could not be governed, connected, and preſerved, but by the ſupremacy of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic power. All the exertions of the moſt potent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of Rome, were not capable of keeping that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire together, which, in extent, was far inferior to the dominion of America."</p>
            <p>This great point having been now confirmed by the conceſſion of Mr Wilſon, though indeed it was ſelf evident before, and the writers againſt the propoſed plan of government, having proved to demonſtration, that the powers propoſed to be veſted in Congreſs, will neceſſarily annihilate and abſorb the legiſlatures and judiciaries, and produce from their wreck one conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated government, the queſtion is determined. Every man therefore who has the welfare of his country at heart, every man who values his own liberty and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in ſhort, every deſcription of perſons, except thoſe aſpiring deſpots who hope to benefit by the miſery and vaſſalage of their countrymen, muſt now concur in
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:021344_0091_0FB31D6C6B5D0B30"/>
rejecting the propoſed ſyſtem of government, muſt now unite in branding its authors with the ſtigma of eternal infamy. The anniverſary of this great eſcape from the fangs of deſpotiſm, ought to be celebrated as long as liberty ſhall continue to be dear to the citizens of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>I will repeat ſome of my principal arguments, and add ſome further remarks, on the ſubject of conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>The legiſlative is the higheſt delegated power in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; all other are ſubordinate to it. The cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Monteſquie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tabliſhes it as a maxim, that legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation neceſſarily follows the power of taxation. By the 8th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, "the Congreſs are to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and exciſes, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States." Now, what can be more comprehenſive than theſe words? Every ſpecies of taxation, whether external or internal, are included. Whatever taxes, duties, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d exciſes, that the Congreſs may deem neceſſary to the general welfare, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the citizens of theſe ſtates and levied by their officers. The Congreſs are to be the abſolute judges of the propriety of ſuch taxes, in ſhort they may conſtrue every purpoſe for which the ſtate legiſlatures now lay taxes, to be for the general welfare, they may ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every ſource of taxation, and thus make it impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ſtates to have the ſmalleſt revenue; and if a ſtate ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

But the legiſlative has an able auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the judicial department, for a reference to my ſecond number will ſhew, that this may be made greatly inſtrumental in effecting a conſolidation; as the federal judiciary would abſorb all others. Leſt the foregoing powers ſhould not ſuffice to conſolidate the United States into one empire, the convention, as if determined to prevent the poſſibility of a doubt, as if to prevent all claſhing by the oppoſition of ſtate powers, as if to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all ſtruggle for ſtate importance, as if to level all obſtacles to the ſupremacy of univerſal ſway, which in ſo extenſive a territory would be an iron handed deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, have ordained by article the 6th, <hi>"That this conſtitution, and the laws of the United States, which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which ſhall be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land; and the judges in every ſtate ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding."</hi>

But the convention has ſuperadded another power, by which the Congreſs may ſtamp with the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conſtitution every poſſible law; it is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following clauſe: "To make all laws which ſhall be neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers veſted by this conſtitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." Whatever law Congreſs may deem neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution any of the powers veſted in them, may be enacted; and by virtue of this clauſe, they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul and abrogate any and every of the laws of the ſtate governments, on the allegation that they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the execution of any of their powers; and yet theſe laws will <hi>"be made in purſuance of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,"</hi> and of courſe will <hi>"be the ſupreme law of the

            <p>There is no reſervation made in the whole of this plan in favour of the rights of the ſeparate ſtates. In the preſent plan of confederation made in the year 1778, it was thought neceſſary by article the 2d to declare, that <hi>each ſtate retains its ſovereignty, freedom, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and every power, juriſdiction, and right, which is not by this confederation expreſsly delegated to the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States in Congreſs aſſembled.</hi> Poſitive grant was not thought ſufficiently deſcriptive and reſtrictive upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and the omiſſion of ſuch a declaration now, when ſuch great devolutions of power are propoſed, manifeſts the deſign of conſolidating the ſtates.</p>
            <p>What reſtriction does Mr. Wilſon pretend there is in the new conſtitution to the ſupremacy of deſpotic ſway over the United States? What barrier does he aſſign for the ſecurity of the ſtate governments? Why truly a mere cobweb of a limit! By interpoſing the ſhield of what will become mere form, to check the reality of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He ſays, that the exiſtence of the ſtate governments are eſſential to the organization of Congreſs, that the former is made the neceſſary baſis of the latter, for the federal ſenators and preſident are to be appointed by the ſtate legiſlatures; and that hence all fears of a conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation are groundleſs and imaginary. It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, as reaſon and argument would have been foreign to the defence of the propoſed plan of government, Mr. Wilſon has diſplayed much ingenuity on this occaſion; he has involved the ſubject in all the mazes of ſophiſtry, and by ſubtil diſtinctions he has eſtabliſhed principles and poſitions, that exiſt only in his own fertile imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a ſoleciſm in politics for two co-ordinate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignties to exiſt together; you muſt ſeparate the ſphere of their juriſdiction, or after running the race of dominion for ſome time, one would neceſſarily triumph over the other; but in the mean time the ſubjects of it would be harraſſed with double impoſitions to ſupport the contention; however, the ſtrife between Congreſs and the ſtates could not be of long continuance, for the former has a deciſive ſuperiority in the outſet, and has
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021344_0094_0FB31D7315DF26D0"/>
moreover the power by the very conſtitution itſelf to terminate it when expedient.</p>
            <p>As this neceſſary connexion, as it has been termed, between the ſtate governments and the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has been made a point of great magnitude by the advocates of the new plan, as it is the only obſtacle alledged by them againſt a conſolidation, it ought to be well conſidered. It is declared by the propoſed plan, that the federal ſenators, and the electors who chooſe the preſident of the United States, ſhall be appointed by the ſtate legiſlatures for the long period of ſix and four years reſpectively; how will this connexion prevent the ſtate legiſlatures being diveſted of every important, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry efficient power? may not they, will not they dwindle into mere boards of appointment, as has ever happened in other nations to public bodies, who in ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have been ſo weak as to part with the eſſentials of power? does not hiſtory abound with ſuch inſtances? And this may be the mighty amount of this inſeparable connexion which is ſo much dwelt upon as the ſecurity of the ſtate governments. Yet even this ſhadow of a limit againſt conſolidation may be annihilated by the imperial fiat, without any violation of even the forms of the conſtitution; ſection 4th of article 1ſt has made a proviſion for this, when the people are ſufficiently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued with the uſeleſs expence of maintaining the forms of departed power and ſecurity, and when they ſhall pray to be relieved from the impoſition. This ſection cannot be too often repeated, as it gives ſuch a latitude to the deſigning, as it revokes every other part of the conſtitution that may be tolerable, and as it may enable the adminiſtration under it to complete the ſyſtem of deſpotiſm: It is in the following words, viz. "The times, places, and manner of holding elections for ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and repreſentatives, ſhall be preſcribed in each ſtate by the legiſlature thereof; but the Congreſs may by law at any time make or alter ſuch regulations, except as to the place of chooſing ſenators." The only appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant reſtriction in this clauſe is, as to the place of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſenators, but even this may be rendered of no avail; for as the Congreſs have the controul over the time of appointment of both ſenators and repreſentatives,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021344_0095_0FB31D75CE0F9430"/>
they may, under the pretence of an apprehenſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, upon the pretence of the turbulence of what they may ſtile a faction, and indeed pretences are never wanting to the deſigning, they may poſtpone the time of the election of the ſenators and the repreſentatives from period to period to perpetuity: Thus they may, and if they may they certainly will, from the luſt of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſo inherent in the mind of man, relieve the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the trouble of attending elections by conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to create themſelves. Has not Mr. Wilſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed it in fact? Has he not ſaid in the convention that it was neceſſary that Congreſs ſhould poſſeſs this power, as the means of its own preſervation; otherwiſe ſays he, an invaſion, a civil war, a faction, or a ſeceſſion of a minority of the aſſembly, might prevent the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſtate in Congreſs.</p>
            <p>The advocates of the propoſed government muſt be hard driven, when they repreſent, that becauſe the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures of this and the other ſtates have exceeded the due bounds of power, notwithſtanding every guard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by their conſtitutions; that becauſe the luſt of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary ſway is ſo powerful as ſometimes to get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of every obſtacle, that therefore we ſhould give full ſcope to it, for that all reſtriction would be uſeleſs and nugatory. And further, when they tell you that a good adminiſtration will atone for all the defects in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which, ſay they, you muſt neceſſarily have; for how can it be otherwiſe, your rulers are to be taken from among yourſelves. My fellow citizens, theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring deſpots muſt indeed have a great contempt for your underſtandings, when they hope to gull you out of your liberties by ſuch reaſoning; for what is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary object of government, but to check and controul the ambitious and deſigning: How then can moderation and virtue be expected from men who will be in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of abſolute ſway, who will have the United States at their diſpoſal? They would be more than men who could reſiſt ſuch temptation! Their being taken from among the people would be no ſecurity, tyrants are of native growth in all countries; the greateſt baſhaw in Turkey has been one of the people, as Mr. Wilſon tells
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021344_0096_0FB31D7ACBAC3C48"/>
you the preſident general will be. What conſolation would this be, when you ſhall be ſuffering under his oppreſſion.</p>

A golden phantom held out to them by the crafty and aſpiring deſpots among themſelves, is alluring them into the ſangs of arbitrary power; and ſo great is their infatuation, that it ſeems as if nothing ſhort of the reality of miſery, neceſſarily attendant on ſlavery, will rouſe them from their falſe confidence, or convince them of the direful deception; but then, alas I it will be too late, the chains of deſpotiſm will be faſt rivetted, and all eſcape pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</hi>

it is that luſt of dominion that is inherent in every mind, in a greater or leſs degree; this is ſo univerſal and ever active a paſſion as to influence all our anceſtors; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſituation and qualifications of men only modifies and varies the complexion and operation of it.</p>
            <p>For this darling pre-eminence and ſuperiority, the merchant, already poſſeſſed of a competency, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures his all in the purſuit of greater wealth; it is for this, that men of all deſcriptions, after having amaſſed fortunes, ſtill perſevere in the toils of labour; in ſhort, this is the great principle of exertion in the votaries of riches, learning, and ſame.</p>
            <p>In a ſavage ſtate, pre-eminence is the reſult of bodily ſtrength and intrepidity, which compels ſubmiſſion from all ſuch as have the misfortune to be leſs able; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great end of civil government is, to protect the weak from the oppreſſion of the powerful, to put every man upon the level of equal liberty; but here again the ſame luſt of dominion by different means fruſtrates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always this ſalutary intention. In a poliſhed ſtate of ſociety, wealth, talents, addreſs and intrigue are the qualities that attain ſuperiority in the great ſphere of government.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſtriking illuſtration of the prevalence of this luſt of dominion is, that the moſt ſtrenuous aſſertors of liberty in all ages, after ſucceſsfully triumphing over tyranny, have themſelves become tyrants, when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpicious confidence of an admiring people have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted them with unchecked power: Rare are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſelf-denial, or conſiſtency of conduct in the votaries of liberty, when they have become poſſeſſed of the reins of authority; it has been the peculiar felicity of this country, that her <hi>great deliverer</hi> did not prove a <hi>Cromwell,</hi> nor a <hi>Monk.</hi>

The luſt of power or dominion is of that nature, as ſeeks to overcome every obſtacle, and does not remit its exertions, whilſt any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of conqueſt remains, nothing ſhort of the plenitude of dominion, will ſatisfy this curſed demon: Therefore liberty is only to be preſerved by a due reſponſibility in the government, and by the conſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The celebrated <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> has warned mankind of the danger of an implicit reliance on rulers; he ſays, that "a perpetual jealouſy reſpecting liberty, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely requiſite in all free ſtates," and again, "that ſlavery is ever preceeded by ſleep."</p>

How tranſitory are the bleſſings of this life! Scarcely have four years elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince theſe United States, reſcuced from the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of foreign deſpots, by the unexampled heroiſm

and perſeverance of its citizens, at ſuch great expence of blood and treaſure, when they are about to fall a prey to the machinations of a profligate junto at home, who, ſeizing the favourable moment, when the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and extraordinary difficulties of the people have thrown them off their guard, and lulled that jealouſy of power ſo eſſential to the preſervation of freedom, have been too ſucceſsful in the ſacrilegious attempt; however I am confident that this formidable conſpiracy will end in the confuſion and infamy of its authors; that, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the avenging ſword of an abuſed people will humble theſe aſpiring deſpots to the duſt, and that their fate, like that of Charles the Firſt of England, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch attempts in future, and prove the confirmation of the liberties of America until time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>One would imagine, by the inſolent conduct of thoſe harpies of power, they had already triumphed over the liberties of the people; that the chains were rivetted, and tyranny eſtabliſhed. They tell us all farther oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition will be in vain, as this ſtate has paſſed the Rubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. Do they imagine the freemen of Pennſylvania will be thus trepanned out of their liberties; that they will ſubmit without a ſtruggle? They muſt indeed be inebriated with the luſt of dominion, to indulge ſuch chimerical ideas. Will the act of one ſixth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this too, founded on deception and ſurpriſe, bind the community. Is it thus that the altar of liberty ſo recently crimſoned with the blood of our worthies, is it to be proſtrated, and deſpotiſm reared on its ruins? Certainly not. The ſolemn mummery that has been acting in the name of the people of Pennſylvania, will be treated with the deſerved contempt, it has ſerved, indeed, to expoſe the principles of the men concerned, and to draw a line of diſcrimination between the real and affected patriots.</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with an high opinion of the underſtanding and ſpirit of my fellow citizens, I have in no ſtage of this buſineſs entertained a doubt of its eventual defeat; the momentary deluſion, ariſing from an unreſerved confidence placed in ſome of the characters whoſe names ſanctioned this ſcheme of power, did not diſcourage me: I foreſaw that this blind admiration would diſcover it, native deformity.</p>

               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:021344_0102_0FB31D85CE8A61B0"/>Already the enlightened pen of patriotiſm, aided by an able public diſcuſſion, has diſpelled the miſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and the great body of the people are awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a due ſenſe of their danger, and are determined to aſſert their liberty, if neceſſary, by the ſword, but this mean need not to be recurred to, for who are their enemies? A junto, compoſed of the lordly and high minded gentry, of the profligate and the needy office hunters, of men, principally, who, in the late war, ſkulked from the common danger. Would ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters dare to face the majeſty of a free people? No: All the conflict would be between the offended juſtice and generoſity of the people, whether theſe ſacrilegious invaders of their deareſt rights ſhould ſuffer the merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed puniſhment, or eſcape with an infamous contempt.</p>
            <p>However, as additional powers are neceſſary to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the people will no doubt ſee the expediency of calling a convention for this purpoſe as ſoon as may be, by applying to their repreſentatives in aſſembly, at their next ſeſſion, to appoint a ſuitable day for the election of ſuch convention.</p>

            <p>UNDER the benign influence of liberty, this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo recently a rugged wilderneſs, and the abode of ſavages and wild beaſts, has attained to a degree of improvement and greatneſs, in leſs than two ages, of which hiſtory furniſhes no parallel; it is here that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature may be viewed in all its glory, man aſſumes the ſtation deſigned him by the creation, a happy equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and independency pervades the community; it is here the human mind, untrammelled by the reſtraints

of arbitrary power, expands every faculty: as the field to fame and riches is open to all, it ſtimulates univerſal exertion and exhibits a lively picture of emulation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and happineſs. The unfortunate and oppreſſed of all nations fly to this grand aſylum, where liberty is ever protected, and induſtry crowned with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But as it is by compariſon only, that men eſtimate the value of any good, they are not ſenſible of the worth of theſe bleſſings they enjoy until they are deprived of them; hence, from ignorance of the horrors of ſlavery, nations that have been in poſſeſſion of that rareſt of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, liberty, have ſo eaſily parted with it: When groaning under the yoke of tyranny, what perils would they not encounter, what conſideration would they not give to regain the ineſtimable jewel they had loſt; but the jealouſy of deſpotiſm guards every avenue to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and confirms its empire at the expence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted people, whoſe property is made inſtrumental to their miſery; for the rapacious hand of power ſeizes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every thing, deſpair preſently ſucceeds, and every noble faculty of the mind being depreſſed, and all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to induſtry and exertion being removed, the people are adapted to the nature of the government, and drag out a liſtleſs exiſtence.</p>
            <p>If ever America ſhould be enſlaved, it will be from this cauſe, that they are not ſenſible of their peculiar felicity, that they are not aware of the value of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly boon committed to their care and protection; and if the preſent conſpiracy fails, as I have no doubt will be the caſe, it will be the triumph of reaſon and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, as theſe united ſtates have never felt the iron hand of power, or experienced the wretchedneſs of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>The conſpirators againſt our liberties have preſumed too much on the maxim, that nations do not take the alarm, until they feel oppreſſion. The enlightened ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of America have, on two memorable occaſions, convinced the tyrants of Europe, that they are endued with the faculty of foreſight, that they will ſedulouſly guard againſt the firſt introduction of tyranny, however ſpeciouſly gloſſed over, or whatever appearance it may aſſume: It was not the mere amount of the duty on
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:021344_0104_0FB31D89252BA7D0"/>
ſtamps, or tea, that America oppoſed; they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſignals of approaching deſpotiſm, as prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents whereon the ſuperſtructure of arbitrary ſway was to be reared.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding ſuch illuſtrious evidence of the good ſenſe and ſpirit of the people of theſe united ſtates, and contrary to all former experience of mankind, which demonſtrates, that it is only by gradual and impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degrees that nations have hitherto been enſlaved, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſe of conqueſt by the ſword; the authors of the preſent conſpiracy are attempting to ſeize upon abſolute power at one graſp; impatient of dominion, they have adopted a deciſive line of conduct, which if ſucceſsful would obliterate every trace of liberty. I congratulate my fellow citizens, that the infatuated confidence of their enemies has ſo blinded their ambition, that their defeat muſt be certain and eaſy; if imitating the refined policy of ſucceſsful deſpots, they had attacked the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of liberty by ſap, and gradually undermined its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, they would have ſtood a fairer chance of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deſign; but in this enlightened age thus raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attempt to carry the fortreſs by ſtorm, is folly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. They have even expoſed ſome of their batteries prematurely, and thereby unfolded every latent view; for the unlimited power of taxation would alone have been amply ſufficient for every purpoſe; by a proper application of this, the will and pleaſure of the rulers would of courſe have become the ſupreme law of the land; therefore there was no uſe in pourtraying the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate object, by ſuperadding the form to the reality of ſupremacy in the following clauſes, viz. that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers the new congreſs to make all laws that, may be neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution any of their powers by virtue of which every poſſible law will be conſtitutional, as they are to be the ſole judges of the propriety of ſuch laws; that which ordains that their acts ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land, any thing in the laws or conſtitution of any ſtate to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding; that which gives congreſs the abſolute controul over the time and mode of its appointment and election, whereby, independent of any other means; they may eſtabliſh hereditary deſpotiſm; that which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:021344_0105_0FB31D8CED85B3A8"/>
them to keep on foot at all times a ſtanding army; and that which ſubjects the militia to abſolute command. And to accelerate the ſubjugation of the people, trial by jury in civil caſes, and the liberty of the preſs are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
            <p>So flagrant, ſo audacious a conſpiracy againſt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of a free people, is without precedent; mankind in the darkeſt ages, have never been ſo inſulted—even then tyrants found it neceſſary to pay ſome reſpect to the habits and feelings of the people; and nothing but the name of a Waſhington could have occaſioned a moment's heſitation about the nature of the new plan, or ſaved its authors from the execration and vengeance of the people, which eventually will prove an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their treaſon, for America will reſent the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition practiſed upon the unſuſpicious zeal of her <hi>illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deliverer,</hi> and vindicate her character from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions of theſe enemies of her happineſs and fame.</p>
            <p>The advocates of this plan have artfully attempted to veil over the true nature and principles of it, with the names of thoſe reſpectable characters that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate cunning and addreſs they have prevailed upon to ſign it, and what ought to convince the people of the deception and excite their apprehenſions, is, that with every advantage which education, the ſcience of government, and of law, the knowledge of hiſtory, and ſuperior talents and endowments furniſh the authors and advocates of this plan, they have, from its publication, exerted all their power and influence to prevent all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the ſubject, and when this could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, they have conſtantly avoided the ground of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and recurred to declamation, ſophiſtry, and perſonal abuſe, but principally relied upon the magic of names. Would this have been their conduct, if their cauſe had been a good one? No: they would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited veſtigation, and convinced the underſtandings of the people.</p>
            <p>But ſuch policy indicates great ignorance of the good ſenſe and ſpirit of the people; for if the ſanction of every convention throughout the union was obtained by the means theſe men are practiſing, yet their triumph would be momentary, the favorite object would ſtill

elude their graſp, for a government founded on fraud and deception could not be maintained without an army ſufficiently powerful to compel ſubmiſſion, which the <hi>well-born</hi> of America could not ſpeedily accompliſh. However, the complexion of ſeveral of the more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſtates does not promiſe even this point of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, New-York, and New-Hampſhire, have, by their wiſdom in taking a longer time to deliberate, in all probability ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the diſgrace of becoming the dupes of this gilded bait, as experience will evince, that it need only be properly examined to be execrated and repulſed.</p>

This may account for the infatuation of ſome of our merchants, who, elated with the imaginary proſpect of an improved commerce under the new government, overlook all danger; they do not conſider that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is the handmaid of liberty, a plant of free growth that withers under the hand of deſpotiſm, that every concern of individuals will be ſacrificed to the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men in power, who will inſtitute injurious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies, and ſhackle commerce with every device of avarice; and that property of every ſpecies will be held at the <hi>will and pleaſure</hi> of rulers.</p>

            <p>The higheſt illuſtration of the excellence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this commonwealth, is, that from its firſt eſtabliſhment, the ambitious and profligate have been united in a conſtant conſpiracy to deſtroy it; ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are they that it is their great enemy, that it is the great palladium of equal liberty, and the property of the people from the rapacious hand of power: the annals of mankind do not furniſh a more glorious inſtance of the triumph of patriotiſm over the luſt of ambition, aided by moſt of the wealth of the ſtate. The few general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail over the many by uniformity of council, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitted and perſevering exertion, and ſuperior inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and addreſs; but in Pennſylvania, the reverſe has happened; here the <hi>well-born</hi> have been baffled in all their efforts to proſtrate the altar of liberty for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſubſtit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The preſent conſpiracy is a continental exertion of the <hi>well-born</hi> of America to obtain that darling domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which they have not been able to accompliſh in their reſpective ſtates. Of what complexion were the deputies of this ſtate in the general convention? Six out of eight were the inveterate enemies of our ineſtimable conſtitution, and the principles of that faction that for ten years paſt have kept the people in continual alarm for their liberties. Who are the advocates of the new conſtitution in this ſtate?

uſual gradations to abſolute power, and have attempted to ſeize at once upon the ſupremacy of dominion. The new inſtrument of government does indeed make a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious parade of ſome remaining privileges, and inſults the underſtandings of the people with the ſemblance of liberty in ſome of its artful and deceptive clauſes, which form but a flimſy veil over the reality of tyranny, ſo weakly endeavoured to be concealed from the eye of freedom. For, of what avail are the few inadequate ſtipulations in favor of the rights of the people, when they may be effectually counteracted and deſtroyed by virtue of other clauſes; when theſe enable the rulers to renounce all dependence on their conſtituents, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the latter tenants at will of every concern? The new conſtitution is in fact a <hi>carte blanche,</hi> a ſurrender at diſcretion to the will and pleaſure of our rulers; as this has been demonſtrated to be the caſe, by the inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation and diſcuſſion that have taken place, I truſt the ſame good ſenſe and ſpirit which have hitherto enabled the people to triumph over the wiles of ambition, will be again exerted for their ſalvation. The accounts from various parts of the country correſpond with my warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hopes, and juſtify my early predictions of the eventual defeat of this ſcheme of power and office making.</p>
            <p>The genius of liberty has ſounded the alarm, and the dormant ſpirit of her votaries is reviving with enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic ardor; the like unanimity which formerly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them in their conflict with foreign deſpots, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to crown their virtuous oppoſition on the preſent occaſion, with ſignal ſucceſs. The ſtructure of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm that has been reared in this ſtate, upon deception and ſurpriſe, will vaniſh like the baſeleſs fabric of a dream, and leave not a trace behind.</p>
            <p>The peraſites and tools of power in Northampton county ought to take warning from the fate of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle junto, leſt like them, they experience the reſentment of an injured people. I would adviſe them not to repeat the impoſition of a ſet of fallacious reſolutions as the ſenſe of that county, when in fact, it was the act of a deſpicable few, with Alexander Patterſon at their head, whoſe atchievements at Wyoming, as the meaner inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of unfeeling avarice, have rendered inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but yet, like the election of a Mr. Sedgwick for the little town of Stockbridge, which has been adduced as evidence of the unanimity of the weſtern counties of Maſſachuſetts ſtate in favour of the new conſtitution, when the fact is far otherwiſe, this act of a few individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als will be founded forth over the continent as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the zealous attachment of the county of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton to the new conſtitution. By ſuch wretched and momentary deceptions do theſe harpies of power endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give the complexion of ſtrength to their cauſe. To prevent the detection of ſuch impoſitions, to prevent the reflection of the rays of light from ſtate to ſtate, which producing general illumination, would diſſipate the miſt of deception, and thereby prove fatal to the new conſtitution, all intercourſe between the patriots of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica is as far as poſſible cut off; whilſt on the other hand, the conſpirators have the moſt exact information, a common concert is every where evident, they move in uniſon.

            <p>It is a fact that can be eſtabliſhed, that during almoſt the whole of the time that the late convention of this ſtate were aſſembled, the newſ-papers publiſhed in New-York, by Mr. Greenleaf, which contain the eſſays writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there againſt the new government, ſuch as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic ones of Brutus, Cincinnatus, Cato, &amp;c. ſent as uſual by the printer of that place, to the printers of this city, miſcarried in their conveyance, which prevented the re-publication in this ſtate, of many of theſe pieces, and ſince that period great irregularity prevails; and I ſtand informed, that the printers in New-York complain that the free and independent newſpapers of this city do not come to hand; whilſt on the contrary, we find the devoted vehicles of deſpoti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

at this momentous criſis, when our every concern is dependent upon a proper deciſion of the ſubject in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion. No trivial excuſe will be admitted; the Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel will, as from the firſt approach of deſpotiſm, warn his countrymen of the inſidious and baſe ſtratagems that are practiſing to hoodwink them out of their liberties.</p>
            <p>The more I conſider the manoeuvres that are practiſing, the more am I alarmed—foreſeeing that the juggle can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long be concealed, and that the ſpirit of the people will not brook the impoſition, they have guarded, as they ſuppoſe, againſt any danger ariſing from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the people, and rendered their ſtruggles for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty impotent and ridiculous. What otherwiſe is the meaning of diſarming the militia, for the purpoſe, as it is ſaid, of repairing their muſquets at ſuch a particular period? Does not the timeing of the meaſure determine the intention. I was ever jealous of the ſelect militia, conſiſting of infantry and troops of horſe, inſtituted in this city, and in ſome of the counties, without the fanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of law, and officered principally by the devoted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the well born, although the illuſtrious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm of one of them, has not correſponded with the intention of appointing him. Are not theſe corps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to ſuppreſs the firſt efforts of freedom, and to check the ſpirit of the people until a regular and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently powerful military force ſhall be embodied to rivet the chains of ſlavery on a deluded nation. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms theſe apprehenſions, is the declaration of a certain major, an active inſtrument in this buſineſs, and the echo of the principal conſpirators, who has ſaid, he ſhould dee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
