            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AS ſome religious perſons may miſconceive the reaſons which prevent Friends from freely centributing (when called upon) to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the Methodiſt miſſions, to the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Iſlands and Africa, to inſtruct the Negroes in Chriſtianity; I have been induced to point out ſo many of them, for their information, as may, I hope, convince impartial minds, that they are not therein actuated by a ſpirit of bigotry; but, on the contrary, of religious caution, leſt they ſhould any way contribute to <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> ii.18.</note> build again thoſe things which the Spirit of truth has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in their religious ſociety.</p>
            <p>There remains no doubt, that many of the preachers amongſt the Methodiſts have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to rouſe ſinful men from their beds of eaſe, and convince them of the danger of their ſtate, and of the impoſſibility of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſalvation, even through the mediation of Chriſt, unleſs they are renewed up in hm, thro' the purifying operation of his Holy Spirit, in righteouſneſs and inward holineſs.</p>
            <p>So far as this awakening work has advanced, and its conſequent fruits of renovation of mind and manners have been produced, the truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious among Friends have rejoiced therein; and have united in ſpirit with their conſcientious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:046546_0003_102203BCB427D650"/>ſo far as they have miniſtered in the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which flows from Chriſt, the holy Head of his own Church; as well as with the really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed members of the Society, who act agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the light wherewith they have been favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are concerned to attain a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their duty, and experience of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>For <hi>theſe,</hi> Friends deſire that they may witneſs an entire and ſteady ſettlement under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's pure Spirit, which is the alone infallible teacher and leader, appointed of Chriſt to be ſo unto the end of time. To him all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental miniſters ſhould direct thoſe minds they have been aſſiſted to awaken, that they may know him to <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> xvi.13.</note> "guide them into all truth," conſonant with the promiſe of Chriſt, who, by this his own pure Spirit, is with his diſciples and followers in their reſpective ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſervices, <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii.20.</note> "alway, even unto the end of the world;" bringing all his edifying ſayings to their remembrance, as their ſpiritual ſtates require them, either for reproof, inſtruction, or conſolation; and opening their underſtandings into his holy doctrines, and the glorious myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of redemption through him, from unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that they may become purified unto God, <note n="(d)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Titus</hi> ii.14.</note> "a peculiar people, zealous of good works."</p>
            <p>But, whereas it appears to Friends, that ſome of the principal leaders among the Methodiſts,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:046546_0004_102203BE396D5AE0"/>endeavour to fix the people in the obſervance of forms and inefficacious ceremonies, which, in the apoſtatized ſtate of the Chriſtian Church, were ſtiled religious, they cannot therein unite with them. For out of all theſe did the divine Spirit of Truth, lead their zealous and pious predeceſſors, in their beginning as a people; and it does ſtill convince the truly enlightened among them, that, inſtead of eſtabliſhing the mind in the holy fear of God, and in a ſteady depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him, they tend to deprive him, in part, of the honor of his own glorious work in the ſoul, by leading to a degree of reliance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> iv 9.</note> "weak and beggarly elements" for aſſiſtance to perfect them in righteouſneſs, and on <note n="(f)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> i.25.</note> "the creature more than the Creator, who is God, bleſſed for ever, Amen," ſay the ſouls who humbly wait upon him, and witneſs his Son revealed in them by his Spirit, to be their King, Prieſt, and Prophet; their <note n="(g)" place="bottom">

            <p>Theſe, ſeeing that the end is come upon the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy diſpenſations of the Moſaic Law, and of John the Baptiſt, can no longer touch nor taſte with
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:046546_0005_102203ACEF747BB8"/>them, knowing, that when their appointed uſe in their ſeaſon was fulfilled, they were to ceaſe, and that Chriſt's ſpiritual diſpenſation, of <note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> i.</note> Light, Grace, and Truth, muſt ſtand alone and be exalted upon the top of all mountains of high profeſſion. This is confirmed by the anſwer given to theſe peculiarly favored diſciples, who, ſeeing Chriſt's transfiguration upon the mount, and <note n="(j)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> xvii.3, 4, 5. &amp; 10 <hi>to</hi> 13.</note> "Moſes and Elias talking with him," were overcome with the glory they had beheld; and Peter requeſted of him allowance to "build three tabernacles, one for him, one for Moſes, and one for Elias," <note n="(k)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> xi.14.</note> who is John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, not knowing what he ſaid; he not having ſeen to the end of all that was to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the inſtruction from God was, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him." Thus the Father condeſcended, immediately, to teſtify to his own laſt and moſt glorious diſpenſation of grace and truth, thro' his Son to mankind, appointing him their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and free teacher; not then leaving it to himſelf to teſtify to his own office, although <note n="(l)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> ii.9.</note> "in him dwelleth all the fullneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily."</p>
            <p>Under a ſenſe of the awfulneſs of this merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manifeſtation of the will of the Father, my mind is humbled; and deſires are raiſed, that the Son, through his own pure Spirit of light and life, may inſtruct and invigorate awakened
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:046546_0006_102203C0351F4DE0"/>minds, to the perfecting them in true holineſs of faith and practice.</p>
            <p>When men ſet bounds to this holy Spirit of wiſdom, and endeavor to fix the people in the obſervance of what themſelves acknowledge to be non-eſſentials, Friends cannot unite with them herein; becauſe in Chriſt's church nothing can remain by his appointment, which is inefficacious.</p>
            <p>All that is of human appointment, or which is retained of the former diſpenſations, muſt be come out of: and let human reaſoning ſupport, as it may for a time, the uſeleſs ceremonies which remain in the nominal Chriſtian Church; the true light will diſcover them to be but chaff, from which Chriſt will purge <hi>his own</hi> ſpiritual Church. Therefore, religious minds ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how they hold faſt or ſupport that which he hath appointed to be denied, as being under his pure ſpiritual diſpenſation unclean <hi>unto them,</hi> and not to be touched.</p>
            <p>Friends have been inſtructed, that Chriſt as the holy, living, wiſe <hi>Head of his Church,</hi> hath the ſole power and right to purify, qualify, call, ſend forth, direct and aſſiſt his miniſters; who, by the immediate operation of his Spirit upon their ſpirits, are made in their reſpective mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures <note n="(m)" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii.6.7.</note> "able miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not of the letter which killeth, but of the Spirit which giveth life."

And as in Chriſt Jeſus <note n="(p)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gal</hi> iii.28.</note> "there is neither male nor female;" and <note n="(q)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> ii.17 18.</note> "his Spirit was poured forth upon both ſexes," to qualify for theſe ſervices; ſo among Friends, liberty is given to women to ſpeak <note n="(r)" place="bottom">

            <p>Now as Friends have believed in, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced this pure ſpiritual miniſtry and worſhip, and have been commanded to teſtify againſt its contrary; and for obedience to God therein have <note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:046546_0008_102203C22EFACB60"/>whereby their miniſters are directed how and when to preach and pray, where to go, and among what people to labor, any more than with the human wiſdom, which ſeeks qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to miniſter from human learning, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from men. They acknowledge that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning may be made uſeful under Divine direction; but they know that he who choſe and qualified poor illiterate fiſhermen, &amp;c. to preach his goſpel <note n="(t)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii.4.</note> "in the demonſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of power," <hi>is able to do ſo ſtill.</hi> And if he call theſe who have not ſchool learning into hiſ ſervice, 'tis not for them to ſeek there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be perfected therein.</p>
            <p>They have believed that miniſters ſhould not, in any degree, be excited to engage in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry by a view to worldly intereſt or honor; and that Chriſt's command to <hi>his</hi> miniſters is yet in force, <note n="(u)" place="bottom">

Many mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters among them, labor with their hands to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their neceſſities; and others, accounting it more honorable to give than to receive (as

            <p>From the foregoing premiſes it muſt appear, that Friends cannot, conſiſtently with ther own principles, freely unite with the leaders of the Methodiſt Society, who eſtabliſh all the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England, and the maintenance of its miniſters by tythes; the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof, the truly conſcientious among Friends cannot ſubmit to; becauſe thoſe being a part of the Levitical law, are ended in Chriſt, as is the obſervance of all the ceremonies of that diſpenſation, which were but a <note n="(t)" place="bottom">

            <p>They lament, that the reformation from the apoſtatized Romiſh Church, which has made ſome progreſs in this nation, did not go forward to the full accompliſhment thereof, although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny laid down their lives to effect it, ſo far as they had ſeen; and are, doubtleſs, numbered with the glorified ſpirits perfected through ſufferings.— Some of theſe faithful martyrs teſtified againſt things which yet remain in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and which its miniſters ſeek to uphold; but which muſt be deſtroyed when Chriſt by his

            <p>Now having, in a mind clothed with charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all truly religious perſons, whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings may not be ſo fully opened, as to ſee the end of all which ſhould be aboliſhed in the nominal Chriſtian Church, penned the foregoing reaſons: I proceed to ſtate a few Queries conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant therewith, and tending to diſcover whether ſome obſervances, approved and practiſed by ſome of the miſſionaries ſent among the poor Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, may not tend to fix their dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what cannot profit them; and may confuſe their weak judgments, rather than eſtabliſh them in the pure ſpiritual faith in Chriſt, and in the exerciſe of a worſhip conſiſtent therewith.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> Suppoſing theſe poor ignorant people, through preaching the doctrines of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſcripture, have been taught that it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to their ſalvation, that they ſhould experience a change of nature; for whereas man is a fallen creature, and as ſuch, is by nature of the <note n="(v)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv.47.</note> "earth earthy," and hath deſires and inclinations agreeable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved earthly ſtate, and hath brought forth the condemnable fruits of the fleſh; he muſt be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:046546_0011_102203C6484CB9B0"/>minded, experiencing his deſires and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to be after bringing forth the fruits of righteoſneſs, and knowing his ſpirit clothed with true holineſs; and that this neceſſary work of renovation, can only be effected by the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe coming and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to ſave them from ſin, they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to believe. Now, if through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, a degree of living faith has been raiſed in the power of Chriſt, as the head of, and alone ſanctifier and perfecter of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body or Church; can it avail any thing to ſprinkle a little water in their faces, and croſs their foreheads with the finger, uſing the cuſtomary words in the performance of that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and thanking God for their <note n="*" place="bottom">

If it be ſaid, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to water baptiſm is a public acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their faith in Chriſt; I anſwer, Firſt, That ſprinkling is not water baptiſm, but an innovated ceremony ſubſtituted for it, introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a dark night of apoſtacy from the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of genuine Chriſtianity: And Secondly, No proof can be deduced from ſcripture, that Chriſt ever appointed Water Baptiſm in his Church; although, to fulfil in his own perſon all the diſpenſations appointed of his Father, he ſubmitted to it, as he did to all the Moſaic rites, &amp;c. and until he had done ſo, and had offered
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:046546_0012_102203C8AEEF1360"/>up himſelf, as the one efficacious ſacrifice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his Father for the ſins of the whole world, agreeable to his own teſtimony, <note n="(w)" place="bottom">

And further, What can they think of this ceremony being performed as a neceſſary rite upon infants who are incapable of believing, and have committed no ſin? If they are told that infants are included in the fall, muſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that by this ceremony they are raiſed out of it, and are then and thereby really regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated? Did not Chriſt die for infants as well as for adults? and has he left the completion of the work of their ſalvation (if they die in an infant ſtate) to the option, and in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of men, who may perform it or not at their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:046546_0014_102203CA34958858"/>pleaſure; and made it poſſible that this work may be acompliſhed by a bad man as well as by a good one?

            <p>Throughout the New Teſtament we do not find any precept or example for Infant Baptiſm. But, alas! the poor Negroes muſt be taught, that it is neceſſary for their children to be ſprik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (baptized they are n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> for, dying without it, their ſouls are not ſafe. And the children when grown up may, as many in this land do, avail themſelves of being what is called baptized in their infancy, and never ſeek after the alone ſaving Baptiſm <note n="(d)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Peter</hi> iii.21.</note> "which is not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, by the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt," whereof <hi>he,</hi> by his Holy
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:046546_0015_102203CBD6047D68"/>Spirit, is the ſole adminiſtrator throughout all ages.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How can the Negroes conceive, that by eating a bit of bread, and ſupping a little wine, they really participate ſpiritually of the body and blood of Chriſt? The utmoſt that can be inferred from the words of Chriſt to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (as recited in Luke xxii.19 &amp; 20, at the paſſover, when he bleſſed and break the bread, and handed it as he did the cup to them, as the ſign of his body and blood being offered up for them) is, that "they did it in remembrance of him, and thereby ſhewed forth his death till he came." And although to a truly religious perſon, who conſcientiouſly obſerves this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, merely as a remembrance of him, there may a degree of ſolemnity attend, under the conſideration of his ſufferings, and the merciful end of his coming; I will venture to aſſert, that his body and blood is not ſpiritually conveyed by the adminiſtering material bread and wine; nor does the communion of the ſaints ſtand in any degree therein: nor is it neceſſary thereby to revive the remembrance of Chriſt in thoſe ſouls, who have experienced his ſecond coming unto their ſalvation from ſin; for theſe ſanctify him in their hearts, and feed upon him, the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternal word of God, with whom they have ſweet communion; and many of them ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the non-neceſſity of continuing this (as the Church of England ſtiles it) <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>I believe but few who obſerve this ceremony, ſuppoſe themſelves to be ſo unfaithful, as not to be benefited thereby.</hi>

               <hi>not of the faithful,</hi> and yet are exerciſed in that which is acknowledged to be but the ſhadow, abide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſuppoſing it to be a means of conveying the body and blood of Chriſt to their ſouls? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of charity this may be concluded to be the caſe of many, who partake of the outward bread and wine; for they are too unclean to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Chriſt's holy table, or to taſte of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſpiritually.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In regard to the outward mode of worſhip, ſome of the principal leaders among the Methodiſts direct their followers to attend that of the Church of England; and what can the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes think, when they ſee the miniſter put on a white robe to read prayers in, and a <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>William Fulk, that Engliſh champion of the Proteſtants in the time of Queen Elizabeth, writes, "The Prieſts of Baal had the name of Chemarims for their black garments, which they did wear ſuperſtitiouſly." See Zeph.</hi> i.4. <hi>which Anthony Purver, in his tranſlation of the Old Teſtament, makes "Black ones." The critics have allowed Purver to be a literal, tho' in ſome inſtances an inelegant tranſſator; but I think, whoever reads him with attention will admit, that in many parts, the ſenſe of ſcripture is conveyed much more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than in the common tranſlation.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:046546_0017_102203D19DE5F9F8"/>to preach in? Again, how are they edified by the miniſter's going from the pulpit or deſk, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat a part of the ſervice before the communion table; and, at particular times, the people turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying towards the eaſt? What is meant by theſe changes of garments and attitudes in prayer, by thoſe who obſerve them, I know not; but ſuſpect both to be retained from the heathens, as the prieſts of Baal were wont to be clothed in black, and the Romans prayed towards the eaſt; probably becauſe there the ſun aroſe, as other pagans (particularly the Perſians) worſhipped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the riſing ſun. If any of the Negroes in Africa pay adoration to that luminary, may not thoſe in our Weſt-India ſettlements, &amp;c. who ſee this cuſtom continued in the Church of England liturgy, be pleaſed; and ſuppoſe that God, in a particular manner, is preſent in that quarter of the heavens? Whereas the heaven of heavens cannot contain him; yet his throne is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a truly humbled heart, which is alſo his temple and altar, cleanſed and conſecrated by the Holy Spirit to his ſervice. Oh! the humbling depth of his worſhip!—did profeſſing Chriſtians comprehend it, they would ſee how inconſiſtent the frequent varied poſtures, ſounds, and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of words, wherein many of them are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, are therewith; which, inſtead of adding to the ſolemnity of public worſhip, tend, by a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:046546_0018_102203B555173738"/>continual round of bodily exerciſes, to prevent the Spirit's entering in the worſhip of God, in his "temple of the heart," whereinto when he is entered, <note n="(e)" place="bottom">

            <p>I might enlarge, but hope I have ſaid enough to exculpate Friends from juſt cenſure, for not contributing to the expences of the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned miſſions; but am inclined here to add, that ſome enlightened minds of both clergy and laity of the Church of England have lamented, that ſuch obſervances ſhould remain therein, as tend to ſhade the luſtre of its fundamental principle, and prevent many from uniting with them in the outward mode of worſhip.</p>
            <p>Should the conſtraining power of goſpel-love, engage miniſters among Friends to viſit the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, and endeavour to turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from <note n="(f)" place="bottom">

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:046546_0019_102203D3230D9260"/>And, inaſmuch as all miniſters who conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly labour among the Negroes, may not ſee alike in ſome points, yet may all of them concur in labouring, that they may attain the neceſſary experience of faith in Chriſt, and regeneration through his Spirit: Each of them ſhould be careful not to invalidate the labors of others, nor ſtrive to fix the Negroes in obſervances which will not profit them: ever bearing in mind the following apoſtolic injunctions, as neceſſary to be obſerved by every goſpel miniſter, viz.. <note n="(g)" place="bottom">
