            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

CYNTHIA. A NOVEL.</head>
         <div type="part_of_story">
            <p>FORTH from a deſert and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented wood in the eaſt parts of Albion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butting to the ſea, iſſued out a woman; and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf upon a carpet of ſweet flowers, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered by the hand of nature; ſhe reſembled Diana, the beautiful huntreſs of the woods; or more fair, if poſſible: one would have taken her for a celeſtial deity, if the ſucceeding viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of fortune had not ſtrongly perſuaded ſhe was a mortal beauty. Indeed the purity of her complexion ſeemed to excel the new fallen ſnow, but ſorrow gathered the carnation off her cheeks. All the features of her face had ſo near a kindred, and formed to ſo rare a proportion, that ſhe ſeemed nature's maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; or rather ſympathiſed ſomething of that divinity which name ſhe bore. From her eyes darted a luſtre, mingled with a vivacity ſo pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating, that it was impoſſible for the moſt confident ſoul to make reſiſtance. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious creature, after, ſhe had ſearched every vacant place with her eye, fearing to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033593_0003_0FF7972D34C045C0"/>
with a troubled and low voice ſhe began as followeth:</p>
            <p>"O my dear, though abſent, Orſamus! To whoſe merits I never yet gave any reward, whoſe complaints I could never be induced to pity! When Neptune ſhipwrecked thee upon the ſhore, I little thought thy preſence would beget me ſuch diſquiet; O duty! O love! To what extremes do you hurry me? And what enemies are you to my reſt? The birds that live in theſe unfrequented woods are happier than I; for they may chuſe their mates, and carol their ſweet pleaſures to the ſpring; but by the cruel commands of a father I am forced to neglect the perſon I love; and diſeſteem the ſervices of one with diſdain, whoſe welfare I prize above my life; who once left, I would not bid a welcome to the deareſt good the world can afford me. But alas! The time draws near that will make a perpetual divorce. Unfortunate Orſamus, by thy abſence; miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Cynthia, by thy folly."</p>
            <p>Scarce had theſe words took a farewel from her mouth, when from an adjacent part of the wood iſſued out a man richly appareled, and bent his ſteps directly to the place where ſhe ſat. Her eyes had no ſooner found him out, but with exceſs of grief ſhe uttered theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, "O cruel Heavens! Do you take a pleaſure in tormenting ſubmitting innocence,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033593_0004_0FF7972ECB7983E8"/>
that you conduct this monſter, the enemy of my content, and fatal diſturber of my quiet, ſo unfortunately to the place of my concealment; now farewel my poor Orſamus; I ſhall only ſtay here amongſt the living to conſecrate the relicts of a languiſhing life to thy dear mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory."</p>
            <p>By this time the unknown perſon came up; and ſeating himſelf by her ſide, he accoſted her with this diſcourſe: "Madam, ſaid he, your father expects you with ardency, and is in fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſions of the certainty of your ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Why, madam, continued he, at ſuch a time as this do you ſeek out ſolitude, and ſo carefully ſhun the perſon that adores you? Why theſe clouds my dear princeſs, on a joyful day; wherefore theſe tears too, too precious to be thus laviſhly caſt away; Why are my promiſing joys overcaſt with ſuch fearful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, and my ſweeteſt hopes vaniſhed? Tell me, O tell me! joy of my bliſs, what may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion your diſquiet, that with the peril of my life I may procure a remedy."</p>
            <p>This fair unknown was preparing, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, when they were diſturbed with a noiſe from the neighbouring thickets; and caſting their eyes about to underſtand the cauſe of that ſurprizal, when behold there ruſhed out a man, whoſe unexpected appearance was quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their aſtoniſhment: his viſage was pale
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033593_0005_0FF79730655E19E0"/>
and clouded over with grief; in all regards and lineaments of his face appeared a natural fierceneſs; his whole compoſure ſhewed the ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence of ſomething ſo great and noble that ſpake him to command others, born to diſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem the whole world, and think it held none fit to be his rival.</p>
            <p>He ſet his face and directed his haſty ſteps to the place where they ſat; but his preſence put them both in confuſion. He no ſooner preſented himſelf to their ſight, but fixing his eyes wholly on this fair unknown, as the load ſtone of his will, and centre of his happineſs, with a rapture of joy he ſuddenly caſt himſelf at her feet. "O my divine princeſs, ſaid he, beautiful cauſe of my misfortunes, and cruel origin of all my miſeries? How careful has fortune been to make me happy, when I have intended to ſacrifice the fragment of this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life to your ſeverity? I have yet this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort left me in death, to complain to you of your injuſtice."</p>
            <p>All this time a wavering colour often went and came in her cheeks, that ſhe became ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with aſtoniſhment, as if ſhe had been planet ſtruck; but at laſt calling back that aſſurance her ſudden ſurprizal had ſequeſtered, "Gods, ſaid ſhe, is this Orſamus himſelf I ſee before me? Yes, replied he; it is Orſamus, if you have not caſt the memory of ſo poor a wretch
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033593_0006_0FF79732DA803DA0"/>
into oblivion." This ſaid, he diſſembled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from her knees, and with a look full of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he drew his ſword to pierce his breaſt with that fatal weapon. But Cynthia no ſooner ſaw that glittering miniſter of death unſheathed, but giving a grievious ſhriek, ſhe fell into a deadly ſwoon; when ſuddenly caſting his eyes about, he ſaw this firſt gallant ſitting like one metamorphoſed, or a ſtatue without life; and ſuddenly calling him to remembrance, "Oh (cried he) have I found you, the only oppoſer of my bliſs? Can you think to go ſafely away with that prize, which is only due to my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; If you know how to own a good, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the intereſt you would challenge in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine creature with your ſword." Saying this, he preſented his ſword againſt his breaſt, but he never moved from the place where he ſat, neither did he endeavour to make any motion of defence.</p>
            <p>In this interim of time, his friends who had been in queſt of him in the moſt ſecret parts of the wood, hearing of a diſturbance, came up unto him, and ſeeing Cordello in danger, at that moment they made in, and reſcued him out of his hands, when no doubt he had acted the laſt cataſtrophe and ſcene of his life. They all aſſaulted him at once; but he, without ſpending a thought upon the number, ruſhed upon them like lightning, with a ſwiftneſs,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033593_0007_0FF7973643A7E1F0"/>
and looks ſo terrible and dreadful, that he made the forwardeſt repent their raſhneſs. Six lay ſtain by his hands: and they had encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed him about, ſo that it ſeemed impoſſible he could make any longer reſiſtance againſt ſuch numbers as ſurrounded him.</p>
            <p>When lo! fortune provided a remedy for this diſaſter; yet one that ſeemed worſe than the diſeaſe. Behold from an adjoining creek of the ſea, ſhaded by a little hill, iſſued about ſixteen pirates led on by their captain. They came not to aſſiſt either ſide, but to make their utmoſt advantage of both. No ſooner had the aſſailants of this brave cavalier beheld them coming, but they all ran away; only he alone ſet him in a poſture of defence to preſerve the lady; but, overpowered by their numbers, they forced him to ſubmit to their will; yet not before he had received four deſperate wounds in the body; in revenge of which he had ſlain four of the beſt men belonging to their veſſel. They conveyed Cynthia, with Orſamus, on board the boat, intending to ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfy the death of their companions with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who had occaſioned it. They put off from ſhore, and began to prepare for his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; mean while the fair Cynthia, whoſe ſpirits were newly returned to execute their proper functions, ſat almoſt diſſolved in tears, beholding theſe preparations for Orſamus's
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033593_0008_0FF79737D4CE9190"/>
death, fearfully apprehending what ſhe could not as yet know the cauſe of; going unto him that ſeemed commander of the reſt, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded "to what uſe thoſe weapons, and preparations of death were made?" He return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anſwer, "for that cavalier who in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence had ſlain four of the beſt men belonging unto his ſhip." "Sir, replyed Cynthia, that young man is my brother; and ye cannot well blame him in what he did in the defence of a dear ſiſter: and ſure the courſe you would take is indirect, ſince if you fulfil your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you can gain nothing by his death, but preſerving his life, you may receive a great ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
            <p>The ſweet thought of gain, delivered from ſuch a lovely creature, ſet both his love and covetouſneſs on the rack. In fine, the hope of gain turned the current of their revenge, in execution of which their choler abated, and they reſted ſatisfied. But it was not ſo with their commander, for the eyes of his fair priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner had opened themſelves a paſſage, and darted their reſplendant rays into the ſoul of this fierce pirate. He found ſuch charms as it ſeemed impoſſible, and mere folly, to ſtand in oppoſition againſt them. Here was a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſe wrought by the force of love and beauty, a barbarian civilized to a milder tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for, accoſting his fair prey, he compoſed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033593_0009_0FF797F9C4499C48"/>
all that was fierce and rude to reſpect and duty. "Madam, replied he, 'tis enough that you deſire your brother ſhould live; reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he ſhall live only for your ſake; not ſo much for our intereſt as for your content; for we could well have diſpenſed with our gain to give our revenge precedence: but your deſires have put a period to our reſentment; thus you reign triumphant while you eſteem yourſelf a captive. O madam, continued he, ceaſe thoſe ſhowers: clear up thoſe bright ſtars, have you any deſire? Give them a name; for I find it irreſiſtable to give you a denial. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to yonder cabin, which ſhall be wholly at your diſpoſal. Your menial ſervants ſhall not be more officious, than theſe my men that ſeem ſo barbarous ſhall be dutiful at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. For myſelf I'll pay my reſpects with as much chaſte zeal as we pay our devotion to the offended deities, at ſuch a time only when my viſits will not incommode you: for I am not ſo much a pirate but I know what civilities ought to be paid to ladies of your quality; which, as you appear to me, is not mean.— Reſt firm in the aſſurance of my promiſe, whilſt I take care for the ſpeedy dreſſing of your brother's wounds, and for his accomodation in the ſhip." Saying this, he left her in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpect.</p>
            <p>Orſamus, who was an auditor and ſpectator
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033593_0010_0FF797398F337AC0"/>
of the diſcourſe that paſſed betwixt the pirate and Cynthia, was tranſported with raviſhment when he underſtood that ſhe was his preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. "Nay, ſaid he, ſince my life is not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to my fair divinity, I'll live to free her from this captivity, or periſh in the attempt; ſince ſhe ſeems to have an eſteem for my life, I'll endeavour to preſerve it, for I cannot but prize what ſhe eſteems." Theſe words were overheard by thoſe that guarded him: but being ſpoken in Engliſh were not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. By their captain's command he was carefully conducted into the hold, where he had a lodging aſſigned him, and ſurgeons ſent him that ſearched his wounds, which they found dangerous, but not mortal: they careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreſſed them and left him unto his reſt.</p>
            <p>While things were thus ſtated, they would have tacked about again for the ſhore, to have received their expected ranſom for Orſamus; but there aroſe a cruel tempeſt, which convey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed them many leagues from thence into the main ocean. The captain was not ſo ſorry for diſappointing his men of their hopes, becauſe he had an opportunity to oblige Cynthia with the ſtayance of her ſuppoſed brother; as alſo to benefit himſelf in making him the ſolicitor of his love.</p>
            <p>Three days had paſſed ſince the laſt diſaſter befel Cynthia; mean time Orſamus was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033593_0011_0FF7973D27A43180"/>
dreſſed, and officiouſly attended, and Cynthia ſerved with caution, the pirate never viſiting her without permiſſion. On the fourth day he invited her to take a walk on the deck. It was about the time Sol left watery Neptune's bed and newly darted his rays upon the face of the water.</p>
            <p>Cynthia accorded with his deſire; and kindly preſenting him her hand, they went both forth the cabin. But oh! what a mine of beauties did the LIGHT preſent, which grief, and that diſmal place had detained from his eyes; for the pain and fear ſhe ſuffered for Orſamus, by the aſſurance of his ſafety, was partly vaniſhed away, ſo that the beauty they had put to flight, was almoſt returned back again to its uſual luſtre, which this pirate took ſome time to contemplate and admire.— The encreaſe of her beauty augmented his paſſion; and ſparks of love and pity that lay hid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, began to blaze into a flame, as by the ſequel will appear; for after ſhe had ſweetly complained unto him of the detaining of her freedom, and, that according to his promiſe, he had not put her brother to his ranſom, taking a hint from theſe words he began as followeth:</p>
            <p>"Madam, ſaid he, would I ſet your freedom to ſale, a kingdom were too little to buy the ranſom. If your brother's liberty has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033593_0012_0FF7973FA028D190"/>
perhaps your intereſt was the chief oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, when in ſome ſort to oblige you, I have neglected ſo great a gain. For ſhould I accord with you in this one thing, touching your freedom, poſſibly I ſhould divorce my eyes from the deareſt object forever. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, I love you, becauſe it is impoſſible to ſee you and be inſenſible. I have a paſſion for you that nothing can extinguiſh but death; but it is legitimate, and may be owned by you without a ſcruple, were your condition equal to the degrees of a princeſs. My birth is not ignoble, altho the diſaſters of my life have been uncommon; nor becauſe I ſeem ruſtic, is my condition ſo mean, ſince the king of Norway, a few days ſince, profered me his neice to wife, which upon my return to Norway, I did intend to accompliſh; and had certainly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it, had not your prodigious beauty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed my deſigns. And for your liberty, how can you account it a reſtraint when your goaler has become your ſlave? Abate but the thoughts of ſeparation, and your deſire cannot name another thing ſhould meet my refuſal. If once I be ſo happy to attain the ſhore of Norway, whither I intended in a few days to go, I will ſpend the reſidue of this wretched life at your feet." Here he contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſilent, leaving Cynthia in amaze at the diſcovery of his paſſion; yet being obliged to reply, ſhe returned the following anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:033593_0013_0FF79741316F22D8"/>Sir, your reſpective uſage could not give me more ſatisfaction then your unpleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe gives me diſcontent, ſince you take away the hopes of my liberty in denying my ranſom. Never think by conſtraint to gain my affection, nor by detaining my liberty to make me become kind. Would I accord to your will, I am at my brother's diſpoſal, whom you diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in denying him freedom, but never think by ſuch rude ways, to force love; for your hopes will all fail you; for my ſoul is free, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my body be your priſoner; and you ſhall find I can die when I cannot live. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, ſhe left him and returned to her cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>Mean while the pirate ſtood like one tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: yet, not minding to deſpair of the firſt repulſe, when he had the perſon in his power; ſo that recollecting his ſpirits, he went immediately to give Orſamus a viſit, whoſe wounds by this time were faſt recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>After ſalutations paſt, he deſired him to be his aſſiſtant to his ſiſter, who proteſted never to diſpoſe of herſelf without his conſent: promiſing him in recompence to give him his freedom: or if he would go with him to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he ſhould have ample revenues to ſubſiſt during life. Orſamus thanked him, and ſaid, if he would allow him the freedom to viſit his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033593_0014_0FF79743932D5128"/>
ſiſter, he would perform the utmoſt of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to procure her conſent; that if his felicity depended upon his diſpoſal, he would be no obſtruction to defer it; that ſeeing he had put him to choice, he had rather go to Norway with his ſiſter, than to return without her into his own country. Thus he was forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to delude him with hopes, ſo to detain him within the bounds of reaſon.</p>
            <p>The pirate was ſatisfied at the freedom of his diſcourſe, giving the phyſician orders, when his wounds would permit him, to let him have free acceſs to his ſiſter's chamber, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of converſation, at ſuch times as he beſt pleaſed.</p>
            <p>This paſt he left him to his reſt; but this tranſport was too great to let him mind that neceſſary miniſter of his health: that which Cynthia had done for him in preſerving his life, by adopting him with that happy title of brother, and laſtly, not to diſpoſe of herſelf without his conſent, was a fit ſubject to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his thoughts upon. Now her former rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours were all vaniſhed to his memory, and he conſidered her only as his benefactor, and orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal of his felicity.</p>
            <p>He paſt away his time in ſuch pleaſing tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, ever fancing the idea of his faireſt Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia before his eyes, that all other thoughts were huſhed in ſilence; his contentment ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033593_0015_0FF79747CE378AA8"/>
perfect, and his wounds received an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional cure, from the temperature and quietneſs of his mind, ſo that in two days time he found himſelf in a capacity to viſit his deareſt phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; which being made known to the pirate, the more to oblige Cynthia, he intended to preſent him unto her himſelf.</p>
            <p>'Twas about the time that Phoebus had clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his mid-day height, and began to drive his chariot to the weſtern ſeas, when Orſamus accompanied him to Cynthia's cabin. They found her ſitting in the moſt diſmal part of the room, very diſconſolate, accompanied only with a mournful ſilence. At their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, the pirate ſaluted her in this manner: Madam, ſince the diſconcealing of my love has begotton your diſquiet, I have courted all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to diſſipate your reſentment, yet I fear you will not welcome the happneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I bring it. This ſaid with great reſpect, he departed out of the Cabin.</p>
            <p>Scarce had he given an exit, ſhutting the door after him, but Orſamus in a tranſport caſt himſelf at her feet ſo haſtily, as ſhe had neither time nor power to prevent him. But ſhe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to let him remain in that condition, preſented him her hand, Riſe Orſamus (ſaid ſhe) this proſtrate action can ſcarce obtain its pardon; your preſence at this time is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome, ſince it has quietted me of ſome fears
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033593_0016_0FF797495F8FF4C0"/>
that prepoſſeſſed me in your abſence, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your welfare, and the wounds you receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my defence.</p>
            <p>Theſe wounds (replied Orſamus) have been leſs cruel than thoſe I received from your fair eyes; they would admit of a cure, but theſe daily augment, without hope of remedy. Oh! my deareſt princeſs! I die daily, and every moment begets a new death. If your anger has prepared me a condemnation, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fatal doom from your mouth with a perfect and entire obedience. Believe it, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamus, (replied ſhe) you will not obtain it ſo eaſily as your imagination flatters you; neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er prehaps has my ſeverity proceeded from the cauſe your opinion has taken it. No, no; I have not been inſenſible of your love, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of your merits, but have prized them both at their true value in my breaſt.</p>
            <p>Orſamus bowing his head at this diſcourſe with a profound reſpect; Then, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, I am not utterly loſt, for if my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs vote me happy, I will bid defiance to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune's malice; ſince ſhe cannot with all her ſtock of misfortunes make me miſerable. But, Madam, what ſhall this happy wretch do, whoſe life you have preſerved with ſuch exceſs of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity? what price ſhall he add for the leaſt of theſe divine bounties: by a fidelity, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cynthia, which I value above my father's
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033593_0017_0FF7974B0B075570"/>
crown; and, by which till death you may preſerve that affection, whereon you eſtabliſh your happineſs. If that be the means, replied Orſamus, I will be happy to my tomb, and all human conſiderations ſhall not make me wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one moment in my inviolable loyalty. But, Madam, continued he, after a ſmall pauſe, if I may have licence to aſk it, how ſhall we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of our affairs in this condition, whereinto fortune hath blindly brought us? The happy title of brother you have conferred on me, hath preſerved my life and by your bounty I begin to prize it at its true value, ſo that I can dare the effects of fate. But for you, my dear princeſs, that you ſhould be brought to ſuch extremes, is that which galls my heart with unexpreſſible grief. My misfortunes are become my chief felicity, but I am too miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in yours; you have raiſed me to the height of human happineſs, then gratitude calls that I ſhould purchaſe your content. Fortune, ſpight of herſelf, ſhall ſhortly give you eaſe, or put a period to the cauſe; ſince to expect her to be kind, is to involve ourſelves in greater dangers. Deſperate wounds muſt have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate cures; extremes muſt be thus ſerved, when bliſs and happineſs be in danger of a wreck, boldly to dare it, bravely to preſerve it. Thou wretched rival, obſtructor of my bliſs, continued he with a tone ſomewhat ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033593_0018_0FF7974CADDD60F8"/>
I'll give an exit to thy love and life; though guarded by a thouſand ſwords, nothing ſhall ſecure thee from my arms; if I fail in the attempt, I ſhall have the ſatisfaction, that I did endeavour your quiet, though I could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.</p>
            <p>O Sir! ſaid Cynthia, with a timerous agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, do not with ſuch raſh reſolution caſt away your life, but conſider that ſtroke that ends your days gives a period to mine.— Oh! think in the cuſtody of what villains I ſhall be left, acquainted with nothing but what is ill! Then death may fly me; and that may be taken from me I eſteem far above my life. I ſhall have none then to participate in my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, or revenge my quarrels, when you are gone. Death, when all hope is paſt, will not fail to relieve us; fortune is full of viciſſitudes; and being unkind ſo long, muſt at laſt be juſt: that valour is unconquerable to which diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is joined, when wiſdom directs it for the moſt advantage. The caution will be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when you remember I interceded for Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia's ſafety in the welfare of Orſamus. As yet reſpect ſeems to have the upper hand in his thoughts, let us not abuſe it to our utter deſtruction: In the mean time, ſeek to attempt nothing but upon good mature conſideration in each others life. We may continue ſafe, and be good companions in adverſity: Let your
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033593_0019_0FF797511C498FD8"/>
carriage be circumſpect, that he may not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you for any other than what you ſeem; ſo you may remain ſecure, whilſt I reſt firm guarded with my innocency. Becauſe he has made you the agent of his love, you may feed him with hope; for it will be dangerous to loſe thoſe advantages he hopes from you: My carriage unto him ſhall be followed by your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and you may tell him what your reaſon and wiſdom accords to, is convenient; always reſerving my honor intire. And ſeeing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamus, I repoſe my honor in your truſt, look you do not fail my confidence. O, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am! replied Orſamus, that life which you ſet ſo high a prize on is not worth the care you take to preſerve it; but it were no life were it not wholly at your devotion; and being only yours, I ſhall be careful not to caſt that life uſeleſs away, which is reſerved wholly and entire for your intereſt. Your commands ſhall lead me by the hand, which I will execute as far as weary life will go. 'Twere a ſin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Cynthia, to doubt your fidelity and the continuance may not go unrewarded. But let us leave this diſcourſe for ſome time more agreeable, and conſider how to treat the pirate at his return, which will not be long. I'll ſhew myſelf ſomewhat kinder, that he may conceive you have prevailed ſomething in his behalf; and, this kindneſs, if my expectation fail me not, ſhall purchaſe a relation of his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:033593_0020_0FF79752AB662B20"/>
which will for a ſmall time free me from his importunities, and in ſome ſort diſſipate my misfortunes by the hiſtory of his diſaſters, ſince we naturally find a pleaſure in the reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of paſt miſeries. His reſpect and behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior towards us ſhews him to be more than what he ſeems; yet this odious courſe makes him ſeem leſs than what he is. His life in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, muſt be monſtrous that walketh in a way ſo uncommon.</p>
            <p>In ſuch diſcourſes they paſſed away the ſmall time of the pirate's abſence; but fortune ſoon took care they ſhould not ſurfeit their joys, by haſtening his return to the cabin. And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaluted Cynthia with much reſpect as his miſtreſs, and careſſed Orſamus as her brother, he ſeated himſelf to participate of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which he apprehended did tend to his advantage.</p>
            <p>He was opening his mouth to ſpeak, when the fair princeſs prevented him; and taking the word with an air, replied, with a grace and behaviour only peculiar to herſelf, ſhe began her diſcourſe thus. "Sir, your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs uſed to my brother is no ſmall obligation that I owe you, nor have you failed in your purpoſe when you made him your ſolicitor; ſince none can more perſuade my inclination or more freely diſpoſe of me than he; yet he, I think, will not agree to force my will to what
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033593_0021_0FF797543ADD6988"/>
is repugnant. If I muſt love, I would have a ſubject worth my affection. Such you may be if your life has been regulated and guided by that rule formerly, as in this time ſince we have been your priſoners. But the faireſt fruit is not always pleaſant to the taſte; nor will a wiſe merchant purchaſe commodities without a trial. We may paint the ſun, but not his warm influence; and the fire, but not its heat.— With ſmall trouble you may eaſe me of this doubt, in relating your extraction and birth, and the paſt adventures of your life."</p>
            <p>This bold language of Cynthia put the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to his dumps, knowing the relation of his life would diminiſh the eſteem they had of him; and ſhould he give her a denial, he began to fear her firſt reſolution; ſo that for a ſmall time his thoughts were upon the rack, and he ſat poſſeſſed with a deep ſilence; but at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himſelf, he made this reply.</p>
            <p>"Madam, ceaſe theſe horrible reſolutions, for I find it impoſſible to diſobey you; you ſhall be ſatisfied with the true narration of the diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a miſerable wretch, injured by fortune, and purſued by fate, the relations of which will ſet my wounds bleeding afreſh, yet Madam, you ſhall be obeyed. Then prepare yourſelves with attention to receive the ſatisfaction you deſire, whilſt I entertain you with the tragic ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my life, which if it cannot beget love, it may produce pity.</p>
            <p>

            <head>THE TRAGICAL ACCOUNT OF THE UNFORTUNATE LOVES OF ALMERIN AND DESDEMONA:</head>
            <p>IN the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> ſea is ſituated an iſland called Sicilia, renowned over the world for the ſweet wholeſomneſs of the air, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the ſoil; extolled highly by fame for the wonderful mountain Etna, there fixed; which being always on the outſide covered with ſnow, yet by a ſulpherous or brimſtone matter doth continually burn within. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the flame mounting upwards is ſo ſtrong it brings up with it burnt and ſcorching ſtones, and pieces of hard ſubſtances, which ſeem to be rent out of ſome rocks, to the great terror and danger of the beholder. Report has not been idle in proclaiming the known rarities of this iſle; but above all, that ſo much famed ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Syracuſe, twenty-two miles in compaſs, walled about with three ſtrong walls, for ſtrength and ſecurity; watered with many ſweet ſprings adorned with many gardens, and pleaſant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033593_0023_0FF7975A3AAD7FE8"/>
the noble buildings added to its gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, whoſe lofty towers and turrets ſeemed to ſupport the ſkies, retaining a majeſty, and yielding a glorious ſhew to the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. It was the mart town of the iſland where ſhips go out, and reſort thither, to and from all parts of the world, which enriches the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>It was this city that gave me birth; although my father had his original out of Norway, a kingdom far hence diſtant, towards the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen north, his inclinations being more to trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſtrange countries than live a quiet life in his own; when the one begets nothing but effem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inateneſs and ſloth, and the other produces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and valour. So that with his father's conſent he took his journey, having well ſtored himſelf with jewels and money, neceſſaries ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needful for ſuch a voyage; in a few years he ranged over the greateſt part of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca and Aſia, where he ſaw the famous cities of Grand Cairo in Egypt, the city ot Jeruſalem in Paleſtina; where he did behold many rare monuments, with the lofty pyramids. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed through many large dominions, at laſt he arrived at Conſtantinople, the imperial city of the Grecian empire. Here he ſpent ſome time, and at laſt took ſhipping there to viſit the iſles of the Mediterranean ſea; ſo that he came at laſt to the famous iſland of Sicilia,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033593_0024_0FF7975BD83D4AB0"/>
where the pleaſantneſs both invited and incited his longer ſtay and abode.</p>
            <p>Where, by ſtrange fortunes and unheard of chances, he was made known unto King San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credus, who at that time had his reſidence in Syracuſe, in whoſe affection he gained ſo great an eſteem, as he gave his own kinſwoman in marriage, enriched him with ſeveral lordſhips, made him one of his council, and Governor of the famous city of Syracuſe.</p>
            <p>I was his only ſon, and in this city I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my life and education. I lived with my father in a garb befitting a prince rather than a Governor's ſon. All their hope and comfort they ſeemed to treaſure up in me. Thus I continued until I arrived at the age of ſixteen years, and became capable to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of love.</p>
            <p>Small time had paſſed away afterwards before fortune preſented me an object to beget it.— For fate had ſo decreed, that in a pleaſant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den belonging to the city, garniſhed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny private walks, among which I had choſen out one for privacy, to retire from the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of the ſun, here it was I went to ſeek reſt, and found eternal diſquiet; for by the bank of a little rivulet, which had a thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and many turnings in the garden, ſat a moſt beautiful damſel, who had ſeated herſelf as it were to obſerve the ſecret gliding of the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033593_0025_0FF7975D8C8BAB80"/>
murmuring ſtream. The place where I had retired was ſo ordered by nature, that I could ſee, yet remain unſeen. Her years might be about fourteen; her ſtature tall, and comely; her face the perfect map of beauty, where the lillies and the roſes did ſeem to ſurpaſs in glory what nature had ever framed, or art ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; I beheld her with amazement; for never before did my eyes behold any thing ſo lovely.</p>
            <p>Thus unperceived was I conquered by this unknown beauty; and at that fatal hour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, I became her ſlave, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wear her chains.</p>
            <p>Yet how to make my addreſſes unto one that till then I never ſaw, or to talk of love to her, both ſeemed groſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt ſeemed too full of confidence, and the other ſeemed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour much of impudence.</p>
            <p>But here fortune ſupplied this want, and at firſt ſeemed to court me; but it was only to drill me into greater miſeries; for no ſooner I ſaw her riſe from the place where ſhe ſat, but I made towards her, from the place where I lay concealed, when behold this charming beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſurprized by an unknown ſtranger, who with expreſſions of joy uttered theſe words; "Fortune, I defy thy further malice, and dare my fate to make a ſecond relapſe in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires"—So that by force, in ſpite of her reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033593_0026_0FF7975F3A161E00"/>
taking her delicate body rudely in his arms, he began with a more than ordinary pace to convey her to a neighbouring thicket. My eyes had never left her, but were wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and fixed on this inſolent action, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on ſo lovely a creature. I needed no ſolicitors but her cries to prepare me for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and it was but a few moments betwixt the reſolution and the execution; for with the utmoſt dilligence I purſued him by the ſame track I ſaw him paſs. Such expedition I made that my haſte outwent his ſpeed, and my fury overtook him before I had time to conſult with reaſon; ſo that without demanding any queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I run him through the body, and he not having diſburthened himſelf of his fair prey, fell down, claſping her in his deadly arms.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing I did was to free her from him, which with ſome trouble I performed.— After I had ſet her at liberty from that danger, and her frighted ſpirits returned to her again, ſhe fell down at my feet, and embracing my knee, Sir, ſaid ſhe, this ſudden aſſiſtance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades me to eſteem you as the genius of my better fortune, ſince you have by timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption preſerved what is more precious to me than that we prize moſt dear.</p>
            <p>Her tears and ſweet ſpeeches transformed me from my uſual temper; and I could not behold her in that mournful poſture without
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033593_0027_0FF79761B0638708"/>
participating in her ſorrows; ſo that taking her in my arms, I returned her this anſwer: Madam, I rejoice in being made the happy cauſe of preſerving you, if I have obliged you in this action, I have a ſatisfaction above what I could hope, and fortune has been kind above my hopes, in affording an opportunity to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſt my affection. O Madam! blame me not when I reveal I love you. If you think I have obliged you, Oh! pay it in love, and I ſhall ſoon become the debtor; and talk not of death, when the gods deteſt thy propoſitions; but think lovely creature, if ſo much beauty can be without pity, and yield no redreſs to my love, death will be kinder than you, and yield a remedy when you deny it.</p>
            <p>This ſaid, I ſet my ſword againſt my breaſt, ſaying, here Madam, is that, that will yield re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in neceſſity; and ſeeing I cannot live without love, I will endeavour in death to gain your pity; and if my love is become an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, this very ſword ſhall make ſatisfaction, and deſtroy that life that gave it birth. She no ſooner ſaw this deſperate offer at my life, but caſting an eye of pity on my raſhneſs. Oh! hold, ſays ſhe, that fatal weapon, the cruel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turber of my quiet! and think, whoever you be, what an error I muſt commit in yielding to love one who till this moment I never ſaw: and how ſhall I forget paternal duty to give
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033593_0028_0FF79765207B6248"/>
myſelf away without their knowledge. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what an obligation will lie on you, when I rely upon your promiſe of fidelity to preſerve my honor entire; and how the gods will pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh you if you prove purjur'd.</p>
            <p>Virtuous lady, replied I, you wrong my love to think it baſe, and my integrity to imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine I may prove unconſtant. No, no Madam, your charms are too ſtrong to be rivalled by any other objects, and affection too entire to be deceived by any other beauty. Becauſe you ſhall not be obliged to love one you know not, and to eſteem one that till this moment you never ſaw; to diſperſe thoſe doubts, know my name is Almerin, the only ſon of Artme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus govenor of this famous city of Syracuſe; never before unfortunate, if you prove pitileſs; never before happy, if you become kind. If ever I endeavour to violate your honor, or think to commit ſo great a ſacrilege on your virtue, let all the gods rain down vengeance on my head for my diſloyalty, and let the heavens be witneſs to what I promiſe.</p>
            <p>Oh hold! ſaid ſhe, ſwear not by that; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers may eat a flower on the ſtalk: and when in theſe cheeks and lips which you extol ſo high, ſhall not be left red enough to bluſh at perjury, when you ſhall make it, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me then?</p>
            <p>O Madam! replied I, ceaſe thoſe doubts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:033593_0029_0FF79766B0D3F060"/>
and diſſipate ſuch needleſs fear; the ſun ſhall as ſoon faulter in his career, the ſtars drop from their places, where they have of old been fixed; the earth ſhall remove, nature ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her courſe, and all impoſſibilities ſhall be performed, when I prove diſloyal.</p>
            <p>Theſe proteſtations did give her ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and prevailed ſo far with her, that ſhe ſuffered me to enjoy the privilege to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her to her parent's houſe, which was within the city. When we came thither ſhe gave her friends to underſtand the timely aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance I gave her, as alſo my birth and quality, and authority in the city. They no ſooner received this relation from their daughter, but they bade me welcome, and careſſed me with the greateſt endearments. My entertainment was extraordinary: but the kindneſs that was beſtowed on me was not after the lofty court mode, but moſt familiarly, as if I had been a near relation to them, and gave me thanks in the moſt obliging terms for the kindneſs conferr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their daughter, which I could receive without a bluſh. Here it was I learned his name was Philaſter, an aged knight, that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there many years; that his fair daughter was his only child, whoſe name was Deſdemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</p>
            <p>In ſeveral diſcourſes we paſſed away the time while ſupper laſted, where the chiefeſt delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033593_0030_0FF797686CF5CFB8"/>
I fed on was Deſdemona's beauty; and indeed it was ſhe alone made all things ſeem pleaſant.</p>
            <p>Supper being ended; and the evening far ſpent I began to prepare for my departure. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had bade farewel to the old knight and his lady, I began to order myſelf to take leave of the fair Deſdemona, and in this manner I accoſted her, "Faireſt of creatures, let not abſence beget a neglect in my love, but think of the torments I endure; and though neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity enforces me to leave you, yet think how all places will ſeem a hell when you are abſent; and that you bring a heaven of felicities, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your fair ſelf doth appear. O Deſdemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na! I muſt leave you; yet ſhall I tell you, a poor criminal never went to execution with more reluctancy than this cruel parting ſeems to me, ſince I muſt leave all my happineſs with you, and go away accompanied only with my torments and miſeries." I had proceeded farther, but I ſaw ſome attentive to underſtand what I ſaid.</p>
            <p>Deſdemona returned me no anſwer, but a bluſh. And after I had with an extacy ſealed a kiſs on her fair hand, I took my leave; yet not before the old knight and his lady deſired me that I would honor them ſo much as to further oblige them with a viſit. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment over, I was conducted, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033593_0031_0FF7976CC2EC0C00"/>
by them all to the door where ſtood a chariot richly adorned to convey me to my father's houſe. Here it was I parted from them, and bid the firſt farewel to myſelf. I was no ſooner arrived at my father's houſe, but was welcomed by the greateſt kindneſſes that might be, my preſence diverting the fear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers that might befal me. They began to enquire how I paſſed the evening ſo late; but I had a ſtory ready that gave them ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After a while I gave them good night, and betook myſelf to reſt.</p>
            <p>But ſmall reſt, heaven knows, it was I could take: my fancy formed the idea of fair Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona; and it was only theſe thoughts that did give a ſmall ceſſation to my torments.</p>
            <p>In this ſort I paſſed away the time, thinking the night exceeded its uſual length, exclaiming againſt Phoebus for his ſluggiſh approach; and yet when he did appear, how often have I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his abſence! ſo that night ſeemed a vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and day a torment. Some few days paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what for want of ſuſtenance in the day, and for want of reſt in the night, my ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its began to decay, and my body fore-weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; my colour faded away, and my youthful vigour abated, ſo that I was but an emblem of what I had been. My careful parents wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered at this ſudden alteration and change; the phyſicians were ſent for, but their conjectures
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033593_0032_0FF7976E54495048"/>
came far ſhort of the diſeaſe; every one gave his judgment as fancy and opinion gave them birth, but all came ſhort of the ſymptoms of my diſeaſe. My careful parents never forſook my pillow, ſeeking to ſearch out the cauſe of this diſtemper, that ſo they might provide a remedy.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you wonder I did not reveal my love to them at ſuch a time when there was a poſſibility of having my deſires granted.</p>
            <p>Faireſt lady, ſaid he looking upon Cynthia, you will not marvel, nor have occaſion to blame me, when you underſtand that about ſix weeks before I was betrothed, by my parents conſent, to a fair damſel named Artemeſia, ſecond daughter to the earl of Palermo. Indeed I think ſhe was more noble than fair, yet her beauty was not ſo mean but it might have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my nicety, had I never beheld the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching charms of fair Deſdemona.—'Twas on this fatal marriage I was deſtinated a victim to my parents will, not my deſires. I knew my father to be a man too paſſionate, and not to be altered by perſuaſions in his proceedings. Beſides, this marriage ſeemed to augment and agree with his ambition; and his being allied to ſo great a lord, no mean honor. He was obſtinate in his humours, nor could reaſon make him reverſe what he had decreed; but eſpecially thoſe he imagined did tend to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033593_0033_0FF797700BB9F018"/>
and advance his aſpiring ambition. Theſe were the unhappy cauſes that I did not reveal to them the affection I had for the fair Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona.</p>
            <p>As nothing continues always in one ſtate and condition, ſo my diſtemper began to abate, and my weakened body began to recover a little ſtrength; yet in my mind I received no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſince my deareſt phyſician was abſent.— Phoebus had ſcarce run his career thrice in this upper world, and lodged himſelf in the weſtern ocean, but I left my bed: and though I was extremely feeble, yet I did endeavour to walk, and the firſt ſmall journey I made, was ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Deſdemona. I had no ſooner ſet my face towards that part of the city, but mark the wonderful effects! although my body was weak, yet methought in every ſtep I went towards her I received new ſtrength; when I arrived, and entered the houſe, my body became as if it had been inſpired with a new ſoul; and well it might, ſince it was there alone the felicity and content, which was the extacy and rapture of my ſoul, did reſide.</p>
            <p>Such unthought of alteration had my ſmall time of ſickneſs begotten on me, that none in the houſe could hardly diſcern who I might be; but theſe thoughts were ſilenced when I reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf; ſo that they ſeemed to be poſſeſſed with amazement rather than unbelief. In a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033593_0034_0FF79772A6B07AE0"/>
few moments all their ſuſpicions were vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that I was entertained with their accuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omed kindneſſes. In a few moments fair Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demona did appear; and although ſhe was forewarned by ſome in the houſe, yet in her firſt approach ſhe could not contain from won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. She bade me welcome as her deliverer, not as lover; yet did her eyes ſpeak pity to my diſaſters; and then her looks ſeemed a ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign balſam to expel the worſt of miſeries: what ſhall I ſay, it was here my ſickneſs took its birth, and it was here I had the only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to expel it.</p>
            <p>After dinner the old knight and his lady, with fair Deſdemona, invited me to take a walk into a fair garden adjoining their houſe, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſhady arbours, where nature was helped by art to make the work more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and was adorned with many pleaſant walks.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of the garden was a houſe of pleaſure, the faireſt for workmanſhip that ever I beheld; ſo that nature grew envious that art ſhould excel her, endeavouring with fine ſhady trees, and what ſweet ſummer's live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wears, to conceal it from the eyes of the ſpectators, when the pretty birds that harbour in thoſe boughs ſeem to croſs her intents with their melodious notes, inviting the eyes of the beholder not to leave ſo rare a work unſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:033593_0035_0FF797752FD8CF50"/>Into this garden I accompanied them, where we had ſome diſcourſe on different ſubjects, which I think impertinent, and nothing relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtory of my life. Thus having paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away ſome time, Philaſter and his lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired themſelves into the houſe of pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related, and left Deſdemona only to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me. This opportunity fell out above my thoughts; and being unwilling to loſe ſo fair a time, as we walked along the alleys I began this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Faireſt Deſdemona, I cannot tell whether <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay you are more kind than cruel, or whether you are more fair than <hi>I</hi> am miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. See, my divine lady, behold <hi>I</hi> die alive; and what is more cruel than living death? can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you pity one that dies for love? O, pierce my heart! It is the nobler way, and let me not live in ſuch torments.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, <hi>I</hi> am not inſenſible of your love, nor do <hi>I</hi> take any pleaſure in your tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>I</hi> would <hi>I</hi> could perform the one as willingly as <hi>I</hi> can the other, you ſhould not lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh for a remedy. If a return of love and compaſſion can give you eaſe, <hi>I</hi> can pity; if that be too low, <hi>I</hi> can grieve; if this will not do, O think, ſir, in what bands you are bound not to violate my honor. Oh! ſeek not to ruin this, and command all things beſides <hi>I</hi> am able to perform.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:033593_0036_0FF79777A5CE6FB0"/>O Madam, replied I, heaven ſend thoſe pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments on my head I ſo lately did invocate, if I intend diſhonor to you perſon. No, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, 'tis lawful marriage I deſire; and what is more honorable? This way you may ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give ceſſation to my torments, and not injure your chaſtity. Oh! think if you can pity, as you give me to underſtand you can; be not cruel to let me pine away with ſorrow, when you are the only phyſician that can give me a remedy.</p>
            <p>I had ſcarce finiſhed theſe laſt words but old Philaſter, and his lady, left the place where they had remained during our diſcourſe; and their too ſudden approach robbed me of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demona's anſwer. So that we made towards them; and joining our company and diſcourſe with theirs, we paſſed away the reſidue of that time, fortune not offering me that day another opportunity where I might with ſecrecy renew our diſcourſe. After a while we left our diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Philaſter forſook the garden, and we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him in, where we ſpent the remainder of the day. I then took my leave of my char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And altho my deſires were fruſtrated, and my intentions prevented of ſpeaking unto her, by reaſon of her parents being preſent; yet my eyes and countenance ſeverely ſpoke the language of my heart. And as far as I could perceive I did not find ſhe had any aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for my love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:033593_0037_0FF7977937989AE0"/>With this hope of good fortune I gave Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſter the good-night, and returned ſecretly to my father's, where they all wondered at my long abſence, yet glad to ſee me recovered ſo well, wondering from whence the cauſe of ſuch a ſudden ſickneſs ſhould ariſe, alſo at ſo uncommon a recovery; but leaving them to conjectures, I went to my chamber, where I paſſed the night in a different manner from what I had formerly done, my hopes now having overcome my deſpair. In ſuch pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts the hours paſſed away; yet not ſo ſwift but I could number them, and think them ſlow in going. I aroſe and attired my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a more than ordinary curioſity; build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many hopes in expectation of what the following day might bring forth, and the hour approaching wherein viſits are accuſtomed to be given, I took my way to Philaſter's houſe. As my viſits were become more common, I was eſteemed a leſs ſtranger, and my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment was more familiar and friendly: ſo that after ſome diſcourſe had paſſed, I requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the favour of Philaſter that I might take the privilege to paſs ſome ſmall time away in his fair garden: which requeſt was kindly granted, himſelf intending to accompany me; when behold, as we were entering the garden, he was ſent for by a meſſenger, that informed him that his brother did attend him, deſiring
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033593_0038_0FF7977ACDD73E50"/>
ſome conferrences with him about earneſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that would not admit of delay; ſo after pleading neceſſity for his untimely parting, he left me.</p>
            <p>Half an hour had not paſſed ſince I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the garden, but I ſaw fair Deſdemona, who was ſent by her father to entertain me in his abſence. I made towards her with much reſpect, and ſhe accoſted me with as kind a reception, with ſuch innocency as might ſeem to bring in compaſs the extravagant thoughts of any but myſelf.</p>
            <p>Here it was we betrothed ourſelves to each other and regiſtered our vows in heaven.— Here it was I could not bound my joy, and conſequently my paſſion; ſo that I could not retain from folding her delicate body in my arms, giving and receiving many a ſweet kiſs on her ruby lips. In this rapture of raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſpent the time, till Sol with his ſcorching beams, forced us to retire into that houſe of pleaſure before-mentioned. This proved a defence againſt the heat, and a cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to act our loves more ſecurely. Here we did double our kiſſes and embraces, while the pretty birds did ſeem to participate my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The favours ſhe then conferred on me could not yield content and ſatisfaction to my deſires, but ſerved only to beget a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to preſume to purchaſe greater, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033593_0039_0FF7977E4995DF68"/>
to higher felicities. So that from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar converſation I began to requeſt the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of that love I then enjoyed: and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my requeſts with ſuch intreaties and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, with a promiſe of never failing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, urged by ſuch ſtrong perſuaſions, and reſiſted with ſuch faint denials, that I came to the yielding up of that fort, which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kings might envy me the conqueſt of; in the enjoyment of which imperial monarchs would have accounted it the higheſt felicity; all which was wholly proſtrated to my raging paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and luſtful deſires.</p>
            <p>The kiſſes, embraces and endearments, were almoſt numberleſs, our diſcourſe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly of our loves and ſervent affections of the day of marriage. Thus we ſpent our time in a paradiſe of pleaſure; paſſing theſe few minutes we ſtayed there in ſuch felicity as might well be termed the chiefeſt happineſs of lover's bliſs.</p>
            <p>But to defer your expectation no longer, I'll go forward in my diſcourſe, and give you to underſtand, that after I had quitted old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſter's hoſpitality and kindneſs, with the theſe of his daughter's honor, and againſt the vows I had made, by inticements and deceit, I had forgotten the faireſt jewel in Deſdemona's ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, we ſaw him and his lady enter the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. With all expedition we forſook our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033593_0040_0FF79780CD22EE28"/>
and deſcended down a private pair of ſtairs, unſeen of them, being ſhaded by the friendly trees, which, in the time of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ſeemed to ſtand as watchmen to defend us, and now a ſcreen to ſecure us. This way we paſſed, left they might ſuſpect what indeed was true, and ſo prepared to meet them acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally. Here we joined company and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them, and paſſed away the reſidue of time till dinner was brought in, upon which notice was given, we left the garden, and ſpent the remainder of that day altogether in diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, till night began to approach, and urged my departure; and returning them many thanks for their civilities and kindneſſes, I took my leave of Philaſter and his lady; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaluted Deſdemona with a promiſe of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den return to require her in marriage of her parents, according to my vows in the garden, I left her, and with her all my joys.</p>
            <p>I ſoon arrived at my father's houſe, but I found him inquiſitive above his uſual manner, to know where I had paſſed away my time theſe three days paſt; my abſence having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a ſuſpicion in him of what indeed was true; and ſudden ſickneſs, ſeconded with as quick a recovery, did confirm him: ſo that ſeeing me well recovered, and almoſt in as good a ſtate of health as when I firſt fell ſick, he began his diſcourſe to me in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:033593_0041_0FF7978294EE5A48"/>Son, your ſudden health cannot give me more joy than the extraordinary cauſe gives me ſuſpicion, leſt in your carriage, which hath been ſo reſerved to me, you ſhould act any thing which ſhould fall contrary to my intentions and deſires. You know the time will draw ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near when you muſt marry your contracted bride, fair Artimeſia; one which is fortunate as fair, and as wiſe as fortunate; one, my ſon, that will raiſe thee to a high eſteem of high honors, which is the miſtreſs young gallants court. And by the alliance of ſo great a lord, we ſhall be made ſhot-free againſt the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt batteries of fortune.</p>
            <p>"Sir, (ſaid I) your ſuſpicions are not grounded amiſs: if you ſuſpect I love, and if I be a criminal in making it a ſecret unto you, forgive and pardon me when I ſhall make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al confeſſion. Yes, Sir, I do love, and with that ardour and affection, with that conſtancy and fidelity, as death cannot divert my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: and ſhould you make a ſeparation, or imagine an alteration, know, Sir, my vows are regiſtered in heaven, which if you once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to violate, expect the puniſhment may attend your endeavours. You may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my life, ſince you give it me; but my ſoul, it is the gift of the gods."</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe, uttered with as much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as confidence, began to raiſe a ſtorm in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033593_0042_0FF79784256EBBB0"/>
my father's countenance; for the form of his viſage began to overcaſt with frowns, and all his actions beclouded over with anger. So that caſting a frowning look on me, enough to daunt me, had not my love made me proof againſt his fury, and confident to ſuſtain his utmoſt charge.</p>
            <p>Villain, replied he, and ſhame to thy blood, dare you juſtify and vindicate that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my intentions? or can your diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience own what I have an averſion againſt? Shall my hopes be thwarted by your extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant youth, and my purpoſes fruſtrated by your ill-placed love? Curſe on your willful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, which puts me into this unuſual paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and your boldneſs, that durſt give me this relation. Ungoverned young man! Can you think this giddy-headed youth, ſubject to all paſſions, and pliable to all impreſſions, ſhould better know how to govern his paſſions and direct his actions, than his aged ſire? Can he better chuſe for his good, than one who hath ſo often been acquainted and concerned with the viciſſitudes and changes of this nature? No, no, young man, you yet want that experience, which is always the beſt ſchool-maſter, and the miſtreſs of underſtanding. Your youth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, and like a headſtrong horſe that will run himſelf on any danger, without he be ſurely curbed: ſo you grow bold and impudent, dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033593_0043_0FF79786AE6424F8"/>
any precipice ſo you may poſſeſs your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded deſires; but know I'll curb you from theſe extravagancies, and retain you from theſe wild wandering thoughts; and if I have been too indulgent, for the future you ſhall find me as ſevere: and ſo avoid my ſight, that by the want of duty art become a grief to my eyes, and a vexation to my ſoul, and ſee that at our next meeting you ſhow not the leaſt averſion againſt your marriage with Artimeſia; but that you bound your love and deſires in the compaſs of my will, and that you tread no ſtrange path, but that you reform and recollect yourſelf firſt, by taking your rules from me, and not reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> run yourſelf headlong to ruin, and me diſhonor: but if you have any extravagant love, deſtroy it whilſt it is young in the bud; and learn to forget it before you come to the knowledge of what it is. Return no anſwer to juſtify what I muſt condemn; but regulate your ways and life by my directions, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſure a guide, you cannot err or go aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if you continue ſtill obſtinate and audacious in your proceedings, you ſhall find I will diſinherit you both of my love and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and make account of you but as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and a rebel to my blood.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid this, he left me and departed. But alas! how can I deſcribe to you the grief that did ſeize on me at that time, when Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033593_0044_0FF7978A1A172748"/>
came to my remembrance, and my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's cruelty was freſh in my memory. Oh! how was I torn between love and duty! now it was love that led me in a maze ſo difficult and intricate, that my beſt endeavours could not keep me from ruin. To go forward was dangerous; but to return backward did ſhew more perilous.</p>
            <p>Such Madam, was my deſperate condition: my ſweeteſt hopes began to leave me, horror, deſpair began to poſſeſs, and fear razed out the expectation of a more happy change. This confirmed me in the ominous preſage that did befal me in my return homeward from my deareſt Deſdemona.</p>
            <p>After I had well weighed and conſidered all the difficulties on either ſide that might befal me. I reſolved at laſt that my love ſhould reign ſupreme, and remain entire to fair Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demona; but yet withal, that I would ſhew a yielding conſent to my father's will in my marriage with Artimeſia; and like a warter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that rows one way, and looks another, yet brings the boat to the deſired place: ſo I endeavoured by this policy, ſeeming to accord with my father's deſires, when my inclinations roved a contrary courſe; and whilſt openly I did comply with him, inwardly I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my own content; flattering myſelf, that as fortune had made ſo ſudden a change in my
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033593_0045_0FF7978BAC800B48"/>
happineſs, in ſome ſmall time ſhe might beget as great an alteration in my misfortunes, and at laſt bring me to the period of my deſires: of which, though I had ſmall cauſe to hope, yet I did not wholly deſpair.</p>
            <p>I did further reſolve not to acquaint Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona with my father's reſolution, leſt it might beget her diſcontent. I began to repent of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing to my father what I ſhould have kept ſecret, and reſolved to conceal my paſſion for the future, ſince I had only given manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love, and not of the perſon beloved, which I did expound as one happy preſage of my fortunate proceeding. This way I had fixed on, ſince I had no other wherein I might walk with more ſecurity. Nor did my hopes altogether fail me; for by my craſty wiles, the next time I accoſted my father, I had ſet on ſo ſtrange a face on my former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, ſhewing myſelf ſo dutiful and pliant to all his intents and purpoſes, as begat won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in him when he did behold it. He queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of me who this object might be, to whom I did ſhew ſo great, and ſeemed to have ſo firm an affection not long ſince, which now I did ſeem to ſlight.</p>
            <p>I underſtood very well the ſubtleneſs and craft he uſed, and how like myſelf his actions were working one way, and his deſires another, but both agreed to intrap me in my deareſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033593_0046_0FF7978D422915D8"/>
But Old birds are not caught with chaff; for he could not cloſely work his mine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, but I as privately made my counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to blow up, which I performed in this manner.</p>
            <p>"Sir, replied I, you were too paſſionate in you laſt diſcourſe, and what I propoſed only to try your inclinations, how you would have allowed of a change, if I could have admitted of an alteration; this you took to be a verity, and too ſeverely rebuked me for what was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fiction; and allowing me only one moment of time, wherein I might diſable you in your error, and aſk your pardon for my over confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent preſumption, in raiſing ſo great a tempeſt from ſo ſmall a cauſe, and that I have not, nor never will, fix my affections without your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
            <p>This compliance to his will, ſo contrary to his expectations, began to work wonders in his mind, when my artifice had perſuaded him that all my former diſcourſes and proteſtations were mere deceit; ſo that inſtead of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo fierce in his proceedings he became more mild, his choler abated, he left accuſing me, and began to excuſe himſelf. I ſoon laid hold of this opportunity, aggravating his miſtake, yet by always wherein any likelihood did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear exempting myſelf from blame. And ſo far did I inſinuate myſelf into his ſoul, of my
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033593_0047_0FF79791BA8333C8"/>
innocence in the cauſe that he ſuſpected me, that my deceit became approved verities, and what I could relate in my defence received as undoubted truths: ſo that I think he never parted from me with a greater ſhow of love and ſatisfaction than at this time.</p>
            <p>Whether this occaſioned my father's enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ceaſe I cannot tell, but I well know I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him in his own craft, and over-wrought him in his own device. Neither did I in words alone confirm him in his belief, but manifeſted the ſame in my carriage and actions; ſo that a week or ten days paſſed away in this manner before I did offer in the leaſt to abſent myſelf from my father's houſe. After which time I did ſecretly and privately many times viſit and converſe with my Deſdemona, but I made my viſits much ſhorter, which was ſoon perceived and taken notice of by Deſdemona, who urged a conſummation of our marriage; fearing as indeed afterwards it happened, that ſome unhappy obſtruction might defer it. I comforted her amidſt theſe fears with my promiſe of loyalty, and with my beſt endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to gain my father's conſent; which if I ſhould fail of, I firmly engaged to perform all the rights of marriage at the end of one month from thence next enſuing. We agreed, leſt my often reſort ſhould beget jealouſies of that, which as yet her parents had no miſtruſt,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033593_0048_0FF797934F5D78C0"/>
that by a ſecret way into the garden I ſhould have acceſs at certain times, when I might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly enter; which to perform we appointed a time at our parting, or elſe by a certain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a handkerchief that gave me aſſurance that I might ſecurely paſs.</p>
            <p>By ſuch ſecret and unmiſtruſted paths, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times viſited my deareſt lady, who received me with as kind endearments; where I often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enjoyed, without controul, the happy felicity and fruition of her love.</p>
            <p>In theſe bitter ſweets, and ſtolen pleaſures, ſome three months had paſſed ſince I firſt ſaw Deſdemona, and almoſt one ſince I had made her the laſt promiſe of wedlock. Now the time began to draw near to confirm by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, what I had already performed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with Artimeſia. And now alas! my deareſt Deſdemona found herſelf conceived and quick with child. In neglecting the firſt I was ſure to procure my father's diſpleaſure; but in the latter, before God and man, I could not quit myſelf of the grievous ingratitude.— In the firſt my ignorance might excuſe me; but to the latter I could plead no excuſe, ſince my vows to Deſdemona proceeded from my very ſoul, and no doubt had reached the gates of heaven; when my contract with Artimeſia proceeded only of courſe, and in ſatisfaction of my father's humor, and not for any inclination
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033593_0049_0FF79794E1BD6F98"/>
to love on my own part. So I reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firm and conſtant to Deſdemona, and procure my own content, in hazarding my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's diſpleaſure rather than to ſatisfy his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition with my own torment.</p>
            <p>The time approached in ſight wherein I muſt be married to Artimeſia, but not the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance was given me by my father for a preparation; ſo that I began to bury the tho't of it in forgetfulneſs; thinking ſome difference had lately happened between my father and Artimeſia's parents; ſo that I began to account myſelf ſecure as to that.</p>
            <p>But a change of fortune ſoon put me out of that mind; for one morning, when I did lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſuſpect ſuch deceit, my father deſired me to array myſelf in my beſt attire, and wait on him to the great temple of the city. This I performed with great willingleſs, not miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any deceit or treachery had lain hid in his requeſt; and before I could find the plot, I found myſelf ſhip-wrecked on a rock. I was no ſooner ready but I attended him to church, only accompanied with my mother, who was of his confederacy. We ſoon arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the temple, yet with more haſte then good ſpeed: for I was no ſooner entered, but to my amazement I ſaw the earl of Palermo, with his daughter Artimeſia, with all his and my father's friends attending him, richly attired,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033593_0050_0FF79796730EE858"/>
and the prieſt ſtanding ready to join our hands. They all came to receive and welcome me with much reſpect; but my amazement would not let me receive their kind endearments with a behaviour as I ought to have done; for it was ſuch a ſtrange, diſagreeable and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſight, that I could not ſuddenly recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from my aſtoniſhment; rather thinking it to be a dream or a fiction, than any thing elſe. My father came and rouſed me from this trance; "Son, ſaid he, wonder not at what you ſee, but recollect yourſelf, and embrace your fortune. Surprizes in love make the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of greater value. And this buſineſs was managed by me, that a bleſſing that falls on you unexpected, might be by you more prized and eſteemed. Ceaſe your marvel then and accoſt thoſe friends with reſpect that are ready to receive you."</p>
            <p>His diſcourſe being ended, and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny expecting an anſwer I replied, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Artimeſia is a fortune above my hopes or deſerts; yet ſuch a one as I cannot with ſafety poſſeſs, leſt by enjoying ſuch a happineſs, I ſhould enforce heaven to make her wretched and miſerable for my ſake. For to put you out of doubt, know I am betrothed already to one that is as virtuous as fair; with whom I have tied ſuch an inviolable knot, that it is paſt the art of man to unlooſe it without provoking
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033593_0051_0FF7979B19EC5658"/>
the gods to revenge: there is no promiſe but I have made it, no proteſtation but I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, no ceremony but I have ſigned it, nor is there any obligation or vow but I have ſealed it. Heaven hath joined our hearts, this can only join our hands. In this, reaſon will tell you I have ſhewn no diſobedience; ſince, as I lately told you, heaven gave me a ſoul, and it is only that I have diſpoſed of with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; my body is yet free which you gave me: but it may as well ſurvive without a ſoul as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the vows I have lately made. My af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is ſo entire, that if all things admit of charge, it cannot be ſubject to alteration. And ſhould death itſelf approach I ſhould continue firm in the grave.</p>
            <p>I had continued my diſcourſe, but my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er haſtily interrupting me, drew his ſword, and preſenting it to my breaſt, Die thou rebellious villain, ſaid he, and enjoy the fruits of thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in the duſt. This action was no ſooner taken notice of by Artimeſia, but ſhe freed herſelf from her father; and caſting herſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my father's weapon, hold, ſaid ſhe, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unnatural man, and pierce this breaſt, it will ſhew leſs horrid and inhuman. This unexpected action, with his friends perſuaſions and intreaties, made him ſheath his ſword, whilſt a ſalamander did ſeem to live in his eyes, which ſhot forth fire like a murthering cannon that it
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033593_0052_0FF7979CAADB2930"/>
lightens ere it ſmokes. Wicked wretch, ſaid he, I diſown thee from this hour from being my ſon, and revoke all ties and privileges that love or nature hath given thee; and do not dare from this minute to aſſume the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to appear in my preſence, as thou tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereſt thy life and ſafety. Having ſaid this, he left me in a rage.</p>
            <p>My father was no ſooner departed, but poor Artimeſia received a check from her parents for her too much diligence and care in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, who did ſlight and neglect her; and that it rather pertained to my friends to have interceeded, and diverted the blow, than her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>My mother, with my relations, came and importuned me not to continue ſo obſtinate, with many intreaties and perſuaſions, urged the danger I caſt myſelf into, by bringing on my head my father's diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>I was hitherto miſerable, but I was more wretched in being beloved by Artimeſia. If her love and affection had not been ſo great, there might have been hopes that my coldneſs might have begot an averſion in her towards me. But like a merchant o'er charged with debt, when he begins to fail, all things agree to ruin him; ſo that he only knows then to be wretched, and they from whom he hopes any relief, moſt times conſpire, and agree to his
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033593_0053_0FF7979E71D8E128"/>
ruin. And as the Perſians adore the riſing ſun, and curſe it again ere the day be half ſpent, ſo fortune ſeems to court the man who flouriſheth in proſperity and ſcornfully neglects him when he falls into adverſity.</p>
            <p>This was the laſt blow, and I utterly undone. For upon notice of my conſent, my father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with Artimeſia, and the earl of Palermo her father, where, in the midſt of a great throng of people, which this diſturbance had brought together, the prieſt joined our hands; the uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ceremonies were performed with great ſtate, which being once ended, I was attended by my father's friends, and a very great company of citizens to my father's houſe, where, with, muſic, dancing and feaſting, they paſſed away the reſidue of the day; and the night approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when my father, with the earl of Paler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, conducted us to our lodging, where they left us, as they imagined, to make a new ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of pleaſures. But they were no ſooner departed out of the chamber, taking her by the hand, "Madam, ſaid I, this body you have ſo virtuouſly preſerved, is but a poor recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in conſideration of the danger you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent for my ſake, and I fear you will ſoon grow weary of what ſo lately you had an eſteem for, ſince I am become a burthen and torment to myſelf, and by conſequence in the uſe may prove ſo to you. O Artimeſia! thou enjoyeſt
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033593_0054_0FF797A01802F130"/>
this wretched and miſerable part of me, the body, when my ſoul is beſtowed elſewhere: thou haſt only the ſhadow of what I am, when another enjoys the ſubſtance. How, for your ſake only, could I wiſh love were no mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic point, but would admit of diverſion, that in ſome ſort I might quit the obligation that I owe you! O cruel parents! you are too kind to procure my diſcontent, and give me no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to diſſipate it.</p>
            <p>Poor Artimeſia, ſtood diſſolved in tears at my diſcourſe; and, although I could not love, yet I could not continue inſenſible of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, nor refrain participating in griefs which had their original from me.</p>
            <p>Oh! how I was wrecked by my conſcience that enſuing night, which preſented my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude in lively colours! the day approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to no other end but to renew my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and make my perfidiouſneſs ſeem the greater. Artimeſia, with her kind and ſweet ſpeeches, and lovely behaviour, did endeavour to divert the melancholy diſcontents; and this ſeemed another dagger to pierce my breaſt, ſince I could make no return for ſuch a mine of love.</p>
            <p>Two days had paſſed away ſince my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Artimeſia, and the third approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherein I had given my faith to marry Deſdemona. The remembrance wrought ſo
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033593_0055_0FF797A3B1897520"/>
ſtrong on my affections, that I intended to write and excuſe myſelf, leſt ſhe might think, by my neglect, I performed that willingly, that I was enforced to do by neceſſity; ſo that taking pen, I wrote and ſent her the letter by one that did attend me, of whom I had often made trial of his fidelity; to whom I revealed all the particulars which happened to Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona and myſelf, and of the continuance of our loves. It is ſome comfort in our miſeries when we have a partner in our ſorrows; one that will participate in our griefs, and to whom with confidence we may reveal our cloſeſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. Such an one was this man, whoſe name ought not to be concealed in this ſtory; Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio was his name, and it well ſuited his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I gave him directions to the garden gate, with charge to remain there till he ſaw Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demona enter. Away he went to execute what I commanded him, whilſt I with an earneſt expectation waited an anſwer. Fidelio, long expected at laſt returned. I no ſooner ſaw him, but I endeavoured to read my deſtiny in his looks; but I beheld there a ſad omen to attend me. Yet with an earneſt deſire, accompanied with timerous apprehenſions, I thus beſpoke him. Fidelio, doſt thou intend to make me linger away in expectation, and ſilence with that which being revealed, will kill as ſoon as know? What is Deſdemona's ſentence; be
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033593_0056_0FF797A62991A5B8"/>
it happineſs or miſery, joy or ſorrow, life or death, nothing can be bitter or harſh that ſhe commands; but I ſhall be all obedience. I am loth to ſuſpect where I love, yet it is not without pain I expect your anſwer, I am earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt you ſhould reveal what perhaps I would not know; yet I would fain know the worſt, that I might be freed from the fear of worſe to come.</p>
            <p>He returned me no anſwer; but drawing a letter from his boſom, Sir, ſaid he, here is that will give a better account of your fortune than myſelf; peruſe it; after which I will give you a relation of the particulars that happened in this ſmall time of abſence.</p>
            <p>I had no leiſure for a reply; but taking her letter, haſtily opened it, and read lines, which, while I live, I ſhall retain and keep in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>Her words, like a dart, wounded my very ſoul. Her innocent ſweetneſs made my infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity appear more notorious. Fidelio, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the grievouſneſs of my own crimes, at my requeſt related theſe few particulars.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid he, according to your order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, I ſtaid at the garden gate ſome time: but it was not long before I ſaw Deſdemona en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with her preſence, like another ſun, did dazzle the eyes of the beholders. Her attire was negligent and careleſs; her countenance
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033593_0057_0FF797A7BAF82D18"/>
ſeemed to be clouded with ſweet melancholy ſadneſs, fitly ſuited to her thoughts; and tho' all were ſhadowed and overcaſt with a veil of grief, yet ſhe ſeemed charming, ſince it did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve that we might behold her perfections at a nearer diſtance, and her virtues more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and plain; ſo we may face the ſun when he is clouded, which in a clear day we dare not approach with our eyes. Such was her grief, it would make one in love with ſadneſs; and ſuch her geſture, it would make one wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Raviſhed with this apparition, I knocked at the gate; which <hi>I</hi> had ſcarce done, but like a goddeſs ſhe appeared, and fixed her eyes upon my face, perhaps preſaging me to be ſome harbinger of ill news; quickly recollecting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "Sir, ſaid ſhe, are you not miſtaken, have you any buſineſs with any perſon here? this is no common way, and it gives me ſome cauſe of wonder how you came here."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> anſwered, "Madam, it was not a miſtake that bro't me hither, nor by chance that <hi>I</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before you, but expreſly and on purpoſe. <hi>I</hi> was ſent to you by Almerin, the governor's ſon of Syracuſe, with a letter, with a charge to deliver it into your hands." With theſe words <hi>I</hi> delivered her your letter; which <hi>I</hi> had no ſooner done, but <hi>I</hi> perceived ſhe was poſſeſſed with an uſual agitation and emotion of ſpirit;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033593_0058_0FF797A990A7B3D0"/>
ſometimes the roſes of her cheeks were overcaſt with a lovely red, and ſuddenly they vaniſhed and gave way to the lillies to poſſeſs their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. She kiſſed the letter, earneſtly enquired of your health, to which, when <hi>I</hi> had given her an anſwer, ſhe entreated me to walk into the garden; and ſo ſhutting the door, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired herſelf into a private arbour, where open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the letter, ſhe began to read, whilſt <hi>I</hi> ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf to behold her.</p>
            <p>When on a ſudden all former ſigns of joy vaniſhed; her viſage was overcaſt with a fatal diſturbance; her breaſt began to pant, and a ſhower of tears began to fall from her fair eyes, which hung on her cheeks like pearly dew on a ſweet ſmelling roſe; ſuch were her actions, that they would have induced the wild ſatyrs and fierce beaſts to pity. She ſhewed nothing of raſhneſs in her carriage; but reſerving her complaints mildly, till her ſpirits being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ſorrow, forſook her, ſo that letting your letter fall, ſhe fell into a deadly trance, without any motion, or hopes of life remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>I</hi> ran haſtily to catch her before ſhe fell, but came too late; ſo that falling, ſhe ſeated herſelf on a bed of violets, which ſeemed to cloſe and hang down their heads at this fatal misfortune.</p>
            <p>Then it was <hi>I</hi> curſt you for your perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſo ſweet a creature. Heaven only knows
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033593_0059_0FF797ADF05DBE90"/>
the extremes of grief <hi>I</hi> then endured. <hi>I</hi> could not go out of the garden and leave her in that forlorn condition, yet to ſtay was perilous to my life; but my pity overcame my fear, ſo that running to a fountain in the garden, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold water in my hand, <hi>I</hi> ſprinkled it on her face; and taking her lovely body in my arms, <hi>I</hi> ſoftly began to blow her; ſo that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening her fair eyes, and ſending two or three heart-breaking ſighs, as a token of her ſoul's return to her body, which was loath, as it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to leave ſo fair a habitation.</p>
            <p>When her ſenſes began to execute their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per function and duty, caſting her eyes on me, taking notice <hi>I</hi> had her in my arms, Sir, ſaid ſhe, <hi>I</hi> perceive <hi>I</hi> have been a trouble to you, for which <hi>I</hi> beg your pardon, and intreat you to aſſiſt me to yonder houſe (ſhewing me a place ſituate in the midſt of the garden) ſo that raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her up, <hi>I</hi> ſupported her by the arm; firſt taking up your letter, <hi>I</hi> conducted her to the houſe, where ſhe wrote the letter <hi>I</hi> now deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered you, and ſealing it, gave it me in theſe words, Tell him <hi>I</hi> wiſh him happineſs and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; for myſelf, tell him <hi>I</hi> ſhall hardly find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but in the grave. So deſcending the ſtairs, <hi>I</hi> attended her to the gate; and taking my leave, <hi>I</hi> left her, bewailing your ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>Thus Fidelio ended his diſcourſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033593_0060_0FF797AF84694D90"/>
what he had ſaid to be nothing but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. I could not refrain from participating with him, and hate myſelf, ſince ſhe continued ſtill to love me; for all my perjury and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, betraying and abuſing ſo much inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Deſdemona ſends me word ſhe loves me ſtill, and ſhall do ſo in death; ſhe forgives me too, more than I can forgive myſelf; yet this was the ſame Deſdemona whoſe goodneſs and kindneſs I ſo much abuſed, her harmleſs innocence began to ſet a higher price on her virtues in my ſoul than formerly I had for her beauties. I began to know the worth of the treaſure I had forgone, and found the value to ſurmount all eſteem.</p>
            <p>Now all my thoughts and deſires became wholly engaged to tender an ample ſatisfaction, in recompence of the injuries I had occaſioned her, but I found my deſires were all fruitleſs, and that my beſt performance would be of no value, while Artimeſia remained as an obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to obſtruct my intentions. It was here the agents of hell ſolicited and aſſiſted me in this tragical deſign, ſo that her death was conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a moment; nothing remained but the means how to effect it.</p>
            <p>As formerly I was black with perjury, now I began to plot how to be red with murder, in taking away the innocent and guiltleſs life of one that not five days before had preſerved
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033593_0061_0FF797B114905FB0"/>
mine; but reaſon and conſideration were ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed; no thoughts remained but how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what I had ſo barbarouſly begun. I had thought of many ways how to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, but poiſon at laſt I reſolved on. I was loth to truſt any one with a ſecret of ſo great a conſequence, whereon my life depended; ſo that I went myſelf to an apothecary in the city, of whom for a few crowns I purchaſed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal potion, and went to perform my fatal reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution.</p>
            <p>Being come to my father's, I found poor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timeſia indiſpoſed in her bed; and going to viſit her in her chamber, I ſet down by her, where caſting her arms about my neck, and beſtowing many a ſweet kiſs on me, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments ſo obliging, that if hell had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired her ruin, ſure it would have turned the current of my barbarous deſign. Much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe paſſed till ſhe deſired to take a little reſt, ſo kiſſing her, I left her to her repoſe; but taking notice of a poſſet that was preparing on the fire, the maid being buſy about her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; like a fiend of hell, I haſtily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen emptied the poiſon in it, and ſo departed away undeſcried. About half an hour after, this envenom'd drink was adminiſtered unto her, which ſpreading itſelf by degrees into all parts of her vital ſpirits, which, with its force, ſoon made a ſeparation betwixt the ſoul and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:033593_0062_0FF797B2C637E758"/>
the body and left her a breathleſs corpſe. The rumour of her ſudden death begat an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom it was related. Accompanied with father and mother, I went to ſee her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs trunk, not without tears in my eyes; but I cannot ſafely ſay whether it was in deceit, the better to cover my villainy, or the woful object preſented to my eyes; but for one, or either, or both together, many ſighs of ſorrow I made. Mean while meſſages were ſent to my father-in-law, the earl of Palermo, with the heavy tidings of his daughter's untimely death. They arrived at the houſe about the evening; but the lamentations and moans they made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the untimely hearſe of their dear child were numberleſs. They were not without doubts and miſtruſts about the ſudden occaſion of her death; but having no light whereon they might build or ground a ſuſpicion, it vaniſhed as ſoon as it received birth. After nature had paid her tribute in paternal tears, her body was carefully coffined up, and in two days, the ſame company that attended me in my bride nuptials in ſtate and triumph, this day accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the corpſe of poor Artimeſia to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where the body was committed to the earth, after the uſual ceremonies of the dead were celebrated.</p>
            <p>Four days had paſſed ſince the burial of Artimeſia, and two ſince the departure of her

parents when, to paſs away the ſummer's even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to refreſh my drooping ſpirits with the ſweet air and pleaſant ſhades. I retired myſelf, only accompanied with Fidelio, into the ſame garden wherein I was firſt ſurprized with my fair Deſdemona.</p>
            <p>Phoebus now haſtened to bathe his ſweltry ſteeds in the foaming ocean, and his ſiſter Luna began to appear ſo to expel the uſurping ſhades of night, when being comforted by the refreſhing ſweetneſs of her cold influences, ſo that the pleaſures I then enjoyed, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the thoughts of enjoying Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona, made the time ſeem ſhort, ſo that the unexpected hour of ten arrived. Fidelio's intreaties, with the lateneſs of the evening, could not perſuade my return, my mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employed on thoughts more agreeable. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the clock had ſtruck eleven I intended to leave the garden, but firſt reſolving to viſit the happy place where I reſcued my dear Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demona, it was almoſt on the ſtroke of twelve ere I arrived there: the night continued fair and clear, and this was the moſt private retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any in the garden: where I was no ſooner arrived, but, to my amazement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! by the glimmering light of the moon, I ſaw a beautiful woman: her countenance was pale and wan, dropping pearly tears from her fair eyes, which ſhe wiped off with a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033593_0064_0FF797B8B80942B8"/>
She ſat on the ground, leaning her head on her fair hand. She ſeemed wholly a map of ſorrow, and gave demonſtrations by her actions that her geſture could not expreſs the torment of her mind. I had no ſooner approached near enough to have ſpoken to her, but as one ſurpriſed, ſhe haſtily takes away her hand, that ſupported her head; which ſhe had no ſooner done, behold from her breaſt iſſued a crimſon gore. My amazement was great, when in her face I beheld the features of Deſdemona. Her countenance ſeemed to contend with grief and pity, rather than with wrath and anger.</p>
            <p>Frighted with the horror of this ſight, I ſtood like an image of ſtone, not able to go forward, or retire back; when this woful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject came nearer unto me fixing her eyes ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly on my face; after a while raiſing her right hand, laid it on her wound, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to run in purple flood down her breaſt, ſprinkling the graſs with ſcarlet dye. My amazement was augmented, when unfixing her eyes from my face, ſhe lifted them towards Heaven with ſo pale and mournful a poſture as would have produced pity in the moſt ſenſeleſs breaſt. This ſudden ſurpriſal, did cowardice all my ſpirits, ſo that I had not the confidence nor courage to ſpeak to this pitiful apparition, which once more lifting up her hands to her
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033593_0065_0FF797BA4FD67950"/>
wounds, giving me a grievous parting look, ſuddenly vaniſhed out my ſight. I was amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after its departure, and jealous whether I ſhould believe my eyes or no; or whether this was a real apparition, or a fiction brought forth by fancy, that had figured ſuch diſmal ideas in my mind. But the ſucceeding incidents ſoon confirmed the effects to be no illuſions; for before I could recollect and rally together my frighted ſpirits, behold from the thicket hard by me iſſued diſmal ſcreeches horrible and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful moans, accompanied with uncommon and confuſed voices: the heavens on a ſudden cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered themſelves with a ſable cover, and the moon hid her face under an eclipſe. The noiſe became yet more loud and terrible, and the reſounding echo of the horrid clamour drew nearer and nearer, and ſo became more fearful and dreadful. The horizon was cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thick dark clouds; from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a ſtormy ſhower of hail and rain, the wind grew tempeſtuous and boiſterous, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſlaſhes of lightning proceeded: after which followed loud and fearful claps of thunder. The ſtorm increaſed, and became more horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when from the neighbouring thicket ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a woman, who approached me, and whom I ſoon knew to be the dead Artimeſia. I would have fled from her ſight, but could not fly my deſtiny: when coming yet nearer
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033593_0066_0FF797BCCD999528"/>
unto me, with a weak and feeble voice ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered theſe words.</p>
            <p>"Wretched man, now the reward of thy wickedneſs draws near, and thy puniſhment is at hand. Heaven is ready to leave thee, and the earth is prepared to ſwollow thee; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is pronounced againſt thee, and a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger prepared to execute. My innocent death will not go unrevenged, nor your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury unpuniſhed. Go, miſerable and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! deſpair: think of nothing but horrors, ſhrieks, pains, and torments; let content and felicity henceforth become ſtrangers to thee, and let thy misfortunes become even worſe and worſe: let thy ſleep be ſhort, and diſturbed with fearful viſions. The remainder of your life ſhall be a living death: you ſhall ſeek for death, but you ſhall not find it. This is the commiſſion I had to unfold to thee from the higher powers, which having revealed, I leave thee to thy fate."</p>
            <p>This ſaid, ſhe vaniſhed from my ſight, but not my thoughts; for the remembrance was ſo fixed in my ſoul, that I think the feigned fantaſm would hardly yield precedency to the real. My eyes were, yet firmly bent towards that part of the thicket I ſaw Artimeſia take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Fidelio, who the time of this tempeſt had concealed and ſheltered himſelf in a thicket near at hand, after his deſires and intreaties
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033593_0067_0FF797BF5E890440"/>
became fruitleſs, in requiring me to retire with him, when he came unto me, he found me not removed from the ſame place where he left me. Wondering at this change, he took me by the arm; Sir, ſaid he, what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions theſe ghaſtly looks, and timerous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions? You ſeem as if you had met your ſins, or been accoſted with your grandfather's ghoſt. What cauſes thus to bend your eyes on vacancy, and fix your thoughts on ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows? Where do you let your fancy run at random? Sir, conſider where you are, and what time of night it is and let us repair from this fatal place, that has brought you this diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
            <p>His earneſt importunities brought me to myſelf: and ſeeing him expect a reply, Yes, Fidelio, ſaid I, my ſins have met me in full bloom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ghoſts more fearful than my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. By heaven! Fidelio, ſhadows haunt me. Saw you not my deareſt Deſdemona here, and the deceaſed Artimeſia, who juſt now pronounced the ſentence of horror and damnation againſt me?</p>
            <p>"Sir, replied he, theſe chimeras be nothing but the deluſions of a diſturbed brain, which forms to itſelf wonders, which the ſpectators cannot behold: ſuch no doubt was yours; for I proteſt and vow to you I heard no voice, nor did I apprehend any ſuch ſimilitudes: Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſia
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033593_0068_0FF797C1D85969E8"/>
lies quiet in her grave, and I doubt not but Deſdemona is aſleep in her bed; reſt will ſoon cure this diſquiet: come, Sir, let us walk home, the night grows aged, the late ſtorm is paſt, both call on us to depart, leſt we ſhould be prevented by a ſecond diſaſter.</p>
            <p>His entreaties, made me accord to leave the garden, and without returning an anſwer, I ſtraitway accompanied him. We ſoon came to my father's, where they all ſat up expecting my return; but they no ſooner beheld me in that condition and ghaſtly diſtemper, but they ſtood like people with amaze. I was led to my chamber by Fidelio, where I betook myſelf to bed; but oh! the horrors that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me the latter part of the night! If aſleep, Deſdemona preſented herſelf to my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet ſuddenly ſtarting from the trance, methought I ſaw that object really which fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy formed in my dreams; ſo that fearfully call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Fidelio, who attended me, Oh! Fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>io, doſt thou not ſee my deareſt Deſdemona; the blood ſtreaming from her fair breaſt, now ſtanding by my bed ſide? behold ſhe is going away out of the door. Oh ſtay abuſed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence! and tell me the reaſon thou doſt viſit me in that diſmal poſture.</p>
            <p>Here Fidelio, to divert theſe thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made me this diſcourſe, Deſdemona remains entirely yours, and you may bind her ſo by
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:033593_0069_0FF797C36BD7D8B0"/>
tying that inviolable knot of matrimony, which you have already faſtened by ſo many vows: ſince Artimeſia is dead, there is no obſtruction can hinder you from giving her ſatisfaction, and yourſelf content.</p>
            <p>Here Fidelio ended when I embraced him ſaying, O my friend! I am willing to believe whatever thou haſt related unto me, could it contain leſs of truth. I ſhould wiſh no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er happineſs were Deſdemona ſtill among the living; I would ceaſe to expect and aſpire to any greater hope, if I could once embrace her in my arms, and repoſe this weary head in her boſom. To-morrow, my Fidelio, I will put thee to the trouble once more to deliver a letter to Deſdemona; in the mean time we will endeavour to take a little reſt.</p>
            <p>Night had no ſooner fled, but I left my bed, and taking pen, I wrote to this effect.</p>

            <p>I had no ſooner ended my letter, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what horrid fate prompted me to the contrary, to go myſelf in perſon, alledging that my preſence would procure more in Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demona's breaſt, than my letter could. I went accompanied with Fidelio, towards her fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's houſe; but we had no ſooner, leſſened the diſtance, but behold I ſaw a coffin covered with black, adorned with a garland of flowers; the hearſe was ſupported and carried by four young men and ſix beautiful maidens accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, each holding a part of the hearſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, wherein they did intimate and ſilently ſpeak their willingneſs to do ſomething oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it being the laſt ſervice they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the body of this poor departed virgin. The company were all covered with a fable black, their pace ſilent and ſlow, bent towards the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:033593_0071_0FF797CA18492DA8"/>
great temple of the city. This ſight began to chill my blood: and that which gave ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to my fears was, becauſe I ſaw, them come out of Philaſter's houſe; to confirm me that I was not in an error, I ſaw the corpſe followed by the old knight and his lady; their countenance and actions declared them to be in the bitterneſs of ſorrow, and plunged in the depth of woe.</p>
            <p>I had accompanied them to the temple, had not the earneſt deſire I had to be reſolved of the worſt prompted me to the contrary, and perſuaded me to go to the houſe to be truly ſatisfied of my fears. We ſoon came to the door, and having knocked were met by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the houſe, who did know me ſince I uſed to frequent the houſe; and being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the reſpect his lord and lady paid me when they requeſted me to come in. I aſked for the knight and his lady, not taking notice that I had ſeen them; alſo for Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona; to which he gave me a pitious look, letting drop from his eyes many tears. "Sir," ſaid he, "you come in a time to ſee us buried in woe, and to behold us overcharged with ſorrow; for about four days ago, after my miſtreſs Deſdemona had pined with grief and given to ſorrow the full reins and poſſeſſion in her breaſt, when her ſpirits being overcome with grief, and her ſenſes overcharged with
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033593_0072_0FF797CBABAF0390"/>
melancholy, ſhe ſell into deſpair, and walking out as if ſhe would recreate herſelf in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſhe retired into a houſe of pleaſure there privately ſituated, where with a fatal dagger ſhe wounds herſelf to the heart, and this day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with her friends, in a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they perform her obſequies, and convey her body to the temple.</p>
            <p>Here he ended—while my apparition came bleeding freſh in my mind;—my crimes preſented themſelves in their own colours; and my conſcience bid me expect nothing but the fulfilling of murdered Artimeſia's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>I took my farewell, but not without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tears for the loſs of one whom I ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved.—In this diſtreſs of mind, I returned home; and about the hour of ten, at night, while repoſing on my bed, ſuddenly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, our houſe was ſurrounded with armed men, my chamber doors broke open, my body ſeized on, and taken priſoner; being thus ſurprized, I demanded the cauſe, and by what authority they did it? To which one returned me this ſharp anſwer, their authority they had from the king, which I muſt obey, and the occaſion, the death of your late mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried wife Artimeſia, ſuppoſed to be poiſoned by you; with a ſuſpicion which is conceived of you, that you are the author and cauſe of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033593_0073_0FF797CD434EFC20"/>
the death of Deſdemona, daughter and only child of an aged knight of this city, called Philaſter; theſe are the crimes to which you muſt anſwer; in the mean time you muſt yield obedience to our power, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go along with us. This ſaid they laid hands on me, and ſpeedily hurried me out of my chamber, to convey me to priſon; but we had not ſhortened half the way between my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's houſe and the city goal, but by the ſhine of the moon, we might diſcern a troop of horſe, and perceive a ſmall company of foot, which in a void place of the city began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs us about, which my guard no ſooner deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried, but they cried out a reſcue, a reſcue: but their voices were ſoon ſtopped by the horſe-men which overran them, and the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that bravely aſſaulted them: ſo that in a moment I ſaw myſelf free, and bravely mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a freſh horſe. Whilſt I was wondering at the ſtrangeneſs of this reſcue, I ſaw one make toward me, which I preſently knew to be Fidelio. Sir, ſaid he to me, ceaſe your amazement, and follow this guard with ſpeed; for every moment you ſtay here will be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and they will ſafely convoy you to the water-ſide, where a veſſel attends you, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your father, from whom, by my timely notice came alſo this guard; for he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents him of his obſtinacy which occaſioned
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033593_0074_0FF797CEF4182E80"/>
theſe evils for which you were accuſed fearing you are too much guilty to ſtand in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yourſelf and your crimes too notorious to abide a trial; and therefore being unwilling to leave you to the mercies and ſeverities of the law, that himſelf firſt brought into danger, waits for you at the water-ſide, with ſome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er company.</p>
            <p>Being conducted to the veſſel, and the wind blowing fair, ſo that we left Syracuſe far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, and a few hours after wholly loſt the ſight of the iſland of Sicilia; the gale continuing ſtill fair, we gained a ken of the iſle of Malta, where we did not land, but continuing our courſe almoſt three days gained a view of the main continent of Africa; and about the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third day, we anchored before the mighty city of Carthaga.</p>
            <p>Here we landed and provided ourſelves with all neceſſaries, as well offenſive as defenſive, and all other things needful, which our ſo haſty parting from Syracuſe would not permit us to furniſh. We lay there one day, and then weighed anchor, and put to ſea, where our intentions were to cruize about, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to meet with ſome veſſels that came lately from Syracuſe, of whom we might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire tidings of what we all did ſo paſſionately deſire to know.</p>
            <p>It was now ſeven days ſince we parted Sicil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033593_0075_0FF797D3805EA290"/>
and two ſince we left the coaſt of Africa, about the time of the day when the ſun begins to decline towards the weſt, when a boy ſtood centinel on the top maſt head ſuddenly cried out a ſail, a ſail; being demanded from whence ſhe ſteered her courſe? he returned anſwer from Sicilia. This began to augment the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I had to have news from Syracuſe; ſo that I gave commands to the pilot to ſteer his courſe to her, which he had no ſooner performed, but the boy called out again, ſaying, prepare for your defence, for this veſſel bears to us with all ſpeed for an aſſault. He had ſcarce ended theſe words but our eyes did give us proof the were fit for a preſent fight.</p>
            <p>This ſight cauſed them to forget the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of others, and to think on nothing ſo much as to provide for their own ſafety; yet they agreed with one accord chearfully to make good their defence, and manfully to guard themſelves, and me from being captured. We had hardly made our preparations for a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but we ſaw this veſſel with great dexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity preparing to board us on the weather ſide: their javelins in a moment were ready to grapple with our veſſel, in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which we received a brave aſſault, and they as gallant repulſe. Our archers ſcarce ſpent an arrow in vain; neither did their's ſlack their duty. The fight continued
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033593_0076_0FF797D510EECB08"/>
ſharp while we lay off the one from the other, but I heard him that ſeemed to be the captain of the veſſel ſay theſe words to his ſoldiers, "Arm yourſelves with courage, noble hearts, and let the king of Sicilia know you are val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ient. We are not miſtaken; ſee fortune hath preſented the murderous villain an object to your eyes, and brought him a ſacrifice to our juſt reſentments. Now let the innocent death of Artimeſia and Deſdemona ſharpen your ſwords for a juſt revenge, and let their ſorrowful parents ſee your fidelity, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt you take in their wrongs, when you preſent them with the head of their mortal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy.</p>
            <p>This ſpeech left us no longer in doubt of their buſineſs; and although I eſteemed my life ſcarce worth preſerving, yet the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this fellow made of my head made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve not to part with it friendly to my enemies at ſuch a time when I was in good capacity to defend it. This raiſed my anger to make a ſtout reſiſtance; and his oration cauſed his ſoldiers to aſſail us with double courage.</p>
            <p>Now the fight began to be at the higheſt, and a great number of men were ſlain on both ſides. This battle was fought till the ſun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bid good night to our horizon, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had left it doubtful to which ſide ſhe ſhould incline: when we were preſſed by our
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033593_0077_0FF797D6A60569E8"/>
enemies, with ſo much vigour, that my men were forced to retire, whilſt they furiouſly mounted our veſſel. Here I expoſed myſelf to certain dangers, very willing to part with life, ſo I could have loſt it nobly in reſiſting my enemies; but death flies them that ſeek him, and intrudes on ſuch as deſire his abſence. As I was deſperately braving the utmoſt danger, I met and engaged with their commander, ſo greedily we combated one with another, and with ſo much deſire endeavoured the ruin of each other, that it was no wonder fortune made haſte to determine the end; many cruel blows we exchanged, till at laſt I puſhed my enemy ſo cloſely, and redoubled my blows with ſo much violence, that directing a blow which fell on his head with my greateſt force, it part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two, and he fell lifeleſs on the deck.— Thus he who ſo confidently diſpoſed of my head, could not ſecure his own from my ſword.</p>
            <p>This ſight began to abate the courage of our enemies, and to revive the ſpirits of my almoſt vanquiſhed men; for returning with a greater force than at firſt, they made a mighty ſlaughter; and having diſpatched all thoſe in their own veſſel, with great ſpeed we boarded our enemies, ſo that the offenſive were now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come defenſive, and performed their part ſo ill in maintaining it that we ſoon became con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>querors
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033593_0078_0FF797D92AA59E28"/>
of the other ſhip, committing all the ſouls to the place appointed for their deſerts, where the ſpirits of all men are rewarded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merits. The dead bodies of our men, and alſo of our enemies, we caſt overboard into the ſea.</p>
            <p>The night became extreme dark, not one ſtar appeared in the firmament, as if they had diſdained to behold ſo bloody a tragedy: ſo that we were forced to ſtrike up lights, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee to clear the veſſel of the dead carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Myſelf, with a torch in my hand, went to behold the ſlain in the enemy's veſſel, where the ſoldiers, the tempeſt of their revenge being not yet ſtilled, without pity caſt as well the wounded as dead out of the veſſel; when their wounds, miſeries, intreaties, prayers, or diſmal moans, could not perſuade them to mercy.</p>
            <p>Among many that were thus uſed, one of them, whom my men had taken up in their arms ready to caſt him away into the ocean, cried out, "O Sirs! ſpare me but one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bring me to your commander, to whom I ſhall relate ſuch ſecrets as he is yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of." This had not preſerved his life, if I had not given a ſpeedy command to the ſoldiers to hold their hand; and although diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured with wounds, by his voice I quickly diſcovered him to be the ſervant of Philaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:033593_0079_0FF797DBAF80F320"/>
the ſame who related to me the death of Deſdemona. And from him I learned that the letter I wrote to Deſdemona, and which I unfortunately dropped near her father's houſe, had been found, and delivered to the earl of Palermo; who thereby diſcovered me to be the murderer of his daughter, and who with a deſign to revenge her death, had cauſed me to be arreſted; but finding I had been reſqued by my father, applied to the King, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately armed and ſent veſſels in purſuit of me; and that the earl's ſervants, and the ſervants of Philaſter, had voluntarily gone on board, determined to ſecure the author of the calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities that had befallen their maſters. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded no farther, and perceiving him to grow faint by the loſs of blood, I ordered the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons to adminiſter the beſt relief; but in vain, for he ſoon expired.</p>
            <p>Day ſoon advanced, and the enemies veſſel appearing the ſtrongeſt, and beſt to ſail, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved our ſtores, ſunk our own veſſel, and ſet ſail for the city of Algiers, knowing of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther port that would give us protection, and that only upon condition of our turning pirates.</p>
            <p>It would be too tedious, madam, to relate the many adventures thro' which I have ſince paſſed; and the many human ſacrifices I have made to acquire wealth, and to obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the Dey. But here let me put an end
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033593_0080_0FF797DE21EB8860"/>
to my diſmal ſtory. I have given you, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, a true relation, nor have I interwoven the leaſt falſehood, with a view to draw a veil over my crimes. But when you remember that my firſt ſins proceeded, not from inclination, but from my adverſe fate, and that having once entered the gulph of wickedneſs, there was no poſſibility of going back, you will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pity than condemn me. Was I uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to, and did I practiſe Artimeſia's death— Oh! remember my conſtancy and love to Deſdemona; I am incapable of going farther in my own juſtification. My crimes are a continual torment; but the reherſal of them affords me ſome ſatisfaction when it is done by your command.</p>

            <p>HERE Almerin ended the ſtory of his life, leaving Orſamus and Cynthia in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and aſtoniſhment; they ſaw he was purſued by a divine hand, and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to fly his fate; ſo that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look on their own condition, fearfully apprehending the calamities that might befal them, in being priſoner to one, who being followed by divine vengeance, made all miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that were concerned in any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033593_0081_0FF797DFB51E86A8"/>
unto him. Their fears almoſt made them deſpair but that they did remember Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doth always aſſiſt the virtuous in their greateſt calamities, and is neareſt at hand, with remedy and relief, when our miſeries become moſt deſperate, and paſt cure.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations diſſipated the grief of lovers endured, elſe it had been too heavy a burden; for their condition ſeemed ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that only a divine power could relieve them. The relation of Almerin's life, became an addition to their own miſeries, and an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of their tears, yet in civilitiy ſhe was enforced to render him thanks for his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; after ſome diſcourſe had paſſed, and night began to cloath herſelf in a ſable black, ſo putting a period to their diſcourſe, Orſamus and Almerin each taking their reſpective fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of Cynthia, left her to her reſt; Orſamus retiring to his cabin, and Almerin to give commands to his ſoldiers, concerning the ſhip.</p>
            <p>Some days paſſed, while they cruiſed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of more prizes; In the mean time, Almerin proſecuted his ſuit to Cynthia with much eagerneſs; ſtill keeping himſelf in the bounds of his reſpect, until by the return of Cynthia's beauty, his love blew his luſt into a flame, which could not be extinguiſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peril to either ſide. Love is a paſſion of
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:033593_0082_0FF797E14BE17930"/>
all others moſt lovely, until luſt take a moiety, and becomes its rival, then it becomes a very tyrant, and is ſubject to the greateſt villainy; for where paſſion bears ſway, there is no admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for reaſon.</p>
            <p>About nine days had paſſed away, ſince they were firſt ſurpriſed, when he came very rudely into her cabin, and with much inſolence treated her in this manner: Madam, I ſee all civilities have been loſt, and you provoke me to deſtroy all the conſiderations that have flowed from that fountain. I have henceforth decreed to ſeek my ſatisfaction by other means, ſo that I allow you until to morrow to frame a reſolution, and if that fail to overcome your obſtinacy, I ſhall know how to oblige you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, in ſpite of your averſion. He confirmed this menace with many others; and his actions agreeing thereunto told him to have ſpoke nothing but what he fully determined before in his mind; ſaying this, he left the cabin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt reſpect; and in going out, he fortuned to meet Orſamus, then going to pay his uſual viſit to Cynthia, and greeting him in his rough language, ſir, ſaid he, remember you are my priſoner; and ſince fortune gives you no greater tie over your ſiſter's affections, that ſhe will not ſuffer you to gain your free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from henceforth you ſhall be treated like a ſlave, or like one that has baffled and deluded
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:033593_0083_0FF797E5A87EF180"/>
me with falſe hopes; henceforth I ſhall find other ways to compaſs my ends, without your interceſſion: until to-morrow I have allowed your ſiſter to comply with my deſires, which if you can perfect you may both yet be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Baſe man, replied Orſamus, doſt thou think thy villainy ſhall always remain unpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, and that there is no period ſet on thy wickedneſs. This ſaid, he entered into Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia's cabin, yet compoſing all that was fierce and terrible in his looks, where he found the object of his felicity bathing in tears. Why theſe precious ſhowers, Madam? ſaid he, wherefore the overflowings of grief? is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this villain has ſo confidently ſet a time to finiſh his deſires? alas! my dear princeſs, he does but hurry on his own puniſhment, and ſet an end unto his villainy; fear not the iſſue, Madam; but diſſipate thoſe cruel apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; for you ſhall yet be free.</p>
            <p>All the time of this diſcourſe Orſamus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at her feet; but recollecting her ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, taking him by the hand, riſe Orſamus, ſaid ſhe, and blame not my griefs ſince fortune in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to put no period to our misfortunes, nor end to our miſeries; ſhe is become cruel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remorſe, and pitileſs without compaſſion; if I think of hope, ſhe ſoon transforms it into diſpair, and if I dare imagine I may be more happy, ſhe ſoon curbs me in that preſumption.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033593_0084_0FF797E738BC1028"/>
If there is no preterminant end ſet to my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, why ſhould I expect any longer, and not count death as the laſt remedy? then blame not the tears I ſhed in ſo woful a caſe, ſince ſome fall for Orſamus, and accompany thoſe that drop for Cynthia. Orſamus raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this free and unconſtrained anſwer of Cynthia, and manifeſtation of her pity, Oh! Madam, ſaid he, how happy do you make me! a thouſand ſuch lives as mine ſpent in thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice were but a poor recompence of the leaſt of thoſe precious tears that you ſhed: Oh reſt contented, my deareſt princeſs: I am only ſafe in your ſecurity, and happy in your ſatisfaction. It is impoſſible I ſhould be thus fortunate, and yet be unhappy.</p>
            <p>In ſuch diſcourſe they paſſed away their lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited time, till Almerin, with haſty ſteps made towards the cabin door; which was no ſooner perceived by Orſamus, but he made ready for his entertainment. Cynthia perſuaded him from an attempt upon his life: but he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anſwer, Ceaſe, fair ſoul, and let me alone, middle ways to ſuch enterprizes are the moſt dangerous.</p>
            <p>By this time Almerin came to the cabin door, which was opened on to him by Orſamus, at his entrance he ſuddenly diſarmed him of his ſword with ſuch an impetuous fury, that before he could cry out for help or make the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:033593_0085_0FF797E8D2AF7280"/>
leaſt reſiſtance, he caſt him deadly wounded at his feet, "Lie there thou main obſtructor of my quiet, ſaid he, take the reward of thy villainy in the grave." Hardly was he fallen on the deck but his amazed ſpirits returned, being ready to give a farewel to the body; which Orſamus ſeeing, made ready to give him another blow, ſo to make a ſudden end to that fatal ſeparation, which Almerin perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cried," "Oh, hold your hand! it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; I feel my ſoul is ready to take her flight, and my continuance here will be but a few moments. Oh horrible! ſtill beginning and never ending eternity; now I deſire to live becauſe I fear to die; yet I would die becauſe I would be free from the fear of worſe to come. Oh happy they that ſo live, that they may be never afraid to die; to ſuch, death is eternal happineſs;—but mine is—another voyage— for my time is at hand, I go away in a miſt I know not how;—I can ſay no more—farewel." At this he gave up the ghoſt, to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Orſamus, and to the terror of Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia.</p>
            <p>In a moment the glory of the day was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt with black clouds, the wind grew boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the ſeas turbulent, the reſounding echo of the thundering claps were terrible to the hearers; flaſhes of lightning made the ſhip ſeem on fire, with ſtorms of hail and rain; ſo
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033593_0086_0FF797EA7172A548"/>
that the men made towards Cynthia's cabin, to give notice to their captain to have his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe; when behold they were amazed at the diſmal object preſented to their eyes; they ſaw him wallowing in his own blood at the entrance of the cabin.</p>
            <p>This ſight was followed with a loud and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cry, with lamentations, of many voices; ſtill the ſtorm continued, and their confuſion increaſed until at laſt recollecting their diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they agreed with one conſent to make good their revenge upon Orſamus, who they doubted not had been the murderer of their captain; part they appointed to manage the ſhip in the ſtorm, while the reſt went to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his blood to the ghoſt of their ſlain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. Their reſolution was anſwerable to their deſign: for the loſs of their captain whom they loved ſo entirely, and in whom they built their future fortunes, had raiſed their cholor to ſuch a height, that nothing could allay it but his death. This was made manifeſt in their fierce aſſault, which was by Orſamus as brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repulſed; for he had gotten this advantage, that defending himſelf at the entrance of the cabin door, but one at a time could endanger or hurt him. The combat continued hot on both ſides, Orſamus, for the ſafety of his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cynthia, and the pirates their revenge.— Three of the pirates Orſamus had ſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:033593_0087_0FF797EED063D4D0"/>
their captain, neither did he himſelf eſcape without wounds. Things were thus ſtated when the tempeſt began to aſſuage, and one from the forecaſtle began to cry out, A Sail, a Sail. This ſummons perſuaded them to defer their revenge for a time, ſo that of that great number that aſſailed him, ſix only ſtaid as a guard to ſecure him, fearing, ſhould they engage, he might iſſue forth and join with the enemy, to their no ſmall diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>The ſhip drew nearer, making towards them with full ſails before their preparations were in readineſs for defence, they were ſalut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſhowers of arrows that ſeemed to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſky; in a few moments they came to a cloſer combat and grapple with their ſhip; then the fight began bloody, and cruel deſpair made the pirates courageous, ſo that twice they repulſed them with no ſmall loſs: in the third aſſault they were worſted and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> taking advantage of their retreat, ſlew all, leaving not a man alive, thoſe that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Orſamus were fled away, and eſcaped his hands, but it was only to fall by others; ſome that were forwardeſt for plunder and ſpoil, would have entered Orſamus's cabin, but their lives paid the forfeit of their folly: this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned another bickering and drew moſt part of the conquerors together to behold a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſo bravely maintained by one man, where
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:033593_0088_0FF797F061E74688"/>
eight lay wallowing in their blood yet he made good his defence, thus he continued triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their deaths, while the victorious captain that had boarded the ſhip was a ſpectator, and pitying that ſo much bravery ſhould wither in the bud, he commanded his men to leave aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and drawing ſomething nearer, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant man, ſaid he, your courage has gained an eſteem in the breaſt of your enemy; ceaſe this conteſt, and I promiſe, you life and liberty.</p>
            <p>Your offer is noble, replied Orſamus, nor could it flow but from a breaſt truly generous; it is not only againſt your men I have made this reſiſtance, but againſt the whole ſtrength of this ſhip before your valour ſubdued it; the captain lies here a ſacrifice, ſlain by my hand; and nothing could have preſerved my life, had not providence directed you hither; yet being my preſerver, I dare not deliver my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on theſe terms; not that I doubt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of your promiſe, but I have here within this cabin one whoſe ſafety if I cannot ſecure, I ſhall little value my own. If you pleaſe to let us both ſhare alike in your bounty, and promiſe to include us both in that noble offer of life and liberty, I will ſubmit myſelf to your protection; if not, I am ready to make good my defence, with the loſs of that life I ſhall not eſteem, without the entire perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe articles. Saying this, he put
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:033593_0089_0FF797F1F34F0280"/>
himſelf in a poſture of defence. Hold ſaid the captain I will fulfill all thy requeſt; in the King of Kent's name, my royal maſter, I plight thee my faith. Orſamus remained amazed at this anſwer, and after ſome revolutions in his ſpirit, he replied, ha, King of Kent ſaid you' come and finiſh what you have begun; for I will never live to ſee in another's cuſtody what is entirely due to my merit.</p>
            <p>Scarce had he uttered theſe words when an aged man made through the crowd towards him, and with extacy of joy exclaimed, My noble lord Orſamus, living and found here! Heavens, you have ſatisfied my tedious expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations: and pauſing a while with admiration he continued his diſcourſe; Sir, I am not ſo much loſt unto your memory, but you may remember one Willifred. At this Orſamus recollecting himſelf, crying out, my dear fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Oh come into this fatal place that I may have happineſs in death to die in the defence of two perſons that ſhare my ſoul betwixt them. Oh ſir! replied the old man, talk not of death, we come forth in ſearch of you only for ſafety; that I make all this evident unto you, ceaſe your admiration for a time. This ſaid, and all continuing ſilent, he proceeded as follows.</p>
            <p>Oſwald, that famous king of the Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, had a brother named Oſwain the only
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:033593_0090_0FF797F3B81FC088"/>
ſucceſſor to that great kingdom: he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a noble lady, by whom he had iſſue Egfrid the elder, and Orſamus one year young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo that you are not my ſon, as hitherto you have eſteemed yourſelf. When that fatal bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Maſterfield was ſought by king Penda, the tyrant of Mercia, againſt your uncle Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald, king of the Northumbers, in which field he was ſlain, it was uncertain whether Oſwain your father, or your elder brother Egfrid had ended their lives at the moment; as ſoon as tidings were brought of their diſmal overthrow, I fled with you, being as then about ten years old, unto the next port town, where I got ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and eſcaped to find a more ſecure ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in another country than our own; but I kept you from the knowledge of yourſelf; pardon, it was my love that erred, for I did conclude a diſcovery would be prejudicial.— While we were ſailing on the ocean as you well remember, their aroſe ſuch a tempeſt, that the ſkill of the mariners was uſed in vain; ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left to the mercy of the ſea we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to unknown parts: and about the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond day, we diſcerned land, and before we had time to recollect upon what ſhore we were caſt, we grounded on a rock ſo that the ſhip burſt into a thouſand pieces. The little time I had left I did conſider of your ſafety, ſo that tying two caſks together and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:033593_0091_0FF797F82EF360F0"/>
you ſafely on I left you to the mercy of the ſea, while I ſecured myſelf on a piece of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that came from the broken ſhip, but mine was driven a contrary courſe unto that which you went, ſo that we ſoon parted to a great diſtance, that I never ſaw you ſince, until this moment. Some time after your father recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered and took poſſeſſion of his brother's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and after I had made a ſtrict enquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the part where I conceived you were lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and not finding you, I imagined you had paid your life as a tribute unto the unmerciful waves; ſo that I returned home ſorrowful into my own country, and made this relation unto your father, who bitterly lamented your loſs; but time at laſt put your memory into oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when we conſidered you were not among the living.</p>
            <p>Some years had added themſelves unto the age of time when ſame proclaimed in our own country the excellent beauty of Cynthia, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the king of Kent; ſo much did the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this ſeize your brother Egfrid's affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, as he deſired his father to treat of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with the king of Kent by a marriage with his daughter.—His father, that after the report of your death, did prize him as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his eye, unwilling to croſs affection in a cauſe ſo juſt, immediately accorded with his deſires and choſe me for that embaſſage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033593_0092_0FF77E1156CECA78"/>
that well attended, in a few days I arrived at Doraborina, the regal city of Kent; in a ſmall time I was admitted to a hearing, where I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the ſum of my embaſſage; hardly had I arrived unto the period of my commands, but with tears in his eyes he began as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>"Sir, ſome few years ago, when I enjoyed my deareſt Cynthia, for now ſhe is not; or if ſhe be, is not to me: in a pleaſant morning, before Sol had caſt her rays from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tops, ſhe aroſe to enjoy the variety of the pleaſant ſpring, which Flora had cloathed in her choiceſt garb; the pearly dew did yet hang on the ſweet damaſk roſes, and the infant bloſſom caſt forth a pleaſant favour; the wild choriſters of the wood made the vallies ring with echo of their delightful notes; while her contemplation was taken up on the muſing of theſe rarities, her curioſity had brought her to a little path, which led towards the ſea, which was not far from the place where ſhe was; ſtraying farther, and caſting her eyes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, they encountered with an object that at once excited her admiration and pity; ſhe ſaw a youth about her age, that had ſecured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on two caſks, and with his utmoſt ſkill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to gain ſhore; compaſſion is never wanting in ſo tender a breaſt, nor was it abſent from hers; ſhe commanded thoſe men that
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033593_0093_0FF797FB718E95A0"/>
attended with all expedition to make off and ſave his life, and bring him unto her, having more timerous apprehenſions of his ſafety than at that time needed. Her commands were exactly obeyed, ſo that by their induſtry in a few moments they ſecured him aſhore, and weak and feeble as he was preſented him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Cynthia. I remember I was walking in my palace garden when they preſented him unto me: Lo here, Sir, ſaid ſhe, taking the youth by the hand with a ſmile, ſweetly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſee how fortunate I have been to day by my early riſing, to be the preſerver of this pretty lad, which, with your conſent, I would have to attend on me ſince it is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to ſpend his life, ſo happily preſerved, in my ſervice. With this ſhe related where, and how he came into her hands; I ſtaid ſometime for an anſwer, contemplating his behaviour, and ſweet becoming graces; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I ſaw ſomething in him of majeſty. I queſtioned him of his name and country, to which he gave me this anſwer, Sir, my name is Orſamus, my father is an aged old man, who I fear periſhed in the late ſtorm; my country is far hence, in parts unknown to me; and being ſhipwrecked in the late tempeſt, he ſecured my ſafety upon two caſks; many hours I continued on the waves uncertain of life, until I was caſt upon this happy ſhore,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033593_0094_0FF797FD09A5AE48"/>
and reſcued from the jaws of Neptune, by this fair divinity, in whole ſervice I ſhould be too happy were I aſſured of my dear father's ſafety. At the period of his diſcourſe he let fall a ſhower of tears to the memory of ſo near a loſs. We comforted him with the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable words we could frame, telling him his miſtreſs would be to him inſtead of a fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; that if his father were caſt upon our coaſt he ſhould have notice given of his ſafety. He ſeemed much ſatisfied with this diſcourſe, which contentment he expreſſed in his conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for that time he left me, and attended the princeſs.</p>
            <p>"He was already become the darling of the whole court; every day added to his eſteem he had already gotten, who all admired ſuch uncommon graces ſhould bud in years ſo green; he had a ſolidity that overtoped his age, he was never hardly from Cynthia's eye, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did ſhe deſire it; ſo that he ſeemed to bound his whole felicity in her ſervice; he waited upon her walks and recreations, but ſtill kept himſelf about her with a profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; he would not prize the deareſt good before the leaſt and ſmalleſt occaſion to pleaſe her; he courted all opportunities, time and places, to make it manifeſt; if ſhe would retire herſelf into an arbour there would he charm ſweet ſleep upon her eye lids with delightful
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:033593_0095_0FF79800A9EC21C8"/>
muſic, in which art he was excellent; and while ſhe ſlept he would remain a careful cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel. The princeſs, young as ſhe was, did not bury thoſe ſervices in oblivion, but rated them at their true value in her breaſt, rewarding all with a grand eſteem, which was received by him as a reward of all his merits; he could ſo ſweeten his diſcourſe and action to ſo near a ſympathy, his converſation being ſo charming and agreeable, that Cynthia was never ſatisfied when he was abſent; as his years increaſed, he bent his delight to manly exerciſes, ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times his gallant deportment in publick ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles drew admiration from all that did behold him.</p>
            <p>"His affairs ſtood thus in court, when my land was ſuddenly invaded by Cavaline, King of the Weſt-Saxons; I raiſed an army to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, and ſet forward to meet him; when this young novice, fired with hopes of action, to make trial of his valour, taking opportunity when the princeſs was alone, he accoſted her in this manner: "Madam, I am too happy, in the felicity you have raiſed me to in being your ſervant; but now opportunity preſents what perchance fortune may never offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; your country is invaded by enemies, and I deſire your good leave to accompany your father in this expedition, againſt thoſe Pagans that dare to commit ſo great a ſacrilege;—
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:033593_0096_0FF7980341CB7900"/>
where, in the field of honor, I may purchaſe trophies that may raiſe me to deſerve that eſteem you have for me." Cynthia, having a while conſidered of his requeſt, with an unuſual kindneſs, made this reply. "Yes, Orſamus, you have my free leave to go: nor can I truſt you better than with my father; yet it is no ſmall hopes I promiſe myſelf, from theſe early beginnings of your bravery; go then, and be happy, for you ſhall never want the prayers of your miſtreſs." This ſaid, he attended her to my chamber, where ſhe made known his reſolution unto me; nor could I diſapprove the gallantry of his mind, but commending his forwardneſs, gave him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ordering him always to be near my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>"We marched forward by uſual journies, to hinder the enemies foraging in the country, until at laſt we encamped upon a large plain, on the frontiers of my kingdom; here we took the advantage of our ground, and bade the enemy battle; it was firſt begun by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of our armies, but at laſt our main body engaged, and the fight became bloody on both ſides; victory as yet remained doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to which ſide ſhe would incline; at laſt, by a violent charge of the enemy, my ranks were broken, my main battle diſordered, and, in ſpite of my guard I was taken priſoner. This
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033593_0097_0FF79804D3C14810"/>
was no ſooner underſtood by Orſamus, but, like a young Mars, he ruſhed into the midſt of the throng, dealing blows with ſo much bravery, that he ſoon redeemed me, and in ſhort we became maſters of the field.</p>
            <p>"But it fortuned ſoon after, I became the diſturber of his quiet, and chief occaſion that he left my court. It fell out thus; the Eaſt Angles king, my adjoining neighbour, aſked Cynthia in marriage for his ſon Cordelio; my council adviſed me to grant his requeſt; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to their advice, and concluded the marriage with his ambaſſadors, telling them I would celebrate their nuptials in Doroborino: the Ambaſſadors returned home, and in a few days after, Cordelio arrived with a great train. The day was appointed to join their hands, all neceſſaries provided; yet, by a turn of fortune, it came to no effect.</p>
            <p>"After this contract of marriage Orſamus became poſſeſſed with unuſual melancholy! he ſought out ſolitary places wherein to ſpend his time; a mortal ſadneſs was charactered in all the features of his face: the whole court concerned them in his misfortunes, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was not the leaſt; I often times demanded of him from whence this change did ariſe, but he never yielded me any account. This was ſoon taken notice of by Cynthia, ſo that being with him alone in the garden walks, How

now, Orſamus, ſaid ſhe, why theſe ſighs? wherefore is your countenance changed? why have you let yourſelf fall into a diſtemper below the knowledge of your miſtreſs? reveal it, that if poſſible I may procure a remedy.— Yes, ſaid Orſamus, it is only you can yield a remedy; you made me happy only to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate: Oh that I had been buried in the raging ocean! I ſhould have found a reſting place in Elizium, and not have died by a ſecond death. Oh Madam! continued he, reſolve me, muſt you be married? Yes, replied Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, it is ſo decreed: then farewel hopes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Orſamus; now, Madam, you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a remedy, death and deſpair will ſoon give period to my life; but becauſe I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with your deſires, that your diſpleaſure may haſten on the death I ſo much deſire, know, from the moment you preſerved my life, until this time, I have nouriſhed ſuch a paſſion for your virtues, as will follow my aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the grave. Seven long years are paſt ſince I have concealed this a ſecret in my boſom; the ſummer's ſcorching heat, nor the tedious winter nights, could never work the leaſt change; it was daily nouriſhed by your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, although innocently, until it came to its full growth; whilſt there was the leaſt hope it thrived nor did I ever complain; but to have hope torn up by the roots, to be confined nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:033593_0099_0FF77E184BCD7818"/>
to ſee you more, is a cruelty that cannot be borne. Here he continued ſilent.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Cynthia remained aſtoniſhed at his diſcourſe; but at laſt recovering that aſſurance ſhe had loſt the time of his diſcourſe. "Orſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus? (replied ſhe) is it thus you pay your reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects unto me? dare you raiſe your ambition to the daughter of a king? or could you imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine I would own your pretenſions? I am ſorry my eſteem ſhould be thus leſſened by your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or if my intentions or inclinations could lean that way, it is impoſſible my father ſhould ever conſent, whoſe diſpleaſure I would not gain to obtain the deareſt good: to put an end to thoſe dangers that this may occaſion for the future, I deſire you from henceforth to avoid my preſence, ſince there is only this mean left to cure your malady; while I reſtrain thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent familiarities that have diſturbed your quiet." Oh Madam! ſaid Orſamus, falling on his knees, mitigate your diſpleaſure—there wanted only this to make me wretched. It is decreed, replied Cynthia, and it behoves you not to diſpute it. Then be it ſo, ſaid Orſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, to thy cruel ſentence will I ſubmit, and henceforth avoid thy preſence, however fatal to me may be the ſeparation from her who, thro' pity, preſerved my life: may my abſence free you from the danger of your father's diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure;—and if in death I ſtill retain your pity,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:033593_0100_0FF7980A054741E0"/>
then ſhall my ghoſt reſt quiet in the grave.— He bowed, and left the room.</p>
            <p>The abſence of Orſamus, ſoon produced great effects in the breaſt of Cynthia; diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſeated herſelf on her brow, the carnation of her cheeks began to abate, and the lillies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to poſſeſs their places; having demanded the reaſon of thoſe ſudden effects, ſhe inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me of the particulars that had fallen out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Orſamus and herſelf, and the occaſion of his abſence. Sir, ſaid ſhe, ſee the reſolution of this unfortunate youth occaſioned by one haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty word; which I fear will deſtroy what I ſo happily preſerved, although his audacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing of his love were an offence, it was not of that degree to call his life in queſtion. Shall I tell you, from whom I do not conceal my greateſt ſecrets; had Orſamus's love been au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by your free conſent, I would have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him out of the ſtock of mankind; nor can I much offend in loving one that has been the preſerver of your life and kingdom.</p>
            <p>I could not much gainſay, what ſhe had ſaid, for Orſamus's virtues were ſo well grounded in my breaſt, that oftentimes I have had thot's to his advantage, tending that way; but, as things were now ſtated, I durſt not make my concerns known unto Cynthia. The marriage day drew near, and Cordelio waited the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his nuptials, ſo that I could not go
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:033593_0101_0FF7980C748DFEA8"/>
back from promiſe without provoking the Eaſt Angles King to be my enemy. This conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration cauſed me to cloud my countenance with a frown: Fy, Cynthia, replied I, forget this man, one of ſo low condition; were his birth any ways correſpondent to thine, I think I ſhould have accorded with thy deſires, had I known it before this contract with Cordelio; but this has proceeded ſo far, that the deferring of it would endanger my whole kingdom.— Baniſh this miſerable man from thy memory, and obey the commands of thy father and king. She made no reply, but with a low ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſeemed to conſent with what I deſired, and left me. After her departure, I ſent ſpies throughout my kingdom to ſearch for Orſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, and bring him back: my diſcontents came little ſhort of Cynthia's, for I could not endure the abſence of him to whoſe valour I was ſo much obliged. My ſervants at length returned without bringing the leaſt intelligence of Orſamus; this added freſh grief to Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia; and ſhunning thoſe amuſements which might have diſpelled her melancholy, ſhe was ſoon reduced to an object of compaſſion. I beheld this viciſſitude with ſorrow, and gladly would have procured a remedy. The day of marriage faſt approached, and being unwilling at ſuch a time ſhe ſhould be wholly made up of ſorrow, I cauſed a ſtately banquet
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:033593_0102_0FF7980E0910A5F0"/>
to be prepared in my garden adjoining the ſea environed by an unfrequented wood. It was here I recreated myſelf when my buſineſs at court would permit my abſence; and thither I came with Cynthia, attended by Cordelio and a numerous train. We had ended our ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and ſeparated to participate of various pleaſures. Cordelio remained with me, and Cynthia, accompanied by her uſual attendants, directed her walk to that part of the garden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butting the ſea; as ſhe approached the bounds of the garden ſhe cautioned her ſervants to keep at a diſtance: theſe commands were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and always obeyed. She had retired an hour, when becoming anxious for her ſafety, they ventured to break her commands, and reſolved to follow her into the wood: but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon induced them firſt to give me notice, as the turnings were ſo intricate, that, being once entered, they might ſooner loſe themſelves than recover their abſent miſtreſs. We then diſperſed into all parts of the wood; ſcarce a thicket was left untraced; night approached, and we had almoſt deſpaired of finding her, when it was Cordelio's fortune to diſcover her ſitting alone. He had but juſt ſeated himſelf by her ſide, when Orſamus iſſued from a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring thicket and caſt himſelf at her feet. So changed was his countenance, that he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unknown to Cynthia until he complained
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:033593_0103_0FF7980FCB436C40"/>
of her cruelty. Amazed at his ſad appearance, ſhe was unable to reply. He became deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; drew his ſword, and reſolved to ſacrifice his own life to his love, and the life of Cordel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>io to his revenge. Cordelio was falling a ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice, when his attendants flew to his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; they inſtantly aſſaulted him, and altho' by his bravery he ſlew five of the ſtouteſt, yet no doubt they would have put a period to his life, had not a ſtrange turn of fortune preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him—From a ſmall creek iſſued ſixteen pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, at the ſight of which they that aſſaulted Orſamus fled; but he made good his defence againſt them. Too late I had news of this, for when I came to the place, nothing was to be ſeen but half a ſcore of men lying dead on the ground. Among thoſe there was one who began to recover, and by aſſiſtance was ſoon brought to his ſenſes, to whom I promiſed life, on condition that he gave me a true relation what they were: He began as followeth:</p>
            <p>My country is the Ocean, and the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of theſe men with whom I came a ſhore is Almerin the famous rover; under his conduct 16 of us came aſhore, and were bravely repulſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one ſingle man, who made good his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt us all, for the preſerving of a lady who lay ſenſeleſs on the ground; three of my companions beſides myſelf lay grovling in their blood at his feet, which ſight incenſed Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:033593_0104_0FF798125D21A828"/>
to a ſpeedy revenge, that they ruſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with ſuch force that it ſeemed impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he ſhould make any longer reſiſtance; in fine, they ſeized him, and conveyed both him and the lady aboard our veſſel.</p>
            <p>Scarce had he uttered theſe words, when caſting my eyes towards the Ocean I beheld the ſhip that contained all my worldly joys, going before the wind with full ſails. I gave orders to ſeveral veſſels to follow this pirate; but all things agreed to further his eſcape. The night became exceeding dark, and there aroſe a mighty ſtorm, ſo that he was conveyed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known parts, far from my own country. This, Sir, is one reaſon I cannot accord with your maſter's deſires; and the other is, were ſhe here I could not without breach of honor break my promiſe to Cordelio."</p>
            <p>Here, continued Willifred, the king ended his ſtory, which I hearkened unto with aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; at laſt recollecting my ſpirits, Sir, replied I, before I proceed, tell me one thing truly, I ſee you prize Orſamus's virtues at their full value, ſhould his birth be as illuſtrious as his virtues, would you deny him your daught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in marriage. Would I? replied the king— could I be ſo fortunate, his perſon and merits, would be the firſt to gain my breaſt. I was much ſatisfied at the freeneſs of his diſcourſe, and returned to him this anſwer, Know, Sir,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033593_0105_0FF79815D1B737A0"/>
Orſamus is of royal blood, ſecond ſon to my maſter, the king of Northumbers, by caſualty ſhipwrecked on your coaſt; I gave a relation of what already you have heard, and told him I would return to my maſter, to give him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of thoſe many ſtrange adventures, from whence I would ſet out with a ſhip well manned in purſuit of the pirate.</p>
            <p>He ſeemed highly pleaſed at what I propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſpeedily fitted out the ſhip we are now in, diſpatching this noble commander to aſſiſt in the recovery of his daughter. The wind blowing fair we put off from ſhore, and gave farewel to the king. In fine, we had a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſage into our own country, where I land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and gave your father an account of your fate. Your father rejoiced much at the hope of your ſafety, according with the king of Kent in all his requeſts; for they were equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in each others diſaſters.</p>
            <p>Hardly were commands iſſued for a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but a ſhip that came into our harbour brought news that Almerin was off at ſea, and that they narrowly eſcaped his hands; this opportunity would admit of no delay, which this brave captain conceiving, haſtened our departure; in a moment the ſhip was ſtrongly manned with our own men, who freely offered their lives to redeem their prince; myſelf, tho' age would have excuſed it, accompanied
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:033593_0106_0FF79817617DBEE8"/>
this noble man, the thought of your welfare extinguiſhing the imagination of my own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; thus we made off to ſea, accompanied with one ſhip more, which was ſevered from us in the late ſtorm. Four days had not yet paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince I left my own country, in which time heaven had been ſo kind to make us your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver! Now what remains but that we return to your father.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe being ended, Orſamus and Cynthia left the cabin, whoſe beauty was the admiration of all that did behold her, and claimed obedience as a tribute from all hearts; and the reſpects there ſhewn her were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to thoſe ſhe received in her father's court. After a ſhort conſultation, it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſtear for Northumberland; the ſhips were then cleared; Almerin's body, with the reſt, was committed to the waves, and this was the miſerable end of that wretched man.</p>
            <p>A fair and pleaſant gale ſoon waſted them to their native ſhore, where being arrived, they made themſelves known to the king, who was almoſt raviſhed with joy at the ſight of his long loſt ſon; his brother careſſed him, his friends welcomed him, nor could there be a parallel to his entertainment. Cynthia had ſuch reſpects paid her as were peculiar to ſo rare a creature; ſuch deep impreſſions can virtue make on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minds. Becauſe they would not diſturb
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:033593_0107_0FF7981909CA8FB0"/>
their happineſs by a ſudden journey, they ſent a meſſenger to the king of Kent, to certify him of his daughter's ſafety, and to give him advice, that in a few days time Oſwin would be with him in Doroborina, accompanied with his too ſons, and his fair daughter Cynthia, to celebrate Orſamus's nuptials; the meſſenger was received with all joy and reſpect, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were made on all parts for a triumphant entrance; at the time limited Oſwin came and was received with acclamations of joy. They had a ſplendid attendance to the palace, where Cynthia threw herſelf into her father's arms, and they embraced with tears of mutual glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The marriage was deferred no longer than the next week, when Orſamus received Cynthia from the hands of the old king, as the beſt reward of his ſervices and valour. They lived in felicity, and, as a cruel winter makes a lovely ſpring, ſo the adverſity through which they had paſſed, added to their new ſcenes of pleaſure.</p>
