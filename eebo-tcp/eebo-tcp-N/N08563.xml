            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE chief Deſign of our Exiſtence, is high and noble; worthy of a God
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010950_0004_0F85307F8FDEB6B0"/>
to have, in making his Creature Man, and of our utmoſt attention and ſolicitude to reach unto it. As God, in his Works, could not have an higher End, than his own Glory, and his Creature's good; we are not in all our Life and Service, to ſtop at a lower; but, ever keep it in view, to riſe up unto it, in the exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that excellent and important Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs aſſigned us; which, it ſeems, even the apoſtacy of Man, and malice of Satan; is not an irremoveable Bar in the Way of: When; ſovereign Grace in Chriſt, has open'd the Way of our recovery unto it, and the happineſs connected with it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then, thus revives in the World, and Heaven again opens to View; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Goſpel of God our Saviour, which brings life and immortality to light. I ſay, this Buſineſs, is yet to occupy the chief Room in the whole courſe of our life here, that it may gloriouſly fill an Eternity hereafter. But for which, how could it have been worth while for Man to exiſt, that rational, conſcious Creature, that he is; capable of a connexion and communion with God.</p>
               <p>BUT, how ſhort a Time has Man, as a probationer for a better State of exiſtence?
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010950_0005_0F8530810DBBDE80"/>
which, the Apoſtle in our Text, appears to have a clear and affecting View of; as he counted ſhortly to put off the Tabernacle of the fleſh; and have done preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt, that delightful Buſineſs of the better part of his Life. Man's Life is <hi>ſoon cut off;</hi> and <hi>he flys away</hi> to yonder World of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits—So that, the whole run of Buſineſs here, of this and that kind; is ſhort, and ſoon over, with Time; which, haſtens to an end. But, ſhort as Time is, (always on the wing,) it is long enough to reach unto, and introduce Eternity; which, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follows upon the ſhorteſt Life that is. We therefore, had need be early adorn'd with God's Image, and the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Righteouſneſs; and by the Grace of God, fill up our Time well; to be ready for the important Change of States and Worlds for ever. The very Thing, the Apoſtle preſſed in the courſe of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and experienc'd in the Caſe of his own Soul. And, while we are ſpared in Life; may it be, as <hi>God ſpareth a Son to ſerve him.</hi> For, it is a forfeited Life, that is ſpared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which carries in it, the greater obligation on us, to ſpend it well, as the fruit of having dedicated it, and our ſelves unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010950_0006_0F853081CF6EC288"/>
VERY juſtly may each one of us ſay; <hi>having obtained help of God, I continue unto this Day.</hi> Yea, in the midſt of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, dangers and deaths; and that, which is more; notwithſtanding all our Offences. For, if in any ſingle Moment, God had withdrawn his Care, in that Moment, we had retired from Life.</p>
               <p>BUT, more eſpecially, may I adopt the Words, <hi>having obtained help,</hi> &amp;c. with an animated Gratitude, to the great <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Men: who in the riches of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,</hi> hath continued me, (through many Years infirmity in former Life, and many ſcenes of heavy Trial in the greater part of Life) into the <hi>Seventy-fourth</hi> Year of my Age; with confirmed Health, in ſome late Years. A rare Inſtance of ſignal Mercy. <hi>A Wonder to many,</hi> moſt juſtly ſo to <hi>my ſelf:</hi> more eſpecially, as through Grace, I have been carried along to the completion of half a Century, in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry—<hi>Selah</hi>—Pauſe a little here, Oh my Soul; and acknowledge him in all this, who is <hi>glorious in Holineſs, fearful in Praiſes, doing Wonders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now juſtly looking forward to the cloſe of my Life and Miniſtry; which is gathering in apace upon me: And, with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010950_0007_0F85308667155B18"/>
this argument before me; to animate me, by the grace of God, to fill up the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of my Days, with the important Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion and of my Station; I have thought it my Duty, to take this public Notice of God's great Goodneſs, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing me in ſome Meaſure capable of public Buſineſs, to ſo remarkable a Period. A kind of <hi>Jubilee</hi> for rejoicing in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs; and for Liberty yet to ſerve the moſt High in his Church. Verily, this Day, is <q>Witneſs for God that he is good, and doeth good.</q> This Day, the laſt Sabbath of the <hi>Fiftieth</hi> Year in Office; may be noted indeed, as an <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> indicating that <hi>hitherto the Lord hath helped me:</hi> And may ſerve both as a Memorial, and Monitor unto me. I ſay, a <hi>Remembrancer</hi> of God's Mercy to me, and a <hi>Monitor</hi> of my Obligation to him; to be indeed, more than ever devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Service. With which view, I have choſen the Words read, to improve to the Glory of God, and to my own Advantage and your's.</p>
               <p>THIS Apoſtle, who in his ſecond Epiſtle, inſerts theſe important, affecting Paſſages, which I have read; had been faithful in <hi>preaching</hi> the very goſpel, ſo worthy of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010950_0008_0F8530871A7EB700"/>
their Attention and Remembrance; to whom he <hi>wrote.</hi> And then, he didn't think he had done enough, without <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding</hi> them of theſe Things; and doing all that was proper to <hi>fix</hi> them in their Minds for laſting Profit: And therefore, ſays, <q>I will not be negligent always to put you in Remembrance of theſe Things:</q> The very Doctrines, and great Things of the Goſpel, which he had delivered to them. And they (ſome of them) had a good knowledge of, and at preſent appeared well eſtabliſhed in them; yet, this, he thinks to be the Work of his remaining Days, to be bringing them to their Remembrance; and one great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he had to excite him unto it; was his View of the ſmall remains of Life now before him, and ſwift approach of Death, which, by revelation had been ſhewed him. And therefore, adds, a pathetic <q>
                     <hi>Moreover,</hi> I will endeavour that you may be able after my deceaſe, to have theſe Things always in Remembrance,</q> i. e. as long as they ſhould live after him; they might, by his faithfulneſs to them now, be profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; yea, carry the good favour thereof, to their own Grave, and find the unſpeakable Benefit of it, beyond all Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010950_0009_0F8530880BC5CF28"/>
Whence, I collect theſe OBSERVATIONS.</p>
               <p>I. 'TIS the Character of a good Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and faithful in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; to be in the courſe of his Miniſtry, preaching the <hi>great Doctrines and Duties</hi> of the Goſpel: inſiſting chiefly <hi>on them</hi> for the ſaving good of Men's Souls.</p>
               <p>II. WHEN he hath done this, in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Miniſtry; yet, he is not to neglect proper Means to refreſh their Memories herewith, to impreſs them deep on their Hearts.</p>
               <p>III. HE is accordingly to fill up the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of his Days, very much to this Purpoſe. And,</p>
               <p>IV. FROM this Conſideration, that he cannot live long to do this Service. And,</p>
               <p>V. FOR this End, are Miniſters to exert themſelves; that their Hearers may reap the Advantage of it after their deceaſe.</p>
               <p>I. I obſerve, 'tis the Character of a good Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and faithful in his Service; to be in the Courſe of his Miniſtry, preaching the great <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Duties of the Goſpel,</hi> inſiſting chiefly on them for the ſaving good of Men's Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010950_0010_0F85308898591BC8"/>
THE Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> as alſo <hi>Paul</hi> and others did ſo. When, God had <q>put them into the Miniſtry, as counting them faithful,</q> they ſpent their Life in it. And ſo have others, down to this Day; who were of the right Stamp: <q>giving themſelves, (as charg'd) to reading and meditation, on thoſe Things,</q> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the important Buſineſs of their Office; <q>ſtudying to ſhew themſelves approved of God,</q> and unto Men's Conſciences; <q>as Workmen that need not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, rightly dividing the Word of Truth;</q> which is yet, and always will be the Character of true and faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel. Our Apoſtle here, in what is ſaid of him, in his Epiſtles, is a good Pattern indeed, for imitation, through all Ages.</p>
               <p>IN his firſt Epiſtle he diſcourſeth of the great <hi>Doctrines of Grace</hi>—of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> unto Life, <q>according to the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of God the Father, through ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the Blood of Chriſt.</q> ver. 2.—of <hi>Regeneration</hi> by the Spirit of God, as the ſole Author; while the Word is the well choſen and appointed Means thereof: as here declared to be <q>according to his

abundant Mercy, that he hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt from the dead.</q> v. 3. to the ſame Purpoſe with that moſt expreſs paſſage in Jam. 1. 18. <q>Of his own Will begat he us, with the Word of Truth.</q>—And of <hi>Perſeverance</hi> unto Life; as is declared in v. 4, 5. that the Regenerate <q>who are born to an heavenly Inheritance, are kept by the mighty Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</q>—And this we find alſo; in his preaching the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Doctrines of the Goſpel; that he omits not, but inſiſts upon the <hi>ſacrifice of Chriſt, upon the Croſs,</hi> the all-availing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his whole obedience; for our <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> unto Life, ſee ver. 11, 19.</p>
               <p>As alſo the great <hi>Duties of the Goſpel,</hi> are what he much inculcates. As, that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <q>do gird up the Loins of their Minds, be ſober and hope to the End, for the Grace, that is to be brought to them, at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. As obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Children, not faſhioning themſelves according to the former Luſts, in their Ignorance; but, as he which hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them is holy; ſo that they be holy in all Manner of Converſation and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; paſſing the Time of their Sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010950_0012_0F85308A1DA320B0"/>
here in fear.</q> ver. 13,—17. And if we look through his whole firſt Epiſtle into this; where, he ſpeaks particularly of <q>
                     <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God, and our Soviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt;</hi> which becomes our's by a precious Faith.</q> And where he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly preſſeth <hi>Diligence,</hi> in <q>adding to Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege;</q> and ſo on to the completion of the Chriſtian Character. And ſo, to <q>make our Calling and Election ſure.</q>—I ſay, if we view, what he has wrote clear thrô we ſhall find, what important <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> he inſiſted on; wherein, all faithful Miniſters, will in ſome good Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure follow him: Yes; all ſuch, will preach up free Grace—Chriſt Crucified—and Faith in him, &amp;c.—Hence,</p>
               <p>II. I OBSERVE, that when the faithful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, hath done this, in his former Miniſtry; ſtill, he doth by no Means, neglect proper Steps, to remind his People of theſe Things; for their deeper Impreſſion on their Hearts. It was ſo, with the Apoſtle, when he had preached the great Doctrines, and urged the great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Goſpel; and ſhown the vaſt Importance of them, with reſpect to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Comfort, and future Happineſs; He
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010950_0013_0F85308AD10F1890"/>
don't think, he had done enough; but ſays, as in the Text; <q>Wherefore, I will not be negligent to put, you always in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of theſe Things.</q>—<hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</hi> that is, becauſe of the great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Neceſſity of theſe Things, which I have taught in the Courſe of my Miniſtry heretofore; "I will not be Negligent,"—No; nothing ſhall make me ſo; nothing ſhall divert me from my duty, not any worldly Views and Motives; nor ſhall any Thing which mine Enemies throw in my Way, as an embarraſment to my Work; diſcourage me: Nor yet, that which looks the moſt Plauſible by way of Excuſe, to relax my Care in this Matter: (<abbr>viz.</abbr>) that "you do know theſe Things" already; and appear to be <q>eſtabliſhed, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Truth,</q> the labouring Truths of the Day; yet, I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of theſe Things: But will be frequently refreſhing your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories with them; and ſo endeavour by all Means, to keep theſe Things with you, to confirm you more and more in the faith of the Goſpel, and practice of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>So, faithful Miniſters to this Day, (as it is the Character of ſuch,) will not only, by preaching ſound Doctrine to their Hearers,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010950_0014_0F85308B93374408"/>
endeavour to inſtruct them well in the very Things of God, that they may know them well, and be eſtabliſhed therein, <q>in the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</q> &amp;c.—But, and though many of them, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready know them well, and profeſs to be well eſtabliſhed in them; they will yet inſiſt upon them over, and over; with freſh Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrations and Arguments, and every Way, they can properly take; be putting them in Remembrance hereof.</p>
               <p>III. I OBSERVE, that the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who hath ſerved long already, is to fill up the reſidue of his Days much to this purpoſe: Reminding his People of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Things, they have been taught. "I think it meet" (ſays the Apoſtle) fit and highly proper, <q>as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to ſtir you up, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you in Remembrance.</q> As if he had ſaid, Upon the moſt ſerious review of the Duty of my Office, of the importance of thoſe Things, I have taught you, and of your receiving them to ſaving Profit; it is my ſettled Thought and Reſolution; that as long as I live, I will exert my ſelf to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you, unto a freſh aſſent to the Truth, by a moſt impreſſive Review of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and worth thereof, that you might
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010950_0015_0F85308C5200F688"/>
better than ever yield Obedience unto it; that <q>you might not loſe, (or ſeem to loſe) what you have gained,</q> nor, any way fail of a right Chriſtian ſtedfaſtneſs in Faith and Duty. What the Apoſtle was after, by all his Pains in this Matter, was, that they be thorough, perſevering Chriſtians, and be excited abundantly to <q>exerciſe themſelves unto Godlineſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AND thus, will faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, in all Ages of the Church, do; not be content with preaching up moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Self-Government, Righteouſneſs, and Charity; but inſiſt much on the Subjects of chriſtian Revelation, as <hi>Paul,</hi> who would eſpecially preach <q>Chriſt and him Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</q> They will enter into the Marrow of the Goſpel, and dwell much upon the Words of Chriſt, that "are Spirit and Life." They will eſteem it fitting and neceſſary, that as long as they live, and can do it, to preach often upon Subjects of the greateſt Moment, and thereby be exciting their People to "obey the Truth:" (and more and more ſo,) in which conſiſts the Life of Religion. Oh; this "doing the Truth" as St. John expreſſes it, is what Crowns all, <q>If ye know theſe Things happy are ye if ye do them.</q> Thoſe who have
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010950_0016_0F85308D14D13D28"/>
ſome good Underſtanding of the Principles of Religion, and appear well ſet in the Practice thereof; do yet need <q>Line upon Line, to ſtir them up, even their pure Minds by Way of Remembrance,</q> in Order to better Practice.</p>
               <p>IV. I OBSERVE that Miniſters are to be faithful in all their Duty, from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſcanty Meaſure of their Opportunities for it; that they are not to live long, eſpecially, when the moſt of their Day is gone already. And ſo, will have but a little Time for this Service. Hence ſays the Apoſtle, <q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle to ſtir you up—knowing that <hi>ſhortly</hi> I muſt put off this Tabernacle, as the Lord Jeſus hath ſhewed me.</q> Some have had ſtrange premonitions of their Death, the near approach of it: But, there was ſomething more ſpecial in the Caſe of <hi>Peter;</hi> the Lord Jeſus had ſhewed him above 30 Years before, the <hi>Manner,</hi> if not the <hi>Time</hi> of his Death—See Joh. 21. 18, 19.—<q>When thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy Hand, &amp;c. This ſpake he, ſignifying by what Death he ſhould glorify God.</q> That is, by dying on the Croſs, in which, he was to follow Chriſt, die as he did; he
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010950_0017_0F85308DD46F6A30"/>
was, in the Day, when Chriſt ſpake theſe Words to him, very confident, that he could follow Chriſt any where, even to Death. This was Self-confidence, and failed him; that, inſtead of <hi>dying</hi> with Chriſt, he <hi>deny'd</hi> him over and over, before Chriſt came to die himſelf: But <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents of this; and after his Recovery, has a better kind of Confidence and Courage: ſo that, when called to ſuffer <hi>Martyrdom</hi> for Chriſt, as the Lord told him he ſhould, <hi>he ſtretched forth his Hands,</hi> freely yielded to be Crucified, which was at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the cruel Perſecution of <hi>Nero,</hi> but a little after he wrote theſe Epiſtles; Anno Dom. 65. or 66. For then he was grown old, when the Lord Jeſus ſaid he ſhould be Crucified. So that he might well ſay now, "I muſt ſhortly put off this Tabernacle." 'Tis obſerv'd by Hiſtorians, the exact Time is not aſcertain'd, but, by all Accounts, might not be far from 67. or 68. and ſome ſay, at the ſame Time, yea, the very Day, that <hi>Paul</hi> was beheaded there, by <hi>Nero,</hi> for converting one of his Concubines to the Chriſtian Faith. Which Death, <hi>he</hi> might have ſome previous Warning of, or at leaſt, of the near approach of Death, in ſome Form; when he ſays, <hi>The Time of my
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010950_0018_0F85308F82DF9498"/>
departure is at Hand:</hi> And <hi>both</hi> of them, aware of this; did exert themſelves the more, to do all the good they could, whilſt they liv'd and had Opportunity for it.—</p>
               <p>THUS faithful Miniſters ſince; in the View of their uncertain, but ſhort Stay at the longeſt, may well be excited to Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in their Maſter's Work: eſpecially, if they have liv'd long already: as their old Age then, (without a ſpecial Revelation from the Lord Jeſus) ſpeaks the near Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of their Death, When a Miniſter is far advanced in Life, to Three-ſcore Years and Ten, or more, he muſt needs know, that ſhortly, he ſhall put off this Tabernacle; and reſign Office and Life; and all Opportunity here, of doing good. For of ſuch an Age, it is juſtly and aptly ſaid; <hi>It is ſoon cut off, and we fly away,</hi> Pſal. 90. 10. It is ſomething as the Sun, when paſt the Meridian, (and in ſhort Days too) it ſuddenly ſhoots down, and Sets at once. So the Life of an old Man, far paſt the Meridian, haſtens a-pace to the Cloſe, and is ſuddenly up, and gone. But, no improving the ſmall remains of Life, ſo well, as by filling it up with Duty to God, and Uſefulneſs to Men; and the more chearfully, as our Days draw on a-pace to a Period.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010950_0019_0F8530900EA36BD8"/>
IT is the Character, and will be the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, of faithful Miniſters, to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in Study and Diligence, in all the Exerciſes of their Office, that they can; <q>to fulfil the Miniſtry which they have received of the Lord Jeſus.</q> And en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to the laſt, the beſt good of their Charge. A Miniſter of Chriſt, is to be eminently like <q>the Sun that rejoiceth as a ſtrong Man to run his Race,</q> and <hi>Shines</hi> as he <hi>goes;</hi> even till he <hi>Sets.</hi> When a good Miniſter's Days, and Time, contracts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace; and his Thoughts grow more Weighty; and full of Religion, and of the World he's going to; his Zeal encreaſes; and according to his Capacity, he will be truly <hi>fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. FOR this End, are Miniſters to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert themſelves, and the faithful will do ſo; that their Hearers may reap the Advantage of it, after their Deceaſe. As the Apoſtle here adds, <q>Moreover, I will endeavour, that you may be able, after my Deceaſe, to have theſe Things always <hi>in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>This Word,</hi> is much uſed by the Apoſtle, as if very Significative and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical; like the <hi>Burthen</hi> of a Song; which has the carrying Sound with it, and the leading Sentiments expreſs'd by it: which,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010950_0020_0F85309373B2CD60"/>
indeed is the Caſe here. Not enough (it ſeems) that People know, and are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in the Truth: To be ſure, not enough that they have a ſpeculative View of it, and have a rational Belief of it; but, they muſt Remember it; have it always ready, as <hi>Food</hi> to feed upon conſtantly, and as a <hi>Rule</hi> always to live by. They muſt attend to it, not for preſent Amuſement, or to be pleaſed juſt while they are hearing a good Sermon; but attend to it, as <hi>Lydia</hi> did to the Things ſpoken by <hi>Paul;</hi> attend to the very Important Things ſpoken of, with a View of having them impreſt on their Minds, fix'd there, for laſting Good; which, you ſee the Apoſtle was greatly concerned about: and therefore, inſiſts upon it here, as he doth. <q>I <hi>will not</hi> be negligent,</q> (a ſtrong way of expreſſing his Care in this Matter) <q>to put you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Remembrance of theſe Things.</q> Again, <q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to ſtir you up, by putting you in Remembrance;</q> ah, and exert my ſelf in this; becauſe, I know, that in a little Time I can do it no more; Therefore, while I live, <q>I will endeavour that you be able, after my Deceaſe, to have theſe Things always in your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</q>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:010950_0021_0F8530946302B520"/>
Thus, he dwells upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as a very main Thing with him, and what ſhould be ſo with us; elſe we read and hear, as if we did it not; nor were like to be the better. The Apoſtle, (it ſeems) in the very decline of Life, juſt as he was finiſhing his Miniſtry, was laying in greatly for the future Advantage of Men's Souls; that, when he was dead and gone, they might be able to have thoſe Things in Remembrance, which they had heard. And ſo always, as long as they liv'd after him, be reaping the good of his Sermons and Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>THUS, faithful Miniſters now, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they come to the finiſhing their Courſe; will be the more concern'd for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their dear Charge; that after their Deceaſe, their Hearers, may be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect what they have been taught; have it preſent with them, and fix'd in their Minds to their beſt and laſting Advantage; (that is) well grounded in Faith and Love, never to be <q>moved away, from the hope of the Goſpel.</q> Therefore, they will Pray and Preach, Converſe and Live, in a good Meaſure as Perſons looking into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. They will treat important Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with great Plainneſs and Solemnity,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010950_0022_0F853095180421E0"/>
and as much perſpicuity and openneſs to Men's Underſtandings, as they can: ſpeak with Pathos and Concern to have theſe Things well receiv'd and fix'd in their Minds, and their Faith in them Eſtabliſh'd,—This, good Miniſters love to ſee much of, and of the probability of its exiſting after they are gone. Oh, how careful that their People do not forſake the right Ways of the Lord, that they be not Wavering, and driven to and fro, by every Wind of Doctrine, after their Deceaſe; but by an exemplary Soundneſs in the Faith, be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſecure from Declenſion in any Thing of Religion; or true Comfort and the Peace of religious Society and Chriſtian Communion. It was very Affecting to St. Paul, what he told his Hearers, and knew, <abbr>viz,</abbr> 
                  <q>That after his Departure, grievous Wolves wou'd enter in among them not ſparing the Flock, and that of their own ſelves, would Men ariſe, ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Things, to draw away Diſciples after them.</q> See Acts 20, 29, 30. But, yet he would do all he could, (to prevent this as much as might be,) in not ſhunning to declare the whole Counſel of God. As he ſays in v. 27.—And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> would do, all he could, that People
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010950_0023_0F85309552E56ED0"/>
might have what he taught them, always in Remembrance: To continue ſound in the Faith, and ſtedfaſt in the Order of the Goſpel.—</p>
               <p>AND thus faithful Miniſters down to this Day, will Study hard, Pray earneſtly, Preach clearly and powerfully; yea, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and Argue, and do all they can, to inſtruct the People in the very Truth, as it is in Jeſus; the very Faith and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel, and to eſtabliſh them therein; by having all that done for them, which, by the bleſſing of God ſhall enable them to have the Things of God and Jeſus Chriſt, always in Remembrance; as the Matter of their Faith, and Guide of their Practice, from Generation to Generation; that, a right Scriptural Religion, and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Order, may live on, to all ſucceeding Time. AMEN.</p>

               <head>PART II. THE APPLICATION, with ſomething HISTORICAL.</head>
               <p>1. USE, FROM hence it appears, that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Life, is ſet at a great Diſtance
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010950_0024_0F85309685138B98"/>
from Indolence; admits of but little Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Scarce any Man's Life ſo cloſely fill'd up with Duty and Exerciſe; not only of the ſtated Worſhip of God in Public, with diligent Reading and Study to prepare for that; but much of a more private Kind, viſiting the Diſtreſſed in their various Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; one <hi>Sick</hi> here, and another <hi>Dying</hi> there, and many Caſes of Individuals to attend unto; that it may be eminently ſaid of a Miniſter's Work, that <hi>'tis never done,</hi> as long as he lives, and is capable of it; and that old Age, will not excuſe him from Application; while God keeps up his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for it.—His Work is great <hi>all his Life through,</hi> as he is to be <q>giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to theſe Things,</q> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the miniſterial Office, that he may <q>fulfil the Miniſtry, he has received of the Lord Jeſus,</q> inſtructing Men truly in the great Points of Religion, and labouring both their Edification and Eſtabliſhment in the Truth, &amp;c. And when he comes near the cloſe of his Life and Miniſtry; how deſirable, that this be adorn'd with the moſt evident Marks of Grace, of Faithfulneſs and Succeſs. Thus, tho' <q>his Beginning was Small, to have his latter End greatly Increaſed</q> is Glorious: And even in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010950_0025_0F853096D5763F58"/>
his cloſing Days, he muſt not be negligent to put his People in Remembrance of thoſe Things, they have heard; inſiſt upon them over and over, with new Illuſtrations and more Proof, to fix them deep in their Minds; and ſo to ſtir them up moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to the Chriſtian Life: Yea, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all Means, they have theſe Things always in Remembrance, ready at Hand, for their own perſonal Benefit, and for the Defence of the Truth againſt Gainſayers. And though the Miniſter is ſhortly to put off this Tabernacle, and he has much to do, before it is diſſolv'd, thrô Grace, to dreſs up with the Garments of Salvation, to ſtand compleat in Chriſt; waiting his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to go, when called, as a Servant wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Order of his Maſter; yet, even then, when drawing near, to finiſh his Courſe; he muſt endeavour, to impreſs the Minds of his Hearers with the great Things of the Goſpel; that they be able, after his Deceaſe, to have them always in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>II. USE. WE learn from the Premiſes, the great Duty of thoſe that live under the Goſpel, to attend faithfully to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. If Miniſters muſt give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Work, and be all the Time
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010950_0026_0F853097C381B868"/>
faithful in it; who then may, for trifling Excuſes, forbear to attend unto a preached Goſpel, or be inattentive to it, when they do attend. If the Miniſter muſt not, by any Means, be negligent to put his People always in Remembrance of pure Goſpel; but it is of ſo much Worth to them, that he muſt be always ſetting it before them, as long as he lives; that they may not fail of the Benefit of it, when he can ſpeak no more to them? then ſurely, it claims their moſt diligent Attention now, to have it ever with them. Oh think of it, with reſpect to the Doctrine of free-forgiveneſs of Sin, and Juſtification unto Life, by the all-avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Atonement, and perfect Obedience of Chriſt. May this be diſregarded? Is this ever to be forgotten? or wholly out of Mind one Day? Can we paſs a Day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin? and what they do, one Day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Saviour, and unleſs we have theſe Things always in Remembrance? Very worthy then, of our Attention, with the View of laying them up in our Mind and Heart: Yes, ſurely; if the Apoſtle in the cloſe of Life; when his Thoughts would be ſo full of his own perſonal Concerns; gathering in all needful Comfort in the View of Death; I ſay, if yet he eſteem it
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010950_0027_0F853098610CB950"/>
his Duty, and think it meet to lay out ſo much of the precious remains of his Time, for this End; to ſtir up others' Minds by way of Remembrance, and to the laſt; endeavour that they be able, after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, to Profit by his Miniſtry, by having theſe Things, he was teaching them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Remembrance, ready for Uſe in Meditation, in Prayer, in religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, &amp;c. for ſtrengthning of their Faith and Hope in God? Certainly then, this teacheth People to attend conſtantly and well on the Word preached; and to hear, as for their Lives; while they may; and with a View of their reaping the Advantage of it, after their Miniſter is gone from the Pulpit, to the Grave.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010950_0028_0F85309929E60F18"/>
ſpoken: And deſirable it is, to have a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Subjects, within the Compaſs of Orthodoxy and great Moment; and well handled. Yet, (I ſay,) to have ſuch a Thirſt for Novelty, as not to Care, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what we hear, be <hi>True,</hi> if it be but <hi>New,</hi> or to nauſeate old Truths, meerly becauſe we have heard them, and known them before; is very wrong; and favours much of a vain Mind. The Apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Men to know the Truth, and to be eſtabliſhed therein; and yet, to need being "put in Remembrance thereof." Men of pure Minds, may need, and be greatly Profited by this. So that, an Itch for new Things, for the ſake of Novelty, is a vain Curioſity. Our Text will juſtify a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's inſiſting much upon what the Apoſtle means by <hi>theſe Things,</hi> theſe important Doctrines, &amp;c. which are to be <hi>brought to Remembrance;</hi> and going over with them again and again, in the Courſe of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; But, the <hi>more</hi> with new turns of Thought and Expreſſion, to the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; to rivet theſe Things in Men's Minds; and the <hi>more</hi> with new illuſtrations and enforcements of the Subjects, to give them a more lively Impreſſion on the Heart; <hi>the better.</hi> This is all well: and what
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010950_0029_0F853099D04999F8"/>
the Apoſtle intends, by putting Men that had heard the Goſpel, always in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the ſame Things for Subſtance; which they had known and believed before.</p>
               <p>IV. USE. If there be ſo much Streſs laid upon putting People in Remembrance of the important Things, they had heard; that the Apoſtle thought it meet to do it, as long as he lived; and however much he had done at inſtructing them well, in the Courſe of his Miniſtry; yet, and in the cloſe of his Life, to make it his Buſineſs, to put them in Remembrance of theſe Things; then it follows, as a juſt Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renee, that there are many, who, after a Sort, hear them now; that think little of their Excellence, and of the vaſt Importance of their attending duly unto them, to lay them up for their Advantage hereafter. I ſay, think little of this, through the long Day of their Opportunity; ah, little of this, till their Day is over, not only for hearing them, from this, or that Miniſter; but for attending to them at all. For, they let the Candle of their Life, under the Means of Grace, ſweal away, by their own abuſe and neglect thereof. O how reprehenſory and awakning is this? that the Apoſtle,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010950_0030_0F85309AD9EC90F0"/>
in the ſhort Time he had to live, before he muſt ſuffer Martyrdom, and die on the Croſs; I ſay, the ſhort Time he had now, when old; to think of this, and have his own Heart well brac'd up to meet it; and be in the moſt ample readineſs for Heaven: That yet, even then, he wou'd endeavour by all Means, that others, after his Deceaſe, always have theſe Things in Remembrance, to their own everlaſting Advantage. Verily it reproves, and may juſtly ſtartle ſuch, as do yet, after all Means uſed with them, <hi>neglect the great Salvation,</hi> and ſtupidly ſpend their Life in Sin; or in worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, to the neglect of <hi>the one Thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. USE. WE ſee here, what is one great End of all good Preaching the Word, and Writing on divine Subjects: It is, <hi>to excite Men to right Practice,</hi> the Apoſtle's Aim in all he ſaid and wrote; inſtructing People in the Truth, and putting them in Remembrance of thoſe Things which they had been taught; was <hi>to ſtir them up,</hi> to their Duty, to receive the Truth moſt fully into their Hearts, and obey it in all Things; to excite in them a juſt Concern, to be approved of God as the upright. Yea, he neglected not to ſtir up the pureſt Minds
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010950_0031_0F85309B5F445178"/>
by way of Remembrance: to put them upon exerciſing themſelves unto Godlineſs in all the lovely Branches of it; to love God ſupremely, to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſimplicity, and moſt exemplary godly ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and to love one another fervently; and thus, <hi>fulfil the Law of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WELL now, having giv'n ſome Account, from our Text, of the Duty of Chriſt's Miniſters, in the Courſe of their Miniſtry to be inſiſting on the great Doctrines and Duties of the Goſpel: and yet in the cloſe of their Life, to be putting People in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of theſe Things. May I not on this Occaſion, in the FIRST PLACE, humbly ſay, That through the Grace of God, <hi>I have not ſhunned</hi> 
                  <q>to declare the whole Counſel of God unto you.</q> Are you not my Witneſſes, that in ſome good Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I have preach'd both <hi>the Law</hi> and <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> in their Place, and with their Views. The <hi>Law</hi> as the great Means of convincing Men of their Sin and Miſery; as by it, is <hi>the knowlege of Sin.</hi> And as the Rule of Life, the obligations of which, being Moral and of perpetual Force, yet lie upon us; and in this View, fitted to give Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of <hi>Sin;</hi> as <hi>that,</hi> is the want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto, and Tranſgreſſion thereof:—
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010950_0032_0F85309C16195D28"/>
And preach'd the <hi>Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as "the Grace of God bringing Salvation," opening and proving the great Doctrines of Grace—the nature and neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation—the only Way of Forgiveneſs and Juſtification by the atonement and obedience of Chriſt, <q>the Lord our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</q>—together with the neceſſity of Holineſs, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IN the <hi>next Place,</hi> obſerve, this is ſtill my Duty (as aforeſaid) to put you in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of theſe Things: Which I truſt, you will (every Way) incourage me in; that you may be able, after my Deceaſe, to have them in Remembrance, to your own Advantage. The Reaſons to urge me to Faithfulneſs in this, are chiefly the Glory of God and your Salvation; which are intimately concerned herein. But then, my Life and Opportunity, which remains for this; is very ſhort; and my Concern for you, after I am gone, ne'er the leſs. Beſure, that you hold faſt the Faith and Order of the Goſpel, and be well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in the Truth, and obedient to it; you and your Children after you. God only knows, how it will be with you hereafter. But I think it meet, as long as I am with you; and in a Meaſure capable of it, to ſtir
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010950_0033_0F85309D78DA7950"/>
you up, to all Attention and Regard to the Truth, by putting you in Remembrance thereof; that you may never be eaſy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſound, pious, learned, faithful, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearching and edifying Miniſtry: The which, you will the more likely be bleſſed with; by how much the better Attention and Regard, you give to divine important Things now; and have them well fixed in your Minds, for the eſtabliſhment of <q>your Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</q> For, the manifeſt Declenſion of a People in Point of Principles and Practice, in one Generation; makes Way for a growing Corruption thereof in the following Generations.</p>
               <p>FOR AS MUCH then, as it is my Duty, in ſome Imitation of the Apoſtle, to ſtir up your Minds, (even the pureſt of them) by Way of Remembrance of theſe Things, to fix and eſtabliſh you well in them; you will ſuffer me to Remark upon the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>this Remembrance,</hi> which is a Kind of <hi>Capital Word,</hi> in Scripture; much uſed there, as expreſſing what is of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>AS for Inſtance; what is the <hi>doing</hi> this and that, at the Lord's Supper, eating of the Bread, and drinking of the Cup there,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010950_0034_0F85309E2D6C8E28"/>
without doing this, <hi>in Remembrance</hi> of Chriſt? This, is eſſential to the Duty of attending that Inſtitution, and to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, The Words which Chriſt had ſpoke (to the Diſciples) in his Sermons, (it ſeems) muſt be brought to <hi>their Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:</hi> elſe, they don't fully Anſwer their Deſign. See John 14. 26. <q>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter—He ſhall teach you all Things, and bring all Things <hi>to your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> whatſoever I have ſaid to you,</q> that ye may have a more juſt and full Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them, and be more Profited by them. And how did the Diſciples fail of their Duty, and Suffer by <hi>not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring</hi> Chriſt's Words, reſpecting his Death and Reſurrection, to apply them, for the ſtrengthning of their Faith in him, &amp;c. But, when they <hi>recalled</hi> his Words, they anſwered the Purpoſes for which they were uttered. When Chriſt ſaid, <q>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this Temple, (meaning his Body) and I will raiſe it up again the Third Day,</q> at firſt his Diſciples underſtood it not: But when he was riſen from the dead, then <q>
                     <hi>they remembred</hi> his Words, and believ'd the Scripture,</q> and were confirmed in his being the MESSIAH. Joh.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010950_0035_0F85309F1B3CCF10"/>
2. 22. And when he was going up to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem in a kind of Triumph, amidſt the Hoſannas of the People, he obſerv'd to his Diſciples a Paſſage of Prophecy, that related to him; <q>Fear not Daughter of Zion, thy King cometh ſitting on an Aſs's Colt.</q>—<q>Now, theſe Things underſtood not his Diſciples at the firſt; but, when Jeſus was Glorified, then <hi>remembred they,</hi> that theſe Things were Written of him,</q> and ſo were Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Joh. 12. 16. Thus <hi>were</hi> they, and Oh how many ſince <hi>are help'd</hi> in a diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Hour, by <hi>remembring Chriſt's Sayings.</hi> Ah! and brought to Repentance too by this Means—After <hi>Peter</hi> had denied Chriſt moſt ſhamefully, he is brought to Repentance, as <q>
                     <hi>he called to Mind</hi> the Word, that Jeſus ſaid unto him, Before the Cock crow Twice, thou ſhalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me Thrice; and when he thought thereon he Wept bitterly.</q> And how is Repentance a genuine Thing in any, without calling to Remembrance our Sins: And what is Iſrael's God to them; who <hi>forget him?</hi> or what the Moſt High to ſuch Youth, as <hi>remember him not</hi> ſo much, as in the Character of <hi>Creator?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, What ſays <hi>Paul</hi> of the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010950_0036_0F85309FCD756B58"/>
of <hi>a good Miniſter?</hi> See 1 Tim. 4. 6. <q>If thou put the Brethren <hi>in Remembrance</hi> of theſe Things, thou ſhalt be a good Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt.</q> And <hi>Peter</hi> you ſee, was eminently this good Miniſter: For, he would not be Negligent in this Matter by any Means; but, as long as he was in the Body, wou'd be ſtirring up People by putting them <hi>in Remembrance</hi> of thoſe Things, and do all that he could, that after his Deceaſe, they might <hi>not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> them. The good Opinion he had of ſome; that they knew, and were eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Truth, did not relax his Care of this Matter; yea, however much Charity he had for ſome, as Chriſtians of great Simplicity, yet he writes theſe Epiſtles, as he ſays, 2 Pet. 3. 1. <q>To ſtir up their <hi>pure Minds by way of Remembrance.</hi>
                  </q> So that it is verily ſomething of great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is here intended, and what every Miniſter is to be engaged in; and the rather, as the import of the Word, is ſo Magnified in Acts 10. 31. <q>Thine Alms are had in <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
                  </q> God Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members and Rewards them. And in Rev. 16. 19. <q>Babylon came into <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> before God.</q> He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred her Sins to Puniſh them. And if
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010950_0037_0F8530A08CFD60E0"/>
the Moſt High, repreſents himſelf, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring Men's Virtues and their Vices; to Reward the one, and Puniſh the other? then ſurely, we are to call to Mind our Sins, to repent of them in Seaſon, and eſcape Puniſhment: And to remember our Duty, what God ſays to us in his Word, to excite us to embrace the Faith of the Goſpel, to believe in Chriſt, and be careful to maintain good Works; to obtain, thrô Grace in Chriſt, the Reward of the Faithful.</p>
               <p>THESE Hints, reſpecting <hi>Remembrance,</hi> I have given to ſhew, that 'tis not enough, that we <hi>read</hi> and <hi>hear the Word,</hi> and appear to <hi>know it,</hi> and, be <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> therein; but we muſt <hi>have it always in Remembrance:</hi> as it were continually preſent with us. And to ſhew, that, 'tis no trifling Thing, which Miniſters urge and take Pains in, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <q>To ſtir up their Hearers, by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</q> The <hi>Memory,</hi> (a Faculty or Power of Recollection) is of vaſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Mind; well improv'd; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in Matters of Religion; as it looks up, and reviews what it had ſome Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of before; and now, by reviewing the ſame, hath deeper Impreſſions of it, made upon the Soul; and, to have <hi>Helps</hi> to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010950_0038_0F8530A453BF34D0"/>
as faithful Miniſters, (among others) to bring to Remembrance, is a great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. To be ſure, the Apoſtle thought ſo, when he judges it <q>meet, as long as he liv'd</q> to labour this Matter.</p>
               <p>AND not only is a Miniſter to put his People in Remembrance of the great <hi>Doctrines and Duties of Religion;</hi> but alſo, of the great <hi>Event of Death,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waits all Men, and firſt or laſt will open to every one, a moſt clear view of the Importance of thoſe Things.</p>
               <p>SOME have once <hi>a Year</hi> given to the Congregation, the Number of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, in <hi>that Term,</hi> for the awakning of the Living. For the ſame Purpoſe, I will now, as near as I can, count to you, the Numbers of the Deceaſed here, in the Courſe of 50 Years. And learn ye, ſomething, by the Voice from the Dead: i. e. <q>So to Number your Days, that you may apply your Hearts to Wiſdom.</q>

               <p>ACCORDING to ſome exact Account of the Deaths, in this Society, for a Number of Years together; including therein the extremes from 14 to 30 in a Year; it appears, there have Died of all Ages, about 20, in a Year, one with another.

And in ſuch Proportion as this:—From the Age of 70 and upwards, an 112. Of this firſt Claſs, many liv'd to above 80 Years; a few to above 90; and one,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. <hi>Abigail Lathrop,</hi> who lived into her 104th Year. And on the completion of an 100, ſhe had, at her Deſire, a Century Sermon preach'd at her Houſe, Jan. 13, 1732; when ſhe appeared a moſt rare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Piety and ſtrength of Mind.</note> to above an 100.—From the Age of 50, to 70, an 140; of this Claſs, many liv'd to above 60; and ſome, near 70.—From the Age of 30, to 50, there died, an 154: many of whom, as they died in the vigour of Life, ſo, in the midſt of growing Uſefulneſs; to the great Lamentation of Survivors.—From the Age of 20 to 30, about an 140: many of whom, were as hopeful, and promiſing to be great Bleſſings to the Church and Society, as thoſe who now fill important Places therein.—From the Age of 14 to 20, have died about 70; a Number of whom, had they been ſpared in Life, might have filled it <hi>eminently</hi> well, according as they were the Hope and Joy of the Generation, in which they liv'd.—From the Infant of Days, to 14, there have died about

390: Some of which appeared to have an uncommonly ſprightly Genius, and a promiſing turn of Mind; ſome of the moſt likely Branches of humane Nature, we had; full as Promiſing for their Age; as others, who are now, forward and uſeful in their's; who, if ſpared, might have been as great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in their Day, as any that now are ſo: which ſhews the great Loſs, the Public may ſuſtain in the Death of Children, as well as of Youth; in which Reſpect this Society has had great Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, made therein, not ſoon forgotten. Now, by the Account I have given of Deaths, in this Society, from the Year—17, to this—67, in the ſeveral Ages; you ſee the Amount of the whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is about 1000.—A great Number, for any one Perſon to have taken from his Charge by Death, and to have attended the Funeral of the greater Part of.</p>

THE firſt Set of <hi>aged People,</hi> are all gone long ago. Thus, in every Age, is the propriety of them Words kept up, "Your Fathers, where are they?" The next Set are almoſt all gone, after them; which we continually learn, is "the Way of all the Earth:" And indeed, when People arrive to Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and Ten, <hi>their Life is ſoon cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </q> ſo it has been; and may be even with the preſent Youth: Therefore, let them <q>Remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth.</q> Be early, and effectually Religious, have it fix'd in their Minds to be ſo.

               <p>'TIS now 51 Years, the 19th of laſt Month, O.

At the Time of my coming to Town, no ſmall Cloud of Diſcouragement, appeared in the Way of any one's peaceable Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, though moſtly gone off, before I ſettled; as the Difficulties on Account of the People's former Diviſions gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually abated to clear the Way. Thrô God's goodneſs, and the beſt Advice, I was wholly kept from intereſting my ſelf in thoſe Diviſions. And thoſe
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010950_0043_0F8530A824A560D0"/>
Words, <q>who made me a Judge, who made me a Divider?</q> were then, and ſince, a good Guard to me, againſt taking in, with a Party. And as all were united in my Settling here; ſo, (as I have often ſaid) I never could tell which, were moſt Friendly to me. The unhappy Diſcord that had been long in the Place, and among Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, in a little Time, began to Subſide; and more and more; till it became ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally undeſirable to keep it up. And 'tis like, the more, and the ſooner did thoſe Difficulties wear away, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a good Work, which early then, diſcovered its ſelf among them; as Perſons' Minds were awakned, and ſome powerful Turn given them, to religious Matters; of which, ſome now alive, are Witneſſes. And as Things, of a ſpiritual Nature, became generally the Topic of Converſation, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſerious Enquiry; thoſe that had been Matters of Contention drop'd, and diſappeared.</p>
               <p>WHEN I firſt came here, there was a beautiful Sight of venerable aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and many of them appearing

much of the right puritan Stamp <q>The hoary Head found in the Way of Righteouſneſs.</q> And as there is now ſome greater Number of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, from 70, and upwards, than there was at that Time; the more theſe are found in the Imitation of them, in reſpect of Religion; the brighter the Aſpect on the ſucceeding Generations.</p>

I have been with you, in many Scenes of Trial; and in a long Series of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which I hope has been, ſome labour of Love; and in a Meaſure to your Profit: And, truſt, by the Grace of God, while I live, to <hi>ſeek you,</hi> rather than <hi>yours;</hi> as, I ſeriouſly think I have done: and, yet <hi>to Spend and be Spent for you.</hi> And may I not, Hope and Truſt, (without a Shock to my Hope in the Matter) that the Spirit of the Fathers, wherein they followed God and Duty, will in every Reſpect dwell in, and influence the Children. So, ſhall I have the Comfort of ſuch a good Spirit, and they the Bleſſing that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it.</p>
               <p>WHEN I took the paſtoral Office here; there were Eleven Male Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, of its ſtanding in the Rev'd Mr. <hi>Fitch'</hi>s Day, with about the ſame Number of Females. Alſo, there were at that Time, Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Male Members, who had been admitted in the Rev'd Mr. <hi>Woodward'</hi>s Day; with the ordinary Proportion of Females. There have ſince been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, 330, of which an 124 have
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010950_0047_0F8530AB418AAB28"/>
died; as almoſt all of them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd; 410, have owned the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of which Number, 90 have afterwards join'd to the Church, in full Communion. 2050, have been Baptized here, in this Courſe of Fifty Years; of which Number, many have died in Infancy. Thus, Death ſpares no Sort or Age.</p>
               <p>Now, among the Numbers, that have attended on the Means of Grace, more or leſs, theſe 2600 Sabbaths in theſe 50 Years; (beſides a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other public Occaſions,) the Lord knows the Number and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have receiv'd the Grace of God, to their Salvation; and who, through their Unbelief, have died in their Sins; or are in danger of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as being yet in their Sins. For, to ſome, the Word preached, and the preachers of it, are <q>a Savour of Life unto Life, and to others a Savour of Death unto Death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THAT the Number of the former Kind, may be happily Increaſed in the ſmall proportion of Time, I have to be with you: let it be your Prayer,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010950_0048_0F8530ABCFE13750"/>
the ſame as ſome Time ſince made for me, in this Deſk: <q>That my latter End greatly increaſe.</q> And amidſt all other Decline, may there be a rich Increaſe of ſpiritual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, Grace, Experience, Faithfulneſs and Succeſs, to the Glory of God; to my own and your beſt Advantage.</p>
               <p>I OBSERVED, I had in my Youth, the Encouragement which your Fathers, and the Grandfathers of ſome of you, gave me: who appear'd to Prize theſe very Things which I am to bring to your Remembrance. I hope, thoſe who have "grown up with me," and their Children, who began Life, ſince I came here; will ever ſhew the Spirit of their pious Anceſtors; to treat the Goſpel with Eſteem and Love: As alſo the Miniſters thereof with that Regard in all Things, which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires. And may there not ever a Generation riſe up, that know not the God of their Fathers; but, ſuch as have the like precious Faith with them.</p>
               <p>IT is a great Thing, to have the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, tranſmitted
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010950_0049_0F8530AC9E421030"/>
from Generation to Generation, pure and uncorrupt; both as to the great Principles and permanent Inſtitutions thereof, &amp;c. And that every Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their own Day, <q>ſtand faſt in the Liberty, Faith and Order of the Goſpel:</q> as thoſe who take it well to be always put in Remembrance of theſe Things. And if the Diſcourſe this Day, on the Remarkable Occaſion thereof, has any good Tendency to this; then look we back to this Day hereafter; as to a Kind of <hi>Monument</hi> ſet up, to remind us of Fifty Years Experience; yea, of all former Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of God's great Goodneſs to me and you; in upholding Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and preſerving his Church through all Trials, from Diſſolving, and falling a Prey to Error and Confuſion. Yea, review all as in a Kind of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> which ſpeaks out the Ground of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in God's Salvation, and of Praiſe to his great Name. And may the ſame, as looking forward, proclaim Liberty from Embarraſments to Religion, and greater Freedom in the Service of God for the future.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:010950_0050_0F8530AD507D5040"/>
AND, as I may juſtly think it Meet, while in this Tabernacle, to be remin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you; eſpecially, of the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Things; ſo I may agreeably now, (as a Specimen thereof) give you the following Advice.—<q>Be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly Engaged in ſearching the Scriptures, which teſtify of Chriſt, and ſhew the Way of Life by him.—Be much in Prayer, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, to guide you (in the Uſe of the Scripture) into all Truth and Duty.—Be thorough in your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Converſion to God. Take not up with ſlighty Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances thereof: Know, that by the Work of the Spirit in effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the Man becomes a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, created in Chriſt unto good Works.—Reſt not ſhort of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Self-Dedication to God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, for Juſtification unto Life. Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World, by the Sacrifice of himſelf, by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the Death of the Croſs.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010950_0051_0F8530AE0DEADDC0"/>
—Deſpair of Salvation by the Works of the Law, in your own Perſons.—Stedfaſtly View the Glory of the other Way, by Grace; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, God hath made us accepted in the Beloved:—The Argument to fall in with this Way of Acceptance with God, is very great: From the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Origin,</hi> free Grace; the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Medium,</hi> God's own belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son: And ſo, from the <hi>high Security,</hi> it gives the Believer: As alſo, the everlaſting <hi>high Reliſh</hi> he will have of it. On the Dignity, Sweetneſs, and Glory of this Way! More honorary to God, than to be Juſtified by Works of ours: As much more ſo, as the Lord from Heaven is more Honorable than an innocent Adam could have been, with all his Poſterity, an unſinning Race. And therefore ſpoke with an Emphaſis, in Praiſe of this new, and living Way of Acceptance with God. Eph. 1. 6. To the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he hath made us accepted—Of his own Grace, he hath made us ſo; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:010950_0052_0F8530AED8E71388"/>
in it, <hi>a divine Influence,</hi> as well as <hi>a glorious Conſtitution.</hi>—Be then entirely Satisfied in the Goſpel Way of Juſtification before God, and live by the Faith of the Son of God, the Life you now live in the Fleſh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>NOT knowing, but I may obtain Help of God, to continue with you, for more Service, tho' but for a little while; ſhall I earneſtly Invite you, to take the Advantage of my confirm'd Health and Strength, in further Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for your Souls; which, I know, it concerns me to improve this Way.</p>
               <p>THERE is a large, an attentive, and animating Aſſembly of you, who meet here for public Worſhip, as, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is large, and the People greatly increaſed. Every Claſs, from Children, to aged People, ſeem to be multiply'd.<note n="‡" place="bottom">From the Age of 50, to 70, now, above 100 Perſons: And from 70, and upwards, near 40; all advanc'd, and ſome far advanc'd in the Road to the Grave; unto dying Work, new Work; and to be done but once;—and gloriouſly done by ſuch as Die in the Lord.</note> But, if you ſhould fail of keeping
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010950_0053_0F8530B00977F340"/>
up a general Attendance, on ſocial pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip, and other Branches of Religion, which will fail in Proportion as this doth; it may be ſaid, as in Iſai. 9. 3. <q>Thou haſt multiplied the Nation, and not increaſed the Joy.</q> There is <hi>much in the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and in the divine Worſhip that we attend on, to animate us to the Attendance. And <hi>a Multitude</hi> that go to the Houſe of the Lord together, ſeriouſly, harmoniouſly, &amp;c. do animate one another.—<q>By all Means, be ye animated to attend; yea, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, and more faithfully and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly than ever, to the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>—</p>
               <p>AND here now, ſhall I for my ſelf and you, <q>by the Grace of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt the Language of Pſal. 132. And ſay, as there, Recorded; We will go into his Tabernacle, we will Worſhip at his Footſtool; Ariſe, O Lord, into thy Reſt, thou and the Ark of thy Strength: Let thy Prieſts be cloathed with Righteouſneſs, and, let thy Saints ſhout for Joy; for the Lord hath choſen Zion, he hath
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010950_0054_0F8530B05174B830"/>
deſired it for his Habitation. This is my Reſt for ever, and here will I dwell, for I have deſired it. I will abundantly bleſs her Proviſion, I will ſatisfy her Poor with Bread.—You will then ſuffer me to go on with my Advice to the Congregation at large; and ſay, Acquaint now thy ſelf with God, one and all, and be at Peace, thereby <hi>good ſhall come unto thee;</hi> all <hi>the good</hi> of Peace.—Peace with God, Peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,—and Peace among your ſelves. Oh how Glorious thus to be at Peace? Yea, to be engaged, in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, to purſue, and happily poſſeſs mutual Love and Eſteem; abiding Harmony, and Peace in Community, Civil and Religious. As repreſented in Pſal. 133. Behold how good and how Pleaſant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in Unity: It is like the precious Ointment uſed for a ſacred Officer of old; of ſweet Perfume. And as the Dew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending upon the Mountains of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to refreſh them,—for there the Lord commandeth the Bleſſing:
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010950_0055_0F8530B10E6155E0"/>
                     <hi>good indeed,</hi> to be of this Diſpoſition, and in that Situation, where the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, the great Father of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, doth command it, ah and that, which in the End, doth come to be Life for ever-more. This is glorious indeed; ſome Reſemblance of Heaven.</q>—</p>
               <p>Now, whatever failure of this mutual Eſteem, Love and Peace, &amp;c. there hath ever been here; God ſaw it, and was much Diſpleaſed with it: and you have been the Sufferers. And in whatever Degree, this chriſtian Affection and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony hath ſince been, and now is; God is Witneſs, and approves of it; whoſe Approbation it is, that determines the Worth of any Thing in, and among us, and done by us, pleaſing unto him. But whatever Peace and good Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we now live in: <q>Still the Advice is, be more and more intent upon it; to live in Love and Peace, always following Holineſs with it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>LOVE, and Peace! of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſacred Worth is this? it is honoured with God's having a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010950_0056_0F8530B26F35CCD8"/>
to this Purpoſe, God is Love. The God of Peace: and Chriſt, he is our Peace: And Peace it ſelf comprehends all good. As in Joh. 14. 27. <q>My Peace I give unto you,</q> that is every Thing: Yea, put for the Crown of all that is called good. As expreſs'd in that glorious Benediction—<q>Grace, Mercy, and Peace be multiplied to you.</q> So, let it be now, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſo let it be, through my Days, and all ſucceeding Generations, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
