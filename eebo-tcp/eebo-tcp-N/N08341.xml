            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A brief Narration, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ON the 15th of <hi>October</hi> 1763, as I was at work with my father, on the banks of the <hi>Suſquehannah,</hi> the Indians, to the number of 135, came upon us and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my father on the ſpot. My brother <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was at work about half a mile diſtant, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the ſame fate; as did likewiſe 14 or 15 others, who were at work in different places.</p>
            <p>The Indians, after they had burnt and deſtroyed all they could, marched off, and carried me up the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> river 150 miles, to a town called by them <hi>Wethouooungque;</hi> and when we had arrived there, they tied me with a rope about my neck, and an Indian was ordered to lead me, while others beat me with their fiſts: This they continued to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I can about a quarter of a mile. When I arrived at one of their huts, they tied me to one of the ſpars of the hut, where I remained all that night. The next day they let me looſe, but would not let me go out of their ſight.</p>
            <p>Here I tarried about three months, in which time I underwent many hardſhips, and had like to have famiſhed with hunger and cold, having nothing to cover me but an old coat and an old blanket, which was almoſt worn out. My employment was to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010652_0003_0F81BC094A9BE970"/>
fetch wood every day upon my back half a mile, which made me almoſt weary of my life.—At this place was brought a young <hi>Dutchman,</hi> who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the ſame time and place that I was; and when we had convenient opportunity, we laid our heads together to contrive an eſcape; to this end we ſtole every thing we could without being diſcovered, and hid it in the hollow of an old log.</p>
            <p>It was about the latter end of March, as near as I could judge (for it rained ſucceſſively three or four days, which melted away all the ſnow and brake up the river) when we had got together about 40 ears of corn, and ſix cakes of bread each, about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an hand. The <hi>Dutchman</hi> tho't it now time for us to endeavour to make our eſcape, but I was very averſe to his propoſal, telling him it would be better for us to wait till the ſpring was farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and the weather grew a little more warm: that we might endure the ſeverity of the nights when we ſhould have nothing but the cold ground to reſt our limbs on, and the heavens to cover our almoſt uncovered bodies; but he was ſo ſtiflly bent in his opinion of going off the firſt opportunity, that I was obliged to come into his meaſures. The next day at noon we were ſent after wood at the uſual place, when inſtead of returning back, we ſat out with a deſign to reach the neareſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettlement we could.— We ran all the afternoon till evening, when we made a ſtop and built a fire, where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained during the night. Early next morning we ſet out again, but had not gone far before the cold proved ſo ſevere that it froze the ends of my toes, and my mockaſins being very thin and almoſt worn out, my toes wore off as faſt as they froze. This
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010652_0004_0F81BC0A1D8EE500"/>
ſo far diſabled me that it was with great difficulty I could travel, yet we continued our way until about noon, when unable to go any farther, we ſtopt and made a fire, and after we had warmed and refreſhed ourſelves, we ſet out again, and about ſun ſet we arrived at a very thick ſwamp in which we were ſecurely covered by the prodigious thickneſs of the hemlock, with which the ſwamp abounded. We made a large fire, and notwithſtanding the fatigues of our march, and the pain that might be expected to ariſe from my toes being froze, and being as we aprehended out of danger of any enemy, we reſted very comfortably all night. The next day very early we got on our way again; but the weather was ſo cold that we were unable to proceed very far before we were obliged to make a halt, and to build a fire to keep us from freezing.—We ſtayed in this place two days, when the weather began to moderate to ſuch a degree that we could purſue our rout with leſs danger of being overcome with the ſeverity of the ſeaſon: Sometimes we travelled all day, at other times but two or three hours in a day; ſometimes we ſtayed two or three days in a place, altho' many times we had tolerable good weather. This remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs began to make me very uneaſy—I uſed all the arguments I poſſibly could with my companion to perſuade him to expedite our eſcape, but all to no purpoſe. Sometimes I got hold of his hand, with a view to force him along, but nothing would move him—It looks to me very probable, had we made the beſt uſe of our ſhatter'd limbs, we might have reached ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> fort or ſettlement before his death. In this diſmal condition I knew not what to do—leave him I could not, for we had but one
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010652_0005_0F81BC0AC9D107F0"/>
hatchet, and the nights ſtill pretty cold, ſo that we could not endure them without a fire.—Thus we moved on ſlowly for ſeveral days, untill all our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions were ſpent: By this time we had arrived at a ſmall creek which extends its courſe about S. E. and empties itſelf into the <hi>Suſquehannah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had not gone far down this creek before we ſtopt, and built a fire, and ſat down, but were ſoon ſurprized at the appearance of an <hi>Indian,</hi> who came very near before we diſcovered each other. He no ſooner ſaw us but he turn'd ſhort about, and ran down by the creek; and as ſoon as he was out of ſight, we made all the haſte we could to a hill which lay a little before us, on the ſouth ſide of which the ſnow was all gone and the ground dry, by which means we made our eſcape.—The <hi>Indian</hi> ſoon alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hiſ companions who lay at a little diſtance and purſued us, but the ground being ſo dry and hard, it was impoſſible for them to track us, which made them ſoon give over purſuing.—After tarrying on this hill two days, we proceeded on our way, but had nothing to eat but the bark of trees, on which alone we lived to days, without eating any thing elſe. The fourth day after we left this hill we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow weary and faint, but the fear of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my baniſhed all hunger from us. We continued travelling till the ſeventh day, when we ſtopped again, when my companion, as I ſuppoſe was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with faſting (tho' he never complained) and began to be unable to help himſelf. I nurſed him as well as I could. The ſecond day he made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to go to a ſpring at a ſmall diſtance, but was ſo weak he fell down ſeveral times before he could get there, it was with difficulty he got back
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010652_0006_0F81BC0D85902DD8"/>
again; after this he never was able to walk any more.—I know whether he apprehended his end to be ſo near, but the third night he died. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon before his death he ſaid but few words, tho' I often tried to diſcourſe with him. In the evening he told me, that <hi>if he died firſt, he would not have me afraid to eat of his fleſh, for I am determin'd, ſays he, to eat of yours, if you ſhould die before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I was left all alone, ſtript of every comfort of life, and knew not which way to turn myſelf. I thought the abſolute neceſſity I was in, would excuſe my purſuing the advice he gave me, of eating his fleſh as ſoon as dead: I went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately about performing the diſagreeable operation, and cut off 5 or 6 pounds of his legs and thighs:—I left the reſt, and made the beſt way I could down the Creek. I had not travelled but four days before I arrived at an Indian town, where I was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and being taken up by them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed me to one of their huts.</p>
            <p>They demanded of me from whence I came? and after I had anſwered their demands, they gave me ſome parched corn to eat.</p>
            <p>The next day all the Indians left their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and carried me directly back to the place from whence I had made my eſcape.</p>
            <p>My old maſters being ſo vexed at my leaving them, that they were reſolutely bent to have me burnt: But a counſel being called upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they thought death too ſevere a puniſhment, conſidering I was but young, and concluding that I ſhould not have attempted an eſcape, had not the Dutchman enticed me away. Therefore they contented themſelves with ordering me to be whipt on the naked body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:010652_0007_0F81BC0E2F7D7C68"/>
Accordingly, next day I was brought forth, ſtrip'd ſtark naked, and ordered to run; while the Indians, who were ranged in a row, at certain diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, in a moſt cruel and barbarous manner, bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured me with their whips,—by which they ſometimes laid me level with the ground, by their blows.— Thus they continued to laſh me, until I had run about 40 rods, when I received a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blow from one of them, which ſettled me to the ground as quick as if I had been ſhot through the heart. I was ſo ſtunned by the blow, that it ſeems I ſhould never have recovered again, had not an old ſquaw run immediately to my relief, and helped me into her hut. By this time my whole body was covered with gore and blood.</p>
            <p>I tarried here after this about 14 days, and then they ſent me up to the Senecas about 150 miles off. I lived here one year, in which time I ſuffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſurmountable hardſhips: being ſome times almoſt famiſhed to death with hunger, at othertimes greatly ſuffering from the cold, and ſome times near periſhing with both. For the moſt part of the time we had nothing but ground nuts and herbs to ſubſiſt upon in the ſummer, and red plums in the winter. Several of the Indians actually ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death.</p>
            <p>From this place they carried me to Alaganey, a branch of the River Ohio, and from<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Alagany is the name of a place upon the river of the ſame name.</hi>
               </note>Alaganey down the river to the place where it empties itſelf into the Ohio. After ſtaying here about a month, they carried me down the Ohio three hundred miles.— Here I found my indian father and mother
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010652_0008_0F81BC0F62A074C8"/>
and was very kindly received by them, and all the other indians. They ſupplied me with a good blanket and other neceſſary cloathings and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in great plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now the happy time began to draw near, when I ſhould be releaſed, for after I had been in this place three or four months, to my great joy an Indian came from Sir William Johnſon, with orders that all the priſoners ſhould be releaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And after they had ſtriped me of almoſt every thing I had about me, I was conducted by my guide to Fort Du-Queſne, where I was delivered up to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer, and clothing was ordered for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But having undergone ſo many hardſhips during my ſtay among the ſavages, I looked like a mere ſkeleton.—I remained here about eleven months; at the end of which I was ſent to Philadelphia, where I tarried about three months, from thence I went to New Borough, where I arrived the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>I would take this opportunity to return my moſt unfeigned thanks to all thoſe gentlemen and ladies who were ſo generous as to contribute a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſum of money on my behalf.</p>
