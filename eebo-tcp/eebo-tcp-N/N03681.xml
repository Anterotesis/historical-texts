            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Convictions are sometimes begun in the Soul by the Means of some awakening Providence, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Christian Conferences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes by publick, and sometimes by private Ordinances; and even sometimes by the immediate Influences of the Spirit of God, without any known Means or outward Occasion whatsoever: But the Means which God, is most usually pleased to bless unto this End, is the Ministry of the Gospel. <hi>It has pleased God, by the Foolishness of Preaching to save those that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21.</p>
            <p>These Convictions of which I speak, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily begun in the Soul, from a view of some more gross Pollutions and more aggravated Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and Enormities, that the guilty Sinner sees himself chargeable with. These stare him in the Face, lay iust hold on his Conscience; and set before him, a fearful Prospect of that fiery Indignation, that is like to consume him.

            <p>This Experience we must every one of us attain to, or we are undone for ever. We must be thus humbled, and brought off from all Confidence in ourselves, and from all attainments of our own that we either have, or hope for, before we can have any Interest in the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promise before us. To this I will add once more.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, They who are <hi>Weary and Heavy Laden,</hi> are brought to a lively Sense of their utter Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness that God should shew them any Mercy. What I have said already gives us some View of the great Distress of an awakened humbled Sinner; they have found all their Refuges fail, all their Cisterns drawn dry; and all their Props knock'd from under them. <hi>And whither shall they flee for help?</hi> Could they with the careless World, flatter themselves from the Riches of God's Mercy and the Merits of Christ, without an Interest in either of them, that would ease them of their Burthen; and lull 'em asleep in Security. But alas! they are pressed down with a Weight of Guilt, which challenges the Justice of a provoked God. They see that they deserve nothing but Wrath, that they have no Claim to Mercy; and that they can do nothing which will enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle 'em to it. They see that God may justly take the Forfeiture at their Hands, and glorify

himself in their Eternal Ruin; and thence are ready to Wonder at the Patience and Long-Suffering of God towards such henious, hard hearted Sinners as they are.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a great Difference in the humbling Views of their own Unworthiness, which these <hi>Weary and Heavy Laden</hi> Sinners en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain. Some of them have such a Sense of their Guilt and just exposedness to the Divine Wrath, that they <hi>are Troubled, they are bow's down greatly, and go Mourning all the Day long.</hi> They see that God may justly reject them; and they don't know but he will, and how dreadful does their Case appear, while they see but a meer Possibility of escaping his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Vengeance! Some of them find such Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Corruptions, such deadness in Duty; and such hardness of Heart, that they are ready to fear that they are given up of God, that they have Sinned away their Day of Grace, and that the Things of their Peace are hidden from their Eyes. These from such a distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Prospect of their State, and from the Powerful Temptations of Satan setting in with it, are some Times ready to give up the Case, and to conclude that <hi>God's Mercies are clean gone forever; and that he hath in Anger shut up his tender Mercies.</hi> Others will be more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Supported in their greatest Darkness and Fears, with some Hopes of undeserved Mercy, they will still hope (how dark soever their Case appears) that the Rich and free Grace of God, which has been so often Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified

            <p>I can't pretend at Present to set before you all the various Operations of the Spirit of Grace in a humbled heavy laden Soul. But this is their united Character; and what is always found in every one that is prepared to come to Christ for Rest, that they absolutely despair of all their own Strength or Ability to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seves, that they altogether give up all Hope, from any Thing else but the free, forfeited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and undeserved Grace, and Mercy of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the infinite Merit, and inexhaustible Fulness and Sufficiency of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p>If any of you are prejudiced against these Doctrines, and think I have carried the Point too far; the Power of Divine Grace, if you are so happy as to obtain it, will remove your Prejudices, and give you an experimental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their Truths.</p>
            <p>If any of you are surprized at what you have heard, as being Strangers to all these Things; the Lord set home the Surprize to Purpose, till you have attain'd to the happy Experience, that you mayn't perish for ever with Unconverted Sinners.</p>

in the Text. <hi>Come unto Christ and he will give you Rest.</hi> And for your Assistance in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I shall Endeavour to point out the Way by shewing you.</p>
            <p n="1">I· What is imply'd in coming to Christ, that we may have Rest.</p>
            <p>Upon this I shall observe in general, that <hi>coming to Christ</hi> implies the same Thing, with believing on him. Thus it is explained <hi>Ioh.</hi> vi.35. <hi>He that cometh to me shall never Hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never Thirst.</hi> To come to Christ is therefore to give such a hearty Assent to the Truths of the Gospel, as to be fully confirm'd in them, and to have them Powerfully impressed on our Minds. It is readily to consent with our whole Hearts to the Proposals of the Gospel, and to Receive the Lord Jesus Christ upon his own Terms. It is to Place all our Confidence upon him as <hi>the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> and as the Fountain of Grace and Life, that he may be all in all to us. Or in other Words, it is to choose him for our Portion, to give up ourselves wholly to him, and to trust in him alone <hi>as the Author of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation.</hi> This is to come to Christ; and this the only Terms by which we can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the Rest here promised.</p>
            <p>Sinners are ready to flatter themselves with safety, and to quiet their Consciences in a State of Sin and Impenitence, from such Gracious Encouragement as this in our Text. It is but c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004502_0019_0F5E2E6CA11479B0"/>
and as though they could by this Means at their Pleasure obtain a Deliverance from Sin and Guilt, and a Title to Heaven. But what do they understand by coming to Christ? No more perhaps, than Praying to him, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending some of the Ordinances of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as if this were sufficient to make up the Breach between God and their Souls. But I beseech you, my Brethren, to receive this for an established truth, that you are never to hope for an Interest in Christ and his Salvation, until you are brought to receive a whole Christ with your whole Hearts, and to be united to him by a vital Faith. There is no <hi>Rest</hi> to be obtain'd from Christ, until you place all your Rest in him; and have all your Dependance upon him. <hi>Without Faith its impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. xi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>6 <hi>He that believes not shall be damned,</hi> Mark xvi.16, Some of you may perhaps, be startled at this Doctrine, as what robs you of all the Comfort you had taken from the Text. For if this be coming to Christ, you are no more able to come to him by your own Power, than to create a New World. <hi>Faith is the Gift of God, and what Flesh and Blood cannot reveal,</hi> you are therefore plunged into Distress; and what can you do?</p>
            <p>That I may obviate this Difficulty, I would further observe to you, that if you would come to Christ, you must repair to him, and rely upon him for Grace to receive him. He is the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoo and Finisher of our Faith,</hi> Heb. xii.2. <hi>It is of his Fulness that we all receive, and even Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. i.16. We cannot indeed come

            <p>Thus I have set before you the only Terms, upon which you may hope for Rest from Christ. Those of you whose Consciences tell you, that you are yet Strangers to these Qualifications, have Cause to be awaken'd from a Sense of your Miserable undone Condition, and of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of your flying for your Lives to this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Refuge, before the Avenger of Blood overtake you.

Such like Pleas have (I perceive) been made for your Church-Dividing Practices; and for your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Censoriousness. But I would enquire of those, how they come to know that they
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004502_0038_0F5E2E7C756C8380"/>
who are Professors of Religion, sound in their Faith, Regular in their Conversations, Friends to vital Piety, forward in Promoting Religious Duties; and constant in attending upon them, are but formal Hypocrites. They may be such it's true; but it's the Prerogative of him who <hi>searches the Hearts and the Reins,</hi> to determine whether they are such or not; And whence have any of you Authority to invade his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative? Would you but View your Conduct in the Glass of God's Word, it might justly fill you with Surprize. There you are directed not <hi>to Iudge, least you are Iudged,</hi> Mat. vii.1. There the Apostle expostulates with you, as I have now been doing. <hi>Who art thou that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est another Man's Servant? To his own Master he Standeth or Falleth. Why dost thou judge thy Brother, or why dost thou set at nought thy Brother; for we shall all stand before the Iudgment-Seat of Christ? Let us not therefore judge one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any more,</hi> Rom, xiv.4.10, 13. And the same Apostle warns you, <hi>to judge Nothing before the Time, until the Lord come,</hi> 1 Cor. iv.5.

Now what must your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter appear, if you are try'd by these <hi>Oracles of God</hi>? I don't say it is impossible that you can have the Truth of Grace, this were to imitate your Censoriousness, but I am bold to say, that these Practices are directly opposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Grace, and therefore to be heartily repented of, and speedily reform'd, if you would have a clear Evidence of your good Estate. It's not improbable that I shall be severely censured for this Address. But my Dear Brethren, have I not proved the Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these Practices by that Word, by which you and I must be judged at the last Day? If I have, take heed what you do; for it is hard to kick against the Pricks. God will first or last Vindicate the Truth of his Word, whoever oppose it. If I have not proved this from the Word of God, challenge no Regard to any Thing I have said, I don't desire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Thing upon my Authority. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave this to the Determination of your own Consciences; and Pray God that they may direct you to such Methods now, as will prove most Comfortable to you in the Day of Christ. I shall add no more upon this Subject; but that I have in the Fear of God born my Testimony against these uncharitable Practices, and have delivered my Soul. If any of you will still persist in them, your Blood be upon your own Heads, I am clear from your Guilt.— There needs no Apoligy for my insisting so

long upon this Matter, you all know the Case, I shall therefore leave it with you, and return to summon your Attention to those Rules of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that have been proposed. Review what you have heard, and consider it. Do your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences bear Testimony for you, that you have been throughly awakened from your Carnal Security; and deeply affected with a Sense of your Sin and Guilt, and of the Wrath of God, to which you are thereby exposed? Do your Consciences testify for you, that you have been constant, diligent and earnest in all known Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>hods of fleeing from the Wrath to come? Do they upon an impartial Examination bear you Testimony, that you have renounced all Confidence in your selves, that you commit your Souls to Christ, and depend upon him only, as the Author of your Eternal Salvation? And have you found the Fruits of the Blessed Spirit in your Souls, Mortifying your Lusts, Purifying your Hearts, and quickning you in the Ways of God and Godliness? Have you according to the Apostles Direction, Col. iii.14 15. <hi>Above all Things put on Charity; which is the Bond of Perfectness? And has the Peace of God Ruled in your Hearts, to which also ye are called in one Body. If these Things be in yoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
