            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS, DELIVERED AT THE OPENING OF PORTSMOUTH ACADEMY.</head>
            <p>THE BENEVOLENT mind muſt experience great pleaſure in beholding means taking, and new inſtitutions forming in various places, to educate our youth, and particularly that valuable part of our ſpecies, our young FEMALES. This ſubject has engaged the attention of ſome of our moſt beloved citizens in theſe ſtates. They have juſtly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, as a very important ſource of national proſperity. They wiſh ſo to conduct it, as will beſt accommodate it, to the ſtate of ſociety, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and government in our country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:023649_0003_0FC08D1F4793AE98"/>THE Principal of the Academy, now opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, has called our attention, my friends and fellow citizens, to a deſign which it is in our power to make profitable to him, as well as beneficial to our children. The healthineſs of our climate— the elegant manners of the people of this town, give us all neceſſary advantages: It is by our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aid that it may flouriſh, even if no aſſiſtance is derived from others.</p>
            <p>WHEN we reflect, that early education tinctures or forms our character in a great degree, for life; we are irreſiſtibly drawn to exert our utmoſt ability to afford our youth every poſſible advantage to gain the beſt. That ſmall ſum which induſtry and eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy will give almoſt every parent, is far better beſtowed, than a large patrimony joined with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. A knowledge of buſineſs every day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents men with offices whoſe rewards are equal to the rent of large eſtates, and the annual intereſt of great ſums—where theſe perſons have not inherited a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and poſſeſs no other riches than a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>BY inſtructing our <hi>females</hi> in thoſe uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary branches of induſtry which are peculiar to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023649_0004_0FC08D2162170918"/>
their ſex, we alſo furniſh them with a ſource of wealth and profit, which is neceſſary for all conditions in life; which may be laid aſide when affluence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, or aſſumed when adverſity with its billows rolls trouble and indigence upon them.</p>
            <p>THE mode in deſcent of lands—the very equal diſtribution of property—and the equality of rank in our country alſo demand, that every claſs of our citizens educate their children in the beſt manner poſſible. The great Creator of us all, has made no difference in the endowments of the head or heart, between the child of the monarch or of the peaſant. Very rarely does the property of a frugal anceſtor deſcend to the third generation. Theſe ideas daily convince us, that a good education, principles of virtue, and uſeful acquirements, are to be ſought as the moſt eſſential benefits for our children.</p>
            <p>THIS theme has been diſcuſſed ſo often, that I cannot inſure to you, that I ſhall ſay any thing new upon this occaſion. The moſt I can promiſe is to refreſh your memories, and keep alive the ſubject. As a Chriſtian Miniſter, I can come to you with no better arguments and examples, than thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the volume of our holy religion. The
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023649_0005_0FC08D226472C7B0"/>
Bible affords the moſt excellent patterns, by which to form the great and uſeful character of men and women. In the 31ſt chapter of Proverbs, we find a model for the female character, by which to make the daughter of every American citizen, that virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woman whoſe price is far above rubies. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cloſes this rich treaſury of inſtruction, with a chapter which records the leſſon of a mother to her ſon, even the words of King Lemuel—the leſſon which his mother taught him. He was now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the improving ſeaſon of youth, or juſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the throne, and ſeeking a Queen. After ſome general inſtructions upon temperance and chaſtity, upon comforting and defending the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe proceeds with portraying the character of a good wife The mother of a King is employed in an office highly becoming her rank. She is preſented by the wiſe King Solomon, as a pattern to mothers in general. It is their peculiar taſk to direct the morals of youth. Their care in infancy, conſtant attention and ſociety during the critical period of youth—the many opportunities which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life affords, enable them alone, to do the duty properly. Buſineſs and many cares call the father abroad, but home is the mother's province; here ſhe reigns ſole miſtreſs, the greateſt part of her
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023649_0006_0FC08D2BA84D2768"/>
life. If her children err, ſhe muſt bear a large ſhare in their guilt and ſufferings This chapter is more valuable when we conſider, that in a good wife are united the characters of a daughter, mother, friend and miſtreſs; moſt of the deareſt relations in life are concentred in her. Is ſhe ſuch a perſon as fills all theſe ſtations properly? Behold her rewarding the cares, and cheering the ſouls of her affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate parents, obedient children, tender huſband, firm friends and faithful ſervants. Theſe live, as by her ſmiles. Is ſhe uſeful in her ſtation? Does ſhe excell? A long train of the good and virtuous attend her wiſhes, applaud her conduct, and exalt her praiſe. Domeſtic happineſs dwells where ſhe reſides; ſociety is adorned and made pleaſant by her actions; religion is recommended by her bright example. She appears like one of thoſe guardian angels, who are ſuppoſed to attend around the good in this world, as miniſtring ſervants, to guide, guard and animate them through life, and convoy them after death to Heaven.</p>
            <p>WHILE fine writers, poets and painters, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſelect good women to repreſent angels; they alſo take the bad, to portray the horrid picture of furies. While we greedily gaze at the one, we
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023649_0007_0FC08D2CAF6B1D48"/>
turn with abhorrence from the other. So odious is the ſight of the bad, that even vicious men, ſhun their company and avoid their acquaintance, in the preſence of the oppoſite lovely character, whom the poet deſcribes in the mother of our race —"grace was in all her ſteps—Heaven in her eye —in every geſture, dignity and love."</p>
            <p>"THE price of a virtuous woman is far above rubies"—is more valuable than the richeſt and moſt coſtly gems. This deſcription of her worth is enhanced, when we read Job's repreſentation of wiſdom, that excellent gift of God;—"that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the gold of ophir—cannot be valued with the onyx or the ſapphire—that it ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for veſſels of fine gold—that no mention ſhall be made of coral or of pearls, when in balance with wiſdom, for her value is above rubies." The ſame language is uſed in the oracles of Omniſcience to recommend wiſdom, or true religion, as is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to repreſent unto us, that precious gift, that favour from the Lord, a good wife.</p>
            <p>"THE heart of her huſband doth ſafely truſt in her,"—in her prudence and knowledge. He is therefore in no fear of waſte or ſpoil by her idleneſs,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023649_0008_0FC08D2E218EDDB8"/>
extravagance or prodigality.—So far from this, ſhe ſhall help him in increaſing his wealth.—"She ſhall do him good, and not evil all the days of her life."</p>
            <p>HER induſtrious diſpoſition and habits lead "her to ſeek wool and flax, and ſhe worketh will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with her hands." By this, ſhe is furniſhed with means to open a merchandize, which gives her the productions of diſtant regions. "Like the merchant ſhips, ſhe bringeth her food from far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Here a wide field opens for the diſplay of her abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and ingenuity.</p>
            <p>TO prevent exceſſive ſorrow, and needleſs repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, her attendants live by her bounty. She ſpares not in the proſecution of her duty toward her dependants, in order to make them faithful and happy, to "riſe while it is yet night, that ſhe may give meat to her houſhold, and a portion to her maidens. She does not totally confine her cares to merchandize, but knowing the value of real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty—the quality of lands, and importance of agriculture, ſhe conſidereth a field and buyeth it. With the earnings of her hand, and fruit ſelected
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023649_0009_0FC08D41111DBAA8"/>
by herſelf, ſhe planteth a vineyard with the beſt twigs, and moſt delicious grapes.</p>
            <p>SO FAR is this from being too maſculine or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for her delicate ſex, it gives her health and ſhe girdeth her loins with ſtrength, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her hands by uſe. Her cares and exertions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her with the pleaſing ſight of beholding that her merchandize is good. She taſtes, ſees and knows that it is ſafe and honourable.</p>
            <p>DROWSINESS and ſluggiſhneſs are ſtrangers to her. To be always equipped for induſtry, her candle go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not out by night. She improves all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of honeſtly increaſing her wealth. Without confiding in the uncertainties that often attend mercantile employments—without hazarding too far the blaſts and droughts that may injure her crops, or truſting to the mere accidental fallings of property into her lap, ſhe layeth her hands to the ſpindle, and her hands hold the diſtaff.</p>
            <p>THESE reſources of commerce, agriculture and manufactures (as is natural) make her rich. She is furniſhed thereby with means to do good. She has every neceſſary food, cloathing and medicine
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023649_0010_0FC08D4267ACE7F8"/>
in ſtore for the diſtreſſed. She cheerfully ſtretcheth out her liberal hand to the poor, and reacheth out her hands to relieve the needy. Her knowledge of buſineſs, and the value of property, awakes a juſt charity to the diſtreſſed, and heightens her enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when ſhe reflects that ſhe has done good.</p>
            <p>Do ſtorms ariſe?—Does the wind blow?—Or is the cold intenſe—the earth covered and air chilled by ſnow?—She dreads no ſudden, unprepared for anxieties, leſt the health of her houſhold ſhould be in danger: She has been provident in ſeaſon— her houſhold are already cloathed for all weathers; with dreſs that is warm, decent and valuable—even with ſcarlet.</p>
            <p>HER domeſtics being thus equipped for neatneſs, and health—want and diſtreſs having fled from her abode—ſhe appears with all her beauties heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and her works praiſing her in her attire. With her own hands ſhe maketh herſelf coverings of the richeſt tapeſtry. Her clothing is ſilk and purple. No ruined merchant, mechanic or huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band are in her train. She has induſtriouſly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for every elegance, without injuring any one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:023649_0011_0FC08D44064A5230"/>THIS richneſs and elegance appears alſo in the dreſs—in the valuable embroideries, and various ornaments, which her needle prepares for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. He is diſtinguiſhed by the richeſt garb, and moſt ſerene countenance among the rulers of the land. No brow of care and domeſtic diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent attend him to the court or levee. Wiſdom, worth and virtue are the important traits, in the character of the man whoſe joys ſhe improves.</p>
            <p>SHE maketh fine linen and ſelleth it, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth girdles to the merchants. Strength and honour, modeſty and equanimity are her clothing. Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and quietneſs are graces which ſhe cultivates, and conſiders as of infinitely greater excellence, far more ornamental, than all the appendages of her wardrobe or toilet. Well may ſhe rejoice in time to come. Her wealth affords all the pleaſures which riches can poſſibly yield. Her age feels no pinchings from want—knows no ſigh for bread.</p>
            <p>BUT, her cares are not confined to the property, or pelf of this world—to her own dreſs—to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of her houſe—the ſplendor of her huſband—the chearfulneſs of her ſervants—the flouriſhing of her traffic—the fertility of her farms, gardens and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023649_0012_0FC08D51CAEC7A70"/>
but, ſhe has alſo furniſhed her mind with knowledge; with that true wiſdom, which works of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>morality</hi> afford. She never opens her mouth to utter <hi>folly.</hi> No <hi>ſcandal</hi>—no rude, angry, <hi>cruel language</hi> defile her chaſte lips. With her tongue dwells the law of kindneſs—the moſt mild and gentle language. She gives an example and affords the precept, in every juſt and tender ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She conſoles the <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>dying</hi>—ſhe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters a balm to chear the <hi>afflicted.</hi> She looks well to the ways of her houſhold, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct virtuouſly, both in her preſence and abſence. She eateth not the bread of idleneſs; gained by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, or wrong doing: ſhe is not idly ſauntring abroad or night walking, while her ſervants are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oting at home.</p>
            <p>HERE is a <hi>truly noble perſonage,</hi> elevated by her <hi>merit</hi>; ſhe, holds a rank, that no one can deprive her of,—which always procures reſpect, without the trouble of demanding it ourſelves. Such a woman is more uſeful to the world—gains more honour to her ſex—more ennobles human nature, than many of thoſe, who have worn crowns and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onets: who have been ſaluted with the moſt flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing titles—have been attended with all the parade
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023649_0013_0FC08D5403EE68A0"/>
of royalty, while they have ruined the minds and morals of thouſands.</p>
            <p>THE deſcription of this virtuous woman cloſes with obſerving, "That her children riſe up and call her bleſſed—her huſband alſo and he praiſeth her." Doing her duty to them—making their honour, advancement and felicity, the firſt motive of action—knowing that they are all embarked in the ſame intereſt to make each other happy; all other principles give place to this ſentiment. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement and diſſipation having never been ſought by either as a reſource to baniſh diſcontent; or made a momentary ſubſtitute, for want of felicity at home. Her partner and children pay her all poſſible reſpect and reverence.—They extol her virtues—paſs the ſmile of joy, and echo of grateful praiſe, from each to the other. The children rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her care, become bleſſings to the world and imitators of her perfections.—They are beheld with veneration and inherit her excellencies. A ſucceſſion of worth, more valuable than titles or law can give, deſcends to her heirs. Her excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is beheld by others, upon which, to form the uſeful and beloved woman, wife, daughter, mother and miſtreſs. In the ruins of age, ſhe is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,

—is pleaſing e'en in death.—She lives in the memory of many generations.</p>
            <p>THO' many daughters have done virtuouſly in many things, yet ſuch an one excels them all— poſſeſſes moſt of the real excellencies of the female character, and muſt be neareſt perfection.</p>
            <p>TO ALL this we may add, that, tho' one could be found in whom were united all thoſe things which form the perfect beauty, in the opinion of the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſtatuary or man of fancy; yet that elegance of form, and motion is often deceitful—beauty is a fading flower, ſoon gone, never to be regained by art, nor purchaſed with money, and at beſt is vain; yet a woman who feareth the Lord, and follows his laws, ſhall be praiſed.</p>
            <p>WELL may ſhe demand our obedience to the laſt verſe in this book and chapter; that we give her of the fruits of her hands—encourage and aſſiſt her in doing good—to improve her wealth, and gain the applauſe ſhe ſo juſtly merits.</p>
            <p>WHILE Job, Lot, Sampſon, and others, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, had wives who afflicted and diſgraced
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023649_0015_0FC08D5B2B2C7D80"/>
them; Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, and others, were bleſſed with thoſe who comforted and did them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. We read the ſtory of a pious Hannah—a prudent Abigail, and a patriotic Eſther. Theſe are examples of great benefit to chriſtians in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Much care was taken in early times, to ſelect ſuch for wives, who had been properly trained to religion and virtuous induſtry. Rebecca was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed by the Ambaſſador, who came with a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of marriage from his maſter for Iſaac; and he was prepoſſeſſed in her favour, while ſhe hoſpitably and humanely afforded drink at the well for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Rachel was firſt met and loved by Jacob while ſhe followed the employment of a ſhepherd's daughter.</p>
            <p>WHILE man is called the lord of the creation, and has dominion given him over all things, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken from his ſide, bears his image, and is placed as his companion. Their mutual union is deſcriptive of the union between Chriſt and his church.</p>
            <p>IT is our duty in the American States, to pay particular attention to the education of females; that they may preſerve their proper ſtation; their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023649_0016_0FC08D5CCEC48C50"/>
rights and happineſs, and be guided in the road to obtain thoſe ineſtimable qualities, piety to God— reverence to parents—love and obedience to their huſbands—tenderneſs and watchfulneſs over their children—juſtice and humanity to their dependants.</p>
            <p>THIS theme is more important, where early and virtuous marriage is the ſource for increaſing the numbers, the wealth and proſperity of a country, and preſerving purity of morals, Idleneſs, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance and pride diſcourage this. Very few will connect themſelves willingly, in holy wedlock, with thoſe, who do not in return for love and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, favour them with generous ſentiments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, economy, frugality, neatneſs, patience, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, temperance and chaſtity.</p>
            <p>WERE the opulent duly impreſſed with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of riches, and how ſuddenly they may flee away; and were the poor inſtructed in the various branches of female induſtry, both would eſcape one half the miſeries in life.</p>
            <p>WHEN houſe, land and friends, are gone forever, the virtuous mind, the well informed head, and hands taught to work, have found new reſources for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023649_0017_0FC08D6F9EA3E328"/>
their wants, which might otherwiſe have ended their days, or landed them in deſpair. The world is more than half indebted to the female ſex, for the preſervation of religion—for ſecurity and proſperity in ſociety, and for peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in domeſtic life.</p>
            <p>MEN of libertine principles may affect to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule this ſubject; but obſerve their caution, leaſt they become the wedded companion of one who is oppoſite to the character of good. How ſeldom is this the caſe? How frequently do they impoſe their vices and infirmities upon the pureſt and moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic part of the female ſex! Their reverential awe, and aukward baſhfulneſs in the preſence of amiable females, proves alſo that they revere ſuch in their hearts. In no company is the profligate ſo ſoon ſilenced and abaſhed, as in that of the good woman I have deſcribed. They are wounded at the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attention and preference that ſhe pays to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior worth, virtue and knowledge of pious and good men. The harrowed breaſt—the jealous h<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d, here ſhew themſelves, by the ſilent tongue— the downcaſt eye, and prudent retreat.</p>
            <p>BY ſpreading ſuch truths as theſe far and wide, we are doing our duty to God—are in the <hi>only</hi> road to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023649_0018_0FC08D71A6309898"/>
ſecure the honour and proſperity of our families, and the bleſſings of civilization.</p>
            <p>THE induſtry of the good wife we have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, is too important a part of her character to be paſſed over without particular notice. In antient days it was not unfaſhionable for a Queen to attend to manufactures; coſtly dreſs and elegant living were as well, if not better known then, than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It is not <hi>degrading</hi> but <hi>exalting</hi> the female character to ſay, that their education is not complete until they are verſed in the various branches of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures which are neceſſary for their houſholds; I am proud to confeſs that I am ſupported in theſe ideas, by innumerable examples which ladies of the firſt excellence and wealth in America have ſet. A few voluntary aſſociations, or a more frequent exhibition of their induſtry in their dreſs would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and preſerve the practice where it is omitted. A knowledge of the diſtaff, wheel and loom is no diſgrace, but a glory to the moſt exalted. Every man, by the conſtitution, is born with an equal right to be elected to the higheſt office. And every woman, is born with an equal right to be the wife of the moſt eminent man. Let it therefore be our buſineſs, to ſee that each be poſſeſſed of thoſe virtues
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023649_0019_0FC08D7323FE4F48"/>
and accompliſhments which form the uſeful and elevated character. The peculiar nature of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations of women, gives them every neceſſary art, at a much earlier period in life than men can obtain a knowledge of the laborious and extenſive buſineſs that naturally fails to their ſhare. The needle and diſtaff may be early put into the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of females, and go hand in hand with the important branches of reading, writing, arithmetic, accounts, geography, hiſtory and poetry.</p>
            <p>THE employments of the needle are one of the branches of inſtruction in this Academy. The uſeful firſt and then the ornamental. This laſt opens a broad field to exerciſe the ingenuity and amuſe the mind, while they are forming a landſcape or imitating the various ſhapes and tinges of a flower, with their needle or pencil, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly led to admire and adore the power of the Great Creator, who has clothed the lily of the field with greater beauties than Solomon was array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in all his glory. Here the opulent may amuſe themſelves in decorating their perſons and houſes. Here the indigent may earn bread, by delivering their labours to the merchant, as the women of the eaſt did and now do girdles
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023649_0020_0FC08D8164ECC240"/>
and other ſpecimens of induſtry. A general diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe branches affords an opportunity for each to follow that to which her fancy leads. Learned women are valuable, but give me leave to obſerve, that induſtrious women generally make the beſt wives.</p>
            <p>MUSIC, and particularly the vocal, deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demands cultivation; principally as it relates to praiſe—that ſublime part of public worſhip, in which every one ought to ſhare; from which pride or any wrong ſentiment ought not to lead us to withdraw. Both men and women of the greateſt reſpectability in our country have, and their children do every Sunday perform a part in choirs and ſinging ſeats. Much diſcouragement ariſes on this head from an ungracious reluctance: an affected cough or cold: This often diſguſts and offends— affords an opportunity to deny that pleaſure which enlivens company and cheers the ſad. Good ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are often the moſt diſobliging perſons we meet with.</p>
            <p>DANCING forms a part of education as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets that eaſy deportment which makes us appear leſs aukward and reſtrained in company. It is an innocent recreation and relaxation for the ſedentary.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023649_0021_0FC08D82E8BF32B8"/>
It promotes health and cheerfulneſs. It is part of the amuſement of ſocial hours among friends and ſtrangers—among perſons of various purſuits and principles. It wears away the ruſt of prejudice. Seeing each other in their beſt dreſs and moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant face, the blood being ſet into circulation by motion and muſic, ſpleen flies —harmony reigns, and imperceptibly diffuſes its pleaſing effects. But all theſe, under the ſtricteſt rules of decorum and good order.</p>
            <p>THE character of the virtuous woman I have drawn, is from the bible. The thoughts are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally adapted to the paſtoral and agricultural ſtate. The patriarchs and their deſcendents in Judea, were principally engaged as ſhepherds and tillers of the ground. Similar in a great degree is the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States. Agriculture and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures are the foundation of our national wealth and proſperity; they ought to be promoted by all claſſes of citizens. They lead to induſtry—and preſerve health, virtue and piety. The volume of inſpiration is doubly enhanced, and more worthy to be ſtudied to form good men and women, as the characters are real. We need not ſearch the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of romance and fiction, of poets or fine writers for this purpoſe. The heart cannot be ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023649_0022_0FC08D8467005060"/>
or head inſtructed and uſeful manners form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as from that book which alſo contains the words of eternal life.—The grand adverſary of man, never invented a better plan to build up his kingdom, than when he baniſhed the bible from ſchools, and led men of real abilities and learning to join in the ſyſtem, from <hi>affected</hi> reverence to its character.— Others improving upon the idea, have made it an engine by which to introduce infidelity. If this is not the caſe, why are deiſts and their abettors, ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious and zealous on this head? I hope Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans will awake to wiſdom, and while they avoid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting portions of ſcripture to be committed to memory by ſchool-boys as a penance for faults, they will permit it to be read as a privilege in ſchool, as a mark of honour and favour to thoſe who have fartheſt advanced in good morals and reading.</p>
            <p>No volume affords ſo uſeful a field, for tuning the voice to the various ſentiments of the writers in order to benefit both reader and hearer as this. The four goſpels afford a ſtile peculiarly adapted to all readers. Many of the moſt celebrated public ſpeakers, in theſe States, both in the pulpit and at the bar, were taught reading in the bible: <hi>They</hi> have
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023649_0023_0FC08D919F063708"/>
not loſt their reverence and love for it: It has not acquired ſuch indifference in their minds, as to be <hi>idly</hi> called in to lengthen out an oration or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: Is never uſed by them, but upon occaſions moſt worthy the ſanction of God's word. They bluſh for others, who vilely debaſe it to common and improper purpoſes. While our citizens retain the bible in their poſſeſſion and the reading of it in our ſchools and families, a moſt important mean is improved, to gain good morals, pure religion and that happy middle-ſtate between poverty and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. The ſacred oracles contain a ſublimity and purity, which like other excellent productions, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er weary by uſe. They form pure and elegant manners, free from pomp and oſtentation—from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity and gloomineſs. There we find all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God and our neighbour. There we are taught ſubordination to ſuperiors.</p>
            <p>UNDER this laſt is included our duty to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors of every kind. Unleſs children know how to <hi>obey,</hi> they will never be qualified to <hi>command.</hi>— Thoſe who are not properly governed at home are ſeldom orderly in ſchool, but often diſgrace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and parents, and injure others by their unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour. Parents and children are to be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023649_0024_0FC08D92A1676058"/>
pitied for their neglect herein. It is from defects in family government, that magiſtrates and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have much trouble.</p>
            <p>WE ought alſo to ſtrengthen the hands of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and not degrade them. I never envied the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of thoſe who have erred on this head;— bad children, diſorderly youth, and proud, unruly men, have amply puniſhed them for their impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.— Very difficult is the taſk to regulate the various tempers in a ſchool: much patience, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, wiſdom and prudence are neceſſary; we ought not therefore to make the taſk doubly ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by our childiſh inteference.</p>
            <p>PRIDE is always ready to intrude itſelf to interrupt our ideas on the ſubject of female education, and leads many to deſpiſe induſtry, with the pretence that it is not genteel to work: As if we had one order of men, who are to be aggrandized by degrading of another. An American's heart revolts at this idea —we know and ought to practiſe differently.— True gentility is founded upon chriſtian charity— that beſt of graces, which wiſhes and endeavours to do good to all; Its votaries are always humble, courteous, affectionate, wiſe and gentle. Riches
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023649_0025_0FC08D9D6DD1B898"/>
are often the portion of the vileſt of men, they confer no worth upon the poſſeſſor, any farther than with them he makes others happy. They often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a wicked and heavy heart. Luxury and faſhions are ſometimes ſtudied and indulged to caſt a veil over real faults, and to compenſate for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial injuries. He who founds an aſylum for diſtreſs—He who introduces an uſeful art by which the poor may earn bread, or reſcues a fellow mortal from deſtruction, is more deſerving of a ſtatue, than he who conquers a globe—and an induſtrious good wife is a more noble perſonage than a million of faſhionable flutterers. Virtue and merit are not known by title or parade, but by generous, manly, humane, diſintereſted actions. Art and addreſs often procure means to make an appearance before the world, even in public men; while a country may baſely leave their moſt meritorious citizens to beggary and inſult from thoſe who are exalted by the revolution of thoſe affairs, which have made others miſerable. Thus uncertain are all thoſe things which dazzle the eye, and lead the heart to place its happineſs in the uncertain pomp and pelf of this world.</p>
            <p>OUR good or bad fortunes are very little in our power. Providence permits one to riſe and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023649_0026_0FC08D9EB080E690"/>
to fall, in the language of mortals; but, many a beggar will be accepted at his bar, when the rich and the gay may be caſt out. The great concern is to maintain our integrity—to take heed leaſt adverſity diſcourage us, or land us in vice. It is criminal to become worſe by misfortune; but to amend is our glory. When I contemplate the real condition of many female orphans—the loſſes of families from the want of knowledge of buſineſs, in widowed mothers, and the cruel rapine and plunder committed upon their property—When I recall the lamentations and complaints of many, from men we would bluſh to mention, I am irreſiſtibly drawn to wiſh for that fortunate hour, when public or private benevolence will found inſtitutions alſo for depoſiting their property or ſhelters for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and places for their education.</p>
            <p>THAT ſuch aſylums may be erected is proved by the experiment already made by a <hi>proteſtant</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in our own country; where young females are annualy ſent from other places for education. More ſpecimens of ingenuity, and more uſeful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures are annually ſent from that ſociety to market, than from any other place in America. They thereby check coſtly importations in this
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023649_0027_0FC08DA024C66208"/>
line from abroad, and derive profit to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. All theſe things are done under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction of their own ſex, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant opportunity to grow in chriſtian knowledge; free from temptations to learn or commit wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>BUT becauſe we have heard of Roman Catholic nunneries, and <hi>idly</hi> abhor every thing that has the approbation of Papiſts (however <hi>excellent</hi>) we run into the oppoſite extreme. Where is the harm, if men or women chuſe a ſtate of celibacy during the whole or part of their lives? why may they not devote themſelves in a retirement, to the duties of piety, humility, humanity and induſtry? Is not their labour a ſufficient ſource of profit to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for protection? — But, if we wiſh to encourage early marriage, can this be effected in any better way than by giving our youth the beſt education, to enable them to maintain themſelves and families? Muſt we permit a promiſcuous intercourſe of both ſexes—and give full latitude to all the viſionary fancies of poets and romance writers on the ſubject of love, rather than form ſyſtems of real and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent uſe; and leave youth expoſed to fortune-hunters and ſpendthrifts? Men of real virtue prefer
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023649_0028_0FC08DAD7A071270"/>
a companion who is not educated among the croud of idlers. Leading or indulging in faſhions and gaiety, confers no real excellence upon men or women: Thoſe who do, are the leaſt eſteemed in the opinion of the wiſe and good. True gentility needs no plumes, its own excellencies ſhine without them.</p>
            <p>A VERY powerful argument preſents itſelf upon the ſubject of education, as we are a country of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed patriots; who have contended for the rights of poſterity. Shall we neglect to provide for the inſtruction of that poſterity, and leave them to live and die in ignorance—and conſequently plunge them in vice and deſtruction? If we do this by our own children, let us not forget the memory of thoſe who fought, bled and died in the late war.—Who have left large families to be guarded and protected by the country; who have not only loſt their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but property alſo. Shall religion and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm have no influence with us on this ſubject? What muſt poſterity ſay?—What will Britons judge of our principles and national character?— Engage in a war—call it a war of God—for the rights of men, and neglect in peace to afford the beſt bleſſing in life to our young and defenceleſs citizens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:023649_0029_0FC08DAF31FE4378"/>AS OUR children are to be made chriſtians and patriots, this ſubject is of the higheſt national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. It will promote our proſperity far ſooner than a fleet or army. Next to good laws and <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> lawgivers and rulers, it will promote our higheſt proſperity.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER important argument, why the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth ſhould be <hi>national</hi> and not of party care, is that thereby the greateſt benefit may ariſe to our children, when the encouragement and ſprings to application are equal. If the rewards for eminence are not in the public gift, men of the firſt character for learning and uſefulneſs may be neglected becauſe they are not the favorites of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſyſtems. Nay, what is equally to be avoided, they loſe the benefit of thoſe inſtitutions that their fathers and friends have formed and patronized. Until the education of youth is more particularly under the public care than at preſent, we cannot <hi>decently</hi> aſk the aid of a public purſe. If we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, we unfairly attempt to draw money from freemen without their conſent, and compel them to ſupport ſyſtems that conſcience leads them to wiſh might be altered, and under which many groan.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:023649_0030_0FC08DB0E0552150"/>THESE are true liberty principles: I deliver them to you in love as a freeman. I am ſupported in them by many claſſes of our beſt citizens; their writings, valour and ſufferings have ſealed their belief in them. By undiſguiſedly acting up to them, we begin to form a general ſyſtem—ſhall prevent rival inſtitutions from multiplying unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, while none are properly ſupported. Then may we hope to ſee the education of our daughters the ſubject of united aid. Then ſhall we ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pervert no man's charity—offend no chriſtian brother, but with double energy promote the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant purpoſes of true religion, good government, equal liberty and pure love.</p>
            <p>SOME of theſe laſt thoughts refer principally to literary inſtitutions, and where parents are opulent. But foundations to make the children of the poor uſeful, and to give them an opportunity to reap the benefit of thoſe good, and perhaps great abilities, which Heaven has beſtowed upon them as a rich gift, are equally the objects of public care. They are conſidered as ſuch in other countries. The mechanic and every other art, has been improved, and the world bleſſed by their labours, while many who have been born to inherit great eſtates, and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023649_0031_0FC08DBD63AC2808"/>
were allied to influential friends, have become vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and diſgraced human nature.</p>
            <p>WHEN we endeavour to form the female for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and uſefulneſs, that ſhe may be able to plead her own cauſe—defend her own rights, and in a good degree protect her own family againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of men; let me alſo warn women that they do not oppreſs their own ſex, and betray their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and honor into the power of ours: Let not covetouſneſs, unjuſt reſentment or cruel neglect, lead you to treſpaſs againſt the laws of piety, or the rules of right, and debaſe the native tenderneſs and delicacy of your part of the creation. Take heed that artful men do not make you acceſſary to your own deſtruction, and having led you to injure others, plot againſt, and undermine your own proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Beware leaſt you encourage vicious, debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated, diſeaſed and baſe men in their wanton out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages upon females. Remember how great is the reward for protecting the defenceleſs, the weak and inexperienced:—Remove them from temptation— correct their errors—reſtore their ſpirits—provoke them to virtue—teach them to reverence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Inculcate the importance of the female character, give them juſt ideas of themſelves and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023649_0032_0FC08DC2DB6FB268"/>
others:—See to it that idle viſionary thoughts have no place in their minds—When called to connect themſelves for life, let them be informed, that love is formed in mutual eſteem and mutual intereſt—that the eye has a very ſmall ſhare in forming juſt and durable attachments. Piety is the foundation, and virtue the ſtructure to be built by matrimonial alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. Without this, love will ſoon be exchanged for indifference and diſguſt; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>VERY many of the thoughts contained in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs are preſented to you, my female friends, of this Academy, for your ſerious conſideration; as well as others in this every numerous aſſembly. This ſubject is copious and pleaſing. I wiſh it may be beneficial.
