            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ANALYSIS OF The Report of the Committee OF THE VIRGINIA ASSEMBLY.</head>
            <p>THE Legiſlature of Virginia, having, on the 21ſt. December 1798, ordered certain reſolutions, cenſuring the adminiſtration of the Federal Government, to be tranſmitted for the concurrence of the Legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, and receiving in its laſt ſeſſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of ſome of the ſtates on thoſe reſolutions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable to their views, referred thoſe proceedings to a committee, and received a report, reviſing, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and juſtifying the reſolutions, and ſolemnly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them, as true, conſtitutional, and ſalutary.</p>
            <p>The reſolutions, embracing a variety of topics, if not intended, were well calculated, as a declaration of war by the ſtate of Virginia againſt the government of the United States; and the tranſmiſſion of them to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtates was well calculated to combine every ſtate, under the plauſible pretext of preſerving the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a ſyſtem of hoſtility againſt the Union. They
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036760_0003_100AB14701A40F28"/>have no doubt anſwered part of the purpoſe they were intended to effect, in the elections of the ſeveral ſtates; and the report now brings them forward, in their beſt ſhape, to influence the Union in the election of a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The report, evidently the work of one man, is drawn up with great art and ingenuity. With ſome it may be doubtful whether it be the work of a candid mind ingenouſly endeavouring to impreſs on others its own convictions; or the work of an ingenious mind uncan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly endeavouring to perſuade others to believe what it believes not itſelf. Of the end which it proſecutes ſuch is my opinion, that it cannot be proſecuted without a great ſacrifice either of principle or of underſtanding. In this opinion I may perhaps have to claim, and ought therefore to give, much charitable allowance for the ſteps by which an upright mind may be led to its own decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the report will hardly claim apology from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of underſtanding. In anſwers or refutations, a greater diffuſion of ſtyle is often requiſite, than in the propoſitions which give riſe to them. Much of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſubject muſt be repeated, to make the remarks on it intelligible. And ſome things, which yet may be doubted, cannot be more ſhortly expreſſed. If in the analyſis which I am about to undertake of the reaſoning in the principal points in this report, I can attain to any conſiderable degree of its claſſical brevity of expreſſion, it is more than I expect, and all that I deſire.</p>
            <p>The 1ſt. and 2d. reſolutions vindicated by the report profeſs a maintenance of the Conſtitution, and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Union of the United States. This is well, if it be ſincere: but proſeſſions of this kind, put in, by way of proteſtation, that things in themſelves evil, may be conſtrued as favourable as poſſible, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a preface to matter of very different tendency, and may perhaps be more juſtly conſidered as ground of ſuſpicion, than means of juſtification, of the principal matter.</p>
            <p>The 3d. reſolution declarea <hi>"the powers of the Federal Government as reſulting from the compact to which the ſtates are parties, no farther valid, than they are authorized by the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036760_0004_100AB14883FE7218"/>grants enumerated in that compact; and that, in caſe of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, palpable, and dangerous exerciſe of other powers, the ſtates, who are parties thereto, are bound to interpoſe, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining within their reſpective limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties, appertaining to them."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without controverting the ground on which this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is ſupported, or remarking on the vague terms in which it is couched, I ſhall diſcuſs its main purport, <hi>that the ſtotes are bound to reſtrain within their limits the authority of the Federal Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among a variety of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, of which the word <hi>ſtates</hi> is ſuſceptible, the report adopts the following, as the ſenſe in which it is to be underſtood in this reſolution: viz. <hi>the people in their higheſt ſovereign capacity.</hi> This ſenſe of the word <hi>ſtates,</hi> the report juſtly maintains, "becauſe, in this ſenſe the conſtitution was ſubmitted to the ſtates: in this ſenſe the ſtates ratified it; and in this ſenſe the ſtates are parties to the compact from which the powers of the Federal Government reſult." In this ſenſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the word <hi>ſtates</hi> is equivalent to <hi>the people of each ſtate,</hi> who are parties to the compact of the Union expreſſed in the conſtitution of the United States.</p>
            <p>This ſenſe of the word ſtates may be farther illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſupported by comparing the conſtitution with the confederation of the United States. The confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was an act, not of the <hi>people</hi> of each ſtate, but of the <hi>legiſlature</hi> of each ſtate. The delegates who framed it were choſen not by the people, but by the Legiſlature of each ſtate; it was ratified not by the people, but by the Legiſlature of each ſtate; and the members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs who acted under it were choſen not by the people, but by the Legiſlature of each ſtate: it was an Union of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Governments,</hi> rather than of the <hi>people,</hi> of the ſeveral ſtates; and the governments, not the people of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtates, were the parties to this compact. The dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates who framed the conſtitution were, indeed, alſo choſen by the Legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, becauſe they were choſen under the confederation; but they framed the conſtitution, not in the name of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036760_0005_100AB14ADCCA50C8"/>but of the <hi>people</hi> of the ſeveral ſtates; and they fubmitted it to the ratification, not of the Legiſlatures, but of the people of the ſeveral ſtates. The people, not the Legiſlatures, of the ſeveral ſtates did ratify it, and made it their act. And the people, not the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the ſeveral ſtates, thus became parties to this compact, and chooſe members of Congreſs to act under it.</p>
            <p>It appearing then, that the people of the ſeveral ſtates are the parties to the compact in the conſtitution, it will not follow that, becauſe the <hi>parties</hi> to a compact muſt be the judges whether it has been violated, the <hi>Legiſlatures</hi> of each ſtate are the judges whether the conſtitution has been violated. Yet this is the poſition maintained by the reſolution; and, unleſs this poſition be maintained, the reſolution fails. It ſeems clear, that the reaſoning in the reſolution does not ſupport it: and I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning that can ſupport it. To give the reaſoning in the report its full force, it amounts to this, and to this only. The people of the ſeveral ſtates in their ſovereign capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city are parties to the compact in the conſtitution; every party to a compact may judge of its violation: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Virginia, in their ſovereign capacity, are a party to this compact; therefore the people of Virginia, in their ſovereign capacity, may judge of its violation. It is manifeſt that this reaſoning will not ſupport the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; for it claims a right of the Legiſlature of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia to judge of the violation of the compact. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the reſolution, the reaſoning ought to be thus. The Legiſlature of Virginia is a party to the compact; every party to a compact has a right to judge of its violation; therefore the Legiſlature of Virginia has a right to judge of its violation. The premiſes are falſe, the concluſion is not true, and the reſolution fails.</p>
            <p>The people never act, in their ſovereign capacity, but either in framing or diſſolving a conſtitution. While the conſtitution is in force, the people are either ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or agents of the conſtitution. The powers of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty are divided by the conſtitution among ſeveral agents; the legiſlative, the judicial, the executive, and the elective agents. One or more of theſe powers
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036760_0006_100AB14C6B4C9458"/>may be exerciſed by the people; but not as ſovereigns, but as agents of the conſtitution. Each of theſe powers may be conſidered as a part of the ſovereignty, and the agents may be called the ſovereign for that part, and for that part only. For whenever they act on ſubjects not committed to them, they are uſurpers, not ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns. And the Legiſlature, acting on a judicial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is no more ſovereign, than the Judiciary acting on a legiſlative ſubject. It is uſurpation in either. The people of the United States have, for general purpoſes, united all the ſtates into one ſtate, territory, or empire; and have given general legiſlative, judicial, executive, and elective power to agents for this empire. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of each ſtate have given legiſlative, judicial, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive, and elective powers, within their ſeveral limits, to agents for thoſe limits. By authority derived from the people of each ſtate, ſubordinate powers are given to agents for inferior diſtricts of each ſtate. Within their powers, thoſe ſubordinate agents are as much ſovereigns as the Legiſlature of the ſtate. And the Legiſlature of Virginia has no more right to arraign the exerciſe of the powers of the Legiſlature of the United States, than county Commiſſioners of Pennſylvania, to arraign the exerciſe of the powers of the Legiſlature of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. The right of judging of the exerciſe of the powers of the Legiſlature of the United States is veſted in the Judiciary, or (to uſe the words of the report) in "the people in their higheſt ſovereign capacity." The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Virginia Aſſembly were choſen by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that ſtate to make laws for Virginia, not to judge of the laws of the United States. When they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to judge of the laws of the United States, they act not in a corporate or ſovereign capacity, but give their opinion as individuals, and without any public au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>The exerciſe of this judicial power, over the acts of the Federal Government, by the ſtate Legiſlatures, is as dangerous as it is illegal; and, with ſuch exerciſe of power, it may be averred, that the Union cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. The Legiſlature of Virginia conſiſts of more mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036760_0007_100AB14E8DEE40F0"/>than the Congreſs of the United States; and the Legiſlatures of the other ſtates are numerous. I ſhall not make any invidious diſtinction between the capacity and information of the members of the ſeveral ſtate Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures, and of the Federal Legiſlature; but I may fairly ſtate that influence is not in proportion to capacity and information, nor theſe in proportion to number; and I may fairly preſume, from the importance of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the opportunity of diſcuſſion, that the capacity and information of the Federal Legiſlature is ſuperior. Their integrity may be preſumed equal: for all are equally bound by the laws; and equally influenced by a conteſt for power. And the chance, that the Federal Legiſlature is in the right, may be better, from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, under the confederation, of exerciſe by the ſtate Legiſlatures of powers veſted by the conſtitution in the Federal Legiſlature. Extinguiſhed claims do not readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield to new rights. Suppoſing therefore the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Federal Legiſlature to be legal and proper, what chance would there be for its preſervation (with a people not always poſſeſſing the beſt means of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not ſeldom corrupted by falſe information) in a conteſt between it and the Legiſlatures of all the ſtates, each claiming to act by authority? In ſuch a conteſt, the preſervation of the Federal Government would ſeem to be a matter rather of miraculous, than of juſt, calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no reaſonable man would calculate upon it; and the diſſolution of the Union would be a conſequence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt neceſſary.</p>
            <p>If each of the ſtate Legiſlatures has authority to judge of the acts of the General Legiſlature, what chance would there be for uniformity of deciſion? Endleſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of opinion would exiſt; the paſſions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be embarked and diſtracted; and the Union would be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>The people of each ſtate, the parties to the compact, have not veſted their ſeveral Legiſlatures with this judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial power. They have given it to other agents, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary departments, riſing in various grades, from a Juſtice of the peace to the Supreme Court of the United
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036760_0008_100AB150AC002CE8"/>States, and all being the agents of the people. By ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering this power to remain where the people have placed it, uniformity of conſtruction can be regularly and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily attained. If corruption is to be preſumed, will the Legiſlature, a numerous body, with little profit or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration attached to their authority, have greater reſpect for their character, than the Judiciary will have? If there be a paramount judicial authority, its exerciſe reſults not to the Legiſlature, which is but another agent of the people, for another purpoſe, but to the people of each ſtate, the parties to the compact, who can correct the evil in their elective or ſovereign capacity.</p>
            <p>The 4th. reſolution <hi>"expeſſes deep regret, that a ſpirit has been manifeſted by the Federal Government, to enlarge its powers by forced conſtructions of the Conſtitution, and a deſign to expound certain general phraſes ſo as to deſtroy the effect of the particular enumeration, which neceſſarily limits them, and ſo as to conſolidate the ſtates into one ſovereignty, the tendency and reſult of which would be to transform the republican ſyſtem of the United States into an abſolute or mixed monarchy."</hi>

            <p>As inſtances of <hi>"a ſpirit in the Federal Government, to enlarge its powers by forced conſtruction,"</hi> the report enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates <hi>"The Alien and Sedition acts, the Bank-law, and the Carriage-tax."</hi> The two firſt are the ſubjects of very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere cenſure in a ſubſequent reſolution. I ſhall on this point only obſerve, that the judiciary of the United States, the agents of the people for this purpoſe, have determined, that the Sedition-act and the Carriage-tax are within the conſtitutional power of Congreſs, by a juſt and not forced conſtruction; and it lies not in the mouth of the Virginia legiſlature, to controvert this. And, with reſpect to the Bank-law, it will be recollected, that the Congreſs under the confederation did deliberately, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, and almoſt unanimouſly, incorporate and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Bank of North America,<note n="*" place="bottom">Journals 26th. May and 29th. December 1781.</note> which remained in exiſtence at the formation and adoption of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States. So notorious an exerciſe of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036760_0009_100AB152E85D6F60"/>this power, by a Congreſs of far leſs authority than that which eſtabliſhed the Bank of the United States, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and unnoticed by the conſtitution, ſeems a ſtrong argument, that the power to eſtabliſh Banks exiſted in Congreſs under the confederation, and exiſts under the conſtitution. This argument is ſtrengthened by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that Mr. Madiſon, one of the four members of Congreſs who voted againſt the eſtabliſhment of the Bank of North America, and a member of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee who made the report to the Virginia Legiſlature, was a member of the general convention, which framed, and of the Virginia convention which adopted, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Strength is alſo given to this argument by the general acquieſcence in the eſtabliſhment of the Bank of the United States. So that the cenſure of the report looks rather like a pettiſh adherence to an obſtinate prejudice than a ſound opinion on a conſtitutional point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"The deſign to expound certain general phraſes in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſo as to deſtroy the effect of the particular enumeration which neceſſarily limits them,"</hi> has, it ſeems never manifeſted itſelf in any act of the Federal government; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port juſtifies the reſolution, from a vague reference to <hi>"debates in the Federal Legiſlature,"</hi> from <hi>"a report of the late Secretary of the Treaſury on manufactures,"</hi> and from <hi>"a report of a committee of Congreſs on the promotion of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture."</hi> Admitting the cenſorial power exerciſed by the Virginia Aſſembly, their vigilant exerciſe of it is highly meritorious, ſince it is not merely corrective but preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and, like the laws of Heaven, extends not merely to the conduct but to the heart, not merely to acts but to deſigns, not merely to any branch of the adminiſtration, but to every member and agent of any branch.</p>
            <p>The reſolution mentions no general phraſe, which a deſign appears ſo to expound, as to deſtroy the effect of the particular enumeration neceſſarily limiting them. This defect is ſupplied by the report, which ſtates, that "the general phraſes here meant muſt be thoſe of <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the common defence and general welfare."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proofs of a deſign to pervert the conſtruction of theſe phraſes are debates in Congreſs, a report of the late
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036760_0010_100AB155EAF18BA8"/>Secretary of the Treaſury, and a report of a committee of Congreſs. No debate in Congreſs is ſpecified as a proof of this. If any were, it would be proof only of a deſign or miſtake of the individual member. It is ſtated "that in the Secretary's report, it is expreſsly contended to belong to the diſcretion of the National Legiſlature, to prenounce upon the objects which concern the <hi>general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi> and for which, under that deſcription, an appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of money is requiſite and proper. And there ſeems to be no room for a doubt, that whatever concerns the general intereſts of LEARNING, of AGRICUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE, of MANUFACTURES, and of COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERCE, are within the ſphere of the National Councils <hi>as far as regards an application of money."</hi> "The report of the committee on agriculture" (it is ſtated) "aſſumes the ſame latitude of power in the National Councils, and applies it to the encouragement of agriculture." It was not thought prudent to mention, that theſe principles had been ſanctioned by the judgment of the late Preſident of the United States. The venerable name of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, whom even envy and malice, the conſtant attendants of living virtue, now ceaſe to diſturb in his grave, might have covered theſe principles with ſuch a ſhield of integrity and wiſdom, that the aſſaults of the Virginia Aſſembly would have been harmleſs. But, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſheltering them in the ſhade of an ILLUSTRIOUS name, let us examine the reaſoning with which they are oppoſed.</p>
            <p>The report of the Virginia committee ſtates, <hi>that the power given to Congreſs by the conſtitution, "to provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States," is limited by the ſubſequent enumeration of particular caſes, and extends not beyond them.</hi> This poſition it ſupports, <hi>by the ſimilarity of expreſſion in the</hi> 8th. <hi>article of the confederation, and in the</hi> 8th. <hi>ſection of the 1ſt. article of the conſtitution of the United States;</hi> and by a concluſion, <hi>that if the general phraſes were ſo limited in the confederation, they muſt be ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in the conſtitution.</hi> The concluſion might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared juſt, if the conſtitution had manifeſted no deſign to enlarge the powers of Congreſs; if our union under the conſtitution had been, as under the confederation, an
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036760_0011_100AB1580A82EEE8"/>union of governments, and not, as to general purpoſes, an union of people; and if Congreſs were not now, what it was not formerly, a repreſentation of the people in each ſtate, as the Aſſembly of each ſtate is a repreſentation of each county of that ſtate. In ſuch a great change of circumſtances, the concluſion, that the powers remain the ſame, is hardly logical, and ſurely not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The Virginia report contends, that, though Congreſs has power to raiſe money and apply it to provide for the general welfare of the United States, <hi>it has no power to apply money to any caſe not ſpecially enumerated in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whenever money is to be applied to a particular meaſure, a queſtion ariſes whether the particular meaſure be within the enumerated authorities veſted in Congreſs. If it be, money may be applied, if it be not, no ſuch application can be made. This interpretation is enforced by the clauſe in the conſtitution, which declares that no money ſhall be drawn from the Treaſury, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence of appropriations made by law. An appropriation of money to the general welfare, would be deemed rather a mockery, than an obſervance, of this conſtitutional injunction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The GREAT FATHER of his country, the committee of Congreſs, and the late Secretary of the Treaſury, may be fairly believed as competent to give a juſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the conſtitution as the Virginia committee, and their interpretation will not be weakened by the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the conſtitution as the Virginia committee, and their interpretation will not be weakened by the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Virginia committee, but ſo far as this is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by reaſoning. The late Secretary of the Treaſury ſays, and he is ſupported by the late Preſident, and by the committee of Congreſs, that it belongs "to the diſcretion of the National Legiſlature, to pronounce upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which concern the general welfare, and for which, under that deſcription, an appropriation of money is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite." The neceſſity of an appropriation before money can be drawn, and the <hi>mockery,</hi> if there were any, of an appropriation to the general welfare, will not operate againſt this interpretation. Congreſs will firſt pronounce, that a certain meaſure is neceſſary or conducive to the general welfare of the United States, and direct the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its eſtabliſhment, and then appropriate money to that particular meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:036760_0012_100AB1598E9BAB78"/>
There is nothing therefore in the Virginia reaſoning to invalidate the interpretation of the late Preſident, the committee of Congreſs, and the late Secretary; and it will not be pretended, that, on mere authority, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Virginia committee or Aſſembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorves a preſerence.</p>
            <p>The Virginia report argues not fairly. On the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that Congreſs has no powers but thoſe ſpecified in the conſtitution, it concludes, that the power by the firſt clauſe of the 8th. ſection of the Iſt article of the conſtitution granted to Congreſs "to raiſe money to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the general welfare," is explained and limited by the ſubſequent clauſes, which ſpecify the inſtances, and the only inſtances, in which Congreſs has power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the general welfare of the United States. On this ground, all the other clauſes, and Congreſs has no power but one, to raiſe money, or, in the words of the conſtitution, "to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſes and exciſes;" and all that follows of this ſection is only deſcriptive of the objects, to which this money is to be applied; the firſt clauſe deſcribing the object in <hi>general phraſes,</hi> and the other clauſes detailing the <hi>particular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> comprehended within thoſe general phraſes. This ſection will then amount to this: Congreſs ſhall have power to raiſe money, <hi>in order to borrow money, in order to regulate commerce, in order to eſtabliſh an uniform rule of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization and uniform laws of bankruptey, in order to regulate the value of money and fix the ſlandard of weights and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in order to provide for the puniſhment of counterfeiting, in order to ſecure to authors and inventors the excluſive right to their writings and diſcoveries, in order to conſtitute tribunals, in order to deſine piracies, in order, &amp;c. &amp;c. and for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe whatever.</hi> This interpretation of the conſtitution will ſeem abſurd, but it is clearly ſupported by the reaſoning of the Virginia committee. If their interpretation can be ſupported, mine may be alſo, and if mine fails, ſo muſt theirs. For if the phraſe "general welfare," do not imply a diſtinct power, (or duty which involves a power) but be limited by the ſubſequent phraſes, all the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent phraſes taken together can mean no more that it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:036760_0013_100AB15BE5FBC528"/>
Admitting that Congreſs has no powers but thoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the conſtitution, and that the 8th. ſection of the 1ſt. article is a ſpecification of their powers, it ſeems clear, that (inſtead of the firſt clauſe being general phraſes explained and limited by the ſubſequent clauſes) every clauſe gives a diſtinct power, and every power is coupled with a duty, the diſcharge of which is ſubmitted to the diſcretion of Congreſs. Thus the firſt clauſe impoſes on Congreſs a <hi>duty</hi> "to provide for the common defence and general welfare" of the United States; and ſubmitting to the diſcretion of Congreſs what objects or meaſures are neceſſary or conducive to theſe ends, for their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives to Congreſs a <hi>power</hi> "to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and exciſes." The ſecond clauſe gives another power to the exerciſe of which a duty is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily impoſed, whenever Congreſs, in its diſcretion, ſhall think its exerciſe neceſſary. And ſo of every other clauſe of this ſection.</p>
            <p>It ſeems ſtrange indeed, that expreſſions in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which gave no internal legiſlative powers to Congreſs, ſhould, by the Virginia committee, be applied to limit expreſſions in the conſtitution avowedly made to give to Congreſs internal legiſlative powers. Under the Confederation, it was the <hi>duty</hi> of Congreſs "to manage the general intereſts,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Confederation, Article 5.</note> provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but for this purpoſe, they had no <hi>power</hi> to raiſe money. The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution has, to this duty, united this power; and Congreſs has, under the conſtitution all the ſuperintending and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident duty which Congreſs had under the confederation, together with all the legiſlative power, for the diſcharge of this duty, which the confederation had left with the ſeveral ſtates. The 8th. article of the confederation was not a limitation of the powers of Congreſs, but a direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how the money, for the exerciſe of thoſe powers, ſhould be raiſed by the ſtates. The neceſſity of an auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary ſtate power, to enable the Federal Government to diſcharge its duties, and the impoſſibility of efficaciouſly obtaining this aid, was the great defect of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036760_0014_100AB15E9D780970"/>This is ſupplied by the conſtitution, which gives to Congreſs all legiſlative power, for the execution of their duties; and makes the government of the United State; a compleat government with all powers within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for general purpoſes. In judging of the power of Congreſs under the conſtitution, we muſt not limit it by the power of Congreſs under the confederation: for it has now all the power which the former Congreſs had to preſcribe and require, and the power which the ſtate le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures had to execute or provide means for executing the preſcriptions and requiſitions of Congreſs. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per compariſon between the powers would therefore be, that in caſes where the former Congreſs could officially, and for the general welfare, require the ſtate legiſlatures to paſs laws; the preſent Congreſs can paſs thoſe laws itſelf. Thus if the former Congreſs had declared to the ſeveral ſtate legiſlatures, that the United States were in danger from the reſidence of Aliens, and the prevalence of Seditious Libels; and that the general welfare required that each ſtate ſhould paſs Alien and Sedition laws; would any one doubt that it was the duty of each ſtate to obey this requiſition? And if it was the duty of each ſtate legiſlature to do ſo then; is it not the duty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to do ſo now when legiſlative powers have been given to enable Congreſs itſelf to diſcharge all its duties?</p>
            <p>As the Conſtitution thus enlarged the powers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, it enlarged alſo the control of the people over the exerciſe of thoſe powers, by giving to the people of the United States the immediate election of Repreſentatives in Congreſs, without whoſe conſent no act of Congreſs can be made. So that now the General Legiſlature hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power over all general concerns and care of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral welfare, ought to be deemed as immediately the repreſentatives, and as juſtly intitled to the confidence of the people of the United States, as the ſtate legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the repreſentatives, and intitled to the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the people of their reſpective ſtates. The wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the ſeveral ſtates is intruſted to the care of their ſeveral legiſlatures; and the general welfare to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Legiſlature, with competent powers to each for the diſcharge of the duties impoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:036760_0015_100AB160D73256D8"/>
As the Conſtitution plainly gives to Congreſs power over the means to provide for the general welfare, the propriety of exerciſing this power by the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people of the United States can hardly be queſtioned. The regulations of no ſtate can extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its own limits; and the concurrence of all the ſtates, in every meaſure neceſſary for the general welfare, is not to be expected, or muſt be tardy and incumbered. If Congreſs, therefore, do not apply their power over the means to every caſe of general welfare, ſome caſes will be unprovided for; and Congreſs, by neglecting to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its power, will neglect its duty, and betray the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of its conſtituents, the people of the United States.</p>
            <p>The condition in which the Virginia report would place the nation of the United States is ſingularly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; a nation without authority to provide for its own welfare. The individual ſtates cannot provide for it: for their authority is limited within their ſeveral boundaries. Congreſs, as the report ſays, cannot provide for it: for its authority extends only to <hi>ſome</hi> caſes of the general welfare. The conſtitution is not ſo abſurd. It gives to Congreſs power over the means, and impoſes the duty of providing for the general welfare in all caſes whatever, to which in its diſcretion the means ought to be applied. And this power and diſcretion is to be controlled, like the power and diſcretion of the ſtate legiſlatures, by the judiciary, or by the people in their elective or their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign capacity.</p>
            <p>If ſuch then be the juſt conſtruction of the conſtitution, the objection ſtated in the report, that it tends to conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the ſtates into one ſovereignty, has no force; for the conſtitution is the work of the people of the United States; and an objection to a juſt conſtruction of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is an objection to the conſtitution itſelf, which is an objection to the act of the people of the United States, and will not lie in the mouth of the Legiſlature of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, who are but agents, for a particular purpoſe, of a part of the people of the United States.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:036760_0016_100AB1625F5291E8"/>
Ever ſince the "United States aſſumed a ſeparate and equal ſtation among the powers of the earth," they have been, as every nation muſt be, conſolidated, as to general purpoſes into one ſovereignty. The confederation veſted the powers of this ſovereignty in Congreſs; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution enlarged the powers of this ſovereignty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging alſo the control of the people over the exerciſe of thoſe powers. The enlargement of the general autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the United States, become indiſpenſable, was effected by a diminution of the individual authority of the ſeveral ſtates. What was taken from one ſet of agents of the people, was given to another ſet of agents of the people; and the control of the people over their agents was ſtill preſerved. The authority of the people was not diminiſhed, the power only of their agents was altered. That there ſhould be a ſovereignty, or power co-exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive with the territory, and adequate to the general wants and [welfare, is not an objection, but a praiſe, to the ſyſtem of government adopted by the people. If it can be urged as an objection, it will lie only againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of territory, not the extent of power, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, not to a diminution of power, but to a diminution of territory—to a diſſolution of the Union—a ſeparation of the ſtates. Is it to this concluſion that the report would lead?</p>
            <p>That a power to raiſe money in order to provide for the general welfare, or a power to provide for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral welfare, ſhould, by any poſſible conſtruction be ſo extended as to amount to a power to <hi>legiſlate in all caſes whatever,</hi> and ſo to conſolidate the ſtates into one ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, ſeems a ſuppoſition ſo extravagant, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſuade myſelf, it will ever be honeſtly and ſeriouſly urged. But admitting it poſſible (probable it is not) is it a greater evil, that the general welfare of the United States ſhould be provided for by one body of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people, inſtead of ſeveral; or ſhould be left altogether unprovided for?</p>
            <p>This dreaded <hi>conſolidation of the ſtates,</hi> and its portended reſult, the <hi>transformation of our republican ſyſtem into a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> I cannot confider as the work of honeſt rational
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036760_0017_100AB166024B3820"/>conviction, but as either the fiction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, or the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of party on the paſſions, prejudices, or inexperience of the people. If it have a rational foundation, it muſt be this, that a general authority of a republican form cannot be exerciſed over ſo extenſive a territory as that of the United States. From this poſition the concluſion will be, either that there muſt be a diminution of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in other words, a ſeparation of the Union; or our republican government muſt be changed to a monarchy; or the welfare of the United States muſt be unprovided for, which, in other words, is, that the powers ſhall be incompetent to the purpoſes of government. Can any fears of a change of government juſtify the with-holding from government the means of providing for the welfare of the people?</p>
            <p>The report contends, that the reſult of conſolidation will be monarchy, <hi>"becauſe the legiſlature will increaſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the executive, by delegating to it legiſlative powers; becauſe the conſolidation will increaſe the patronage of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and becauſe this increaſe of prerogative and patronage will either enable the Chief Magiſtrate, quietly and repeatedly, to ſecure his election, and finally to regulate the ſucceſſion; or will render the elections of Chief Magiſtrate ſo violent and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, that the public voice itſelf might call for an hereditary in place of an elective ſucceſſion."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpend time in diſcuſſing conjectures like theſe; but will juſt obſerve that any prerogative, given by the legiſlature to the executive, may be reſtrained, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the power which gave it, and the legiſlature will always be under the control of the people; that the people will always control the election of Preſident in ſpite of all patronage, while they remain uncorrupted, and fit for the exerciſe of their rights; that if corruption in the people admit hopes of monarchy, ſuch hopes, with the preſent or without any patronage, will excite violence ſufficient to produce the effect dreaded from it; and that, if the public voice ever call for an hereditary ſucceſſion, no conſtitutional proviſions can prevent it.</p>
            <p>But I am not convinced that a republican form, with a proper diſtribution of authority and power, is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036760_0018_100AB16785FBAD60"/>for the government of an extenſive territory.

            <p>The 5th. reſolution <hi>"proteſts againſt the palpable and alarming infractions of the conſtitution in the caſes of the Alien and Sedition acts; the firſt of which exerciſes a power not dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the Federal Government, and by uniting legiſlative and judicial powers to executive, ſubverts the principles of free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the proviſions of the Federal Conſtitution; and the other of which alſo exerciſes a power not delegated, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbidden by the conſtitution, a power which, more than any other, ought to produce univerſal alarm, becauſe levelled againſt that right of freely examining public characters and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and of free communication among the people, which has ever been juſtly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right."</hi>

It is ſufficiently underſtood, that their amendment of the conſtitution here relied on, like other amendments, made little, if any, alteration of the conſtitution. Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the confederation, it proceeded from a falſe jealouſy, riſing from a falſe principle, and applying to a compact made by the people, of power to be exerciſed by repreſentatives of the people, reſtrictions in a compact made by the governments, of power exerciſed by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of governments. However this may be, it will not be pretended, that this amendment deprives the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the United States of any power given it by the conſtitution; nor that Congreſs, under the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has leſs power than Congreſs had before; nor that any nation would be ſo abſurd, as to form a government without power to manage its general intereſts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for its common defence and general welfare. Nor will it be denied, that the government of the United States has power to carry on intercourſe with foreign nations, make war or peace, or form treaties of alliance and commerce; and that no individual ſtates has any authority to interfere in any foreign affairs; nor that the government of the United States is intruſted with the management of its general intereſts, with providing for the common defence and general welfare, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of each ſtate againſt invaſion, and domeſtic vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, with the preſervation of the peace and ſafety of the United States, and with power to make all laws ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and proper for executing its powers and duties. Nor will it be demed, that aliens may be dangerous to the peace and ſafety of the United States; nor that the government of every other nation has power to remove aliens, when and how it chooſes, on all reaſonable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in any reaſonable manner, without any reſpect to the rules by which it is governed in the puniſhment or reſtraint of its own ſubjects. The declaration of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which raiſed the United States to the rank of a nation, gave to any government, which the people of the United States ſhould eſtabliſh with the charge of common defence and foreign intercourſe, all the rights which the law of nations gives to every ſovereign go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The people have eſtabliſhed the government of the United States with this ſovereign charge, and the law
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036760_0020_100AB16B499EE400"/>of nations gives it all ſovereign rights with reſpect to other nations. The reſtrictions of the conſtitution are not reſtrictions of external and national right, but of internal and municipal right. And power over aliens is to be meaſured, not by internal and municipal law, but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and national law. It affects not the people of the United States, parties and ſubjects to the conſtitution; but foreign governments, whoſe ſubjects the aliens are. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign governments, parties to the code of national law, may call the government of the United States to account for the abuſe of its right under this law; but the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States reſtrains it not. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States being excluſively veſted with the power of peace and war and foreign intercourſe, muſt be excluſively veſted with the means (and the admiſſion or expulſion of aliens may be one of the means) of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing or affecting either. And being charged with the common defence and protection againſt invaſion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic violence, the government of the United States, with a diſcretion to judge of the proper means, muſt be veſted with all means conducive to theſe ends, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, according to their reſpective objects, with the municipal law, and the law of nations. The conſtitution could never intend to make the government of the United States, as the report would make it, a government of duties without powers: for it was framed expreſsly to add powers to duties. The conſtitution was eſtabliſhed by the people of the United States, "to form a more perfect union, inſure domeſtic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, and promote the general welfare." Any conſtruction of this conſtitution, not unavoidable, which would deprive the government of any proper means to promote thoſe ends will be rejected. Whatever is fairly involved in any power granted by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a power granted by the conſtitution, and cannot be reſtrained by the proviſion that the powers not dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated are reſerved. And all powers of peace and war, and foreign intercourſe, and therefore the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing or affecting either, are delegated to the United States by the conſtitution, and prohibited by it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſtates.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:036760_0021_100AB16CE4B19DA0"/>
The next obſervation in the report is, <hi>that there is a diſtinction, by the law of nations, between alien enemies, and alien friends.</hi> To be ſure there is: Alien friends have by the law of nations certain hoſpitable rights ſubject to the reaſonable diſcretion of the government under which they live; and alien enemies have no rights. But the queſtion is, whether every government may not, when it judges it proper for its own ſafety, order and compell "aliens, members of a friendly nation," to depart out of its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory. Every government has, by the law of nations, authority to do this. The right of a nation to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive enjoyment of its own territory is, like the right of an individual to the excluſive enjoyment of his own houſe, a perfect right, ſubject only to the right of hoſpitality, an imperfect right, at the diſcretion of the owner. This is a doctrine too well eſtabliſhed by the law of nations, to need any authorities to ſupport it: a very ſlight inſpection of any book of this law will juſtify it. And, on this principle, it was thought neceſſary, to ſtipulate in the confederation,<note n="*" place="bottom">Article 4.</note> that "the people of each ſtate ſhall have free ingreſs and regreſs to and from any other ſtate, and enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce."</p>
            <p>A third obſervation is, that, "admitting the object of the alien act to be preventive, not penal juſtice, and within the power of the Federal Legiſlature; <hi>this power has not been exerciſed in a conſtitutional manner."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope, it has already appeared, that this power is given to the government of the United States: and, as its object is not municipal juſtice, either penal or preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but public national defence, and as it affects no party to the conſtitution, but a party to the law of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; its exerciſe is to be regulated, not by the conſtitution or municipal law, but by the general law of nations. Has the conſtitution preſcribed, that aliens, like "the citizens of each ſtate, ſhall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in every ſtate?" Was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial or retraction of an imperfect right, a favour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, ever called a <hi>puniſhment?</hi> Or has the law of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036760_0022_100AB16FA7089590"/>nations ever called the removal of aliens a baniſhment? It were well if the Virginia Aſſembly would allow to Congreſs as much preventive vigilance, with reſpect to dangerous aliens, as they have themſelves exerciſed in their aſſumed authority on the deſign to expound general phraſes; and would as readily ſuppoſe that aliens may be dangerous, as that the government of the United States may be corrupt.</p>
            <p>Having made theſe obſervations, the report proceeds to anſwer the arguments by which the alien act has been juſtified.</p>
            <p>The firſt anſwer ſuggeſts a doubt, <hi>whether the diſcretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power of admitting aliens be veſted in the Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in the ſtate governments;</hi> that is, whether, though Congreſs has power to eſtabliſh an uniform rule of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization, every ſtate has not a power to naturalize, without any regard to the uniform rule of Congreſs. Can the Virginia committee diſcover in the Federal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment a deſign ſo groſsly to pervert the conſtitution, as is manifeſted in this doubt? This committee, and the Secretary of the commonwealth of Pennſylvania, in a note to one of the laws of that ſtate, are the only patrons of this doubt that I know.</p>
            <p>"<hi>But it cannot be a true inference, that, becauſe the admiſſion of an alien is a favour, the favour may be revoked.</hi> A grant of land or a pardon may be a favour, but irrevocable. Admiſſion of an alien to naturalization is as much a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as admiſſion to reſidence."</p>
            <p>If the favour be complete in one act, as a grant of land, or a pardon, to be ſure, it cannot be revoked. But if the enjoyment of the benefit depend on the continuance of the benevolence, the favor may be revoked. If I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey my houſe gratuitouſly, and thereby part with all my right in it; I cannot deveſt the right I have conveyed. But if I give a ſtranger a lodging in it for a night, I may turn him out next day. Admiſſion of an alien to reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not admiſſion to naturalization: the firſt is revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, like a permiſſion; the other abſolute, like a grant. The author of the report, who had ingenuity to deviſe the illuſtration, did not want judgment to diſcern the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036760_0023_100AB1726BB08648"/>fallacy of the reaſoning. Admiſſion of aliens to reſidence is not a grant of naturalization: this, until the grant be abſolutely made, muſt depend on the continuance of the benevolence of the government towards them.</p>
            <p>I paſs by the four following anſwers to juſtifications of this act, either becauſe the juſtifications have been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and publickly eſtabliſhed before, or becauſe I think them not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The next is an anſwer to the juſtification, "that the means of preventing invaſions are included in the power of protecting againſt them."</p>
            <p>One would have thought it would not be denied, for it is evident, that a power to protect againſt invaſion did include a power to uſe all proper means to prevent it, or defeat its ſucceſs; and what means more proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect againſt invaſion can there be, than the means given by the alien act; a power to remove "aliens dangerous to the peace and ſafety of the United States, or concerned in any treaſonable or ſecret machinations againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof." As aliens are not entitled to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of citizens, any farther than the conſtitution and laws direct, and as the conſtitution ſays nothing of them, the legiſlature has a right to preſcribe in what manner, they ſhall be dealt with. As the legiſlature has referred to the diſcretion of the Preſident, to determine who of them ſhall be deemed dangerous, or concerned in any treaſonable or ſecret machinations againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as ſuch removed; and as their removal is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the law of nations, by which only it can be judged, and is a proper mean of preventing or defeating an invaſion, which is clearly the ſame as protecting againſt an invaſion; their removal in this manner ſeems clearly within the power and duty of Congreſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect againſt invaſions by a juſt and natural conſtruction of the conſtitution. To adopt an illuſtration uſed by the report, a municipal power to <hi>puniſh</hi> involves a municipal power to <hi>prevent:</hi> for the judge who can try a breach of the peace, can bind over to keep the peace. What a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal judge can do in the manner preſcribed by the municipal law, the legiſlature can do or direct to be done,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036760_0024_100AB173F0749E08"/>with reſpect to an alien, in any manner conſiſtent with the law of nations. Will the report deny that a power to protect againſt an evil includes a power over the means proper to prevent it? What would the committee think of a phyſician engaged for a yearly ſum, who ſhould tell his employer, when ſeized with a fever, <hi>I ſaw this fever coming on you, and could have prevented it; but I am engaged only to cure, and not to prevent diſeaſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The committee ſeem aware of ſuch abſurd reaſoning, and only refuſe to grant, "that a power to act on a caſe when it occurs, includes a power over <hi>all</hi> the means that <hi>may tend</hi> to prevent its occurrence." Is not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding power with diſcretion, a reaſonable with a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton diſcretion, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nferring a want of power from a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of its abuſe? On ſuch reaſoning what power might not be denied?</p>
            <p>To leſſen the force of the clauſe in the conſtitution en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining the government of the United States to protect againſt invaſion, the report conſiders it as <hi>"either a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification of the power of war in general, before granted, or as a duty ſuperadded to a power;"</hi> and reaſons thus, <hi>"In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion is an operation of war. To protect againſt invaſion is an exerciſe of the power of war. A power, therefore, not inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to war, cannot be incident to a particular modification of war. And as the removal of alien friends has appeared to be no incident to a general ſtate of war, it cannot be incident to a particular modification of war."</hi> If this reaſoning means any thing it muſt be this: a power not incident to war, is not incident to war; or a power not incident to all war, is incident to no war, or is not incident to invaſion. The firſt proves nothing: for the proof and the poſition are the ſame. The ſecond proves too much, and is therefore falſe: for there may be powers incident to ſome wars, or to invaſion, which are not incident to all war. One of the ſteps of the ſyllogiſm is falſe, and therefore the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cannot be conſidered as true. For it is not true, according to the law of nations, that the removal of aliens members of a friendly nation, if they are ſuppoſed dangerous, is not incident to a ſtate of war, or to very ſtate of reaſonably apprehended danger. The report ſays,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036760_0025_100AB1762F207400"/>that, <hi>"without this clauſe of the conſtitution, the power to protect againſt invaſion is included in the power to declare war."</hi> This on the principle ſo much relied on by the report, <hi>that general phraſes are limited by the particular ſpecifications and every power not ſpecified is refuſed,</hi> is ſaying, that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare war is to protect againſt invaſion. Preſumptions it would ſeem are admiſſible to leſſen, but not to enlarge, the powers of Congreſs.</p>
            <p>Without aſſenting to the reaſoning by which the next anſwer is ſupported (for I think it exceptionable) I ſhall not diſcuſs it; becauſe it ſeems not material to the main point. Can it be ſuppoſed that the conſtitution meant to deny the government of the United States the important right of uſing, towards other nations, all means, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the law of nations, for the common defence of the ſtates, and their protection againſt invaſion. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears from the conſtitution, that can ſhew, that the people of the United States meant to deny their own government any right, which, by the law of nations, any other ſovereignty enjoys with reſpect to foreign nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and the Alien law affects only foreign nations. The limits of power of any government, towards its own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, were never meant to be applied as limits of power of that government towards the ſubjects of other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. And the queſtion, whether a government conducts itſelf well towards a ſubject of another govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not a queſtion of municipal, but of national law: it cannot ariſe between the ſubject of another government and the government of which he complains, but between this and his own government. How then can the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of any one government be made a rule to decide this queſtion?</p>
            <p>If the candor and "reſpect," which the report pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, had been juſtly "felt;" the captious cenſure on an expreſſion in the report of a committee of Congreſs would have found no place in it. The conſtitution is the act of the people of the United States, and is the ſupreme law of the land; and no individual ſtate ever had power of the common defence, or of foreign intercourſe, war, or peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:036760_0026_100AB17946326918"/>
Not having acceſs, at preſent, to the Alien law of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, from which a juſtification of the Alien law of the United States has been drawn, I cannot ſatisfactorily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs the anſwer to this juſtification. From the miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the pronoun <hi>who,</hi> in the ſtatement of that law in the report, it is difficult to ſay, whether it be the alien or his government, that is the object of ſuſpicion of <hi>hoſtile deſigns.</hi> If it be the alien, the Virginia law is the ſame as the law of Congreſs. If it be the ſtate, an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of hoſtility is not hoſtility; there is no war, and the alien is an alien friend, who, from the reaſoning in the report, ought to be treated as a citizen, and not puniſhed, but for an offence actually committed. And the cruelty ſo much deplored in the report, would be the ſame under both acts, if a harmleſs alien were removed, whether his government were hoſtile or friendly.</p>
            <p>What remains of the report reſpecting the alien act, as to its union of legiſlative and judicial with executive powers, and the influence of this union, having been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and publickly diſcuſſed elſewhere; I ſhall content myſelf with obſerving, that this union can only be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, when it is conſtitutionaly and permanently eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; not when it is only occaſionlly permitted by the legiſlature, for a convenient and practicable execution of legiſlative power, and always under the control of the legiſlature, which is under the control of the people.</p>
            <p>On this reſolution, as it reſpects the Sedition act, the reports ſtates, "that it affirms; 1ſt. <hi>that this act exerciſes a power not delegated by the conſtitution:</hi> 2nd. <hi>that this power is expreſsly prohibited by one of the amendments to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and</hi> 3d. <hi>that this power ought, more than any other, to produce univerſal alarm; becauſe levelled againſt that right of free examination of public characters and meaſures, and free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication thereon, which has ever been juſtly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right.</hi>"</p>
            <p>I think, I am diſpoſed to treat all public authority, not perverted to improper purpoſes, with reſpect, and to examine the report with candour. But ſo extravagant ſeem the poſitions, and ſo dangerous their conſequences,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036760_0027_100AB17B59F026E8"/>in many parts of this report, that I cannot reconcile them with the ingenuity ſhewn in it, and, at the ſame time with ſincerity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> On the firſt point, the report begins with obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "that the Federal Government being compoſed of powers ſpecifically granted, with a reſervation of all others to the ſtates; <hi>the poſitive authority, under which the Sedition act could be paſſed, muſt be produced.</hi>" I have already mentioned, that this principle was introduced into the conſtitution, which is a government made by the people, from a falſe imitation of the confederation, a government made by the legiſlatures of the ſtates. From this it ſeems to be contended, that the Federal Government has no power, but ſuch as the conſtitution <hi>expreſsly</hi> gives. There is nothing in the conſtitution to juſtify this: and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port afterwards admits, "that particular parts of the common law may have a ſanction from the conſtitution, ſo far as they are neceſſarily comprehended in the tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical phraſes, which expreſs the powers delegated to the government; and ſo far as ſuch other parts may be adopted as neceſſary and proper for carrying into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the powers expreſsly delegated."</p>
            <p>In juſtifying the Sedition law, it had been urged, that it created no new offence; for every thing puniſhable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it was puniſhable at common law. Referring to this argument, the report cenſures, as <hi>"novel and extravagant, the doctrine lately advanced, that the common or unwritten law makes a part of the law of theſe ſtates in their united and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal capacity."</hi> And, to juſtify this, it reviews the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſtate of this country, and the effects of the declaration of independence, the confederation, and the conſtitution of the United States.</p>
            <p>The report admits, "that, prior to the revolution, the common law was the ſeparate law of each colony, but not operating through the whole as one ſociety; becauſe there was no common legiſlature or judiciary for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies." This confounds the term <hi>common</hi> with the term <hi>general,</hi> and argues, from the circumſtance of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written law</hi> being called the <hi>common law,</hi> that there could be no common law, becauſe there was no general legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036760_0028_100AB17CDF8C6A80"/>or judiciary over all the colonies. This is an abuſe of words. It alſo confounds principles: for it might as well be contended, that there can be no religion where there is no revelation; and no obligation, where there is no power to enforce it.</p>
            <p>What are now the United States were ſeparate colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſettled under the authority of England, and, as part of its territory, ſubject to its laws: for it is of the nature of colonies, to take with them the laws, rights, and duties of the mother country. The mother country may give its colonies power, more or leſs, to make laws for their ſeparate internal government, or may combine two or more of them in a confederacy, with power to make laws for the confederacy. But the government of the mother country remains the controlling head, and ſovereign power, in a legiſlative and judicial capacity; unleſs it deveſt itſelf of this authority; or until the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as in our caſe, grow to ſuch ſtrength, as to be able to ſupport itſelf, and deny the right and oppoſe the force of the mother country. As a colony of England, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, each ſtate was ſubject to the law of England, the general and controlling law of all; except ſo far as each had authority from England to alter this general law, according as their ſeveral circumſtances required.</p>
            <p>The law of England is of two kinds written and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written. The written is called the <hi>ſtatute law,</hi> becauſe compoſed of ſtatutes or acts of Parliament. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written is called the <hi>common law,</hi> becauſe founded on an implied common conſent, from long acquieſcence in its authority and uſe. The authority of both is thus equally the will of the community. The <hi>common law</hi> is founded on the law of nature and the revelation of God, to which all men are ſubject; on the law of nations, to which every nation is, as a nation, and the individuals compoſing it, ſubject towards every other; and on certain maxims or uſages, which have long prevailed, and been ſanctioned by judicial authority, as naturally riſing out of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances by which the ſubjects of that government were connected with each other, and therefore impoſing duties on the individuals of that nation towards each
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036760_0029_100AB17F021975D8"/>other. Of theſe maxims or uſages ſome are general, and prevail in every part of England; and ſome, from the ſeparate authorities formerly exiſting there, or from other circumſtances, are particular, and prevail only in certain parts. Parliament may adopt ſome part of this <hi>common law,</hi> and, by putting it in an act of Parliament, make it <hi>ſtatute law;</hi> or may alter or annul it by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Any part of the common law may alſo ceaſe, or become obſolete, by the circumſtances ceaſing to exiſt, which manifeſtly were the reaſons of its eſtabliſhment: and this will be conſidered as a repeal by the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which enacted. The colonies, therefore, ſeverally carried with them all the common law of England, which was applicable to their circumſtances, with power, ſo far as given by the mother country to alter this law, by the acts of their ſeveral legiſlatures. Thus, the circumſtances of each colony more or leſs differing, and each having a diſtinct legiſlature; the common law throughout the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies would be, in part, general maxims or uſages pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in all the colonies; and, in part, maxims or uſages prevailing only in one or ſeveral of the colonies. The government of the mother country was the general ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending government.</p>
            <p>The declaration of Independance, though it annulled the power of Britain over the colonies, eſtabliſhed no ſuperintending government in its room; and each colony became a free and independant ſtate. But this could not alter any of the law of the ſeveral ſtates, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what neceſſarily reſulted from the change of ſituation. There was a common law in each ſtate before the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Independence, and it remained after this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
            <p>From every organiſation of individuals, of domeſtic or commercial connections, of ſocieties, and of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, certain powers and duties ariſe; a ſort of common law for the good of all concerned in the organiſation. Men can neither live without law, nor put every law in expreſs words. Incidental powers, without being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, reſult from every civil organiſation: for it is the will of thoſe concerned that it ſhould be effectual for its
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036760_0030_100AB181B4BD09A0"/>purpoſes. Thus, before the confederation, which gave the power, Congreſs formed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>; by a ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, which gave to Congreſs, as the only general organ, the authority uſually annexed to ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſame idea ſeems to be expreſſed in the report: "In the interval between the commencement of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, and the final ratification of the articles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation, the nature and extent of the union was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the circumſtances of the criſis." It would not indeed be "alledged, that the common law could have <hi>birth</hi> during that ſtate of things." It was <hi>born</hi> long before; "in a time whereof the memory of man run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to the contrary." The coloniſts brought it with them from their native land, with their other poſſeſſions, for their common protection againſt murderers, againſt thieves, and againſt <hi>libellers;</hi> for the recovery of their debts, the execution of their contracts, and the redreſs of their wrongs, The people of every ſtate modify it according to their ſeveral circumſtances; and, ſo modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it has been conſtantly preſerved, and will be forever preſerved as a rule of right, and ſtandard of action. There never was a time in any ſociety or government, in which a common law did not exiſt: it is incidental to the conſtitution of every regular ſtate, and inſeparable from its exiſtence. However the condition of men, ſocieties, or governments may be modified; whatever ſhape or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they aſſume, certain rights, powers, and duties, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a common law, is attached to each.</p>
            <p>The confederation was not intended to give any legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative or judicial authority to the Federal government, except in a very few inſtances. But proving that there exiſted no one general authority over the whole, does not prove, "that the common or unwritten law makes <hi>not</hi> a part of the law of theſe ſtates in their united and national capacity." The confederation altered not the rules or nature of offences, treſpaſſes, or duties: the common law remained as it was, except ſuch alteration as reſulted from the change in the government.</p>
            <p>The laſt queſtion made by the report on this review of our ſtate is, <hi>"whether the common law, be introduced as a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036760_0031_100AB183F3194898"/>national law by the preſent conſtitution of the United States."</hi> Its introduction is admitted, ſo far as neceſſarily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in technical phraſes, or neceſſary and proper for the execution of given powers; but beyond this its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is denied by the report.</p>
            <p>It ſtates, that from the proviſion of the conſtitution, "that the judicial power ſhall extend to all caſes <hi>in law and equity,</hi> ariſing under this conſtitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made under their authority;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Article III. Section 2.</note> it had been inferred, that, beſides caſes ariſing under the laws and treaties of the United States, other caſes are preſumed to ariſe, by a common law, thus eſtabliſhed by the conſtitution. This inference appears juſt, and little, if at all, different from the admiſſion made by the report. Every organiſation of authority muſt have the means of protection and execution of the powers veſted in it. This is a <hi>common law</hi> in all countries, and in all caſes; and no ſuppoſition of other poſſible or probable conſtructions can leſſen the force of this reaſoning.</p>
            <p>From the expreſſion "caſes in law <hi>and equity,</hi>" and a ſubſequent expreſſion "that the appellate juriſdiction of the Supreme Court is of law and <hi>fact,</hi>" the report would exclude criminal caſes from federal juriſdiction; for cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal caſes <hi>in equity</hi> would be a language unknown to the law; and the <hi>fact</hi> in criminal caſes is not a ſubject of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething in a guilty mind and a bad cauſe, which will now and then betray itſelf. In the manner of Samſon with the Philiſtines, we might aſk the reporter how he came by the expoſition of this riddle. <hi>"Criminal caſes in equity is a language unknown to the law."</hi> To what law? To the common law ſurely. <hi>The fact in criminal caſes is not a ſubject of appeal.</hi> On what authority is this aſſerted? Not on the authority of the conſtitution; for it gives appellate juriſdiction in <hi>all</hi> caſes, with exceptions which the report ſays "do not mean criminal caſes." It is aſſerted on the authority of the <hi>common law</hi> only; and yet the report ſays <hi>"the common law has no authority under the conſtitution of the United States!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:036760_0032_100AB1861A17C770"/>
The report having thus palpably admitted the common law as part of the law under the conſtitution, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted, that particular parts of the common law comprehended under technical phraſes are ſanctioned by the conſtitution; the phraſe, <hi>all caſes in law and equity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a common law technical phraſe, and adopted in the conſtitution; we may fairly conclude that under this phraſe the common law juriſdiction of the Federal courts is ſanctioned.</p>
            <p>But on the authority of the common law, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects that, in criminal caſes there is no appeal from the finding of <hi>fact</hi> by a jury, to conclude, becauſe the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative juriſdiction of the Supreme Court is both as to law and fact, that criminal caſes are not within the juriſdiction of the Federal Courts, is not fair: for it amounts to this, that no words in a deſcription ſhall extend beyond the meaning of one word. This appellate juriſdiction may be as to fact in civil caſes, and as to law in criminal caſes: for it will not be denied, that on a judgment on a conviction in a criminal caſe in an inferior court, a writ of Error will lie in the Supreme Court. And, though, in caſe of an acquittal in a criminal caſe, by the <hi>common law,</hi> a new trial cannot be granted; yet, in caſe of a conviction, a new trial may be granted by the <hi>common law;</hi> and if the inferior court refuſe a new trial, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court may have appellate juriſdiction as to <hi>fact</hi> to grant it, where the conviction is contradicted or not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by evidence.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution provides that "all civil officers of the United States ſhall be removed from office on impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for, and conviction of, treaſon, bribery, or other high crimes and miſdemeanors.<note n="*" place="bottom">Art. II. Sect. 4.</note> But the party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed ſhall nevertheleſs be liable to indictment, trial, judgment, and puniſhment according to law.<note n="†" place="bottom">Art. I. Sect. 3.</note> And the trial of <hi>all</hi> crimes, except in caſes of impeachment, ſhall be by jury, and in the ſtate were the crime ſhall have been committed; or when not committed within any ſtate, at ſuch place as the Congreſs may by law have directed."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Art. III. Sect. 2.</note> Can it be ſuppoſed, that the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036760_0033_100AB1879F94BF50"/>here uſed are to be limited to the particular offences enumerated in the conſtitution; treaſon, piracy and felony at ſea, counterfeiting and bribery? Is not the phraſe <hi>high crimes and miſdemeaners</hi> a technical phraſe at common law? not a libel a miſdemeanor at common law? And may we not, from the expreſſions uſed in the clauſes of the conſtitution juſt cited, fairly conclude, that all offences, which are ſubjects of impeachment, or, when committed at ſea, of indictment in the Admiralty courts, are when committed at land, and againſt the authority of the United States, ſubjects of indictment in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law courts of the United States? This opinion is fortified by the amendments to the conſtitution propoſed by the conventions of ſome of the ſtates, which ſpeak in ſuch general terms of the trial of crimes, of offences, of all ſuits at common law, of criminal proceedings by ſtates; and of making laws touching religion, as ſeem to ſuppoſe general legiſlative authority in Congreſs, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral common law juriſdiction in the courts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States.</p>
            <p>Whenever a government was eſtabliſhed for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, with judicial organiſation for the trial of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, there reſulted a common law juriſdiction in the Federal Courts, over all offences againſt the authority of this government. Government, the ſovereignty, is as it were the <hi>perſon</hi> of civil ſociety. And, like individuals in a ſtate of nature, governments in the civil ſtate will not ſubmit their wrongs to the determination of any other, but to themſelves alone. Every offence is an offence againſt the ſovereign. The ſovereign alone examines, tries, judges, puniſhes, or pardons it, according to its own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſation. The ſtate courts cannot try an offence againſt the Federal government only: there is no law empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering them. Proſecutions there are in the name of the reſpective ſtates, and puniſhed or pardoned by them. The courts of the United States cannot try an offence only againſt any of the individual ſtates. Thus the rights and honour of the ſeveral governments are reſpectively reſerved to themſelves, and full judicial authority veſted in each for their ſeveral protection.</p>

It is not neceſſary for me to controvert the poſition, "that ſection 2 of article III. of the conſtitution is a compleat enumeration of the powers of the Federal courts: for it is fairly proved from the report itſelf, that this enumeration includes the <hi>common law.</hi> But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is evidently wrong in ſaying that the ſecond para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of the 6th. article is an enumeration of thoſe powers.</p>
            <p>If the common law be <hi>not a law of the United States, and a guide to the Judges of the United States,</hi> and if the deſcription of the law of the United States in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution be a <hi>preciſe and compleat enumeration,</hi> excluding the rules of the common law, helpleſs indeed would be the ſuitors in the Federal courts, outlawed, as it were, from the protection of natural rights, the rules of common juſtice, of debts, contracts, and property, and of the redreſs of wrongs. Are not the Federal courts, in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing claims or injuries ariſing in any ſtate, bound to apply to them the law of the ſtate where they originate, and is not the common law part of the law of each ſtate? May not an action for a libel be brought in a Federal court, by a citizen of one ſtate, againſt a citizen of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate? Is it not an action at common law, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the rules of the common law? If this libel be for deſcribing the plaintiff as an impious atheiſt, a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer of God, will the common law, the principles of religion, be no guide to the Federal Judges? Have "the rights of man" no authority in the Federal courts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not enumerated in the Federal conſtitution? Or had they no authority, by a <hi>common law,</hi> till they were recorded in ſome conſtitution? By what law is a promiſe, contract, or grant valid? What law defines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachable miſdemeanors? By what law do legiſlative and judicial bodies puniſh contempts? Is it not by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law? Have the legiſlative and judicial organs of the government of the United States no ſuch power? Are they deſtitute of all ſuch means of protecting their own dignity and authority? And if they have ſuch means, from what law are they derived? From the common law ſurely.</p>

Confuſion has been introduced into the reaſoning of the report by an ambiguous application of the phraſe common law, uſing it ſometimes as a limit of juriſdiction, and ſometimes as a rule of judgment.</p>
            <p>Conſidering the common law as a limit of juriſdiction, the Legiſlature of the United States, as of every nation, has authority to make all laws neceſſary or proper for the defence of its own authority, but no other common law juriſdiction; and the courts of the United States have authority to determine all caſes ariſing under any law of the United States, and all caſes of miſdemeanor, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the authority of the United States. This plainly reſults from the nature of government, and is fairly deducible from the conſtitution. But the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expreſsly gives to the courts of the United States a further juriſdiction, either, on the principles of common law, for the protection of the peace, dignity and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the government, as in caſe of certain crimes, and in the caſe of foreign miniſters, and in caſes of maritime law; or for impartiality, as in diſputes between citizens of different ſtates, or for titles derived from different ſtates.</p>
            <p>As a rule of judgment, the <hi>common law,</hi> in all caſes where it is applicable, is an univerſal guide to the Judges of the Federal courts. It is no objection to the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this rule, <hi>that it may differ in different ſtates.</hi> The common law of England, ſo far as it reſts on general and local cuſtoms, differs in different portions of that territory. The Judges apply it, as it exiſts, as a rule to the caſe before them. The ſtatute law of each ſtate may differ; the Federal Judges will apply it, as the courts of the ſtate having juriſdiction over the caſe would apply it. So the common law of each ſtate will be applied by the Judges of the Federal court, as the judges of the ſtate, having juriſdiction over the caſe would apply it.</p>
            <p>It is no objection to the common law being conſidered by the conſtitution as a guide to the Federal courts, that <hi>this would give it a conſtitutional eſtabliſhment, make it part of the conſtitution, irrevocable by the legiſlature.</hi> The conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiders the law of each ſtate, both common and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036760_0036_100AB18E42C4C938"/>ſtatute law, a guide to Federal courts; but leaves all law to be modified by legiſlative authority, ſaving always the paramount authority of the United States. The Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral courts, like the ſtate courts, muſt take the ſtatute law of each ſtate, as it ſtands in the exiſting ſtatutes; and the common law of each ſtate, as it ſtands in eſtabliſhed uſages and deciſions. Whatever parts of the common law are altered by the change of circumſtances of the United States, by the conſtitution or laws of the United States within their conſtitutional limits, or by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or laws of the individual ſtates within their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional limits, will no longer remain law over caſes affected by the alteration.</p>
            <p>The picture drawn of the common law, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and conſequences ſtated in the report, from the introduction of this law into the Federal code, ſeem ſo merely the work of a buſy imagination, that any farther diſcuſſion of them would be uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Its preamble declares, that the people of the United States ordained their conſtitution, "in order to form a more perfect union, eſtabliſh juſtice, enſure domeſtic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and ſecure the bleſſings of liberty;" and from this, an argument was drawn for the power of Congreſs to paſs the Sedition-act. The report ſays, <hi>"a preamble uſually contains the general motives for the particular meaſures, and is always underſtood to be explained and limited by them."</hi> I will ſay, that, wherever the body of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument admits of two conſtructions, one of which will better than the other promote the intentions expreſſed in the preamble, that conſtruction which will beſt promote the intentions is the juſt conſtruction of the inſtrument. And it is a leſs evil, that the reſtrictions be not adhered to, in the moſt rigid ſenſe, than that the only govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed by the people with general powers ſhould, where a reaſonable conſtruction will prevent this, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of a power neceſſary or proper to promote the general welfare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:036760_0037_100AB19068A797C0"/>
The conſtitution enables Congreſs "to make all laws, which ſhall be neceſſary and proper for carrying into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution all powers veſted by it in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof;" and requires that the Preſident of the United States "ſhall take care that the laws be faithfully executed;" and that "the United States, ſhall protect each ſtate againſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and domeſtic violence." Hence it has been inferred, that, to enable the Preſident to take care that the laws are duly executed, and to ſuppreſs inſurrections, Congreſs has power to make laws to ſuppreſs the means, by which inſurrections and obſtructions to the execution of laws are uſually excited; and, as ſeditious libels are the moſt uſual and efficacious means, that Congreſs may make laws to ſuppreſs them. All this ſeems natural and logical enough. But the report ſays, <hi>that a power for faithful execution does not imply a power to provide that no oppoſition be promoted; and that a power to protect againſt inſurrection, does not imply a power to prevent it. There is no doubt that libels on the government will excite inſurrections; but government ſhall not ſuppreſs libels; for it may ſuppreſs the inſurrections. Let the libels go on till they have excited an inſurrection, and then the government can take all neceſſary and proper meaſures for its ſuppreſſion. If then the combination be ſuch that the government has not force to ſuppreſs it, the government is not to blame; it has uſed conſtitutional means, and the conſtitution is overturned in due form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The report, admitting that the grant of a power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the means of rendering it effectual, <hi>limits thoſe means to ſuch as are ſtrictly neceſſary for its execution.</hi> It, therefore admits that the grant of the crop growing in a field includes a power to cut down, carry off, and ſecure the grain; <hi>but not to repair the fences, nor keep off the cattle from deſtroying it before it is ripe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Congreſs has power to make all laws neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution the powers veſted in the Federal Government, yet the report will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that this implies a power to make all laws which <hi>may have a tendency, whether proper or not,</hi> for the execution of ſuch powers. I ſhall not diſpute this point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:036760_0038_100AB193B7C2AC68"/>
Though Congreſs has power to make all laws neceſſary and <hi>proper</hi> for carrying their powers into execution; yet the report contends, that Congreſs ſhall make no laws but ſuch as are <hi>neceſſary</hi> for this purpoſe. And, if the law which they make or means which they preſcribe be not neceſſary, but only proper; they have no authority for the law or the means, and they are invalid; <hi>for the judiciary alone can determine the propriety of the law or the means!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The report has admitted, that a power to puniſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a power to prevent the miſchief. The judiciary will execute their preventive authority, by all the means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by law, whether common or ſtatute law. The legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature will execute their preventive power by ſtatutes. The diſcretion of the choice of means, neceſſary or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for executing their powers lies with the legiſlature. If the legiſlature chooſe means palpably unneceſſary and improper, the judiciary can then only exerciſe their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the authority of conſtruction of all laws veſted in this branch of government. But the legiſlature of Virginia ought not, in the exerciſe of uſurped power of judging of the means uſed by the Congreſs, or courts of the United States, for the execution of their powers, preſume themſelves wiſer than the conſtituted autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. A power over the end implies a power over the means; and a power to make laws, for carrying any power into execution, implies a power to make laws for preventing or removing obſtructions to the execution: and it is indifferent, whether thoſe obſtructions be acts of violence or acts naturally leading to violence. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of other governments, and of our own, has ſhewn us, that libels on the powers of government are obſtructions to the execution of thoſe powers, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lead to inſurrections. Denying the Federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the power of ſupreſſing libels is, therefore, denying it <hi>proper</hi> means, and may be denying it <hi>all</hi> means, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting its powers. For, if the libels proceed, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the powers of government may be too ſtrong for removal. This is veſting in the people "the holy right of inſurrection," while the government is veſted with the right of ſuppreſſing it; and leaving with the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036760_0039_100AB1954382F8B8"/>people the beſt means of exerciſing their right, while the government is ſtript of the beſt means of exerciſing the right veſted in it. With ſuch a diſpoſition of powers, we ſhould ſoon ſee a very unequal conteſt, with very fatal effects; and the moſt ſummary exerciſe of the people's ſovereign power over their ſervants, that the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern profeſſor of liberty could deſire. It would indeed bind the government, <hi>hand and foot,</hi> from all reſiſtance, till, in this condition, the knife was at its throat. This is the end to which the clamours againſt the Sedition act and a ſtanding army naturally tend. If the people would preſerve their government free they have their choice of the alternative; indictments to ſuppreſs ſedition, or a ſtanding army to ſuppreſs inſurrection. A government, poſſeſſing force, independent of public opinion, may more ſafely ſuffer public opinion to be tampered with. Samſon, while he retained his ſtrength, might ſlumber in the lap of Delilah, amidſt the ambuſh of the Philiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, or be incircled with the walls of Gaza. Let every government watch where its ſtrength lies, and guard it from corruption. If the ſtrength of a government, as of ours, lie in the opinion of the people, the corruption of public opinion will ruin the government. No injury to public opinion is too ſlight to be overlooked; for every injury to it is a wound in a mortal part. "Lilliputian ties" intwined in Gulliver's hair made him ſurrender at diſcretion, though ſpears and arrows did him no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial hurt.</p>

               <hi>Second,</hi> On the reſolution, as it reſpects the Sedition act the report next ſtates, that <hi>the power exerciſed by this act is expreſsly prohibited by one of the amendments of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The amendment or additional article of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here referred to is the third, which provides, "that Congreſs ſhall make no law reſpecting an eſtabliſhment of religion, or prohibiting the free exerciſe thereof; <hi>or abridging the freedom of ſpeech or of the preſs.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The report obſerves, that, "to vindicate the Sedition act it has been contended; 1ſt. That the <hi>freedom of the preſs</hi> is to be determined by the meaning of this expreſſion
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036760_0040_100AB196C6FB6250"/>in the common law; and 2d. that the article ſuppoſes the power over the preſs to be in Congreſs, and prohibits them only from <hi>abridging</hi> the freedom allowed to it by the common law."</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the firſt of theſe, the report ſays, "<hi>It is deemed to be</hi> a <hi>ſound opinion, that the ſedition act, in its definition of ſome of the crimes created, is an abridgment of the freedom of publication recogniſed by principles of the common law in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>" The meaning of this is, that there are offences declared by this act, for which an indictment would not lie at common law. The report prudently declines ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting this opinion; and I may ſafely aſſert, that it is not a ſound opinion, and that this act does not create any new offence, and that every offence declared by it would have been an offence indictable at common law in the Federal Courts, if this act had never been made, and would be indictable if this act were repealed.</p>
            <p>The people of England, and the common law writers there, ſay, the preſs is free there; the report ſays, it is as free there as here: here and there, it is ſubject to no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious reſtraint; here and there, the abuſe of it is, by the common law ſubject to penalties. Yet the report will not admit, that the common law idea of the freedom of the preſs is the American idea! The circumſtances being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly the ſame, it will ſurely be incumbent on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the report to point out the difference in the <hi>ideas:</hi> and to ſhew why puniſhment of the abuſe would not as effectually check the freedom of the preſs <hi>there</hi> as <hi>here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſagacious contraſt <hi>between the principles of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican government and the principles of the Britiſh government</hi> can give no force to the reaſoning in the report, unleſs it be meant to eſtabliſh, that, becauſe the ſovereign Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican people can change their government when they pleaſe; every individual is at liberty, <hi>by lies and without any juſt reaſon,</hi> to incite the people to change their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whenever <hi>he</hi> pleaſes. Or unleſs it be meant to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, that the American people ought to have leſs confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a Preſident choſen for four years, than in an hereditary King, or in Senators choſen for ſix years, than in an hereditary Houſe of Lords; or in Repreſentatives
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036760_0041_100AB19850E98378"/>choſen for two years, than in members of the Houſe of Commons choſen for ſeven years; or, in a word, that it is more an offence to abuſe the government there, than to miſlead the people by abuſing their government here. In any ſhape in which it is poſſible to put his report, its author will be obliged to maintain, that among the rights of the American people, one is, that every individual has a liberty to uſe the preſs to produce miſchief, by publiſhing falſehood or indecency. For it is well known, that, as by the common law of England, ſo by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of America, and by the Sedition act; every individual is at liberty to expoſe, in the ſtrongeſt terms, conſiſtent with decency and truth all the errors of any department of the government.</p>
            <p>To contend, <hi>that where the government is elective, there ought to be a liberty of the preſs beyond the bounds of decency and truth;</hi> is to contend, that, where the people have a right to chooſe their magiſtrates, every individual has a right to miſrepreſent the character and conduct of the magiſtrates, to pervert the judgment of the people, and render it impoſſible for them to make a right choice. The degree of the reſtraint ought to be in proportion to the danger of the offence. To miſlead the judgment of the people, where they have no power, may produce no miſchief. To miſlead the judgment of the people, where they have <hi>all</hi> power, muſt produce the greateſt poſſible miſchief.</p>
            <p>The <hi>"practice, here and in England,"</hi> will not change the law, any more than treſpaſſes will give a right to the ſoil. It is poſſible, that, both here and there, too much indulgence has been given to libels: but, in either coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when a libel has been tried and found, has the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice prevented a judgment? Not only libels, but thefts, robberies, and murders have been common in both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and the trials and puniſhments have not been ſo numerous as the offences. It is not from a corrupt prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but from a ſettled practice allowed by judicial deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that the common law is to be taken.</p>
            <p>That the liberty of the preſs is an excellent engine to deſtroy a <hi>bad</hi> government, and the licentiouſneſs of the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036760_0042_100AB19AA17AEC40"/>preſs to deſtroy <hi>any</hi> government, all experience will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. But where the government is, like ours, founded on the people, I venture to aſſert, that a degree of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty beyond that given to the preſs by the common law and the Sedition act, will tend only to make the people miſerable, to corrupt and deſtroy the government, and to introduce anarchy, and, in the end, deſpotiſm. Some means of deſtroying a bad may not be the means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a good government. To preſerve a good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the confidence of the people is neceſſary: but falſehood, if it may be propagated with impunity, may be as fatal to a good, as truth to a bad government. To preſerve our beſt bleſſings in an uſeful ſtate, we muſt reſtrain unlimited indulgence. The care and induſtry of man muſt be conſtantly exerted for a proper enjoyment of the gifts of Providence. To make the fruit of the tree good and abundant, we muſt prune its natural luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance. And to preſerve the liberty, we muſt reſtrain the licentiouſneſs of the preſs.</p>
            <p>When it is known, that our Sedition act, like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, forbids the publication of only "falſe, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and malicious writings againſt the government," and permits the publiſher, if he can, "to give in evidence the truth of the matter;" every candid mind will regret the miſrepreſentation in the following ſentence. "<hi>Had Sedition acts</hi> forbidding <hi>every</hi> publication been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly inforced againſt the preſs, <hi>might not the United States have been languiſhing at this day under the infirmities of a ſickly confederation; or, poſſibly, miſerable colonies groaning under a foreign yoak?"</hi> By this the author muſt mean, either that our Sedition act forbids <hi>every</hi> publication againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; or that there is as much ground of cenſure of the government now as before the conſtitution and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; or that there would have been no conſtitution or revolution, if <hi>lies</hi> had not been publiſhed of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and the Britiſh government; or that American juries are not to be truſted with the examination of truth.</p>
            <p>The laſt argument in the report on this point is founded on a fallacy. "The freedom of conſcience and of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are the ſame by the common law of England, and of America. The difference between the actual freedom
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036760_0043_100AB19E03029970"/>there and here is made, not by the common law, but by ſtatutes there; and our conſtitution reſtrains Congreſs from making <hi>"any"</hi> ſuch ſtatute here, "reſpecting an eſtabliſhment of religion, or prohibiting the free exerciſe thereof." The right of conſcience is a natural right of a ſuperior order for the exerciſe of which we are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God. The right of publication is more within the control of civil authority, and was thought a more proper ſubject of general law.</p>
            <p>There is nothing therefore in the reaſoning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that can ſhew, that the meaning of the words <hi>"free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſs"</hi> is not to be aſcertained by the common law. It is a common law phraſe. The common law of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland is the foundation of our law. Their language is ours. We uſe the terms of the Engliſh law in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſenſe of thoſe terms. And where we mean to reſtrain, enlarge, or alter this ſenſe, we do ſo in expreſs terms. Where this is not done, a law phraſe is nearly as well underſtood to mean the ſame thing here as in England, as a mathematical phraſe is ſo underſtood. The freedom of the preſs is plain language, to be underſtood in the common acceptance of this term here and in England. There and here abſolute freedom of the preſs did not exiſt. In every ſtate, Libels were puniſhable at common law. With this ſtate of freedom of the preſs, the people were content, and only reſtrain Congreſs from <hi>abridging</hi> this freedom. Forbidding power to abridge, implies a previous general power over the ſubject, and leaves a power to puniſh an abuſe of this freedom without abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. If this were not ſo why is there ſo ſudden a change in the manner of expreſſion in this amendment? Why as reſpecting religion, was is not declared that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhall make no law reſpecting the freedom of the preſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This however is denied by the reſolution; and, on ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from diſcuſſions of the conſtitution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to its adoption, from propoſitions of amendment made by ſome of the ſtate conventions at the time of its adoption, and from the propoſition of amendment made by Congreſs after its adoption; the report aſſerts <hi>"that this amendment is a poſitive denial to Congreſs of any power whatever on the ſubject."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:036760_0044_100AB19F88383B98"/>
It is very clear, that the power exerciſed by Congreſs is not included by this amendment; and I think it has been ſhewn, that it is fairly involved in powers actually given, and neceſſarily reſults from the organization of the government; and that it gives no new juriſdiction to the Federal courts; for by the common law, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of right and wrong, morality, the rules of religion; the criminal courts of every government muſt have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over this offence. A libel is an offence againſt all thoſe laws, a violation of the rights of man, one of which is reputation, and is puniſhed under every govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the courts of the government offended by it. No evil can ariſe from the exerciſe of this power by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs as a general authority: it depends on no local in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; the honor and ſafety of the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is involved in it; it is proper, that there ſhould be a general law uniformly affecting this caſe, and that the courts of the general government injured by the offence, ſhould be the organs of its correction. Under all theſe circumſtances, the conſtruction will be favorable to the power, and an uſeful power will not be taken away but by ſtrong and expreſs words, and ſuch do not exiſt, in the amendment.</p>
            <p>In the diſcuſſion of the conſtitution, ſome of its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents may have charged it with powers which it had not, and ſome of its advocates may have denied or diſſembled powers really in it. Each, with perhaps honeſt views, may have laboured to carry his point, and if he ſucceeded knew that falſe arguments would not affect the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and might be forgotten. On ſimilar ground, many in the ſtate conventions acceded to the propoſitions of amendment. Thoſe propoſitions gave ſome juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to their arguments; with, or without them, the ratification was equally valid, and they made it more palatable; they were ſuppoſed harmleſs, or, if miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, they had no force then, and could be oppoſed again after the conſtitution was eſtabliſhed. At any rate a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that a thing ſhould be done, will not control the conſtruction of the act as done, any more than a pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will control an act. A contract is to be taken not
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036760_0045_100AB1A1B81C70E0"/>from the previous converſations of the parties, but from the words in which it is expreſſed in the writing. Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia was but one of the parties, and, admitting that there <hi>might have been,</hi> in the convention of that ſtate, a deſire to give the Federal government <hi>no power reſpecting the preſs;</hi> this might have been contradicted by the other ſtates. Excluſive of Rhole Iſland, ſix ſtates ratified the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution abſolutely. Three annexed propoſitions of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not including this reſpecting the preſs, though one of them, New Hampſhire propoſed, that "Congreſs ſhall make no laws touching religion, or to infringe the rights of conſcience." And only three ſtates propoſed the amendment reſpecting the preſs. So that the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was compleatly ratified without any view to this amendment, and muſt be underſtood to give all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which this amendment was intended to reſtrain; and the amendment reſtrains only the power to abridge. It is not neceſſary, therefore to ſhew, as might be done, that the declaration by the Virginia Convention, admitting it ſincere, is founded on a principle, which, though true, will not ſupport it. And were it every way ſupportable, it is ſuſceptible of a conſtruction, which would defeat that contended for by the report. It combines two powers with certain attributes, which, <hi>reddendo ſingula ſingulis</hi> may be taken thus; the liberty of conſcience cannot be modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the liberty of the preſs cannot be abridged, by authority of the United States. But in any conſtruction, how can a law, which only abridges the unlimited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of puniſhment for abuſe of the preſs, be ſaid to modify the liberty of the preſs?</p>
            <p>The author of the report muſt have known that the Virginia Convention in endeavouring to eſtabliſh the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the preſs, underſtood this liberty as every one elſe does to be a liberty from previous reſtraint and not from ſubſequent penalties for its abuſe; and did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it in the ſenſe contended for by him in the report, <hi>a freedom from all reſtraint previous and ſubſequent</hi> and by him ſaid to be the ſenſe of the Virginia Convention. "A law inflicting penalties on printed publications would," ſays the report, "have a ſimilar effect with a law authoriſing a previous reſtraint." Now this Virginia Convention.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036760_0046_100AB1A48BA844A8"/>together with the amendment on the freedom of the preſs, propoſes an amendment, "That every freeman ought to find a certain remedy by recourſe to the laws for all injuries and wrongs he may receive in his perſon, property, <hi>or character.</hi>" If for all injuries to his chracter, he ought eſpecially to find a remedy for the worſt of all a libel. A verdict in an action for damages may be (and we have a late remarkable inſtance of it) a ſeverer penalty than any that would probably be inflicted by a ſentence on an indictment; it may be a ſeverer penalty than can be inflicted by the Sedition act. Yet this Virginia Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which, the report ſays meant to make the preſs free from all reſtraint previous and ſubſequent, ſubjects it to this ſubſequent penalty at common law without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. If the opinion of the Virginia Convention were material on this point, it appears, that it never meant to leave the preſs free from all reſtraints for abuſe. And (ſince the report will argue from the opinion of Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) it appears from this and other amendments propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that a general legiſlative authority was ſuppoſed to exiſt in Congreſs, and a general common law juriſdiction in the courts of the United States. And it appears that the Virginia Convention believed, that without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed amendment which I have cited, Congreſs might make a law, denying the right of action for a libel, and therefore might make a law reſpecting the freedom of the preſs; and that the Federal Courts might deny that an action lies for a libel, and, therefore, that they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law juriſdiction, by which alone ſuch action could be brought before them.</p>
            <p>The preamble to the propoſition of amendment by Congreſs is no evidence that the amendment declared the preſs to be wholly exempt from the power of Congreſs. There are other amendments propoſed, <hi>which might corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with the deſire of the ſtates, and might extend the ground of public confidence.</hi> This amendment was deſired only by three ſtates. If it was the intention of Congreſs to ſatisfy the deſire of thoſe ſtates, by propoſing this amendment, it muſt be preſumed that they propoſed it in terms corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with the deſire. None of theſe ſtates ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036760_0047_100AB1A6AE37A658"/>that the licentiouſneſs or abuſe of the preſs ſhould not be reſtrained or puniſhed; and Virginia expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the contrary. They deſired that the freedom of the preſs ſhould not be violated or reſtrained. By the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſs, they muſt be underſtood to mean the freedom of the preſs as it then exiſted at common law in all the ſtates. The amendment correſponds with this deſire, and the Sedition law with this amendment, for it neither violates nor abridges the freedom of the preſs in the known and eſtabliſhed ſenſe of that expreſſion. The intention of thoſe who made the amendment muſt be collected from the plain meaning of the words uſed in it. Some may have intended greater reſtraint, and others leſs: the queſtion is what is done. <hi>Congreſs muſt leave the freedom of the preſs as it was. There ſhall be no previous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints on this freedom; but there may be ſubſequent penalties on the abuſe of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third,</hi> The laſt point diſcuſſed in this reſolution is, <hi>"that the power exerciſed by Congreſs, in this act, ought, more than any other, to produce univerſal alarm, becauſe levelled againſt that right of free examination of public characters and meaſures, and free communication thereon, which has ever been juſtly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this point, the report, having ſtated part of the act, makes various obſervations on it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"The conſtitution ſuppoſes that the Preſident, the Congreſs, and each of its Houſes may not diſcharge their truſts. Hence they are made reſponſible to their conſtituents, at the returning periods of election. Should it happen, that either of theſe branches has not diſcharged its truſt, it is proper, that according to the degree of their faults, they ſhould be brought into contempt and hatred of the people. Whether this has happened, can only be determined by a free examination and communication among the people. And whenever it has happened, it is the right and duty of intelligent and faithful citizens, to diſcuſs and promulge it freely, as well, for control, as for remedy; and thoſe who are to apply the remedy muſt feel a contempt or hatred againſt the transgreſſing party. During the continuance of this act, two elections of the entire Houſe of Repreſentatives, an election of two-thirds of the Senate, and an election of a Preſident were
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036760_0048_100AB1A8315764B8"/>to take place: and, during all theſe elections, the remedial rights of the people were to be exerciſed, and the reſponſibility of their public agents to be ſkreened under the penalties of this act."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who, reading theſe obſervations, would not ſuppoſe, that the people of the United States were by this <hi>alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſedition-act,</hi> reſtrained from a free and fair diſcuſſion of the public conduct of their public agents, with an honeſt intent of bringing them into diſrepute when they deſerved it? But does this act forbid this? No: it forbids, as the report itſelf ſhews, "a knowingly and willingly publiſhing a falſe, ſcandalous, and malicious writing, with intent to defame the government," &amp;c. Do the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the United States wiſh to retain a right, wilfully, maliciouſly, and falſely, to publiſh ſcandal againſt their officers? Is this one of the rights of man under a free government? Does the reſtraint of this right alarm them? Or have they made a conſtitution to protect it?</p>
            <p>It is evident, that the freedom contended for in theſe obſervations and the report generally, is a freedom from all reſtraint; ſubſequent, as well as previous; from the ſtate governments, as well as from the Federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; from action, as well as from indictment. For "it is equally a reſtraint" (ſays the report) "whether it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede or follow the publication; and ſo is it equally a penalty, whether aſſeſſed by a jury<note n="*" place="bottom">In Virginia Juries aſſeſs fines.</note> or by a court, by a ſtate court or by a Federal court. This freedom is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to all experience, to common underſtanding, to natural juſtice, to the rules of religion, and to the judicial deciſions of every ſtate. It is a violation of the rights of man, one of the deareſt of which is reputation.</p>
            <p>The Sedition act enables the perſon proſecuted for a libel, "to give in evidence the <hi>truth</hi> of the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it," and enables the jury "to determine the law and the fact, under the direction of the court, as in other caſes." But the report ſays, <hi>"its baneful tendency is little diminiſhed by this privilege."</hi> And why is its bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tendency not diminiſhed? Why is it not entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved? Becauſe a reſtraint from publiſhing truth would
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036760_0049_100A8A3A249EEC78"/>have a baneful tendency; is there any baneful tendency to reſtrain the publication of falſehood? Becauſe the preſs ought to be permitted to publiſh every truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to the public; ought it to be permitted to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh every lie? Becauſe "an intelligent and faithful citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen" has a right, honeſtly, decently, and freely, to examine the public conduct of every officer, and, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the truth, expoſe the officer to contempt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; has every impudent or malicious man a right, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, falſely, and ſcandalouſly to defame every officer. It is not a free, but a falſe publication that is prohibited by this act.</p>
            <p>But it is objected by the report, that, <hi>"where ſimple and naked facts alone are in queſtion, there is ſufficient difficulty of meeting a proſecution from government with the proof neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in a court of law."</hi> This will infer, that in order to ſave offenders from the trouble of producing the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary proof in their defence, there ſhould be no proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but a general impunity for crimes, for murders, rapes, robberies, thefts, miſdemeanors in office, &amp;c. Libels of public officers, where the people have a right of election, are offences of great magnitude and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tendency. And it is as ſafe for a perſon accuſed of a libel to have the accuſation tried by a jury, as for a perſon accuſed of any other offence.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>"opinions, inferences, and conjectural obſervations,"</hi> they muſt be drawn from facts. If a man wilfully, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, and with intent to defame, publiſh an opinion not ſupported by fact, it is an offence. If there be fact to juſtify it, he may give it in evidence. If there be none, why ſhould not a wilful, falſe, and malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be a libel, as well as a wilful, falſe and malicious aſſertion. The inference implies the aſſertion.</p>
            <p>As to the intent to defame, the report reaſons abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>"that in proportion to the guilt of the officer will be the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and criminality of the intent to defame him."</hi> Nothing like this can be drawn from the act. The intent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame is never criminal, where the matter of the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true. All depends on the truth or falſehood of the matter of the publication. If the publication of the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036760_0050_100AB1ADB5941C38"/>officer's official conduct be true, the intent to defame, however malicious will not make the publication a libel. So that the intent to defame is not criminal unleſs the publication be falſe; and is criminal in proportion to the innocence or merit of the officer. There is good reaſon why the authors of publications againſt officers ſhould be reſponſible, that they publiſh nothing but truth. For if falſehood might be publiſhed of officers, and the publiſhers were liable to no reſtraint, the whole of an officer's time might be taken up in examining or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſlander; or the people concerned in the officer's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter might be miſled by falſe information.</p>
            <p>No leſs abſurd, and more pernicious in its application, is the reaſoning of the report, from <hi>"the right of electing the members of the government."</hi> It proceeds on a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of freedom with falſehood; as if a diſcuſſion could not be free, without being falſe, or the reſtraint of a falſe were a reſtraint of a free diſcuſſion. If <hi>"the value and efficacy of the right of election depends on the knowledge of the comparative merits and demerits of the candidates"</hi> the greater ought to be the reſtraint on falſehood in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their character. A free diſcuſſion will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to include a falſe one: it means a full and fair diſcuſſion. A full and fair diſcuſſion is not forbidden by the Sedition act. It forbids only a falſe diſcuſſion with a malicious intent. It forbids not diffuſing information, but diffuſing corruption, among the people; miſleading their judgment, and ſeducing them from their duty. It puts not the officer in a ſtate of greater protection than the citizen. Any truth may be publiſhed of the officer, which may be publiſhed of the citizen; and every truth may be publiſhed of the official character of the officer. Would the committee deſire more? Becauſe a man is an officer, ſhall every ſlander of him be publiſhed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity? Becauſe Mr. Adams is Preſident of the United States, ſhall leave be given to miſlead the people, by publiſhing falſehood or ſlander of him; in order that another candidate, not in ſuch reſponſible ſtation, may be on equal terms for a chance of election to that office!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:036760_0051_100AB1B068A4FFB0"/>
A free means not a falſe diſcuſſion, any more than the liberty, means the abuſe, of the preſs. The greateſt injury "<hi>to the right of election,</hi>" and the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to "<hi>the bleſſings of a government founded on this right,</hi>" is ſlander; which perverts the opinions and choice of the people, and leads them to prefer bad to good men. In proportion to the freedom of the government ought to be reſtraint on libels. And the ſedition-act no farther abridges the liberty of the preſs, than by declaring that falſe publications are ſubject to penalties.</p>
            <p>To whom then is the ſedition-act <hi>alarming?</hi> To ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, to libellers, to robbers of reputation, to diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the peace, to violaters of the rights of man. It is, as law ought to be, <hi>"a terror only to evil doers."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three following reſolutions and the report on them contain only matter leſs important or already conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Perhaps Pennſylvania deſerves the rebuke which may be implied in the declaration of the patriotiſm of Virginia, in "<hi>maintaining the authority and laws of the Union, without a ſingle exception of internal reſiſtance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</hi> And while I cheerfully give all due praiſe to the people of Virginia for this uniform ſubmiſſion, I cannot allow any ſhare of this merit to the authors or promoters of the reſolutions or the report. And of the people, for this reſpect for public authority, we ſhall find room to praiſe not only the patriotiſm but the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. There is among them a force, which, if the bands of public authority were relaxed might be fatal indeed.</p>
            <p>The reſolutions conclude as they commenced, with a profeſſion of affection for the ſtates, and anxiety for the Union. I will not ſay (for they profeſs otherwiſe) that the object of the reſolutions is to diſſolve the Union; but I may with little hazard of contradiction, ſay, that they are (eſpecially accompanied with the report) well calculated for this purpoſe. On the ground that <hi>"a wilful and material breach of a part is a breach of the whole compact; having deliberately determined that palpable and alarming infractions of the conſtitution have been made;"</hi> they lay a ſufficient foundation for the diſſolution of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036760_0052_100AB1B1EC762808"/>And I will ſay alſo, that, in making this deliberate and ſolemn determination, the legiſlature of Virginia is miſtaken, and has uſurped a power not given to it by the people; but given to the judiciary, or reſerved to the people themſelves, as parties to the compact, in their higheſt ſovereign capacity. This is a deliberate, palpable, dangerous, and alarming exerciſe of powers not granted by the conſtitution: for the powers of the legiſlature of Virginia are no farther valid, than they are authoriſed by the conſtitutions of that ſtate and of the Union. And the people are in duty bound to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, for arreſting the progreſs of the evil, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining within their reſpective limits the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to them."</p>

            <p>When I wrote what is ſaid in page 12 of the opinion of General Waſhington, on the power of Congreſs to provide for the general welfare, I alluded to this opinion as officially delivered to Congreſs.
