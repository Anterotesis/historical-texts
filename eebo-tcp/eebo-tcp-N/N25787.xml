            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CARRICKFERGUS ASSIZES. BEFORE THE RIGHT HON. BARON YELVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, AND JUDGE CHAMBERLAINE. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1797. TRIAL OF WILLIAM ORR, <hi>FOR ADMINISTERING UNLAWFUL OATHS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE firſt witneſs called was <hi>Hugh Wheatley,</hi> ſoldier in the Fifeſhire Fencibles.—He ſaid, that in April 1796, he returned from Scotland, where he had been on furlough. On going by Antrim, to join his regiment at Derry, along with othertwo ſoldiers, one of them named Lindſay, they went into a public-houſe, where they met with a perſon named Campbell, and another named Orr, not the priſoner. After leaving that houſe, they went along a road, where Campbell introduced the witneſs to Orr, the priſoner, who was in a field ſowing flax. He came out of the field, and they all went to a houſe, where a number of people ſoon aſſembled, and they put a vote among themſelves, whether they ſhould put the Conſtitution book into the priſoner's hands. They agreed to do ſo, and the priſoner, acting as preſident, held out a book to the witneſs to ſwear on. The witneſs at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſwear, but afterwards did ſo, being told his life was not worth a farthing, if he did not come into their way of thinking. The oath was, to keep the ſecrets of United Iriſhmen, and not, for any reward, to diſcover on them. They ſaid, they wanted a Reform in Parliament, and, if they did not get it by fair means, they would overthrow the Conſtitution; and that they meant to have as many military or armed men on their ſide as to effect it. They gave him, the witneſs, a Conſtitution book to take his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from, with orders, that as ſoon as he joined his regiment, he was to ſwear in as many as he could; and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034281_0005_0FFD7D58B3835CD8"/>
when ſeven were made, they were to form a Committee, and then the book would direct them what to do. That while the witneſs and his companions were in Antrim and the neighbourhood, they were ſupported in the houſe of John Hyndman, and paid nothing for it; and when they left Antrim, they got five ſhillings from the priſoner, and ſixpence from another man. After the witneſs had been ſworn a United Iriſhman, the perſons who were in the room gave him certain ſigns by which to know United Iriſhmen, and explained them to him.—The firſt ſign was, <hi>"Lift the right hand, and draw it down over the right ſide of the face—2d, Lift the left hand, and draw it down over the left ſide of the face—3d, Shake hands by the left hands—4th,</hi> Say, <hi>What do you know? I know</hi> U.—<hi>What do you know more? I know</hi> T." or ſome other letters of the word UNITY or UNITED.—Campbell invited him, the witneſs, and Lindſay, to his houſe, a little way from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim, where they were ſhewn arms, and a paper called the Northern Star; and in his garden they were ſhewn a draw well, which, they were told, would be a nice place to put the Ariſtocrats.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>John Lindſay,</hi> ſoldier in the Fifeſhire Fencibles, ſaid that when he and Wheatley came from Scotland, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Derry by Antrim, they ſaw the priſoner, who gave Wheatley a book, and ſwore him not to diſcover the ſecrets of the United Iriſhmen for any ſee or reward, or to give evidence againſt any of them. There was a ſociety there, which they called the <hi>Baronial Meeting,</hi> and Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and the priſoner were there. Wheatley got a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution book—he, the witneſs, did not get one, and does not know the object of the United Iriſhmen, but took the oath of ſecrecy adminiſtered by the priſoner in Hynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Curran,</hi> in behalf of the priſoner, addreſſed the Court as to the conſtruction of the act of Parliament upon which the priſoner was tried. He took notice of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious acts of the Legiſlature which had been paſſed from time to time, for ſuppreſſing and preventing tumultuous riſings, prohibiting the-adminiſtering of unlawful oaths, &amp;c. &amp;c. He remarked, that the act 36th of the king, upon which the priſoner was now tried, made the penalty death. He contended, that if the two witneſſes who had been examined were to be believed, their evidence
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034281_0007_0FFD7D8078649988"/>
amounted to a proof of High Treaſon, and ſurely the crime of High Treaſon could not be tried by any other law than that which applied to it. The objection, therefore, which he had to the preſent trial, was this; that the body of crime contained in the evidence, was not a crime of the nature laid in the indictment, but a crime of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It follows, then, that if a perſon be charged with a crime amounting to High Treaſon, he ought to be tried by the law which relates to High Treaſon, and then he will be entitled to all the advantages which that law gives him.</p>
               <p>The abilities of Mr. Curran are ſufficiently known, and ſtand in no need of encomium. Upon this occaſion they were exerted with all their force and energy; and he went over an extenſive field of argument, to ſhew that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, in its preſent ſhape, ought to be quaſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Attorney General</hi> ſaid a few words in reply to Mr. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran—He remarked that notice had been taken of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of the Crown in ſome trials, as tending to ſhew that ſuch procedure had been rigorous and ſevere. But he ſaid he could challenge any one to point out a caſe where the priſoner had not received every indulgence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the due adminiſtration of juſtice; and he thought that any remarks thrown out, tending to impreſs the minds of the people with a contrary opinion, were equally unjuſt and improper.

He thought, however, he could not be juſtifiable in complying with this—He thought too, the objection was ill timed, it ought to have been made at a much earlier ſtage of the buſineſs, and and not reſerved till now, when the whole evidence on the part of the Crown had been divulged.</p>

Wheatley, the ſoldier. About January laſt he, the witneſs, had a converſation with Wheatley, whom he overtook with Serjeant Miller on the road from Ballyclare to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick—They all went into a houſe on the road ſide and had a glaſs of ſpirits. There was a man lying in a bed in the room were they were; he ſpoke to Miller, having been formerly in the ſervice with him. After one half pint was drunk another was called for, and before it was drank Wheatley called the witneſs out and they went on the road together—Wheatley aſked him if he knew Mr. Orr, who was in priſon, and if he would go into the jail to ſerve him—He, the witneſs, ſaid he could not get into the jail and did not then know Orr—Wheatley ſaid "you muſt try to do it, and tell Orr if he will put a different coloured coat upon me and ſome money I will deſert; and if he will get another coat and two guineas, I will get Lindſay to deſert alſo, for Lindſay was as ready to go as himſelf." Wheatley then added, they had ſlogged him in Ballymoney for his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and when taking off his coat had deſtroyed papers about the United Iriſhman, which he was ſorry for, and that he had perſevered in ſeveral towns. Soon after this Wheatley again ſaid you muſt go into jail to be of ſervice to Orr, but the witneſs replied as he did not know Orr, he would not believe him; then ſaid Wheatley, "here is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred note," holding up his right hand with a cartridge in it. He added that it was not he but Lindſay that had ſworn againſt Orr, and that Lindſay would ſwear the Hill of Howth in Scotland was no larger than a pound of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in a chandler's ſhop.—At this time Serjeant Miller came up with them and they dropt the converſation. When the witneſs arrived in Carrickfergus, he applied to a Magiſtrate who gave him a line to get into the priſon, where he ſaw Orr, who did not know him, but one Story who was there knew him and introduced him to Orr, to whom he delivered the meſſage from the ſoldier. When Orr heard it he ſtared, would not believe it and ſaid he was a villain—The witneſs returned ſoon after to Wheatley, who was waiting for an anſwer—They went together into a Mr. Anderſon's, where they got ſome porter, and Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley urged him to go into the jail again but he would not do it.</p>

                  <hi>Judge Yelverton</hi> then charged the Jury, and recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the evidence that had been adduced on both ſides. His Lordſhip took notice of the witneſs Wheatley, who, he ſaid, had given his evidence in a very clear and diſtinct manner, and in a ſtile of language which convinced him he had received an education far ſuperior to what generally falls to the lot of men in his ſtation of life. With regard to Lindſay's evidence, his Lordſhip ſaid, that ſo far as it went, it ſupported that which had been given by Wheatley;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034281_0010_0FFD7D6DAF45A388"/>
and, upon the whole, thoſe two witneſſes were, in their evidence, conſiſtent with themſelves and with each other. It was true, ſome witneſſes had been adduced to diſprove what Wheatley had ſaid, but theſe witneſſes differed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially with each other. M'Claverty ſays, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation between him and Wheatley, relative to his going into priſon to requeſt Orr to give money, &amp;c. to him to deſert, took place immediately after they came out of the houſe where they had been drinking on the road to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and that Serjeant Miller was then left behind; while Serjeant Miller ſays, that they all came out of the houſe together, and no converſation of the nature men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned could have taken place without his hearing it: he admits, however, that when about a quarter of a mile from Carrick, he ſtepped aſide, and Wheatley and M'Claverty walked on together, ſo that, if any converſation took place, it muſt have been then, and not at the time mentioned by M'Claverty.</p>

               <hi>Mr. Curran,</hi> in a ſpeech replete with great elegance of language, force of reaſoning, and brilliancy of thought, argued for ſeveral hours in ſupport of a motion he made to the Court, for an arreſt of judgment in the caſe of Mr. Orr.

            <head>THURSDAY, SEPT. 21.</head>
            <p>William Orr, for adminiſtering unlawful oaths to two ſoldiers, and found guilty on Monday, was ſentenced to be hanged on the 7th of October next.—It is much to the honour of Baron Yelverton, that we have to obſerve, that in pronouncing the awful ſentence on this unhappy man, he was ſo deeply affected as ſcarcely to be able, articulately, to conclude a very impreſſive addreſs. The tears guſhed from his eyes, and covering his face with both his hands, his Lordſhip, greatly agitated, remained in that ſituation for ſeveral minutes. In this addreſs, the Baron told Mr. Orr, that though recommended to mercy by the Jury, he thought it would be the greateſt cruelty to flatter him with any hopes of a remiſſion of the ſentence, which it had been his painful office to pronounce, and ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him to make the beſt uſe of his time in making his peace with God, and in preparing for that atonement, which he was deſtined to make to the offended laws of his country.</p>
            <p>[Mr. Orr is a very reſpectable farmer, and a man of property in the neighbourhood of Antrim, where he has reſided all his life-time with a fair and unblemiſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. He appears to be about thirty or two and thirty years of age—remarkably good looking, and much the appearance of a gentleman. He has ſix children by a very amiable prudent wife, who has been his conſtant compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in priſon, and who is at this moment far advanced in pregnancy. Her diſtreſs may be felt, but it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.]</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR (immediately after ſentence) begged leave to ſay a few words:—<hi>"My Lord,"</hi> ſaid he, <hi>"that Jury has convicted me of being a Felon; my own heart tells me that their conviction is a falſehood, and that I am not a Felon: if they have found me ſo improperly, it is worſe for them than for me, for I can forgive them—I wiſh to ſay only one word more, and that is, to declare upon this awful occaſion, and in the preſence of God, that the evidence againſt me was groſsly perjured, groſsly and wickedly perjured."</hi>

            <head>A SHORT SKETCH OF MR. CURRAN'S SPEECH:</head>
            <p>When Mr. Curran contended for an arreſt of judgment, he argued with all that brilliancy of imagination and force of reaſoning, for which this gentleman is ſo juſtly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated—He ſaid, That the jury ſhould be diſcharged of the indictment, and that they ſhould be directed to acquit the priſoner; if the teſtimony of the informer was true, the guilt which it proved was not a crime of Felony under the Inſurrection Act, but a crime of High Treaſon under the Statute of Edward III. A man charged with High Treaſon in Great Britain, has advantages of defence which make it almoſt impoſſible for an innocent man to fall a victim to the mere malice of perſecution: he muſt have a copy of the indictment; the overt-acts muſt be expreſsly charged; <hi>the blaſted breath of one venal Informer cannot deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy him.</hi> In that country there muſt be two witneſſes at the leaſt. Even in Ireland, <hi>where life does not ſeem to be of ſo much value,</hi> the man accuſed of Treaſon has advantages peculiar to his ſituation; he is entitled to an exact copy of his charge, and a full defence by his Counſel in point of law and in fact. The State muſt avow itſelf as the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor; it cannot wage a piratical war againſt his life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der falſe colours; and if it proſecutes him maliciouſly, he is authoriſed by his Counſel to diſplay every circumſtance of his caſe to his Jury, and of appealing to every ſenſe of their duty, their juſtice, their humanity, and their danger, for his protection. To try him, therefore, under this Act, which gave him none of thoſe advantages, was to try him without hearing him, and was an oppreſſion unwarranted by the Law of the Land. This objection, it was ſaid, might appear at firſt ſight to be novel and hazardous. As to its novelty, it was the firſt time that ſuch a proceeding, was ever attempted, and the objection to it muſt be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore new. It might certainly be thought deſperate to ſeek a refuge from a charge of Felony under the Law Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and it was only to be lamented that the melancholy ſtate of the Country ſo fully juſtified ſuch a conduct.</p>

            <p>On Saturday morning early the Rev. Mr. Stavely and the Rev. Mr. Hill viſited Mr. Orr, by his own deſire, in priſon. They remained with him all the forenoon; and about half after one o'clock Mr. Orr left the priſon and went into a chaiſe, accompanied by theſe gentlemen. A conſiderable number of military, conſiſting of part of the Fifeſhire Fencibles, the Monaghan Militia, the Reay Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibles, the Carrickfergus Invalids, a party of the 22d Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and the Carrickfergus Yeoman Cavalry, as alſo a party of the Artillery, with two pieces of cannon, were attending. The High Sheriff, on horſeback, preceded the carriage. The Sub Sheriff, alſo on horſeback, followed it. The whole proceeded, in ſolemn, flow proceſſion, from the jail to the place of execution, about three quarters of a mile from Carrickfergus. Mr. Orr and the two clergymen, then alighted from the carriage, and the priſoner having aſked permiſſion of the High Sheriff to allow a few of his friends to be near him, it was inſtantly granted.</p>
            <p>About an hour was ſpent in devotional exerciſes, which Mr. Orr joined with much ſervency, and during the whole period of time, and amid the awful ſolemnity, he preſerved a degree of calm fortitude, and when the fatal moment ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived he drew from his pocket a few printed papers, to which his name was adhibited, containing his dying decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, theſe he diſtributed among the perſons who were near him. This done, he ſhook hands with his ſurrounding friends, and very affectionately bade them farewel—He then mounted the ſcaffold with a firm ſtep, and the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus of death being adjuſted, he was launched into eternity about three o'clock.—After hanging three quarters of an hour, the body was taken down and delivered to his friends, by whom it was conveyed away on a hearſe.</p>

               <salute>My Friends and Countrymen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the thirty-firſt year of my life, I have been ſentenced to die upon the gallows, and this ſentence has been in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of a verdict of twelve men, who ſhould have been indifferently and impartially choſen; how far they have been ſo, I leave to that country from which they have been choſen, to determine; and how far they have diſcharged their duty, I leave to their God and to themſelves.—They have, in pronouncing their verdict, thought proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me as an object of humane mercy; in return, I pray to God, if they have erred, to have mercy upon them. The Judge, who condemned me, humanely ſhed tears in uttering my ſentence, but whether he did wiſely in ſo highly commending the wretched Informer, who ſwore away my life, I leave to his own cool reflection, ſolemnly aſſuring him and all the world, with my dying breath, that that informer was forſworn. The law under which I ſuffer, is ſurely a ſevere one; may the makers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of it be juſtified in the integrity of their motives and the purity of their own lives—by that law, I am ſtamped a ſelon, but my heart diſdains the imputation. My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable lot and induſtrious courſe of life, beſt refute the charge of being an adventurer for plunder; but if to have loved my Country, to have known its wrongs, to have felt the injuries of the perſecuted Catholics, and to have united with them and all other religious perſuaſions in the moſt orderly and leaſt ſanguinary means of procuring redreſs:—If theſe be ſelonies, I am a ſelon, but not otherwiſe. Had my Council (for whoſe honourable exertions I am indebted) prevailed in their motion to have me tried for high treaſon, rather than under the <hi>Inſurrection</hi>

but that was refuſed, and I muſt now ſubmit to what has paſſed.</p>
            <p>To the generous protection of my Country, I leave a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved wife, who has been conſtant and true to me, and whoſe grief for my fate has already nearly occaſioned her death.<note n="*" place="bottom">This unhappy woman, in the ſeventh month of her pregnancy, died on the day of her huſband's execution.</note> I leave five living children, who have been my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light—may they love their Country as I have done, and die for it, if needful.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, a falſe and ungenerous publication having appeared in a news-paper, ſtating, certain alleged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of guilt on my part, and thus ſtriking at my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is dearer to me than life, I take this ſolemn method of contradicting that calumny:—I was applied to by the high ſheriff and the Rev.

            <p>I truſt that all my virtuous Countrymen will bear me in their kind remembrance, and continue true and faithful to each other, as I have been to all of them; with this laſt wiſh of my heart, nothing doubting of the ſucceſs of that cauſe in which I ſuffer, and hoping for God's merciful forgiveneſs of ſuch offences as my frail nature may have at any time betrayed me into, I die in peace and charity with all mankind.</p>

            <p>We think it a duty we owe to ourſelves and to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, to ſtate preciſely the purport of our converſation with the unfortunate man, on the ſubject alluded to in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and the circumſtances that led to it.</p>
            <p>Being at Carrickfergus on Wedneſday the 27th ult. to attend an election of an Alderman and Burgeſſes for that Corporation—the ſheriff expreſſed an intention of going into the jail, for the purpoſe of ſeeing if the priſoner (Mr. Orr) had every reaſonable accommodation that his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſituation would admit of, and requeſted Mr. Briſtow to accompany him.—After ſome enquiries from the priſoner to that effect, and ſome obſervations on a religious book which Mr. Orr had been reading, Mr. Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow ſaid to him, "Sir, I have ſeen a paper which your brother and another gentleman brought to the ſheriff on Monday laſt, with your name annexed to it, in which you acknowledged the juſtice of your ſentence, and cautioned others againſt being led into bad practices by wicked and deſigning men." Mr. Briſtow added, that it was expected, from what your brother and that gentleman told the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, that it would have been publiſhed in laſt Monday's Belfaſt paper. "I am confident, ſaid Mr. Briſtow to Mr. Orr, that this acknowledgement, which you had for ſome time withheld, muſt now afford you great comfort." Mr. Orr replied, "Yes, Sir, it has relieved my mind very much."—Mr. Briſtow then ſaid to Mr. Orr, "As you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of your guilt, it is your bounden duty, if you know of any conſpiracy againſt the State, to make a diſcovery of any circumſtance you may know, which can throw any light upon it, as the only reparation you can make to your injured country." Mr. Orr replied, "I can recollect none at preſent." The ſheriff then ſaid—"Mr. Orr, if, upon reflection, you ſhould hereafter recollect any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of that nature which you would wiſh to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, I will, upon your application, immediately attend

you; or Mr. Briſtow, I am certain, will do ſo, or any other magiſtrate of the county." Mr. Orr replied, "I thank you, Sir.</p>
            <p>This we affirm was the whole ſubſtance of what then paſſed between us and the unfortunate William Orr, and, as nearly as we can recollect, the exact words—and that we never had a converſation with him on that ſubject at any other time,</p>
