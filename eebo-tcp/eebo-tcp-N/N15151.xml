            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Upon my word, Madam, I was a long while conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering whether it was a real or imaginary compliment: I could ſcarcely believe it poſſible, that this country, particularly this town, whoſe name ſtands foremoſt in the annals of America, ſhould ſo early plunge into the utmoſt exceſſes of diſſipation: How will ſuch an account read among the friends of America in Europe. I could hardly refrain from tears when I entered the Hall, to ſee the reſpectable inhabitants of this metropolis, ſo wantonly introducing a cuſtom of publick card playing, even at ſo early a period after the war. Forgive me, Madam, my expreſſing my ſentiments ſo freely; but believe me I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto indulged ſuch pleaſing ideas reſpecting this country, from their publick proceedings during the war, that when I find those ſentiments of their virtue turn out mere chimeras of my own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I cannot but lament my diſappointment. The

reſpect that has been ſhewn me ſince my arrival, I moſt gratefully acknowledge, but often on my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring from the parade of their entertainments. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but pity their deluſion. I did not carry my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm ſo far as to expect to find the rigid Spartan principles practiſed; but I did conceive to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into ſocieties of frugality and oeconomy: I did expect to find a cultivation of manners ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſimilar to their publick reſolves; but again par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, Madam, when I inform you I am greatly diſappointed. Britiſh gewgaws —etiquette and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, are too prevailing to be eaſily eradicated, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome immediate exertions are made to turn this deſtructive current: As a ſtranger, I cannot with propriety ſet up to give examples, but on ladies of eſtabliſhed characters in the country, much ought to be expected from them.</p>

We muſt be convinced how dangerous to the morals of youth—how deſtructive to the happineſs of families and individuals, an introduction of card parties has ever been; therefore though they have become of the party, which from inattention, rather than from inclination to promote a ſpirit of diſſipation they at

                     <p>The Doctor would do to live in Carthage, Sparta, or Rome in the moſt rigid times; but now thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents are wholly imaginary ideas of a Republican's coran— they are too antiquated—modern rebublica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm is of a very different complexion, as contraſted as the ſevere countenance of Cromwell, and the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſmooth face of a petit maitre—thoſe of the Doctor's are principles of republicaniſm of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilized kind—but now we ſoften them down in the ſchool of politeneſs, and make them wear a more pleaſing garb—the antient rebublican ſpirit is like the old principles of religion—ſtaunch Calviniſm— but now we have modernized them, and united them with the court ſtile of taſte and faſhion.</p>

                     <p>Amuſement, Madam, is not the principle in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; poſſibly the firſt inſtitutions of this kind were eſtabliſhed on theſe principles and ſuppoſe the ſums to be play'd for, were limited, as among us;—but the company which now viſit thoſe places of publick reſort, do not go for amuſement ſolely, but to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue a regular branch of buſineſs.—They have no idea of playing to paſs away a few leiſure hours, but to improve the moments for their profit—they are their buſy hours—the time on which depends their future proſpects. Therefore no converſation while at play is admitted, but what is on the ſubject of the game, and a perſon would appear equally as ridiculous to be ſpeaking at that time on any other ſubject, as to be talking of Hoyle at the tabernacle.</p>
