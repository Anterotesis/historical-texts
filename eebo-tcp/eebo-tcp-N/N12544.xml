            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>MY OWN LIFE.</head>
                  <p>IT is difficult for a man to Å¿peak long of himÅ¿elf without vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore, I Å¿hall be Å¿hort. It may be thought an inÅ¿tance of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that I pretend at all to write my life; but this Narrative Å¿hall contain little more than the HiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of my Writings; as, indeed, almoÅ¿t all my life has been Å¿pent in literary purÅ¿uits and occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The firÅ¿t Å¿ucceÅ¿s of moÅ¿t of my writings was not Å¿uch as to be an object of vanity.</p>
                  <p>I was born the 26th of April 1711, old Å¿tyle, at Edinburgh. I was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is a branch of the Earl of Home's, or Hume's; and my anceÅ¿tors had been proprietors of the eÅ¿tate, which my brother poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es, for Å¿everal generations. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, PreÅ¿ident of the College of JuÅ¿tice: the title of Lord Halkerton came by Å¿ucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion to her brother.</p>
                  <p>My family, however, was not rich, and being myÅ¿elf a younger brother, my patrimony, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mode of my country, was of courÅ¿e very Å¿lender. My father, who paÅ¿Å¿ed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me, with an elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a Å¿iÅ¿ter, under the care of our mother, a woman of Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular merit, who, though young and handÅ¿ome, devoted herÅ¿elf entirely to the rearing and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of her children. I paÅ¿Å¿ed through the ordinary courÅ¿e of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation with Å¿ucceÅ¿s, and was Å¿eized very early with a paÅ¿Å¿ion for literature, which has been the ruling paÅ¿Å¿ion of my life, and the great Å¿ource of my enjoyments. My Å¿tudious diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, my Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and my induÅ¿try, gave my family a notion that the law
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015853_0003_0F9A2E6F10094D08"/>
was a proper profeÅ¿Å¿ion for me; but I found an unÅ¿urmountable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ion to every thing but the purÅ¿uits of philoÅ¿ophy and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral learning; and while they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was Å¿ecretly devouring.</p>
                  <p>My very Å¿lender fortune, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being unÅ¿uitable to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, I was tempted, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forced, to make a very fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trial for entering into a more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I went over to France, with a view of proÅ¿ecuting my Å¿tudies in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan of life, which I have Å¿teadily and Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿sfully purÅ¿ued. I reÅ¿olved to make a very rigid frugality Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and to regard every object as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in literature.</p>
                  <p>During my retreat in France, firÅ¿t at Reims, but chiefly at La Fleche, in Anjou I compoÅ¿ed my <hi>TreatiÅ¿e of Human Nature.</hi> After paÅ¿Å¿ing three years very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably in that country, I came over to Lond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the end of 1738, I publiÅ¿hed my TreatiÅ¿e, and immediately went down to my mother and my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who lived at his country-houÅ¿e, and was employing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I continued with my mother and brother in the country, and in that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth.</p>
                  <p>In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with him in England; I found alÅ¿o, that the friends and family of that young nobleman were deÅ¿irous of putting him under my care and direction, for the Å¿tate of his mind and health required it.âI lived with him a twelve-month. My appointments during that time made a conÅ¿iderable acceÅ¿Å¿ion to my Å¿mall fortune.

TheÅ¿e two years were almoÅ¿t the only interruptions which my Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have received during the courÅ¿e of my life: I paÅ¿Å¿ed them agreeably, and in good company; and my appointments, with my frugality, had made m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I had always entertained a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that my want of Å¿ucceÅ¿s in publiÅ¿hing the TreatiÅ¿e of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very uÅ¿ual indiÅ¿cretion, in going to the preÅ¿s too early. I, therefore, caÅ¿t the firÅ¿t part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human UnderÅ¿tanding, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed while I was at Turin.

                  <p>In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true Å¿cene for a man of letters. In 1752, were publiÅ¿hed at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, where I then lived, my Political DiÅ¿courÅ¿es, the only work of mine that was Å¿ucceÅ¿sful on the firÅ¿t publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the Å¿ame year was publiÅ¿hed at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that Å¿ubject), is of all my writings, hiÅ¿torical, philoÅ¿ophical, or literary, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the beÅ¿t. It came unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed and unobÅ¿erved into the world.</p>

                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015853_0005_0F9A2E709FCB9A48"/>In 1752, the Faculty of Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates choÅ¿e me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the HiÅ¿tory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ion of the HouÅ¿e of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreÅ¿entations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, Å¿anguine in my expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of this work. I thought that I was the only hiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, that had at once neglected preÅ¿ent power, intereÅ¿t, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the cry of popular prejudices; and as the Å¿ubject was Å¿uited to every capacity, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But miÅ¿erable was my diÅ¿appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I was aÅ¿Å¿ailed by one cry of reproach, diÅ¿approbation, and even deteÅ¿tation; EngliÅ¿h, Scotch, and IriÅ¿h, Whig and Tory, churchman and Å¿ectary, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinker and religioniÅ¿t, patriot and courtier, united in their rage againÅ¿t the man, who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umed to Å¿hed a generous tear for the fate of Carles. I. and the Earl of Strafford; and after the firÅ¿t ebullitions of their fury were over, what was Å¿till more morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, the book Å¿eemed to Å¿ink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he Å¿old only forty-five copies of it. I Å¿carc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I was, however, I confeÅ¿s, diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to Å¿ome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial town of the former king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have changed my name, and never more have returned to my native country. But as this Å¿cheme was not now practicable, and the Å¿ubÅ¿equent volume was conÅ¿iderably advanced, I reÅ¿olved to pick up courage and to perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</p>
                  <p>In this interval, I publiÅ¿hed at London my Natural HiÅ¿tory of Religion, along with Å¿ome other Å¿mall pieces: its public entry was rather obÅ¿cure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and Å¿cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, which diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burtonian Å¿chool. This pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet gave Å¿ome conÅ¿olation for the otherwiÅ¿e indifferent recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my performance.</p>
                  <p>In 1756, two years after the fall of the firÅ¿t volume, was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed the Å¿econd volume of my HiÅ¿tory, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revolution. This perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance happened to give leÅ¿s diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿ure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only roÅ¿e itÅ¿elf, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.</p>
                  <p>But though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all places, both in the Å¿tate and in literature, I was Å¿o little inclined to yield to their Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿s clamour, that in above a hundred
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015853_0006_0F9A2E7150A44CB8"/>
alterations, which farther Å¿tudy, reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two firÅ¿t Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory Å¿ide. It is ridiculous to conÅ¿ider the EngliÅ¿h conÅ¿titution before that period as a regular plan of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>In 1759, I publiÅ¿hed my HiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the HouÅ¿e of Tudor. The clamour againÅ¿t this performance was almoÅ¿t equal to that againÅ¿t the HiÅ¿tory of the two firÅ¿t Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous againÅ¿t the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ions of public folly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued very peaceably and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly in my retreat at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, to finiÅ¿h, in two volumes, the more early part of the EngliÅ¿h HiÅ¿tory, which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable Å¿ucceÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithÅ¿tanding this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of winds and Å¿eaÅ¿ons, to which my writings had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed, they had Å¿till been making Å¿uch advances, that the copy-money given me by the bookÅ¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, much exceeded any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to Å¿et my foot out of it; and retaining the Å¿atisfaction of never having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a requeÅ¿t to one great man, or even making advances of friendÅ¿hip to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of paÅ¿Å¿ing all the reÅ¿t of my life in this philoÅ¿ophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the leaÅ¿t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, to attend him on his embaÅ¿Å¿y to Paris, with a near proÅ¿pect of being appointed Å¿ecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the embaÅ¿Å¿y; and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This offer, however inviting, I at firÅ¿t declined, both becauÅ¿e I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant to begin connexions with the great, and becauÅ¿e I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris, would prove diÅ¿agreeable to a perÅ¿on of my age and humour: but on his lordÅ¿hip's repeating the invitation, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of it. I have every reaÅ¿on, both of pleaÅ¿ure and intereÅ¿t, to think myÅ¿elf happy in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, General Conway.</p>
                  <p>ThoÅ¿e who have not Å¿een the Å¿trange effects of modes, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all ranks and Å¿tations. The more I reÅ¿iled from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ive civilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real Å¿atisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of Å¿enÅ¿ible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the univerÅ¿e. I thought once of Å¿ettling there for life.</p>
                  <p>I was appointed Å¿ecretary to the embaÅ¿Å¿y; and in Å¿ummer 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lord Lieutenant of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I was <hi>charge d' affaires</hi> till the arrival of the Duke of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, towards the end of the year, In the beginning of 1766, I left Paris, and next Å¿ummer went to Edinburgh, with the Å¿ame view as formerly, of bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myÅ¿elf in a philoÅ¿ophical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015853_0007_0F9A2E721276F1A8"/>
money, and a much larger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, by mean's of Lord Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's friendÅ¿hip, than I left it; and I was deÅ¿irous of trying what Å¿uperfluity could produce, as I had fomerly made an experiment of a competency. But, in 1767, I received from Mr Conway an invitation to be Under-Å¿ecretary; and this invitation, both the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the perÅ¿on, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions with Lord Hertford, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from declining. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Edinburgh in 1769, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opulent (for I poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of 1060l. a year), healthy, and though Å¿omewhat Å¿tricken in years, with the proÅ¿pect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying long my eaÅ¿e, and of Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the increaÅ¿e of my reputation.</p>
                  <p>In Å¿pring 1775, I was Å¿truck with a diÅ¿order in my bowels, which at firÅ¿t gave me no alarm, but has Å¿ince, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a Å¿peedy diÅ¿Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. I have Å¿uffered very little pain from my diÅ¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rder; and what is more Å¿trange, have, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding the great decline of my perÅ¿on, never Å¿uffered a moment's abatement of my Å¿pirits; inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that were I to name the period of my life, which I Å¿hould moÅ¿t chooÅ¿e to paÅ¿s over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s the Å¿ame ardour as ever in Å¿tudy, and the Å¿ame gaiety in company. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider, beÅ¿ides, that a man of Å¿ixty five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities; and though I Å¿ee many Å¿ymptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out at laÅ¿t with additional luÅ¿tre, I knew that I could have but very few years to enjoy it. It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be more detached from life than I am at preÅ¿ent.</p>
                  <p>To conclude hiÅ¿torically with my own character. I am, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was (for that is the Å¿tyle I muÅ¿t now uÅ¿e in Å¿peaking of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf which embordens me the more to Å¿peak my Å¿entiments); I was, I Å¿ay, a man of mild diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions, of command of temper, of an open, Å¿ocial, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little Å¿uÅ¿ceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my paÅ¿Å¿ions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling paÅ¿Å¿ion, never Å¿oured my temper, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding my frequent diÅ¿ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and careleÅ¿s, as well as to the Å¿tudious and literary; and as I took a particular pleaÅ¿ure in the company of modeÅ¿t women, I had no reaÅ¿on to be diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though moÅ¿t men any wiÅ¿e eminent, have found reaÅ¿on to complain of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth: and though I wantonly expoÅ¿ed myÅ¿elf to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they Å¿eemed to be diÅ¿armed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occaÅ¿ion to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate any one circumÅ¿tance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well Å¿uppoÅ¿e, would have been glad to invent and propagate any Å¿tory to my diÅ¿advantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I cannot Å¿ay there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in making this funeral ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of myÅ¿elf, but I hope it is not a miÅ¿placed one; and this is a matter of fact which is eaÅ¿ily cleared and aÅ¿certained.</p>

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT is with a real, though a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry melancholy pleaÅ¿ure, that I Å¿it down to give you Å¿ome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the behaviour of our late excellent friend, Mr. Hume, during his laÅ¿t illneÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p>Though, in his own judgment, his diÅ¿eaÅ¿e was mortal and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet he allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d himÅ¿elf to be prevailed upon, by the entreaty of his friends, to try what might be the effects of a long journey. A few days before he Å¿et out, he wrote that account of his own life, which, together with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther papers, he has left to your care. My account, therefore, Å¿hall begin where his ends.</p>
                  <p>He Å¿et out for London towards the end of April, and at Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth met with Mr. John Home and myÅ¿elf, who had both come down from London on purpoÅ¿e to Å¿ee him, expecting to have found him at Edinburgh. Mr. Home returned with him, and attended him during the whole of his Å¿tay in England, with that care and attention which might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a temper Å¿o perfectly friendly and affectionate. As I had written to my mother that Å¿he might expect me in Scotland, I was under the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing my journey. His diÅ¿eaÅ¿e Å¿eemed to yield to exerciÅ¿e and change of air, and when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in London, he was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in much better health than when he left Edinburgh. He was adviÅ¿ed to go to Bath to drink the waters, which appeared for Å¿ome time to have Å¿o good an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon him, that even he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf began to entertain, what he was not apt to do, a better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own health. His Å¿ymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, however, Å¿oon returned with their uÅ¿ual violence, and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery, but Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with the utmoÅ¿t cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and the moÅ¿t perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and reÅ¿ignation. Upon his return to Edinburgh, though he found himÅ¿elf much weaker, yet his cheerfulneÅ¿s never abated, and he continued to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, as uÅ¿ual, with correcting his own works for a new edition, with reading books of amuÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the converÅ¿ation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his friends; and, Å¿ometimes in the evening, with a party at his favourite game of whiÅ¿t. His cheerfulneÅ¿s was Å¿o great, and his converÅ¿ation and amuÅ¿ements run Å¿o much in their uÅ¿ual Å¿train, that, notwithÅ¿tanding all bad Å¿ymptoms, many people could not believe he was dying. <q>I Å¿hall tell your friend, Colonel EdmondÅ¿tone,</q> Å¿aid Doctor Dundas to him one day, <q>that I left you much better, and in a fair way of recovery.</q>â "Doctor," Å¿aid he, <q>as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you would not chuÅ¿e to tell any thing but the truth, you had better tell him, that I am dying as faÅ¿t as my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if I have any, could wiÅ¿h, and as eaÅ¿ily and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as my beÅ¿t friends could deÅ¿ire.</q> Colonel Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tone Å¿oon afterwards came to Å¿ee him, and take leave of him; and on his way home, he could not forbear writing him a letter bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him once more an eternal adieu, and applying to him, as to a dying man, the beautiful French verÅ¿es in which the AbbÃ© Chaulieu, in expectation of his own death, laments his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿eparation from his friend, the Marquis de la Fare, Mr. Hume's magnanimity and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s were Å¿uch, that his moÅ¿t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate friends knew, that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man, and that Å¿o far from being hurt by this frankneÅ¿s, he was rather pleaÅ¿ed and flattered by it. I happened to come into his room while he was reading this letter, which he had juÅ¿t received, and which he immediately Å¿howed me. I told him, that though I was Å¿enÅ¿ible how very much be was weakened, and that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances were in many reÅ¿pects very bad, yet his cheerfulneÅ¿s was Å¿till Å¿o great, the Å¿pirit of life Å¿eemed Å¿till to be Å¿o very Å¿trong in him, that I could not help entertaining Å¿ome faint hopes. He anÅ¿wered, <q>Your hopes are groundleÅ¿s. An habitual diarrhoea of more than a year's Å¿tanding, would be a very bad diÅ¿eaÅ¿e at any age: at my age it is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening. I feel myÅ¿elf weaker than when I roÅ¿e in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when I riÅ¿e in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am Å¿enÅ¿ible, beÅ¿ides, that Å¿ome of my vital parts are affected, Å¿o that I muÅ¿t Å¿oon die.</q>â "Well," Å¿aid I, "if it muÅ¿t be Å¿o, you have at leaÅ¿t the Å¿atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of leaving all your friends, your brother's family in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in great proÅ¿perity." He Å¿aid, that he felt that Å¿atisfaction Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ibly, that when he was reading a few days before, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian's Dialogues of the Dead, among all the excuÅ¿es which are alledged to Charon for not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readily into his boat, he could not find one that fitted him; he had no houÅ¿e to finiÅ¿h, he had no daughter to provide for, he had no enemies upon whom he wiÅ¿hed to revenge himÅ¿elf. <q>I could not well imagine, Å¿aid he, what excuÅ¿e I could make to Charon in order to obtain a little delay. I have done eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing of conÅ¿equence which I ever meant to do, and I could at no time expect to leave my relations and friends in a better Å¿ituation than that in which I am now likely to leave them; I, therefore, have
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015853_0010_0F9A2E746D5750A8"/>
all reaÅ¿on to die contented.</q> He then diverted himÅ¿elf with inventing Å¿everal jocular excuÅ¿es, which he Å¿uppoÅ¿ed he might make to Charon, and with imagining the very Å¿urly anÅ¿wers which it might Å¿uit the character of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron to return to them. <q>Upon further conÅ¿ideration, Å¿aid he, I thought I might Å¿ay to him, Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow me a little time, that I may Å¿ee how the Public receives the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> But Charon would anÅ¿wer, <q>When you have Å¿een the effect of theÅ¿e, you will be for making other alterations. There will be no end of Å¿uch excuÅ¿es; Å¿o, honeÅ¿t friend, pleaÅ¿e Å¿tep into the boat.</q> But I might Å¿till urge, <q>Have a little patience, good Charon, I have been endeavouring to open the eyes of the public. If I live a few years longer, I may have the Å¿atisfaction of Å¿eeing the downfal of Å¿ome of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿yÅ¿tems of Å¿uperÅ¿tition.</q> But Charon would then loÅ¿e all temper and decency. <q>You loitering rogue, that will not happen theÅ¿e many hundred years. Do you fancy I will grant you a leaÅ¿e for Å¿o long a term? Get into the boat this inÅ¿tant, you lazy loitering rogue.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching diÅ¿Å¿olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with great cheerfulneÅ¿s, he never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity. He never mentioned the Å¿ubject but when the converÅ¿ation naturally led to it, and never dwelt longer upon it than the courÅ¿e of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation happened to require: it was a Å¿ubject indeed which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred pretty frequently, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equence of the inquiries which his friends, who came to Å¿ee him, naturally made concerning the Å¿tate of his health. The conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation which I mentioned above, and which paÅ¿Å¿ed on ThurÅ¿day the 8th of AuguÅ¿t, was the laÅ¿t, except one, that I ever had with him. He had now become Å¿o very weak, that the company of his moÅ¿t intimate friends fatigued him; for his cheerfulneÅ¿s was Å¿till Å¿o great, his complaiÅ¿ance and Å¿ocial diÅ¿poÅ¿ition were Å¿till Å¿o entire, that when any friend was with him, he could not help talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more, and with greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, than Å¿uited the weakneÅ¿s of his body. At his own deÅ¿ire, therefore, I agreed to leave Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, where I was Å¿taying part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his account, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my mother's houÅ¿e here, at Kirkaldy, upon condition that he would Å¿end for me whenever he wiÅ¿hed to Å¿ee me; the phyÅ¿ici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who Å¿aw him moÅ¿t frequently, Doctor Black, undertaking, in the mean time, to write me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ionally an account of the Å¿tate of his health.</p>
                  <p>On the 22d of AuguÅ¿t, the Doctor wrote me the following letter:</p>
                  <p>"Since my laÅ¿t, Mr. Hume has paÅ¿Å¿ed his time pretty eaÅ¿ily, but is much weaker. He Å¿its up, goes down Å¿tairs once a day, and amuÅ¿es himÅ¿elf with reading, but Å¿eldom Å¿ees any body. He finds that even the converÅ¿ation of his moÅ¿t intimate friends fatigues and oppreÅ¿Å¿es him; and it is happy that he does not need it, for he is quite free from anxiety, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or low Å¿pirits, and paÅ¿Å¿es his time very well with the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of amuÅ¿ing books."</p>

                        <p>YeÅ¿terday about four o'clock afternoon, Mr. Hume expired. The near approach of his death became evident in the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ThurÅ¿day and Friday, when his diÅ¿eaÅ¿e became exceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ive, and Å¿oon weakened him Å¿o much, that he could no longer riÅ¿e out of his bed. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the laÅ¿t perfectly Å¿enÅ¿ible, and free from much pain or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of diÅ¿treÅ¿s. He never drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Å¿malleÅ¿t expreÅ¿Å¿ion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience; but when he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion to Å¿peak to the people about him, always did it with affection and tenderneÅ¿s. I thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to write to bring you over, eÅ¿pecially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you deÅ¿iring you not to come. When he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very weak it coÅ¿t him an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Å¿peak, and he died in Å¿uch a happy compoÅ¿ure of mind, that nothing could exceed it.</p>

                  <p>Thus died our moÅ¿t excellent, and never to be forgotten friend; concerning whoÅ¿e philoÅ¿ophical opinions men will, no doubt, judge variouÅ¿ly, every one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, or condemning them, according as they happen to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide or diÅ¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gree with his own; but concerning whoÅ¿e character and conduct there can Å¿carce be a difference of opinion. His tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, indeed, Å¿eemed to be more happily balanced, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Å¿uch an expreÅ¿Å¿ion, than that perhaps of any other man I have ever known. Even in the loweÅ¿t Å¿tate of his fortune, his great and neceÅ¿Å¿ary frugality ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hindered him from exerciÅ¿ing upon p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oper occaÅ¿ions, acts both of charity and generoÅ¿ity. It was a frugality founded, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on avarice, but upon the love of independency. The extreme gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneÅ¿s of his nature never weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened either the firmneÅ¿s of his hand, or the Å¿teadineÅ¿s of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olutions. His conÅ¿tant pleaÅ¿ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was the genuine effuÅ¿ion of good-nature and good-humour, tempered with delicacy and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿ty, and without even the Å¿lighteÅ¿t tincture of malignity, Å¿o frequently the diÅ¿agreeable Å¿ource of what is called wit in other men. it never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify; and therefore, far from offending, it Å¿eldom Å¿ailed to pleaÅ¿e and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, even thoÅ¿e who were the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015853_0012_0F9A2E75CFC352F8"/>
objects of it, To his friends, who were frequently the objects of it, there was not perhaps any one of all his great and amiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which contributed more to endear his converÅ¿ation. And that gaiety of temper, Å¿o agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Å¿ociety, but which is Å¿o of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten accompanied with frivolous and Å¿uperficial qualities, was in him certainly attended with the moÅ¿t Å¿evere application, the moÅ¿t extenÅ¿ive learning, the greateÅ¿t depth of thought, and a capacity in every reÅ¿pect the moÅ¿t compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henÅ¿ive. Upon the whole, I have always conÅ¿idered him, both in his life-time and Å¿ince his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wiÅ¿e and virtuous man; as perhaps the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of human frailty will permit.</p>

                  <p>LES VOYAGES D'UN PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHE of M. le Poivre have been much admired in France. They were originally read before the Royal Society of Agriculture at Lyons, of which he was preÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and afterwards before the Royal Society of Paris. For Å¿ometime they were handed about in manuÅ¿cript, and at length, found their way to the preÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p>M. le Poivre's manner is eaÅ¿y and elegant; his obÅ¿ervations Å¿triking and judicious; his Å¿enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments humane and benevolent.â The genuine happineÅ¿s of every nation muÅ¿t depend on agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and agriculture muÅ¿t ever be influenced by eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed laws and modes of government: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indulgently Å¿miles on the labour of a free-born people, but Å¿hrinks with horror from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and the Å¿lave. This is his Å¿yÅ¿tem, and it is the Å¿yÅ¿tem of truth, founded on experience, and Å¿upported not only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring cotemporary nations, but by contraÅ¿ting nations with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves at different periods.</p>
                  <p>It is neceÅ¿Å¿ary the reader Å¿hould keep in view the country of the author, as many of his Å¿trictures on European agriculture, though unapplicable perhaps to Britain, convey a deÅ¿criptive picture of the Å¿tate of cultivation in France.</p>

                  <p>EVERY people, however bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, have arts peculiar to themÅ¿elves. The diverÅ¿ity of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, whilÅ¿t it varies the wants of mankind, offers to their induÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try different productions on which to exerciÅ¿e it. Every country, at a certain degree of diÅ¿tance, has fabrics Å¿o Å¿ingularly peculiar to itÅ¿elf, that they could not have been the fabrics of other regions: but agriculture, in every climate, is the univerÅ¿al art of mankind: from one extreme of the globe to the other, nations Å¿till barbarous, as well as thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e ideas are civilized, procure to themÅ¿elves, at leaÅ¿t, a part of their Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence by the culture of their fields; yet this art, however univerÅ¿al, is not every where equally flouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>It never fails to proÅ¿per among wiÅ¿e nations, who know how to honour and encourage it;âit Å¿upports itÅ¿elf but feebly amongÅ¿t a people half poliÅ¿hed, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prefer to it frivolous arts, or who, being Å¿ufficiently enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened perhaps to perceive its uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are Å¿till too much Å¿laves to the prejudices of their ancient barbarity, to affranchize and confer honours on thoÅ¿e who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿e it;âit languiÅ¿hes, and its influence is Å¿carcely to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved amongÅ¿t barbarians, who deÅ¿piÅ¿e it.</p>
                  <p>The Å¿tate of agriculture has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been the principal object of my reÅ¿earches among the various people I have Å¿een in the courÅ¿e of my voyages. It is almoÅ¿t im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿Å¿ible for a traveller, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps only paÅ¿Å¿es through a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to make Å¿uch remarks as are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to convey a juÅ¿t idea of the government, police, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

of the inhabitants. In Å¿uch a caÅ¿e, the criterion which beÅ¿t marks the internal Å¿tate of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to obÅ¿erve the public markets, and the face of the country. If the markets abound in proviÅ¿ions, if the fields are well cultivated, and covered with rich crops, then in general you may conclude that the country is well peopled, that the inhabitants are civilized and happy, that their manners are poliÅ¿hed, and their government agreeable to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaÅ¿on. â You may then Å¿ay to yourÅ¿elf, I am amongÅ¿t <hi>Men.</hi>

                  <p>I never remember a Å¿ingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of being obliged to retract this firÅ¿t idea, conceived Å¿imply by inÅ¿pecting the Å¿tate of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture amongÅ¿t the various nations I have Å¿een: the knowledge of various particulars, which a long reÅ¿idence among many of them has enabled me to acquire, has ever confirmed me in opinion, that a country poorly cultivated is always inhabited by men bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous or oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, and that population there can never be conÅ¿iderable.</p>
                  <p>You will obÅ¿erve by the detail I now offer you of my enquiries, that in every country agriculture depends abÅ¿olutely on the laws, the manners, and even on the eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed prejudices of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE iÅ¿lands and weÅ¿tern diÅ¿tricts of this part of the world which I have Å¿een, are for the greater part uncultivated lands, inhabited by unhappy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes. TheÅ¿e wretched men, who have Å¿o poor an eÅ¿timation of themÅ¿elves as to Å¿ell one another, never employ a thought on the cultivation of their lands. Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to exiÅ¿t from day to day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a climate where their wants are few, they cultivate juÅ¿t as much as prevents their dying of hunger; they careleÅ¿ly Å¿ow every year Å¿ome maize, a very little rice; and plant, in Å¿mall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, different kinds of potatoes, not of the nature of ours, though the culture is much the Å¿ame; we know them by the name of <hi>yams.</hi> In general their harveÅ¿ts are Å¿o poor, that the Europeans, who reÅ¿ort to them for the purchaÅ¿e of Å¿laves, are obliged to bring from Europe or America the proviÅ¿ions neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the maintenance of thoÅ¿e unfortunate creatures doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to compoÅ¿e their cargoes.</p>
                     <p>The negroes, who inhabit the environs of the European colonies, give Å¿omewhat more attention to agriculture than the others.â They rear flocks; they cultivate rice in greater quantities; and in their gardens are found pulÅ¿e, of which the Å¿eed has been brought from Europe; yet all they know of agriculture, they have learnt from the Europeans Å¿ettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t them; their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is extremely bounded; and I have never been able to diÅ¿cover in their induÅ¿try any proceÅ¿s which could in the leaÅ¿t improve our own.</p>
                     <p>From the river of Angola to Cape Negroe, and from thence till you approach the Cape of Good Hope, nothing is to be Å¿een but Å¿terile uncultivated lands; the coaÅ¿ts are naked and covered with barren Å¿ands; and you are under the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of travelling many leagues before you can diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a palm-tree, or the Å¿lighteÅ¿t verdure. The country and its few inhabitants Å¿eem to be Å¿truck with one common curÅ¿e. From the informations I have received touching theÅ¿e countries from the Italian miÅ¿Å¿ionaries, who with an admirable zeal have penetrated into the heart of theÅ¿e accurÅ¿ed regions, I learn likewiÅ¿e that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture is juÅ¿t as languid in the

                     <p>THE countries around the Cape were condemned to the Å¿ame Å¿terility before the Dutch took poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of them; but Å¿ince their eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment on this point of Africa, the lands produce in abundance wheat and grain of every kind, wines of different qualities, and a conÅ¿iderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of excellent fruits, collected from every quarter of the world. There you Å¿ee extenÅ¿ive paÅ¿tures covered with horÅ¿es, black cattle, and Å¿heepâtheÅ¿e herds and flocks thrive exceedingly well. The abundance which this colony en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, compared to the barrenneÅ¿s of the Å¿urrounding countries, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently demonÅ¿trates that the earth denies her favours only to the tyrant and the Å¿lave; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes prodigal of her treaÅ¿ures, beyond the moÅ¿t Å¿anguine hope, Å¿o Å¿oon as Å¿he is free, and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by men of diÅ¿cernment, whom wiÅ¿e and invariable laws protect.</p>
                     <p>A number of Frenchmen, forced from their country by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, have on this coaÅ¿t found a new eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment, and, with it Å¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, property, and liberty, the only true encouragers of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the only principles of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. They have enriched this adopted mother by their induÅ¿try; they have there founded conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able colonies, Å¿ome of which bear the name of that unhappy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which denied them the uÅ¿e of water and of fire, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of which however they Å¿till fondly cheriÅ¿h.</p>
                     <p>The colony of the Little Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿es all the reÅ¿t, by the induÅ¿try of the coloniÅ¿ts, and the fertility of the lands which belong to it. The paÅ¿tures are there compoÅ¿ed of a variety of graÅ¿Å¿es, natives of the country, together with Å¿everal different Å¿pecies of herbage, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e our artificial meadows in Europe, Å¿uch as trefoil, lucerne, and Å¿aintfoin. The exotic plants, the Å¿eeds of which have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Dutch, flouriÅ¿h there as the natural productions of the country. ThoÅ¿e Å¿eeds are Å¿own by an operation of the plough; they cut the graÅ¿s only the firÅ¿t year; the Å¿econd they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the meadows to cattle, which live there at diÅ¿cretion, without any other attention than that of collecting them together every evening into a park incloÅ¿ed with Å¿trong and high palliÅ¿ades, to Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them againÅ¿t the lions and tigers, with which this country abounds.</p>
                     <p>Some of theÅ¿e encloÅ¿ures are watered only by the rains, altho' they generally endeavour to chuÅ¿e them in the neighbourhood of Å¿ome brook, where they dig com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious watering places. In all theÅ¿e paÅ¿turages, they have an eye to groves of trees, where the herds and flocks may find Å¿helter againÅ¿t the intenÅ¿e heat of the Å¿un; particularly in January, February, and March, which in this part of the world are the moÅ¿t Å¿ultry months in the year.</p>
                     <p>The arable land is here labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in Europe, Å¿ometimes by

horÅ¿es, but oftener by oxen: the Dutch of this colony have by their induÅ¿try corrected the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Å¿luggiÅ¿hneÅ¿s of theÅ¿e latter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, by exerciÅ¿ing them while young in a briÅ¿k pace; in conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which I have Å¿een, at the Cape, carriages, drawn by teams of ten or a dozen yoke of oxen, go as expeditiouÅ¿ly as if drawn by horÅ¿es.</p>
                     <p>The grains commonly Å¿own at the Cape, are wheat, turkey corn, and rice; theÅ¿e generally produce an increaÅ¿e of fifty-fold. They cultivate a variety of different kinds of pulÅ¿e, Å¿uch as peaÅ¿e, common beans, and French beans. This pulÅ¿e makes a refreÅ¿hing proviÅ¿ion to the Å¿hips touching at the Cape going or returning to India.</p>
                     <p>A particular Å¿pecies of this pulÅ¿e is much in requeÅ¿t in India, to which they export a conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity: it is there known by the name of <hi>Cape PeaÅ¿e:</hi> it is a kind of French bean which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no prop; its grain is of the form of that bean, but larger and flatter; it taÅ¿tes like our green peaÅ¿e, and preÅ¿erves its freÅ¿hneÅ¿s for a long time. I have this year attempted the culture of this plant, which promiÅ¿es Å¿ucceÅ¿s. The cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate at the Cape Å¿eems to demand from the cultivator an attention which appears not Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary in this country, and which would even perhaps be prejudicial to the productions of our lands.</p>
                     <p>The Cape however is expoÅ¿ed the greateÅ¿t part of the year to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent hurricanes, which blow ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally from the north-eaÅ¿t.â TheÅ¿e winds are Å¿o impetuous that they would beat down the fruits from the trees, and Å¿weep to deÅ¿truction the labours of the farmer, had they not provided a barrier for the Å¿ecurity of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veÅ¿t. The Dutch coloniÅ¿ts have divided their lands into Å¿mall fields, which they have Å¿urround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with high palliÅ¿ades of oak and other trees, planted very cloÅ¿e to one another, Å¿omewhat reÅ¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a charmille, deÅ¿igned for the ornament of a garden. TheÅ¿e palliÅ¿ades th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                     <p>It is by this induÅ¿try alone that the Dutch have rendered this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony not only the granary of all their Å¿ettlements in the EaÅ¿t-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but the moÅ¿t commodious place for veÅ¿Å¿els to touch at for refreÅ¿hments and proviÅ¿ions of all kinds.</p>
                     <p>When the Dutch began to form their vineyards, they endeavoured to procure plants from thoÅ¿e can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons which enjoyed the greateÅ¿t reputation for their vines; but after many fruitleÅ¿s attempts to produce, at the extremity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, the wines of Burgundy and Champagne, they applied to rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plants tranÅ¿ported from Spain, the Canaries, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, where the climate is more analogous to the Cape. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, the plants which are culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated moÅ¿t Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully, are thoÅ¿e of the MuÅ¿cadel kind: the red MuÅ¿cadel particularly, which they rear in a Å¿mall diÅ¿trict called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, produces moÅ¿t delicious wine; the Dutch EaÅ¿t-India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany always Å¿ecure this vintage, which they Å¿end in preÅ¿ents to the Å¿overeigns of Europe.</p>
                     <p>The wines at the Cape are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated without vine-props; the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015853_0019_0F9A2E7B14E12760"/>
method of labour is much the Å¿ame with that in France. The vineyards are Å¿urrounded by a number of trees, upon which they entwine the Å¿lips of the great SpaniÅ¿h MuÅ¿cadine, in form of eÅ¿paÅ¿iers, very high, by which the vines are Å¿heltered from the violence of the winds.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿ame attention, at the Cape, is paid to gardening, as to the other branches of agriculture. You there find all the variety of European pulÅ¿e, greens, herbs, and roots, with the beÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e peculiar to other parts of the world. Independent of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the coloniÅ¿ts, which are kept in as fine order as any in Europe, the India Company have cultivated two or three gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, extenÅ¿ive and magnificent, which they Å¿upport with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence worthy of a Å¿overeign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>Fifteen or twenty European gardeners, whoÅ¿e abilities are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved before they are embarked, are employed in the cultivation of each of thoÅ¿e vaÅ¿t gardens, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of a principal gardener, whoÅ¿e place is lucrative and honourable. It is in thoÅ¿e gardens, at the expence of the company, that all the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made in every new Å¿pecies of culture; and it is there that every private individual is provided, gratis, with Å¿uch plants and Å¿eeds as he may have occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for, together with the neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary inÅ¿tructions for their cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. TheÅ¿e gardens furniÅ¿h, in the greateÅ¿t abundance, herbage and fruits of various kinds to the company's Å¿hips.</p>
                     <p>Travellers cannot but with pleaÅ¿ure and admiration obÅ¿erve large encloÅ¿ures conÅ¿ecrated to the Å¿tudy and improvement of botany, in which the moÅ¿t rare and uÅ¿eful plants, from every quarter of the world, are arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moÅ¿t excellent order: the curious have the additional Å¿atisfaction alÅ¿o of finding Å¿kilful gardeners, who take pleaÅ¿ure in deÅ¿cribing and pointing out their virtues.</p>
                     <p>ThoÅ¿e beautiful gardens are terminated by large orchards, where are to be found all the fruits of Europe, together with Å¿everal natives of Africa and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ia.

in many cantons are large tracts of tilled ground, covered with graÅ¿s of an extraordinary Å¿ize, which grows to the height of five or Å¿ix feet; the natives call it <hi>Fatak</hi>; it is excellent for nouriÅ¿hing and fattening their horned cattle, which are of the largeÅ¿t Å¿pecies, and differ in Å¿hape from ours, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by a large fleÅ¿hy protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance on their neck âAnother graÅ¿s, of a finer blade, Å¿hoots Å¿pontaneouÅ¿ly through the Å¿ands on the Å¿ea coaÅ¿t, which furniÅ¿hes food for the Å¿heep: theÅ¿e are of the Å¿ame Å¿pecies with thoÅ¿e of Barbary, and differ from ours moÅ¿t remarkably, by the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trous Å¿ize of their tails, which weigh in general from Å¿ix to eight pounds.</p>
                     <p>The MadecaÅ¿Å¿es or Malegaches (which is the name of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this iÅ¿land) cultivate Å¿carce any other grain but rice: they Å¿ow at the commencement of the rainy Å¿eaÅ¿on; in conÅ¿equence of which they are not under the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of watering their fields. In labouring their ground, they uÅ¿e no inÅ¿trument but the pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe; they begin by grubbing up all the weeds; then five or Å¿ix men, ranging themÅ¿elves in a line on the field, dig little holes as they paÅ¿s along, into which the women or children, who follow, throw the grains of the rice, and then with their feet cover them with earth: a field Å¿own in this manner, produces an increaÅ¿e of above eighty or a hundred-fold, which proves rather the extreme fertility of the Å¿oil, than the goodneÅ¿s of the cultivation: bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underÅ¿tood as it may be, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the inhabitants of Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaÅ¿car live in abundance. In no country in the world, that I have Å¿een, are rice and other eÅ¿Å¿ential proviÅ¿ions cheaper than in this iÅ¿land. For a remnant of coarÅ¿e blue cloath, which may be worth perhaps twenty pence, the Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿Å¿e gives two or three meaÅ¿ures of rice. TheÅ¿e meaÅ¿ures are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed by the Europeans, who never fail to enlarge them every year; yet the iÅ¿landers do not complain. The meaÅ¿ure is firÅ¿t of all heaped; the buyer then, in virtue of an eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed right for Å¿ecuring good meaÅ¿ure, thruÅ¿ts his arm to the elbow in the rice, and with one Å¿weep empties it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t entirely, which the Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿Å¿e has the patience a Å¿econd time to repleniÅ¿h, without a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. This meaÅ¿ure is called a <hi>Gamelle,</hi> which, thus filled, will hold about 160 pounds of pure rice.</p>
                     <p>There cannot be a doubt, but if our India Company,<note n="*" place="bottom">The French India Company.</note> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the trade with the natives of this iÅ¿land, would give proper encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to agriculture, it would in a Å¿hort time make a rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿s.âOur iÅ¿lands of Bourbon and France would here always find a certain reÅ¿ource againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e dearths which too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diÅ¿treÅ¿s the latter of thoÅ¿e iÅ¿lands.

The horned cattle and Å¿heep, which they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from that iÅ¿land, thrive here extremely well, eÅ¿pecially as they have alÅ¿o introduced the graÅ¿s called <hi>Fatak,</hi> which, as I have before obÅ¿erved, makes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent paÅ¿turage.</p>
                     <p>The lands of this iÅ¿land are principally employed in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the coffee-tree. The firÅ¿t plants of this Å¿hrubby tree were brought from Mocha.

all Å¿uch weeds, as might Å¿hoot up within their circumference: at the end of eighteen months the coffee-tree begins to bear fruit, and in three years yields a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful crop. They plant theÅ¿e trees chequer-wiÅ¿e, at about the diÅ¿tance of Å¿even feet from one another, and, when they grow too tall, prune them to the height of perhaps two feet from the ground.</p>

The coffee, after it is gathered in, muÅ¿t be dried; for Å¿everal days, therefore, it is expoÅ¿ed to the Å¿un, till the bean becomes extremely dry; they then clear it of the pulp, which is done by peÅ¿tles in large wooden troughs.</p>

The coffee, the cotton, the indigo, the Å¿ugar cane, the pear, the cinnamon, the mulberry, the tea, and the cocoa trees have all been cultivated by experiments, but in Å¿uch a Å¿uperficial manner as could never Å¿ecure Å¿ucceÅ¿s.

                     <p>The <hi>Manaic</hi> was firÅ¿t introduced into this iÅ¿land by M. de la Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donnois: the culture of this plant was at firÅ¿t attended with very great difficulty, but it is now the principal reÅ¿ource of the coloniÅ¿ts for the nouriÅ¿hment of their Å¿laves. As the culture of this root is here the Å¿ame as in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, I Å¿hall not repeat what has been related by a number of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.</p>
                     <p>They formerly brought from MadagaÅ¿car, black cattle and Å¿heep; but Å¿ince they have diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that more advantage at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the tranÅ¿portation of Å¿laves, they have neglected the increaÅ¿e of their cattle, which the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual demands of the Å¿hipping, and the wants of the inhabitants at the Å¿ame time, daily diminiÅ¿h: beÅ¿ides, they have never hitherto formed any paÅ¿tures; Å¿uch as they have attempted having been laid out with Å¿o little Å¿kill, that they have not Å¿ucceeded. The iÅ¿land produces naturally, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cantons, an excellent kind of graÅ¿s, which grows to the height of five or Å¿ix feet. This graÅ¿s begins to appear above ground about the beginning of the rainy Å¿eaÅ¿on; it performs all its vegetation during the three months, which this Å¿eaÅ¿on laÅ¿ts: the inhabitants take advantage of this to paÅ¿ture their herds, who fatten upon it amazingly; but, the vegetation over, there remains nothing on the ground but a Å¿traw too hard to afford nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the cattle; and, Å¿oon after, the fire, which is kindled here by a thouÅ¿and accidents, conÅ¿umes this Å¿traw, and with it frequently part of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreÅ¿ts. During the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the year, the herds wander about and languiÅ¿h amongÅ¿t the woods.</p>
                     <p>The greateÅ¿t fault which has been committed in this iÅ¿land, and which has proved moÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to cultivation, is the method of clearing the woods from off the ground by fire, without leaving groves and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets at proper diÅ¿tances. The rains, in this iÅ¿land, conduce moÅ¿t to the amelioration of the grounds; but the clouds being Å¿topt by the foreÅ¿ts, there the rains fall; whilÅ¿t the cleared lands are Å¿carce watered by a Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle drop: the fields, at the Å¿ame time, being thus deprived of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, are expoÅ¿ed to the violence of the winds, which often entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deÅ¿troy the harveÅ¿ts.âThe Dutch, as we have before obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, found no trees at the Cape; but they have planted them there as Å¿helter for their habitations.

                     <p>THE kingdom of Siam, Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the peninÅ¿ula of the Indies beyond the Ganges, is in general extremely fertile.â Divided, like IndoÅ¿tan, by a chain of mountains from north to Å¿outh, it enjoys, all the year round, and at the Å¿ame time, two very oppoÅ¿ite Å¿eaÅ¿ons. The weÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern diviÅ¿ion, all along the bay of Bengal, is deluged by continual rains, during the Å¿ix months that the monÅ¿oons continue to blow from the weÅ¿t. This Å¿eaÅ¿on is conÅ¿idered as their winter on this coaÅ¿t; whilÅ¿t in the other diviÅ¿ion of the kingdom, towards the eaÅ¿t, they enjoy the fineÅ¿t climate, and never experience that difference of Å¿eaÅ¿on, which reigns on the weÅ¿tern Å¿ide, except by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the Menam. This noble river runs along a great way among mountains, where the rains concenter: it waÅ¿hes the walls of the capital, and annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally overflows, without the leaÅ¿t ravage, a delightful country, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all over with rich plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Å¿lime, which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam leaves behind, enriches the Å¿oil prodigiouÅ¿ly; the rice Å¿eems to grow up in proportion as the inundation riÅ¿es, and the river at length gently retires by degrees into its bed, as the rice approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to maturity, and has no further occaÅ¿ion for its waters. How bountiful has nature been to thoÅ¿e who inhabit this charming coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try!âÅ¿he has, however, done more: the fields produce, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion, an infinite variety of moÅ¿t delicate fruits, which require al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t no cultivation; Å¿uch as the pine apple, the mangouÅ¿tas, (the moÅ¿t delicate fruit perhaps in the world) mangoes of different kinds and all excellent, Å¿everal Å¿pecies of oranges, the banana, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, the gacca, with other fruits of inferior quality. Nature, Å¿till more bountiful, has alÅ¿o Å¿cattered over this country, almoÅ¿t on the Å¿urface of the ground, mines of gold, copper, and a Å¿pecies of fine tin, which there, as in other parts of India, they name <hi>Calin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this terreÅ¿trial paradiÅ¿e, Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Å¿o much riches, who would imagine that the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameÅ¿e are, perhaps, the moÅ¿t wretched people in the world?</p>
                     <p>The government of Siam is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿potic: the Å¿overeign alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys that liberty which is natural to all mankind: his Å¿ubjects are all his Å¿laves; every one of them is annually taxed at Å¿ix months perÅ¿onal Å¿ervice without wages, and even without food: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them the other Å¿ix months to procure themÅ¿elves wherewithal to exiÅ¿t the year. Under Å¿uch a government, there is no law that can afford protection to individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als againÅ¿t violence, or in the Å¿malleÅ¿t degree Å¿ecure them in their property. Every thing is Å¿ubjected to the caprice of a prince, rendered brutal by every Å¿pecies of exceÅ¿s, particularly that of power; who paÅ¿Å¿es his days locked up in his Å¿eraglio, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an idea of any thing beyond the walls of his palace, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ignorant of the wretched condition of his Å¿ubjects. TheÅ¿e are expoÅ¿ed to the avarice of the grandees, who themÅ¿elves are only

the chief Å¿laves, and tremblingly approach, on appointed days, the preÅ¿ence of their tyrant, whom they adore like a divinity, though Å¿ubject to the moÅ¿t dangerous caprices.</p>
                     <p>Religion alone has preÅ¿erved the power of protecting againÅ¿t tyranny thoÅ¿e who, ranging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves under its Å¿tandard, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the order of the prieÅ¿ts of <hi>Somonacondom,</hi> the deity of the SiameÅ¿e. ThoÅ¿e who embrace this order, and their number is conÅ¿iderable, are by law obliged to obÅ¿erve the Å¿tricteÅ¿t celibacy which, in a warm climate, Å¿uch as that of Siam, whilÅ¿t it occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons great diÅ¿orders, almoÅ¿t depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulates the country.</p>
                     <p>It may eaÅ¿ily be conceived, that under Å¿uch a government agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture cannot flouriÅ¿h; it may be Å¿aid, even, that no regard is paid to it at all, when the Å¿mall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ground which is laboured, is compared to the immenÅ¿e ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of lands which are totally neglected.</p>

                     <p>The SiameÅ¿e method of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating their rice, is firÅ¿t to Å¿ow it very thick in a Å¿mall Å¿quare plot of ground, well watered, a little below the Å¿urface of the earth. As Å¿oon as the plants have grown about five or Å¿ix inches high, they pull them up, by the roots, and tranÅ¿plant them in Å¿mall parcels of three or four Å¿talks, diÅ¿tant from each other about four inches every way. TheÅ¿e plants are placed deep in a clay Å¿oil, which has been previouÅ¿ly well laboured with a plow, dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They take an account of every mangouÅ¿ta, good or bad, making the proprietor guardian and Å¿ecurity for the whole; and, when the fruits ripen, Å¿hould there happen the Å¿malleÅ¿t defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, the poor proprietor is Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to all the inÅ¿olence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿trained power; it becomes, of conÅ¿equence, a real misfortune for a private man to be poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of Å¿uch a tree.</p>

The milk, and a very little labour, is all the advantages they draw from them. Their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the Å¿ame that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in IndoÅ¿tan, and which the Talapoins alone know any thing about, forbids them killing theÅ¿e animals. They elude, however, this law, by Å¿elling them to the Mahometans Å¿ettled among them, who kill them, and Å¿ell their fleÅ¿h privately. They have alÅ¿o great numbers of poultry, particularly ducks, of the beÅ¿t kinds in the Indies.</p>
                     <p>The king maintains a number of tame elephants.

                     <p>BEYOND the kingdom of Siam is the peninÅ¿ula of Malacca; a country formerly well peopled, and, conÅ¿equently, well cultivated. This nation was once one of the greateÅ¿t powers, and made a very conÅ¿iderable figure on the theatre of AÅ¿ia. The Å¿ea was covered with their Å¿hips, and they carried on a moÅ¿t extenÅ¿ive commerce. Their laws, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, were apparently very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from thoÅ¿e which Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them at preÅ¿ent.

                        </gap>, are the Å¿ame people; they Å¿peak almoÅ¿t the Å¿ame language, have the Å¿ame laws, the Å¿ame manners âIs it not Å¿omewhat Å¿ingular, that this nation, whoÅ¿e poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions are Å¿o extenÅ¿ive, Å¿hould Å¿carce be known in Europe?âI Å¿hall endeavour to give you an idea of thoÅ¿e laws, and thoÅ¿e manners; you will, from thence, eaÅ¿ily judge of their agriculture.</p>
                     <p>Travellers, who make obÅ¿erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations on the Malais, are aÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed to find, in the center of AÅ¿ia, under the Å¿corching climate of the line, the laws, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the cuÅ¿toms, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the ancient inhabitants of the north of Europe. The Malais are governed by feudal laws, that capricious Å¿yÅ¿tem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for the defence of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a few againÅ¿t the tyranny of one, whilÅ¿t the multitude is Å¿ubjected to Å¿lavery and oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion.</p>
                     <p>A chief, who has the title of king, or Å¿ultan, iÅ¿Å¿ues his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to his great vaÅ¿Å¿als, who obey when they think proper.â TheÅ¿e have inferior vaÅ¿Å¿als, who often act in the Å¿ame manner with regard to them. A Å¿mall part of the nation live indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, under the title of <hi>Oramcai,</hi> or <hi>noble,</hi> and Å¿ell their Å¿ervices to thoÅ¿e who pay them beÅ¿t; whilÅ¿t the body of the nation is compoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Å¿laves, and live in perpetual Å¿ervitude.</p>
                     <p>With theÅ¿e laws the Malais are reÅ¿tleÅ¿s, fond of navigation, war, plunder, emigrations, colonies, deÅ¿perate enterprizes, adventures, and gallantry. They talk inceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿antly of their honour, and their bravery, whilÅ¿t they are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ally conÅ¿idered, by thoÅ¿e with whom they have intercourÅ¿e, as the moÅ¿t treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015853_0032_0F9A2E8590D40F48"/>
and yet, which appeared to me extremely Å¿ingular, they Å¿peak the Å¿ofteÅ¿t language of AÅ¿ia â That which the Count de Forbin has Å¿aid, in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the MacaÅ¿Å¿ars, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly true, and is the reigning characteriÅ¿tic of the whole Malay nations. More attached to the abÅ¿urd laws of their pretended honour, than to thoÅ¿e of juÅ¿tice or humanity, you always obÅ¿erve, that amongÅ¿t them, the Å¿trong oppreÅ¿s and deÅ¿troy the weak: their treaties of peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip never Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting beyond that Å¿elf intereÅ¿t which induced them to make them, they are almoÅ¿t always armed, and either at war amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, or employed in pillaging their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>This ferocity, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais qualify under the name of courage, is Å¿o well known to the European companies, who have Å¿ettlements in the Indies, that they have univerÅ¿ally agreed in prohibiting the captains of their Å¿hips, who may put into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay iÅ¿lands, from taking on board any Å¿eamen of that nation, except in the greateÅ¿t diÅ¿treÅ¿s, and then, on no account, to exceed two or three.</p>
                     <p>It is nothing uncommon for a handful of theÅ¿e horrid Å¿avages Å¿uddenly to embark, attack a veÅ¿Å¿el by Å¿urprize, poignard in hand, maÅ¿Å¿acre the people, and make themÅ¿elves maÅ¿ters of her. Malay batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty men, have been known to board European Å¿hips of thirty or forty guns, in order to take poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of them, and murder, with their poignards, great part of the crew The Malay hiÅ¿tory is full of Å¿uch enterprizes which mark the deÅ¿perate ferocity of theÅ¿e barbarians.</p>
                     <p>The Malais, who are not Å¿laves, go always armed: they would think themÅ¿elves diÅ¿graced, if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <hi>Crit.</hi> The induÅ¿try of this nation even Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿es itÅ¿elf, in the fabrick of this deÅ¿tructive weapon.</p>
                     <p>As their lives are a perpetual round of agitation and tumult, they could never endure the long flowing habits, which prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other AÅ¿iatics. The habits of the Malais are exactly adapted to their Å¿hapes, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a number of buttons, which faÅ¿ten them cloÅ¿e to their bodies in every part.âI relate theÅ¿e Å¿eemingly trifling obÅ¿ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in order to prove, that, in climates the moÅ¿t oppoÅ¿ite, the Å¿ame laws produce Å¿imilar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, cuÅ¿toms and prejudices â Their effect is the Å¿ame too with reÅ¿pect to agriculture.</p>
                     <p>The lands poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by the Malais are, in general, of a Å¿upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior quality.

                     <p>The Malay iÅ¿lands produce va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds of dying woods, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>Sapan,</hi> which is the Å¿ame with the BraÅ¿il wood.

There are likewiÅ¿e mines of fine copper, mixed with gold, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants name <hi>Tombage.</hi> In the iÅ¿lands of Sumatra and Banea are mines of calin, or fine tin; and at Succadana, in the iÅ¿land of Borneo, is a mine of diamonds.

                     <p>The Å¿ea too teems with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of excellent fiÅ¿h, together with ambergris, pearls, and thoÅ¿e delicate birds neÅ¿ts (Å¿o much in requeÅ¿t in China) formed in the rocks with the Å¿pawn of fiÅ¿hes, and the foam of the Å¿ea, by a Å¿pecies of Å¿mall-Å¿ized Å¿wallow, peculiar to thoÅ¿e Å¿eas: this is of Å¿uch an exquiÅ¿ite Å¿ubÅ¿tance and flavour, that the ChineÅ¿e long purchaÅ¿ed them for their weight in gold, and Å¿till buy them at an exceÅ¿Å¿ive price.</p>

                     <p>THE Å¿agou tree, in part, Å¿upplies the defect of grain. This admirable tree is a preÅ¿ent which bountiful nature has made to men incapable of labour. It requires no culture; it is a Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the palm-tree, which grows naturally, in the woods, to the height of about twenty or thirty feet; its circumference being Å¿ometimes from five to Å¿ix. Its ligneous bark is about an inch in thickneÅ¿s, and covers a multitude of long fibres, which, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven one with another, enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope a maÅ¿s of a gummy kind of meal. As Å¿oon as this tree is ripe, a whitiÅ¿h duÅ¿t, which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pires through the pores of the leaves, and adheres to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, proclaims its maturity. The Malais then cut them down near the root, divide them into Å¿everal Å¿ections, which they Å¿plit into quarters: They then Å¿coop out the maÅ¿s of mealy Å¿ubÅ¿tance, which is enveloped by and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the fibres; they dilute it in pure water, and then paÅ¿s it through a Å¿training bag of fine
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015853_0034_0F9A2E870EE581D0"/>
cloth, in order to Å¿eparate it from the fibres. When this paÅ¿te has loÅ¿t part of its moiÅ¿ture by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, the Malais throw it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of earthen veÅ¿Å¿els, of different Å¿hapes, where they allow it to dry and harden. This paÅ¿te is wholeÅ¿ome nouriÅ¿hing food, and preÅ¿erves for many years.</p>
                     <p>The Indians, in general, when they eat the Å¿agou, uÅ¿e no other preparation than diluting it in water; but Å¿ometimes they dreÅ¿s it after different manners: they have the art of Å¿eparating the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t of the flower, and reducing it to little grains, Å¿omewhat reÅ¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling grains of rice. The Å¿agou, thus prepared, is preferred to the other, for the aged and infirm; and is an excellent remedy for many complaints in the Å¿tomach. When diluted, either in cold or boiling water, it forms a whitiÅ¿h jelly, very agreeable to the taÅ¿te.</p>
                     <p>Though this Å¿agou-bearing-palm grows naturally in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ts, the Malay chiefs have formed conÅ¿iderable plantations of it, which conÅ¿titute one of their principal reÅ¿ources for Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence.</p>
                     <p>They might have the fineÅ¿t or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards in the world, would they give themÅ¿elves the trouble to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the various plants of thoÅ¿e ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fruits which nature has Å¿o liberally beÅ¿towed upon them: we find, however, none but a few Å¿traggling trees planted at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom around their houÅ¿es, or diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perÅ¿ed over their lands without Å¿ymmetry or order.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of the great iÅ¿land of Java have Å¿omewhat better ideas of agriculture, than the other Malais, Å¿ince their Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the government of the Dutch. TheÅ¿e Å¿overeign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have taken advantage of the feudal Å¿yÅ¿tem of the Malais, to reduce them under their yoke; artfully weakening the regal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by fomenting, at times, the rebellions of the great vaÅ¿Å¿als; and humbling the vaÅ¿Å¿als in their turn, by Å¿uccouring their princes, when drove to the brink of ruin.</p>
                     <p>The JavaneÅ¿e begin to recover from that Å¿tate of anarchy, the conÅ¿equence of their ancient laws now almoÅ¿t no longer remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They cultivate, with Å¿ucceÅ¿s, rice, coffee, indigo, and Å¿ugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane. They rear, on the eaÅ¿tern coaÅ¿t of the iÅ¿land, and in the diÅ¿tricts of Madur and Solor, in the neighbourhood, numerous herds of buffaloes, of a monÅ¿trous Å¿ize; their fleÅ¿h is excellent, and they are of infinite uÅ¿e in labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground. They have likewiÅ¿e numbers of horned cattle, the largeÅ¿t and fineÅ¿t, perhaps, in the world<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> The common paÅ¿tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in this, and the reÅ¿t of the Malay iÅ¿lands, is the Å¿ame graÅ¿s I have mentioned under the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the iÅ¿le of France, which the coloniÅ¿ts there almoÅ¿t entirely neglect.</p>
                     <p>Here it would be proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe the manner of cultivating the Å¿piceries, the indigo, the Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-cane, and the camphre; but theÅ¿e muÅ¿t be the Å¿ubject of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diÅ¿courÅ¿e.

                     <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                     <p>I LaÅ¿t year began to give you a Å¿ketch of my inquiries into the Å¿tate of agriculture among differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nations of Africa and AÅ¿ia. I obÅ¿erved, that Å¿carce a veÅ¿tige of it could be traced amongÅ¿t the Å¿tupid, the indolent negroes, who inhabit the weÅ¿tern coaÅ¿t of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; whilÅ¿t it flouriÅ¿hed, under the Å¿hade of liberty, amongÅ¿t the Holanders at the Cape of Good Hope. I pointed out the happy abundance which reigned in the fertile iÅ¿land of MadagaÅ¿car, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by a people governed by the greateÅ¿t Å¿implicity of manners, and unacquainted with other laws than thoÅ¿e of nature. WhilÅ¿t I did juÅ¿tice alÅ¿o to the Å¿yÅ¿tem of cultivation that prevailed at the iÅ¿le of Bourbon, which, having no port, and of conÅ¿equence little or no intercourÅ¿e with Europe, the coloniÅ¿ts have preÅ¿erved an uncorrupted Å¿yÅ¿tem of manners, ever favourable for agriculture, I was at the Å¿ame time, under the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of acknowledging, that this art, which requires perÅ¿ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Å¿implicity, was greatly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015853_0036_0F9A2FB24F4CDEC0"/>
neglected at the iÅ¿le of France, which, having two excellent ports, and being much frequented by European Å¿hips, was more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the inconÅ¿tant and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile manners of our quarter of the world; and that, in conÅ¿equence, though the Å¿oil, in point of ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, was equal to MadagaÅ¿car and Bourbon; their harveÅ¿t ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally failed, and an almoÅ¿t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Å¿carcity prevailed over the iÅ¿land.âI paÅ¿Å¿ed from thence to the great peninÅ¿ula of the Indies, where agriculture, however op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed by the barbarous laws of the Mogul conquerors, is Å¿till honoured and Å¿upported by the religion, the manners, and the perÅ¿everance of the conquered Malabars.âAt Siam, under the happieÅ¿t climate, and bleÅ¿Å¿ed with a Å¿oil inferior in fertility to no country in the world, agriculture we have obÅ¿erved debaÅ¿ed by the indignities of tyranny, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by a race of Å¿laves, whom nothing can intereÅ¿t, after the loÅ¿s of liberty.âI have repreÅ¿ented it almoÅ¿t in the Å¿ame condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the Malais, who inhabit immenÅ¿e dominions, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable iÅ¿lands, where nature has diÅ¿tributed her choiceÅ¿t trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures, and laviÅ¿hed her bounties with a profuÅ¿ion unknown to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regions. The deÅ¿tructive genius of the feudal laws, which keep this people in a perpetual ferment, permits not their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the culture of the fineÅ¿t Å¿oil in the world. Nature alone does all. I am convinced, that if the other nations of the earth, who have the miÅ¿fortune to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the feudal Å¿yÅ¿tem, inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a climate equally happy, and lands equally fertile with thoÅ¿e of the Malais, their agriculture would be equally neglected: neceÅ¿Å¿ity alone could force the plough into their hands.</p>
                     <p>In my laÅ¿t diÅ¿courÅ¿e I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to give you an idea of the moÅ¿t intereÅ¿ting modes of local a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture which came under my obÅ¿ervation: my principal object, however, was to enable you to remark, that in every country, in every quarter of the world, the Å¿tate of agriculture depends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed laws, and, conÅ¿equently, on the manners, cuÅ¿toms, and prejudices from which theÅ¿e laws derived their origin. I now proceed.</p>

                     <p>DEPARTING from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninÅ¿ula of Malacca, and the iÅ¿lands of the Malais, towards the north, I fell in with a Å¿mall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory called <hi>Cancar,</hi> but known, on the marine charts, under the name of <hi>Ponthiamas.</hi> Surrounded by the kingdom of Siam, where deÅ¿potiÅ¿m and depopulation go hand in hand; the dominions of Camboya, where no idea of eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed government Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts; and the territories of the Malais, whoÅ¿e genius, perpetually agitated by their feudal laws, can endure peace neither at home nor abroad: This charming country, about fifty years ago, was uncultivated,

and almoÅ¿t deÅ¿titute of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
                     <p>A chineÅ¿e merchant, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a veÅ¿Å¿el which he employed in commerce, frequented theÅ¿e coaÅ¿ts. Being a man of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent reflective genius, which Å¿o characteriÅ¿tically marks his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he could not, without pain, behold immenÅ¿e tracts of ground condemned to Å¿terility, though naturally more fertile than thoÅ¿e which formed the riches of his own country: he formed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a plan for their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With this view, having firÅ¿t of all hired a number of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, Å¿ome ChineÅ¿e, others from the neigbouring nations, he, with great addreÅ¿s, inÅ¿inuated himÅ¿elf into the favour of the moÅ¿t powerful princes, who, for a certain Å¿ubÅ¿idy, aÅ¿Å¿igned him a guard for his protection.</p>
                     <p>In the courÅ¿e of his voyage to Batavia, and the Philippine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿lands, he borrowed from the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans their improvements, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the art of fortification and defence; with regard to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal police, he gave the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ChineÅ¿e. The profits of his commerce Å¿oon enabled him to raiÅ¿e ramparts, Å¿ink ditches, and provide artillery. TheÅ¿e pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary precautions Å¿ecured him from a coup de main, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him from the enterprizes of the Å¿urrounding nations of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</p>
                     <p>He diÅ¿tributed the lands to his labourers, without the leaÅ¿t reÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any of thoÅ¿e duties or taxes known by the names of Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or fines of alienation; duties, which by allowing no real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, become the moÅ¿t fatal Å¿courge to agriculture, and is an idea which revolts againÅ¿t the common Å¿enÅ¿e of every wiÅ¿e na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He provided his coloniÅ¿ts, at the Å¿ame time, with all Å¿orts of inÅ¿truments proper for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and improvement of their grounds.</p>
                     <p>In forming a labouring and commercial people, he thought, that no laws ought to be framed, but thoÅ¿e which nature has eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed for the human race in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very climate: he made theÅ¿e laws reÅ¿pected by obeying them firÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, and exhibiting an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Å¿implicity, induÅ¿try, fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, humanity, and good faith: âhe formed, then, no Å¿yÅ¿tem of lawsâhe did moreâhe eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed morals.</p>
                     <p>His territories Å¿oon became the country of every induÅ¿trious man, who wiÅ¿hed to Å¿ettle there. The woods were cleared; the grounds judiciouÅ¿ly labo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <head>COCHIN-CHINA.</head>
                     <p>THE Cochin-chineÅ¿e, who border on Camboya to the north, obÅ¿erving the lands of this kingdom deÅ¿olate and abandoned, Å¿ome years ago took poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿uch tracts as were moÅ¿t conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and have there introduced an excellent culture. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Donnay, uÅ¿urped in this manner from Camboya, is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent the granary of Cochin-china. This kingdom, one of the greateÅ¿t in EaÅ¿tern AÅ¿ia, about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years ago, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by an inconÅ¿iderable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, barbarous and Å¿avage, known by the name of <hi>Loi,</hi> who, living partly by fiÅ¿hing, partly on roots, and the wild fruits of the country, paid little regard to agriculture.</p>
                     <p>A TonquineÅ¿e prince, unÅ¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿sful in a war he carried on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the king of Tonquin, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom he enjoyed an office Å¿omewhat reÅ¿embling the maires de palais, under the Merovingian race of the kings of France) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with his Å¿oldiers and adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents acroÅ¿s the river which divides that kingdom from Cochin-china. The Å¿avages, who then poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed this country, fled before theÅ¿e Å¿trangers, and took refuge among the mountains of TÅ¿iampa. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long war with their old ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who purÅ¿ued them, the TonquineÅ¿e fugitives remained at length peaceable poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors of the country known under the name of Cochin-china: it extends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred leagues from north to Å¿outh, but narrow and unequal from eaÅ¿t to weÅ¿t. TheÅ¿e then applied themÅ¿elves entirely to the cultivation of rice, which, being the ordinary food of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of AÅ¿ia, is to them an object of the greateÅ¿t importance. They Å¿eparated into little canton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed themÅ¿elves on the plains, which extend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the banks of the rivers.</p>
                     <p>The fertility of the Å¿oil, which had lain long uncultivated, Å¿oon recompenÅ¿ed their labours by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance: population increaÅ¿ed in proportion to the culture; and their cantons extended in Å¿uch a manner, that all the plains of this vaÅ¿t country being put into a Å¿tate of improvement, they were temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make encroachments on thoÅ¿e of Camboya, which were in a manner totally abandoned. I never Å¿aw any country where the progreÅ¿s of population was Å¿o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable as in Cochin-china, which muÅ¿t be attributed not only to the climate, and the fertility of the Å¿oil, but to the Å¿implicity

of their manners, to the prudence and induÅ¿try of the women as well as the men, and to the variety of excellent fiÅ¿h, which, with rice, is their ordinary food.</p>

                        <hi>CULTURE</hi> of different Kinds of <hi>RICE</hi> in <hi>COCHIN-CHINA.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Cochin-chineÅ¿e culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Å¿ix different kinds of rice: the <hi>Little Rice,</hi> the grain of which is Å¿mall, oblong and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿parent; that is by far the moÅ¿t delicate; it is generally admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿tered to the Å¿ick: The <hi>Great Long Rice</hi> is that whoÅ¿e form is round: The <hi>Red Rice,</hi> Å¿o called becauÅ¿e the grain is enveloped in a huÅ¿k of a reddiÅ¿h colour, which adheres Å¿o cloÅ¿ely, that it requires a very uncommon operation to Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it. TheÅ¿e three kinds are produced in the greateÅ¿t abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and form the principal Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence of the natives. They require water, it being neceÅ¿Å¿ary to overflow the grounds where they are cultivated.</p>
                     <p>They raiÅ¿e alÅ¿o two other Å¿orts of dry rice, which grow in dry foil, and, like our wheat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no other watering but what they receive from the clouds.â One of theÅ¿e Å¿pecies of rice has a grain as white as Å¿now; when dreÅ¿Å¿ed it is of a Å¿limy viÅ¿cous Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance; they make of it different kinds of paÅ¿te, Å¿uch as vermicelli. Both theÅ¿e kinds form a conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able article in their commerce to China. They cultivate them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the mountains and riÅ¿ing grounds, which they labour with the Å¿pade. They Å¿ow theÅ¿e grains as we do wheat, about the end of December or beginning of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, when the rainy Å¿eaÅ¿on ends: they are not above three months in the ground, and yield a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful crop.</p>
                     <p>I am induced to believe, that the culture of this valuable grain would Å¿ucceed extremely well in France. In the years 1749 and 1750 I often travelled over the mountains of Cochin-china, where this rice is cultivated; they are very high, and the temperature of the air cold: in the month of January, 1750, I obÅ¿erved that the rice was very green, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three inches high, although the liquor in Reaumur's thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter was only about four degrees above the freezing point.</p>
                     <p>I carried Å¿ome quintals of this grain to the iÅ¿le of France, where it was Å¿own with Å¿ucceÅ¿s, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a greater crop than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿pecies. The coloniÅ¿ts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my preÅ¿ent with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t eagerneÅ¿s, as, excluÅ¿ive of its Å¿uperior increaÅ¿e, it has a finer taÅ¿te, is attended with leÅ¿s trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there being no neceÅ¿Å¿ity for overflowing the fields; and, as it ripens fifteen or twenty days Å¿ooner than the other kinds, it can be reaped and Å¿ecured before the hurricane Å¿eaÅ¿on, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently makes dreadful havock with their later harv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>Å¿ts. The other kinds of rice, being of a Å¿lower growth, require their grounds to be laid under water, after the manner of the Coroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del

                        </note> but our coloniÅ¿ts pay Å¿o little attention to agriculture, that they have never hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it.</p>
                     <p>One might have imagined, that the advantages flowing from the cultivation of dry rice, would have engaged the coloniÅ¿ts to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it with the greateÅ¿t care; and that, from the iÅ¿le of France, it might have been with eaÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Europe: but I have in vain endeavoured to produce it from this iÅ¿land; thoÅ¿e to whom I have applied, have Å¿ent me only common rice, which demands water and warmth. The culture of dry rice has, like every other Å¿pecies of agriculture, been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned to the unexperienced ignorance of Å¿laves, who have mixed all the different kinds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in Å¿uch a manner, that the rice of Cochin-china being ripe long before the others, the grains have dropt from the ears before they were reaped, and the Å¿pecies, in this manner, has been, by degrees entirely loÅ¿t in that iÅ¿land. Would any traveller, whom buÅ¿ineÅ¿s or curioÅ¿ity might lead to Cochin-china, Å¿end over but a few pounds of this excellent grain, he would deÅ¿erve our warmeÅ¿t acknowledgements.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin chineÅ¿e cultivate the common rice nearly in the Å¿ame manner with the Malabars on the Coromandel coaÅ¿t. After having twice ploughed their ground, they Å¿ow the rice in a little field which has been well laboured with the Å¿pade; the Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of this little field they juÅ¿t cover with water, to the height only of a few lines; and as Å¿oon as the rice is about five or Å¿ix inches high, they harrow over their large fields, and overflow them with water; then pulling up the rice plants in the Å¿eed plots, tranÅ¿plant them into theÅ¿e grounds thus prepared, in Å¿mall parcels of four or five Å¿talks, about the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Å¿ix inches the one from the other. Women and children are generally employed in this work.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineÅ¿e have no machine for overflowing their grounds, nor have they any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion: their plains, from one end of the kingdom to the other, are commanded by a chain of high mountains, plentifully Å¿upplied with Å¿prings and rivulets, which naturally overflow the grounds, according as their courÅ¿e is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                     <p>They cultivate likewiÅ¿e differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds of grain, Å¿uch as the mahis, millets of different Å¿orts, Å¿everal Å¿pecies of the French bean, potatoes, yams, and a variety of roots proper for the Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence of men and animals. But the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of moÅ¿t important advantage to them, next to the rice, is the Å¿ugar cane; and no country in AÅ¿ia produces it in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance than Cochin-china.</p>

                     <head>SUGAR-CANES.</head>
                     <p>THE Å¿ugar-canes of this country are of two kinds; the firÅ¿t grows thick and tall, the joints at a conÅ¿iderable diÅ¿tance from one another, the colour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways green, the juice abundant, with very little of the Å¿alt in it. This Å¿pecies of cane is in general uÅ¿e for feeding and fattening of cattle; and experience teaches them, that no kind of food fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens Å¿ooner or better the human Å¿pecies, as well as animals, than this Å¿ugar cane, eat while green, and the Å¿ugar which is extracted from it.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd Å¿pecies is Å¿maller in every reÅ¿pect, with its joints approaching nearer together:â when ripe it aÅ¿Å¿umes a yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and contains leÅ¿s water, and more Å¿alt, than the other.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineÅ¿e, when preparing the ground for the Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-cane, turn it up to the depth of two feet; this operation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a plank. They then plant joints or eyes of the cane, three and three together, in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal poÅ¿ition, in the Å¿ame manner almoÅ¿t as they plant vines in Å¿everal provinces of Franceâ TheÅ¿e Å¿lips are planted ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e about eighteen inches deep in the ground, diÅ¿tant Å¿ix feet from one another; this operation they perform near the end of the rainy Å¿eaÅ¿on, in order that the Å¿lips may be Å¿ufficiently watered, till Å¿uch time as they have taken root. During the firÅ¿t Å¿ix months, they give them two dreÅ¿Å¿ings with a kind of pick-axe, in order to deÅ¿troy the weeds, and preÅ¿erve a moiÅ¿ture about the roots of the canes, by heaping the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them.</p>
                     <p>Twelve and Å¿ometimes fourteen months after the plantation, they gather the firÅ¿t crop. By this time the canes, though planted at the diÅ¿tance of Å¿ix feet, become Å¿o buÅ¿hy that it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to enter the field, without the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a hatchet to clear your way.</p>
                     <p>The canes being cut, and tied up into bundles, are carried to their mills, in order to extract their juice. I Å¿hall not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe the form of theÅ¿e machines, which reÅ¿emble in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure thoÅ¿e of the WeÅ¿t-Indies:â inÅ¿tead of water, they employ horned cattle or mules to Å¿et in motion the two cylinders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which the Å¿ugar canes are preÅ¿Å¿ed. TheÅ¿e engines have been deÅ¿cribed by numbers of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
                     <p>The juice being extracted, they boil it Å¿ome hours in large kettles, in order to evaporate part of its water: it is then tranÅ¿ported to the neighbouring market, and Å¿old in that condition. Here ends the induÅ¿try and the profits of the Cochin chineÅ¿e planter.â The merchants purchaÅ¿e the juice, which reÅ¿embles pure water; they boil it again, throwing into the kettles Å¿ome alkaline Å¿ubÅ¿tance, Å¿uch as the aÅ¿hes of the leaves of the muÅ¿a or bananier, and Å¿hell-lime; they are acquainted with no other; theÅ¿e ingredients throw up a thick Å¿cum, which the refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er carefully Å¿kims off; the action of the alkali haÅ¿tens the Å¿eparation of the Å¿alt from the water, and,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015853_0043_0F9A2FB78FBDD4B8"/>
by the force of ebullition, reduces the juice of the cane to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tence of Å¿yrup. As Å¿oon as this Å¿yrup begins to granulate, they decant it into a great earthen veÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿el, where they cool it about an hour; when a kind of cruÅ¿t, Å¿till Å¿oft, and of a yellowiÅ¿h colour, appeals on the Å¿urface of the Å¿y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup; they loÅ¿e not a moment then to empty it into a veÅ¿Å¿el of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Å¿hape, which they call a <hi>form.</hi> Without this intermediate opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cooling the Å¿yrup, it would harden into a maÅ¿s, and not being granulated, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently want one eÅ¿Å¿ential qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Å¿ugar.</p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e Å¿ugar-cones, or forms in Cochin-china are, like thoÅ¿e of our WeÅ¿t-India colonies, of baked earth, about three feet high, pierced at their narrow extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and contain in general about forty or fifty pounds of Å¿ugar.â TheÅ¿e <hi>forms,</hi> when full, are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on another earthen veÅ¿Å¿el, the mouth of which is proportioned to receive the narrow end of the cone, and muÅ¿t be large enough to contain the coarÅ¿e Å¿yrup, which diÅ¿tils from the Å¿ugar, through Å¿ome Å¿traw which imperfectly Å¿tops up the little opening in the bottom of the <hi>form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they Å¿uppoÅ¿e the Å¿yrup has acquired the conÅ¿iÅ¿tence of Å¿alt in every part of the cone, they then proceed to whiten and purify it. They dilute, in a trough, a fine Å¿ort of whitiÅ¿h clay, with Å¿uch a quantity of water as, when thus prepared, prevents it from having too much conÅ¿iÅ¿tence; with a truel they then lay it upon the Å¿urface of the Å¿ugar to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of about two inches, in the void Å¿pace left at the top of the form by the condenÅ¿ing of the Å¿ugar, after purging itÅ¿elf of the coarÅ¿er Å¿yrup or melaÅ¿Å¿es. The water contained in the clay pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating by degrees into the maÅ¿s, waÅ¿hes it, and carries off inÅ¿enÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the remaining Å¿yrup, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very foreign particle that adheres moÅ¿t cloÅ¿ely to the Å¿ugar. When the clay hardens, they replace it with a freÅ¿h quantity, diluted as the firÅ¿t: This operation, which laÅ¿ts about twelve or fifteen days, is the Å¿ame here as in our WeÅ¿t-India colonies. Some refiners of Cochin-china, however, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother method. In place of clay, tempered thus with water, they cut into Å¿mall pieces the trunk of the muÅ¿a or bananier, which they place upon the Å¿ugar: The trunk of this tree is very watery; the water of a detergent quality; and diÅ¿tils from the fibres, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velope it, in very Å¿mall drops.â ThoÅ¿e who follow this method pretend, that the operation is thereby rendered leÅ¿s tedious, and that the Å¿ugar acquires a finer colour.</p>
                     <p>The proceÅ¿s of the Cochin-chineÅ¿e, in refining their Å¿ugar, goes no further: They are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Å¿toves in uÅ¿e in the WeÅ¿t-Indies. After having clayed their Å¿ugars Å¿ufficiently, they Å¿ell them in the public mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, particularly to the ChineÅ¿e, and other Å¿trangers, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to their ports by the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate price of this commodity, which is cheaper at Cochin-china than any where in India.</p>
                     <p>The white Å¿ugar of the beÅ¿t quality is generally Å¿old at the port of FaiÅ¿o, in exchange for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther merchandize, at the rate of three piaÅ¿tres (about fourteen Å¿hillings) the Cochin-china quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which weighs from one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015853_0044_0F9A2FB8513D8B30"/>
and fifty to two hundred pounds French.<note n="â " place="margin">Ninety one pounds eight ounces French make one hundred pounds EngliÅ¿h.</note> The trade in this commodity is immenÅ¿e.â The ChineÅ¿e alone, whoÅ¿e lands do not produce enough for their own conÅ¿umpt, purchaÅ¿e annually from Cochin-china about forty thouÅ¿and barrels, weighing about two thouÅ¿and pounds per barrel.</p>
                     <p>This country, it Å¿hould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved, which produces this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity in Å¿uch abundance, and at Å¿o low a price, being a new king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ought to be conÅ¿idered, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, as a colony: it is worthy obÅ¿ervation too, that the Å¿ugar-cane is there cultivated by free men, and all the proceÅ¿s of preparation and refining, the work of free hands. Compare then the price of the Cochin-chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿e production with the Å¿ame commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretched Å¿laves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure Å¿ugar from our colonies, it was neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to authorize by law the Å¿lavery of the unhappy Africans tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to America. From what I have obÅ¿erved at Cochin-china, I cannot entertain a doubt, but that our WeÅ¿t-India colonies, had they been diÅ¿tributed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation amongÅ¿t a free people, would have produced double the quantity that is now procured from the labour of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate negroes.</p>
                     <p>What advantage, then, has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to Europe, civilized as it is, and thoroughly verÅ¿ed in the laws of nature, and the rights of mankind, by legally authoriÅ¿ing in our colonies the daily outrages againÅ¿t human nature, permitting them to debaÅ¿e man almoÅ¿t below the level of the beaÅ¿ts of the field? TheÅ¿e Å¿laviÅ¿h laws have proved as oppoÅ¿ite to its intereÅ¿t as they are to its honour, and to the laws of humanity. This remark I have often made.</p>
                     <p>Liberty and property form the baÅ¿is of abundance, and good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture: I never obÅ¿erved it to flouriÅ¿h where thoÅ¿e rights of mankind were not firmly eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed. The earth, which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies her productions with a kind of profuÅ¿ion, under the hands of the free-born labourer, Å¿eems to Å¿hrink into barrenneÅ¿s under the Å¿weat of the Å¿lave. Such is the will of the great author of our nature, who has created man free, and aÅ¿Å¿igned to him the earth, that he might cultivate his poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion with the Å¿weat of his brow; but Å¿till Å¿hould enjoy his liberty.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineÅ¿e, excluÅ¿ive of the Å¿ugar-cane, employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves in the culture of a variety of other productions, of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance both to their interior fabrics, and external commerce.</p>
                     <p>They cultivate the cotton-tree, the mulberry, the pepper, the varniÅ¿h-tree, the date, the tea, the indigo, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They have Å¿everal Å¿orts likewiÅ¿e of admirable wood for joyner and cabinet work, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the roÅ¿e wood; the tea-wood is excellent for building, and is preferred to all others in the conÅ¿truction of the royal gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, having every pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains alÅ¿o, and from the foreÅ¿ts with which they are covered, they procure ivory, muÅ¿k, wax, iron, and gold in great abundance â TheÅ¿e mountains too are full of game, Å¿uch as deer, antelopes, wild goats, peacocks pheaÅ¿ants, &amp;c. The chace is free to all, but dangerous from the number of tygers, elephants, rhinoceros, and other carnivorous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructive animals, with which the foreÅ¿ts abound.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿ea, which waÅ¿hes their coaÅ¿ts, as well as the rivers, are well Å¿upplied with excellent fiÅ¿h. Every one has the liberty of fiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in this the Cochin-chineÅ¿e take great delight. I have already obÅ¿erved, that they live chiefly on fiÅ¿h and rice.</p>
                     <p>Their domeÅ¿tic animals are, the horÅ¿e for the road, the buffalo for labour, and the cow, the hog, the goat, the gooÅ¿e, the duck, and hens of various kinds, for the table. TheÅ¿e animals thrive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well, and are in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. The king alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erves to himÅ¿elf the excluÅ¿ive right of breeding elephants for the war; and this is a reÅ¿ervation which no man envies him. He maintains generally four hundred of them: he could maintain four thouÅ¿and men at a much leÅ¿s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. The Cochin-chineÅ¿e have few good fruits; the pine apple, and oranges of different kinds, are the beÅ¿t their country produces. They do not cultivate the vine, though it is one of the native pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of their lands. They are but indifferently provided with pulÅ¿e. In a word, their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards and their gardens are very inconÅ¿iderable.âThey attach themÅ¿elves to the more eÅ¿Å¿ential branches of agriculture.</p>
                     <p>Although this art is not yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at that degree of perfection in Cochin-China, to which it might be carried, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Å¿uch an excellent Å¿oil, yet the manners of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very favourable, it flouriÅ¿hes greatly.

                     <head>Ceremony of opening the Grounds.</head>
                     <p>ON the fifteenth day of the firÅ¿t moon, in every year, which generally correÅ¿ponds to the beginning of March, the emperor in perÅ¿on performs the ceremony of opening the grounds. This prince, in great pomp, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the field appointed for the ceremony: the princes of the imperial family, the preÅ¿idents of the five great tribunals, and an infinite number of mandarins ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him. Two Å¿ides of the field are occupied by the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's officers, and guards; the third is allotted for all the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the province, who repair thither to behold their art ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and practiÅ¿ed by the head of their empire; the fourth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved for the mandarins.</p>
                     <p>The emperor enters the field alone, proÅ¿trates himÅ¿elf, and nine times Å¿trikes his head againÅ¿t the ground, in adoration of <hi>Tien,</hi> the God of heaven; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, with a loud voice, a prayer appointed by the tribunal of rites, invoking the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of the almighty Å¿overeign on his labour, and on the labour of his people, who form his family; he then, in quality of Å¿overeign pontiff of the empire, Å¿acrifices a bullock, which he offers up to heaven, as the Å¿ource of every bleÅ¿Å¿ing: whilÅ¿t they cut the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim in pieces, and place them on the altar, they bring to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror a plough, in which are yoked a pair of bullocks, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently adorned. The empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror then, laying aÅ¿ide his royal robes, takes hold of the handle of the plough, and turns up Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral furrows the whole length of the field; then, with a complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant air, having delivered the plough to the mandarins, they Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively follow his example, emulating one another in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this honourable labour with the greateÅ¿t dexterity. The ceremony concludes with the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of money, and pieces of Å¿tuff, among the labourers there preÅ¿ent; the moÅ¿t active of whom finiÅ¿h the remaining labour, in preÅ¿ence of the emperor, with great agility and addreÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>Some time after, when they have Å¿ufficiently laboured and manured their grounds, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror repairs again, in proceÅ¿Å¿ion, and begins the Å¿owing of the field, always accompanied with ceremony, and attended by the labourers of the province.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿ame ceremonies are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, on the Å¿ame days, in all the provinces of the empire, by the viceroys, aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted by all the magiÅ¿trates of their departments, in preÅ¿ence of a great number of the labourers of their reÅ¿pective provinces. I have Å¿een this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the grounds at Canton, and never remember to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held any of the ceremonies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by men, with half the pleaÅ¿ure and Å¿atisfaction with which I obÅ¿erved this.</p>

In Europe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it at preÅ¿ent flouriÅ¿hing, in a country which, during many preceding ages, was reduced to the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of begging Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence amongÅ¿t the neighbouring nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed a happier cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and a greater extent of territory. During thoÅ¿e ages of barbariÅ¿m, their loÅ¿s of liberty and right of property brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them the ruin of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; nor has Å¿he recovered thoÅ¿e natural rights of mankind, and re-eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed the foundations of drooping agriculture, but through Å¿eas of blood, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages Å¿hocking to humanity.</p>

                     <p>SOUTH-AMERICA, covered with marÅ¿hes, brambles, and woods, beholds her extenÅ¿ive tracks hardened even by the Å¿weat of her labourers in chains. The northern regions of that quarter of the world, before the arrival of the Europeans, was inhabited by inconÅ¿iderable tribes of Å¿avages, miÅ¿erable, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out culture; yet free, and, in conÅ¿equence, leÅ¿s wretched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps than thoÅ¿e nations who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be civilized; but who, being farther removed from the laws of nature, by the privation of thoÅ¿e rights which Å¿he beÅ¿tow, make ineffectual efforts to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that happineÅ¿s, which a good agriculture alone can produce.â Since the Europeans arrived, and began in earneÅ¿t to cultivate the lands, they have, by their great diligence in agriculture, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improved the climate as well as the Å¿oil; by continuing their attachment to agriculture, North-America will probably, in a few years, extend her commerce over the greateÅ¿t part of the globe.</p>
