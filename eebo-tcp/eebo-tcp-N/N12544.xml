            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>MY OWN LIFE.</head>
                  <p>IT is difficult for a man to ſpeak long of himſelf without vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore, I ſhall be ſhort. It may be thought an inſtance of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that I pretend at all to write my life; but this Narrative ſhall contain little more than the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of my Writings; as, indeed, almoſt all my life has been ſpent in literary purſuits and occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The firſt ſucceſs of moſt of my writings was not ſuch as to be an object of vanity.</p>
                  <p>I was born the 26th of April 1711, old ſtyle, at Edinburgh. I was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is a branch of the Earl of Home's, or Hume's; and my anceſtors had been proprietors of the eſtate, which my brother poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes, for ſeveral generations. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, Preſident of the College of Juſtice: the title of Lord Halkerton came by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to her brother.</p>
                  <p>My family, however, was not rich, and being myſelf a younger brother, my patrimony, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mode of my country, was of courſe very ſlender. My father, who paſſed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me, with an elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a ſiſter, under the care of our mother, a woman of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular merit, who, though young and handſome, devoted herſelf entirely to the rearing and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of her children. I paſſed through the ordinary courſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation with ſucceſs, and was ſeized very early with a paſſion for literature, which has been the ruling paſſion of my life, and the great ſource of my enjoyments. My ſtudious diſpoſition, my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and my induſtry, gave my family a notion that the law
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015853_0003_0F9A2E6F10094D08"/>
was a proper profeſſion for me; but I found an unſurmountable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to every thing but the purſuits of philoſophy and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral learning; and while they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was ſecretly devouring.</p>
                  <p>My very ſlender fortune, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being unſuitable to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, I was tempted, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forced, to make a very fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trial for entering into a more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I went over to France, with a view of proſecuting my ſtudies in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan of life, which I have ſteadily and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully purſued. I reſolved to make a very rigid frugality ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and to regard every object as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in literature.</p>
                  <p>During my retreat in France, firſt at Reims, but chiefly at La Fleche, in Anjou I compoſed my <hi>Treatiſe of Human Nature.</hi> After paſſing three years very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably in that country, I came over to Lond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I continued with my mother and brother in the country, and in that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth.</p>
                  <p>In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with him in England; I found alſo, that the friends and family of that young nobleman were deſirous of putting him under my care and direction, for the ſtate of his mind and health required it.—I lived with him a twelve-month. My appointments during that time made a conſiderable acceſſion to my ſmall fortune. I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an invitation from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral St. Clair to attend him as a ſecretary to his expedition, which was at firſt meant againſt Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, but ended in an incurſion on the coaſt of France.

                  <p>I had always entertained a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that my want of ſucceſs in publiſhing the Treatiſe of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very uſual indiſcretion, in going to the preſs too early. I, therefore, caſt the firſt part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human Underſtanding, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed while I was at Turin.

                  <p>In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true ſcene for a man of letters. In 1752, were publiſhed at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, where I then lived, my Political Diſcourſes, the only work of mine that was ſucceſsful on the firſt publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the ſame year was publiſhed at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that ſubject), is of all my writings, hiſtorical, philoſophical, or literary, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the beſt. It came unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed and unobſerved into the world.</p>

I then formed the plan of writing the Hiſtory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Houſe of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, ſanguine in my expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſucceſs of this work. I thought that I was the only hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, that had at once neglected preſent power, intereſt, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the cry of popular prejudices; and as the ſubject was ſuited to every capacity, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>xpected proportional applauſe. But miſerable was my diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I was aſſailed by one cry of reproach, diſapprobation, and even deteſtation; Engliſh, Scotch, and Iriſh, Whig and Tory, churchman and ſectary, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinker and religioniſt, patriot and courtier, united in their rage againſt the man, who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to ſhed a generous tear for the fate of Carles. I. and the Earl of Strafford; and after the firſt ebullitions of their fury were over, what was ſtill more morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, the book ſeemed to ſink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he ſold only forty-five copies of it. I ſcarc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly, indeed, heard of one man in the three kingdoms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for rank or letters, that could endure the book. I muſt only except the primate of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Herring, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which ſeem two odd exceptions. Theſe dignified prelates ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent me meſſages not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
                  <p>I was, however, I confeſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial town of the former king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have changed my name, and never more have returned to my native country. But as this ſcheme was not now practicable, and the ſubſequent volume was conſiderably advanced, I reſolved to pick up courage and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</p>
                  <p>In this interval, I publiſhed at London my Natural Hiſtory of Religion, along with ſome other ſmall pieces: its public entry was rather obſcure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, which diſtinguiſh the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burtonian ſchool. This pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet gave ſome conſolation for the otherwiſe indifferent recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my performance.</p>
                  <p>In 1756, two years after the fall of the firſt volume, was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the ſecond volume of my Hiſtory, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revolution. This perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance happened to give leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only roſe itſelf, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.</p>
                  <p>But though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in poſſeſſion of bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all places, both in the ſtate and in literature, I was ſo little inclined to yield to their ſenſeleſs clamour, that in above a hundred
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015853_0006_0F9A2E7150A44CB8"/>
alterations, which farther ſtudy, reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two firſt Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory ſide. It is ridiculous to conſider the Engliſh conſtitution before that period as a regular plan of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>In 1759, I publiſhed my Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Houſe of Tudor. The clamour againſt this performance was almoſt equal to that againſt the Hiſtory of the two firſt Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of public folly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued very peaceably and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly in my retreat at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, to finiſh, in two volumes, the more early part of the Engliſh Hiſtory, which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of winds and ſeaſons, to which my writings had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, they had ſtill been making ſuch advances, that the copy-money given me by the bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, much exceeded any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to ſet my foot out of it; and retaining the ſatisfaction of never having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a requeſt to one great man, or even making advances of friendſhip to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of paſſing all the reſt of my life in this philoſophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, to attend him on his embaſſy to Paris, with a near proſpect of being appointed ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the embaſſy; and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This offer, however inviting, I at firſt declined, both becauſe I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant to begin connexions with the great, and becauſe I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris, would prove diſagreeable to a perſon of my age and humour: but on his lordſhip's repeating the invitation, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of it. I have every reaſon, both of pleaſure and intereſt, to think myſelf happy in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, General Conway.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have not ſeen the ſtrange effects of modes, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all ranks and ſtations. The more I reſiled from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive civilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real ſatisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of ſenſible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the univerſe. I thought once of ſettling there for life.</p>
                  <p>I was appointed ſecretary to the embaſſy; and in ſummer 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lord Lieutenant of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I was <hi>charge d' affaires</hi> till the arrival of the Duke of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, towards the end of the year, In the beginning of 1766, I left Paris, and next ſummer went to Edinburgh, with the ſame view as formerly, of bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf in a philoſophical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015853_0007_0F9A2E721276F1A8"/>
money, and a much larger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, by mean's of Lord Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's friendſhip, than I left it; and I was deſirous of trying what ſuperfluity could produce, as I had fomerly made an experiment of a competency. But, in 1767, I received from Mr Conway an invitation to be Under-ſecretary; and this invitation, both the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the perſon, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions with Lord Hertford, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from declining. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Edinburgh in 1769, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opulent (for I poſſeſſed a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of 1060l. a year), healthy, and though ſomewhat ſtricken in years, with the proſpect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying long my eaſe, and of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the increaſe of my reputation.</p>
                  <p>In ſpring 1775, I was ſtruck with a diſorder in my bowels, which at firſt gave me no alarm, but has ſince, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a ſpeedy diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. I have ſuffered very little pain from my diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rder; and what is more ſtrange, have, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great decline of my perſon, never ſuffered a moment's abatement of my ſpirits; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that were I to name the period of my life, which I ſhould moſt chooſe to paſs over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I poſſeſs the ſame ardour as ever in ſtudy, and the ſame gaiety in company. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, beſides, that a man of ſixty five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities; and though I ſee many ſymptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out at laſt with additional luſtre, I knew that I could have but very few years to enjoy it. It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be more detached from life than I am at preſent.</p>
                  <p>To conclude hiſtorically with my own character. I am, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was (for that is the ſtyle I muſt now uſe in ſpeaking of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which embordens me the more to ſpeak my ſentiments); I was, I ſay, a man of mild diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, of command of temper, of an open, ſocial, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little ſuſceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my paſſions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling paſſion, never ſoured my temper, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my frequent diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and careleſs, as well as to the ſtudious and literary; and as I took a particular pleaſure in the company of modeſt women, I had no reaſon to be diſpleaſed with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though moſt men any wiſe eminent, have found reaſon to complain of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth: and though I wantonly expoſed myſelf to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they ſeemed to be diſarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occaſion to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate any one circumſtance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well ſuppoſe, would have been glad to invent and propagate any ſtory to my diſadvantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I cannot ſay there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in making this funeral ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of myſelf, but I hope it is not a miſplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is eaſily cleared and aſcertained.</p>

                  <p>IT is with a real, though a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry melancholy pleaſure, that I ſit down to give you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the behaviour of our late excellent friend, Mr. Hume, during his laſt illneſs.</p>
                  <p>Though, in his own judgment, his diſeaſe was mortal and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet he allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A few days before he ſet out, he wrote that account of his own life, which, together with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther papers, he has left to your care. My account, therefore, ſhall begin where his ends.</p>
                  <p>He ſet out for London towards the end of April, and at Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth met with Mr. John Home and myſelf, who had both come down from London on purpoſe to ſee him, expecting to have found him at Edinburgh. Mr. Home returned with him, and attended him during the whole of his ſtay in England, with that care and attention which might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a temper ſo perfectly friendly and affectionate. As I had written to my mother that ſhe might expect me in Scotland, I was under the neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing my journey. His diſeaſe ſeemed to yield to exerciſe and change of air, and when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in London, he was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in much better health than when he left Edinburgh. He was adviſed to go to Bath to drink the waters, which appeared for ſome time to have ſo good an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon him, that even he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf began to entertain, what he was not apt to do, a better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own health. His ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, however, ſoon returned with their uſual violence, and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with the utmoſt cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the moſt perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and reſignation. Upon his return to Edinburgh, though he found himſelf much weaker, yet his cheerfulneſs never abated, and he continued to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as uſual, with correcting his own works for a new edition, with reading books of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the converſation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his friends; and, ſometimes in the evening, with a party at his favourite game of whiſt. His cheerfulneſs was ſo great, and his converſation and amuſements run ſo much in their uſual ſtrain, that, notwithſtanding all bad ſymptoms, many people could not believe he was dying. <q>I ſhall tell your friend, Colonel Edmondſtone,</q> ſaid Doctor Dundas to him one day, <q>that I left you much better, and in a fair way of recovery.</q>— "Doctor," ſaid he, <q>as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you would not chuſe to tell any thing but the truth, you had better tell him, that I am dying as faſt as my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if I have any, could wiſh, and as eaſily and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as my beſt friends could deſire.</q> Colonel Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ſoon afterwards came to ſee him, and take leave of him; and on his way home, he could not forbear writing him a letter bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him once more an eternal adieu, and applying to him, as to a dying man, the beautiful French verſes in which the Abbé Chaulieu, in expectation of his own death, laments his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparation from his friend, the Marquis de la Fare, Mr. Hume's magnanimity and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were ſuch, that his moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate friends knew, that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man, and that ſo far from being hurt by this frankneſs, he was rather pleaſed and flattered by it. I happened to come into his room while he was reading this letter, which he had juſt received, and which he immediately ſhowed me. I told him, that though I was ſenſible how very much be was weakened, and that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances were in many reſpects very bad, yet his cheerfulneſs was ſtill ſo great, the ſpirit of life ſeemed ſtill to be ſo very ſtrong in him, that I could not help entertaining ſome faint hopes. He anſwered, <q>Your hopes are groundleſs. An habitual diarrhoea of more than a year's ſtanding, would be a very bad diſeaſe at any age: at my age it is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening. I feel myſelf weaker than when I roſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when I riſe in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am ſenſible, beſides, that ſome of my vital parts are affected, ſo that I muſt ſoon die.</q>— "Well," ſaid I, "if it muſt be ſo, you have at leaſt the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of leaving all your friends, your brother's family in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in great proſperity." He ſaid, that he felt that ſatisfaction ſo ſenſibly, that when he was reading a few days before, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian's Dialogues of the Dead, among all the excuſes which are alledged to Charon for not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readily into his boat, he could not find one that fitted him; he had no houſe to finiſh, he had no daughter to provide for, he had no enemies upon whom he wiſhed to revenge himſelf. <q>I could not well imagine, ſaid he, what excuſe I could make to Charon in order to obtain a little delay. I have done eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing of conſequence which I ever meant to do, and I could at no time expect to leave my relations and friends in a better ſituation than that in which I am now likely to leave them; I, therefore, have
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015853_0010_0F9A2E746D5750A8"/>
all reaſon to die contented.</q> He then diverted himſelf with inventing ſeveral jocular excuſes, which he ſuppoſed he might make to Charon, and with imagining the very ſurly anſwers which it might ſuit the character of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron to return to them. <q>Upon further conſideration, ſaid he, I thought I might ſay to him, Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow me a little time, that I may ſee how the Public receives the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> But Charon would anſwer, <q>When you have ſeen the effect of theſe, you will be for making other alterations. There will be no end of ſuch excuſes; ſo, honeſt friend, pleaſe ſtep into the boat.</q> But I might ſtill urge, <q>Have a little patience, good Charon, I have been endeavouring to open the eyes of the public. If I live a few years longer, I may have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing the downfal of ſome of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſyſtems of ſuperſtition.</q> But Charon would then loſe all temper and decency. <q>You loitering rogue, that will not happen theſe many hundred years. Do you fancy I will grant you a leaſe for ſo long a term? Get into the boat this inſtant, you lazy loitering rogue.</q>

                  <p>But, though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with great cheerfulneſs, he never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity. He never mentioned the ſubject but when the converſation naturally led to it, and never dwelt longer upon it than the courſe of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation happened to require: it was a ſubject indeed which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred pretty frequently, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the inquiries which his friends, who came to ſee him, naturally made concerning the ſtate of his health. The conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which I mentioned above, and which paſſed on Thurſday the 8th of Auguſt, was the laſt, except one, that I ever had with him. He had now become ſo very weak, that the company of his moſt intimate friends fatigued him; for his cheerfulneſs was ſtill ſo great, his complaiſance and ſocial diſpoſition were ſtill ſo entire, that when any friend was with him, he could not help talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more, and with greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, than ſuited the weakneſs of his body. At his own deſire, therefore, I agreed to leave Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, where I was ſtaying part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his account, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my mother's houſe here, at Kirkaldy, upon condition that he would ſend for me whenever he wiſhed to ſee me; the phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who ſaw him moſt frequently, Doctor Black, undertaking, in the mean time, to write me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally an account of the ſtate of his health.</p>
                  <p>On the 22d of Auguſt, the Doctor wrote me the following letter:</p>
                  <p>"Since my laſt, Mr. Hume has paſſed his time pretty eaſily, but is much weaker. He ſits up, goes down ſtairs once a day, and amuſes himſelf with reading, but ſeldom ſees any body. He finds that even the converſation of his moſt intimate friends fatigues and oppreſſes him; and it is happy that he does not need it, for he is quite free from anxiety, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or low ſpirits, and paſſes his time very well with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of amuſing books."</p>

                        <p>Yeſterday about four o'clock afternoon, Mr. Hume expired. The near approach of his death became evident in the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Thurſday and Friday, when his diſeaſe became exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and ſoon weakened him ſo much, that he could no longer riſe out of his bed. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the laſt perfectly ſenſible, and free from much pain or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of diſtreſs. He never drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſmalleſt expreſſion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience; but when he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak to the people about him, always did it with affection and tenderneſs. I thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to write to bring you over, eſpecially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you deſiring you not to come. When he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very weak it coſt him an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſpeak, and he died in ſuch a happy compoſure of mind, that nothing could exceed it.</p>

Even in the loweſt ſtate of his fortune, his great and neceſſary frugality ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hindered him from exerciſing upon p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The extreme gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of his nature never weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened either the firmneſs of his hand, or the ſteadineſs of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. His conſtant pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was the genuine effuſion of good-nature and good-humour, tempered with delicacy and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and without even the ſlighteſt tincture of malignity, ſo frequently the diſagreeable ſource of what is called wit in other men. it never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify; and therefore, far from offending, it ſeldom ſailed to pleaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, even thoſe who were the

objects of it, To his friends, who were frequently the objects of it, there was not perhaps any one of all his great and amiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which contributed more to endear his converſation. And that gaiety of temper, ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſociety, but which is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten accompanied with frivolous and ſuperficial qualities, was in him certainly attended with the moſt ſevere application, the moſt extenſive learning, the greateſt depth of thought, and a capacity in every reſpect the moſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive. Upon the whole, I have always conſidered him, both in his life-time and ſince his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wiſe and virtuous man; as perhaps the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of human frailty will permit.</p>

                  <p>LES VOYAGES D'UN PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHE of M. le Poivre have been much admired in France. They were originally read before the Royal Society of Agriculture at Lyons, of which he was preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and afterwards before the Royal Society of Paris. For ſometime they were handed about in manuſcript, and at length, found their way to the preſs.</p>
                  <p>M. le Poivre's manner is eaſy and elegant; his obſervations ſtriking and judicious; his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments humane and benevolent.— The genuine happineſs of every nation muſt depend on agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and agriculture muſt ever be influenced by eſtabliſhed laws and modes of government: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indulgently ſmiles on the labour of a free-born people, but ſhrinks with horror from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and the ſlave. This is his ſyſtem, and it is the ſyſtem of truth, founded on experience, and ſupported not only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring cotemporary nations, but by contraſting nations with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at different periods.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary the reader ſhould keep in view the country of the author, as many of his ſtrictures on European agriculture, though unapplicable perhaps to Britain, convey a deſcriptive picture of the ſtate of cultivation in France.</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>EVERY people, however bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, have arts peculiar to themſelves. The diverſity of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, whilſt it varies the wants of mankind, offers to their induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try different productions on which to exerciſe it. Every country, at a certain degree of diſtance, has fabrics ſo ſingularly peculiar to itſelf, that they could not have been the fabrics of other regions: but agriculture, in every climate, is the univerſal art of mankind: from one extreme of the globe to the other, nations ſtill barbarous, as well as thoſe whoſe ideas are civilized, procure to themſelves, at leaſt, a part of their ſubſiſtence by the culture of their fields; yet this art, however univerſal, is not every where equally flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>It never fails to proſper among wiſe nations, who know how to honour and encourage it;—it ſupports itſelf but feebly amongſt a people half poliſhed, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prefer to it frivolous arts, or who, being ſufficiently enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened perhaps to perceive its uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are ſtill too much ſlaves to the prejudices of their ancient barbarity, to affranchize and confer honours on thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it;—it languiſhes, and its influence is ſcarcely to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt barbarians, who deſpiſe it.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of agriculture has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been the principal object of my reſearches among the various people I have ſeen in the courſe of my voyages. It is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a traveller, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps only paſſes through a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to make ſuch remarks as are neceſſary to convey a juſt idea of the government, police, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015853_0015_0F9A2E781183C7A8"/>
of the inhabitants. In ſuch a caſe, the criterion which beſt marks the internal ſtate of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to obſerve the public markets, and the face of the country. If the markets abound in proviſions, if the fields are well cultivated, and covered with rich crops, then in general you may conclude that the country is well peopled, that the inhabitants are civilized and happy, that their manners are poliſhed, and their government agreeable to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon. — You may then ſay to yourſelf, I am amongſt <hi>Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When, on the contrary, I have arrived amongſt a people, whom it was neceſſary to ſearch for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt foreſts, whoſe neglected lands were overgrown with bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; when I have traverſed large tracts of uncultivated deſarts, and then at laſt ſtumbled on a grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed up wretchedly cultivated field; when arrived at length at ſome canton, I have obſerved nothing in the public market but a few ſorry roots, I no longer heſitated to determine the inhabitants to be wretched ſavages, or groaning under the moſt oppreſſive ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>I never remember a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of being obliged to retract this firſt idea, conceived ſimply by inſpecting the ſtate of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture amongſt the various nations I have ſeen: the knowledge of various particulars, which a long reſidence among many of them has enabled me to acquire, has ever confirmed me in opinion, that a country poorly cultivated is always inhabited by men bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous or oppreſſed, and that population there can never be conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>You will obſerve by the detail I now offer you of my enquiries, that in every country agriculture depends abſolutely on the laws, the manners, and even on the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed prejudices of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE iſlands and weſtern diſtricts of this part of the world which I have ſeen, are for the greater part uncultivated lands, inhabited by unhappy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes. Theſe wretched men, who have ſo poor an eſtimation of themſelves as to ſell one another, never employ a thought on the cultivation of their lands. Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to exiſt from day to day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a climate where their wants are few, they cultivate juſt as much as prevents their dying of hunger; they careleſly ſow every year ſome maize, a very little rice; and plant, in ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, different kinds of potatoes, not of the nature of ours, though the culture is much the ſame; we know them by the name of <hi>yams.</hi> In general their harveſts are ſo poor, that the Europeans, who reſort to them for the purchaſe of ſlaves, are obliged to bring from Europe or America the proviſions neceſſary for the maintenance of thoſe unfortunate creatures doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to compoſe their cargoes.</p>
                     <p>The negroes, who inhabit the environs of the European colonies, give ſomewhat more attention to agriculture than the others.— They rear flocks; they cultivate rice in greater quantities; and in their gardens are found pulſe, of which the ſeed has been brought from Europe; yet all they know of agriculture, they have learnt from the Europeans ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is extremely bounded; and I have never been able to diſcover in their induſtry any proceſs which could in the leaſt improve our own.</p>
                     <p>From the river of Angola to Cape Negroe, and from thence till you approach the Cape of Good Hope, nothing is to be ſeen but ſterile uncultivated lands; the coaſts are naked and covered with barren ſands; and you are under the neceſſity of travelling many leagues before you can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a palm-tree, or the ſlighteſt verdure. The country and its few inhabitants ſeem to be ſtruck with one common curſe. From the informations I have received touching theſe countries from the Italian miſſionaries, who with an admirable zeal have penetrated into the heart of theſe accurſed regions, I learn likewiſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture is juſt as languid in the

                     <p>THE countries around the Cape were condemned to the ſame ſterility before the Dutch took poſſeſſion of them; but ſince their eſtabliſhment on this point of Africa, the lands produce in abundance wheat and grain of every kind, wines of different qualities, and a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of excellent fruits, collected from every quarter of the world.

The abundance which this colony en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, compared to the barrenneſs of the ſurrounding countries, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently demonſtrates that the earth denies her favours only to the tyrant and the ſlave; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes prodigal of her treaſures, beyond the moſt ſanguine hope, ſo ſoon as ſhe is free, and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by men of diſcernment, whom wiſe and invariable laws protect.</p>
                     <p>A number of Frenchmen, forced from their country by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, have on this coaſt found a new eſtabliſhment, and, with it ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, property, and liberty, the only true encouragers of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the only principles of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. They have enriched this adopted mother by their induſtry; they have there founded conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able colonies, ſome of which bear the name of that unhappy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which denied them the uſe of water and of fire, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of which however they ſtill fondly cheriſh.</p>
                     <p>The colony of the Little Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle ſurpaſſes all the reſt, by the induſtry of the coloniſts, and the fertility of the lands which belong to it. The paſtures are there compoſed of a variety of graſſes, natives of the country, together with ſeveral different ſpecies of herbage, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our artificial meadows in Europe, ſuch as trefoil, lucerne, and ſaintfoin. The exotic plants, the ſeeds of which have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Dutch, flouriſh there as the natural productions of the country. Thoſe ſeeds are ſown by an operation of the plough; they cut the graſs only the firſt year; the ſecond they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the meadows to cattle, which live there at diſcretion, without any other attention than that of collecting them together every evening into a park incloſed with ſtrong and high palliſades, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them againſt the lions and tigers, with which this country abounds.</p>
                     <p>Some of theſe encloſures are watered only by the rains, altho' they generally endeavour to chuſe them in the neighbourhood of ſome brook, where they dig com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious watering places. In all theſe paſturages, they have an eye to groves of trees, where the herds and flocks may find ſhelter againſt the intenſe heat of the ſun; particularly in January, February, and March, which in this part of the world are the moſt ſultry months in the year.</p>
                     <p>The arable land is here labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in Europe, ſometimes by
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015853_0018_0F9A2E7A4EE86800"/>
horſes, but oftener by oxen: the Dutch of this colony have by their induſtry corrected the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſluggiſhneſs of theſe latter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, by exerciſing them while young in a briſk pace; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which I have ſeen, at the Cape, carriages, drawn by teams of ten or a dozen yoke of oxen, go as expeditiouſly as if drawn by horſes.</p>
                     <p>The grains commonly ſown at the Cape, are wheat, turkey corn, and rice; theſe generally produce an increaſe of fifty-fold. They cultivate a variety of different kinds of pulſe, ſuch as peaſe, common beans, and French beans. This pulſe makes a refreſhing proviſion to the ſhips touching at the Cape going or returning to India.</p>
                     <p>A particular ſpecies of this pulſe is much in requeſt in India, to which they export a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity: it is there known by the name of <hi>Cape Peaſe:</hi> it is a kind of French bean which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no prop; its grain is of the form of that bean, but larger and flatter; it taſtes like our green peaſe, and preſerves its freſhneſs for a long time. I have this year attempted the culture of this plant, which promiſes ſucceſs. The cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate at the Cape ſeems to demand from the cultivator an attention which appears not ſo neceſſary in this country, and which would even perhaps be prejudicial to the productions of our lands.</p>
                     <p>The Cape however is expoſed the greateſt part of the year to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent hurricanes, which blow ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally from the north-eaſt.— Theſe winds are ſo impetuous that they would beat down the fruits from the trees, and ſweep to deſtruction the labours of the farmer, had they not provided a barrier for the ſecurity of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. The Dutch coloniſts have divided their lands into ſmall fields, which they have ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with high palliſades of oak and other trees, planted very cloſe to one another, ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a charmille, deſigned for the ornament of a garden. Theſe palliſades th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                        </gap>; their height being commonly from twenty-five to thirty feet; every ſeparate field, in conſequence, is encloſed like a chamber.</p>
                     <p>It is by this induſtry alone that the Dutch have rendered this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony not only the granary of all their ſettlements in the Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but the moſt commodious place for veſſels to touch at for refreſhments and proviſions of all kinds.</p>
                     <p>When the Dutch began to form their vineyards, they endeavoured to procure plants from thoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons which enjoyed the greateſt reputation for their vines; but after many fruitleſs attempts to produce, at the extremity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, the wines of Burgundy and Champagne, they applied to rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plants tranſported from Spain, the Canaries, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, where the climate is more analogous to the Cape. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the plants which are culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated moſt ſucceſsfully, are thoſe of the Muſcadel kind: the red Muſcadel particularly, which they rear in a ſmall diſtrict called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, produces moſt delicious wine; the Dutch Eaſt-India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany always ſecure this vintage, which they ſend in preſents to the ſovereigns of Europe.</p>
                     <p>The wines at the Cape are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated without vine-props; the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015853_0019_0F9A2E7B14E12760"/>
method of labour is much the ſame with that in France. The vineyards are ſurrounded by a number of trees, upon which they entwine the ſlips of the great Spaniſh Muſcadine, in form of eſpaſiers, very high, by which the vines are ſheltered from the violence of the winds.</p>
                     <p>The ſame attention, at the Cape, is paid to gardening, as to the other branches of agriculture. You there find all the variety of European pulſe, greens, herbs, and roots, with the beſt of thoſe peculiar to other parts of the world. Independent of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the coloniſts, which are kept in as fine order as any in Europe, the India Company have cultivated two or three gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, extenſive and magnificent, which they ſupport with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence worthy of a ſovereign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>Fifteen or twenty European gardeners, whoſe abilities are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved before they are embarked, are employed in the cultivation of each of thoſe vaſt gardens, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of a principal gardener, whoſe place is lucrative and honourable. It is in thoſe gardens, at the expence of the company, that all the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made in every new ſpecies of culture; and it is there that every private individual is provided, gratis, with ſuch plants and ſeeds as he may have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for, together with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary inſtructions for their cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe gardens furniſh, in the greateſt abundance, herbage and fruits of various kinds to the company's ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Travellers cannot but with pleaſure and admiration obſerve large encloſures conſecrated to the ſtudy and improvement of botany, in which the moſt rare and uſeful plants, from every quarter of the world, are arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt excellent order: the curious have the additional ſatisfaction alſo of finding ſkilful gardeners, who take pleaſure in deſcribing and pointing out their virtues.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe beautiful gardens are terminated by large orchards, where are to be found all the fruits of Europe, together with ſeveral natives of Africa and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. Nothing is more agreeable than to ſee in different expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even in the ſame encloſure, the cheſnut, the apple, and other trees, from the moſt northern cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, together with the muſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine of the Indies, the camphres of Borneo, the palms, and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of other trees, which are natives of the torrid zone.</p>

                     <p>AFTER doubling the Cape of Good Hope, you enter the Indian ſea, where you find the great iſland of Madagaſcar: we are ſtill unacquainted with many places of this iſland, though the Portugueſe, Dutch, French, and other Europeans have had ſettlements, and frequented it, above two centuries.

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015853_0020_0F9A2E7C8F99ED50"/>
in many cantons are large tracts of tilled ground, covered with graſs of an extraordinary ſize, which grows to the height of five or ſix feet; the natives call it <hi>Fatak</hi>; it is excellent for nouriſhing and fattening their horned cattle, which are of the largeſt ſpecies, and differ in ſhape from ours, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by a large fleſhy protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance on their neck —Another graſs, of a finer blade, ſhoots ſpontaneouſly through the ſands on the ſea coaſt, which furniſhes food for the ſheep: theſe are of the ſame ſpecies with thoſe of Barbary, and differ from ours moſt remarkably, by the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſize of their tails, which weigh in general from ſix to eight pounds.</p>
                     <p>The Madecaſſes or Malegaches (which is the name of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this iſland) cultivate ſcarce any other grain but rice: they ſow at the commencement of the rainy ſeaſon; in conſequence of which they are not under the neceſſity of watering their fields. In labouring their ground, they uſe no inſtrument but the pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe; they begin by grubbing up all the weeds; then five or ſix men, ranging themſelves in a line on the field, dig little holes as they paſs along, into which the women or children, who follow, throw the grains of the rice, and then with their feet cover them with earth: a field ſown in this manner, produces an increaſe of above eighty or a hundred-fold, which proves rather the extreme fertility of the ſoil, than the goodneſs of the cultivation: bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood as it may be, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the inhabitants of Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar live in abundance. In no country in the world, that I have ſeen, are rice and other eſſential proviſions cheaper than in this iſland. For a remnant of coarſe blue cloath, which may be worth perhaps twenty pence, the Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe gives two or three meaſures of rice. Theſe meaſures are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the Europeans, who never fail to enlarge them every year; yet the iſlanders do not complain. The meaſure is firſt of all heaped; the buyer then, in virtue of an eſtabliſhed right for ſecuring good meaſure, thruſts his arm to the elbow in the rice, and with one ſweep empties it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely, which the Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe has the patience a ſecond time to repleniſh, without a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. This meaſure is called a <hi>Gamelle,</hi> which, thus filled, will hold about 160 pounds of pure rice.</p>
                     <p>There cannot be a doubt, but if our India Company,<note n="*" place="bottom">The French India Company.</note> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are in poſſeſſion of the trade with the natives of this iſland, would give proper encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to agriculture, it would in a ſhort time make a rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.—Our iſlands of Bourbon and France would here always find a certain reſource againſt thoſe dearths which too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtreſs the latter of thoſe iſlands. Our ſquadrons bound for India, who put into the iſle of France for refreſhments, would there always find abundance of proviſions brought from Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar, and of conſequence would not be ſubjected to the neceſſity of loſing their time at the Cape, or at Batavia, begging refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Dutch, whilſt the

                     <p>ALMOST 200 leagues eaſt of Madagaſcar, lie the two iſlands of Bourbon and France; the ſoil of which is naturally as fertile as that of Madagaſcar, whilſt they enjoy a happier cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Bourbon has no port; it is of conſequence little frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſhipping. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants have preſerved their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of manners, and agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is there in a flouriſhing ſtate. The iſland produces wheat, rice, and maize, not only for its own conſumpt, but even furniſhes a ſmall ſupply to the Iſle of France: the culture there is the ſame as at Madagaſcar. The horned cattle and ſheep, which they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from that iſland, thrive here extremely well, eſpecially as they have alſo introduced the graſs called <hi>Fatak,</hi> which, as I have before obſerved, makes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent paſturage.</p>
                     <p>The lands of this iſland are principally employed in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the coffee-tree. The firſt plants of this ſhrubby tree were brought from Mocha. It multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies by its grains ſowing ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly; little attention is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; nothing more is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than to grub up, three or four times during the firſt year, the neighbouring weeds, which would otherwiſe rob it of its proper nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: the ſecond year it grows without care; its branches, which extend horizontally along the ſurface of the ground, by their ſhade ſtifle the growth of

all ſuch weeds, as might ſhoot up within their circumference: at the end of eighteen months the coffee-tree begins to bear fruit, and in three years yields a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful crop. They plant theſe trees chequer-wiſe, at about the diſtance of ſeven feet from one another, and, when they grow too tall, prune them to the height of perhaps two feet from the ground.</p>

The coffee, after it is gathered in, muſt be dried; for ſeveral days, therefore, it is expoſed to the ſun, till the bean becomes extremely dry; they then clear it of the pulp, which is done by peſtles in large wooden troughs.</p>

The coffee, the cotton, the indigo, the ſugar cane, the pear, the cinnamon, the mulberry, the tea, and the cocoa trees have all been cultivated by experiments, but in ſuch a ſuperficial manner as could never ſecure ſucceſs. Had they followed the ſimple plan of the founder, which was to ſecure bread, the iſland would at this day have been flouriſhing; Abundance would then have reigned amongſt the coloniſts, and the ſhipping never been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments and proviſions.</p>

of labour, than that which is practiſed at Madagaſcar.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Manaic</hi> was firſt introduced into this iſland by M. de la Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donnois: the culture of this plant was at firſt attended with very great difficulty, but it is now the principal reſource of the coloniſts for the nouriſhment of their ſlaves. As the culture of this root is here the ſame as in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, I ſhall not repeat what has been related by a number of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.</p>
                     <p>They formerly brought from Madagaſcar, black cattle and ſheep; but ſince they have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that more advantage at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the tranſportation of ſlaves, they have neglected the increaſe of their cattle, which the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual demands of the ſhipping, and the wants of the inhabitants at the ſame time, daily diminiſh: beſides, they have never hitherto formed any paſtures; ſuch as they have attempted having been laid out with ſo little ſkill, that they have not ſucceeded. The iſland produces naturally, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cantons, an excellent kind of graſs, which grows to the height of five or ſix feet. This graſs begins to appear above ground about the beginning of the rainy ſeaſon; it performs all its vegetation during the three months, which this ſeaſon laſts: the inhabitants take advantage of this to paſture their herds, who fatten upon it amazingly; but, the vegetation over, there remains nothing on the ground but a ſtraw too hard to afford nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the cattle; and, ſoon after, the fire, which is kindled here by a thouſand accidents, conſumes this ſtraw, and with it frequently part of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreſts. During the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the year, the herds wander about and languiſh amongſt the woods.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt fault which has been committed in this iſland, and which has proved moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to cultivation, is the method of clearing the woods from off the ground by fire, without leaving groves and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets at proper diſtances. The rains, in this iſland, conduce moſt to the amelioration of the grounds; but the clouds being ſtopt by the foreſts, there the rains fall; whilſt the cleared lands are ſcarce watered by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle drop: the fields, at the ſame time, being thus deprived of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, are expoſed to the violence of the winds, which often entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy the harveſts.—The Dutch, as we have before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, found no trees at the Cape; but they have planted them there as ſhelter for their habitations. The iſle of France, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, was covered with woods, and the coloniſts have entirely deſtroyed them.</p>

                     <p>The labourers are a tribe much honoured among the Indians.

I am convinced that in every country they might be rendered equally uſeful.</p>
                     <p>The ſoil on the Coromandel to it is light, dry, and ſandye the induſtry and labour however, of the natives, make it produce two crops every year, without the neceſſity of one fallow ſeaſon.

But the method of rendering the culture of this tree moſt advantageous, is the extracting wine from its fruit. The Indian watches the time when the nuts of the cocoa tree
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015853_0027_0F9A2E81CEFBFBB8"/>
have attained to the ſize of our ordinary nuts, which happens ſoon after the fall of the flower: he then makes an inciſion in the ſtalk of the cluſter about ſeven or eight inches from the trunk of the tree; here he faſtens an earthen veſſel to receive the juice, which iſſues in great abundance: the mouth of the veſſel he carefully wraps round with a cloth, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the admiſſion of the air, which would ſoon turn it to the fret. The veſſel fills in twenty-four hours: the Indian takes care to change it every day. This natural wine, which is called <hi>Soury,</hi> is ſold and drunk in this ſtate.

                     <p>A cocoa-tree, thus managed, is worth a pagoda (about eight ſhillings) per annum. Theſe trees are planted about twenty five or thirty feet diſtant from each other.

The coaſts of Orixa, Malabar, the territory of Surat, the banks of the Ganges, and the interior parts of Indoſtan, are much more fertile, and in many of theſe countries agriculture flouriſhes ſurpriſingly.

                     <p>THE kingdom of Siam, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the peninſula of the Indies beyond the Ganges, is in general extremely fertile.— Divided, like Indoſtan, by a chain of mountains from north to ſouth, it enjoys, all the year round, and at the ſame time, two very oppoſite ſeaſons. The weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern diviſion, all along the bay of Bengal, is deluged by continual rains, during the ſix months that the monſoons continue to blow from the weſt. This ſeaſon is conſidered as their winter on this coaſt; whilſt in the other diviſion of the kingdom, towards the eaſt, they enjoy the fineſt climate, and never experience that difference of ſeaſon, which reigns on the weſtern ſide, except by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the Menam. This noble river runs along a great way among mountains, where the rains concenter: it waſhes the walls of the capital, and annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally overflows, without the leaſt ravage, a delightful country, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all over with rich plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The ſlime, which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam leaves behind, enriches the ſoil prodigiouſly; the rice ſeems to grow up in proportion as the inundation riſes, and the river at length gently retires by degrees into its bed, as the rice approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to maturity, and has no further occaſion for its waters. How bountiful has nature been to thoſe who inhabit this charming coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try!—ſhe has, however, done more: the fields produce, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, an infinite variety of moſt delicate fruits, which require al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no cultivation; ſuch as the pine apple, the mangouſtas, (the moſt delicate fruit perhaps in the world) mangoes of different kinds and all excellent, ſeveral ſpecies of oranges, the banana, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, the gacca, with other fruits of inferior quality. Nature, ſtill more bountiful, has alſo ſcattered over this country, almoſt on the ſurface of the ground, mines of gold, copper, and a ſpecies of fine tin, which there, as in other parts of India, they name <hi>Calin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this terreſtrial paradiſe, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſo much riches, who would imagine that the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameſe are, perhaps, the moſt wretched people in the world?</p>
                     <p>The government of Siam is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotic: the ſovereign alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys that liberty which is natural to all mankind: his ſubjects are all his ſlaves; every one of them is annually taxed at ſix months perſonal ſervice without wages, and even without food: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them the other ſix months to procure themſelves wherewithal to exiſt the year. Under ſuch a government, there is no law that can afford protection to individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als againſt violence, or in the ſmalleſt degree ſecure them in their property. Every thing is ſubjected to the caprice of a prince, rendered brutal by every ſpecies of exceſs, particularly that of power; who paſſes his days locked up in his ſeraglio, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an idea of any thing beyond the walls of his palace, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ignorant of the wretched condition of his ſubjects. Theſe are expoſed to the avarice of the grandees, who themſelves are only

the chief ſlaves, and tremblingly approach, on appointed days, the preſence of their tyrant, whom they adore like a divinity, though ſubject to the moſt dangerous caprices.</p>
                     <p>Religion alone has preſerved the power of protecting againſt tyranny thoſe who, ranging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under its ſtandard, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the order of the prieſts of <hi>Somonacondom,</hi> the deity of the Siameſe. Thoſe who embrace this order, and their number is conſiderable, are by law obliged to obſerve the ſtricteſt celibacy which, in a warm climate, ſuch as that of Siam, whilſt it occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons great diſorders, almoſt depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulates the country.</p>
                     <p>It may eaſily be conceived, that under ſuch a government agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture cannot flouriſh; it may be ſaid, even, that no regard is paid to it at all, when the ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ground which is laboured, is compared to the immenſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of lands which are totally neglected.</p>
                     <p>With regard even to thoſe grounds which they have laid out, nature may be ſaid to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing.

                     <p>The Siameſe method of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating their rice, is firſt to ſow it very thick in a ſmall ſquare plot of ground, well watered, a little below the ſurface of the earth. As ſoon as the plants have grown about five or ſix inches high, they pull them up, by the roots, and tranſplant them in ſmall parcels of three or four ſtalks, diſtant from each other about four inches every way. Theſe plants are placed deep in a clay ſoil, which has been previouſly well laboured with a plow, dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Siameſe rear herds of buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faloes, and horned cattle; but all the care they take of them is, to conduct them, in the day time, to the fallow grounds, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in paſtures, and re conduct them, in the evening, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, in order to ſecure them from the tygers, of which there are great numbers in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The milk, and a very little labour, is all the advantages they draw from them. Their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the ſame that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in Indoſtan, and which the Talapoins alone know any thing about, forbids them killing theſe animals.

They have alſo great numbers of poultry, particularly ducks, of the beſt kinds in the Indies.</p>
                     <p>The king maintains a number of tame elephants.

                     <p>BEYOND the kingdom of Siam is the peninſula of Malacca; a country formerly well peopled, and, conſequently, well cultivated. This nation was once one of the greateſt powers, and made a very conſiderable figure on the theatre of Aſia. The ſea was covered with their ſhips, and they carried on a moſt extenſive commerce. Their laws, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, were apparently very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from thoſe which ſubſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them at preſent. From time to time they ſent out num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of colonies, which, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, peopled the iſlands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, the Celebes or Macaſſor, the Moluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, the Philippines, and thoſe innumerable iſlands of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago, which bound Aſia on the eaſt, and which occupy an extent of ſeven hundred leagues, in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, from eaſt to weſt, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix hundred of latitude, from north to ſouth. The inhabitants of all theſe iſlands, thoſe at leaſt upon the coaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, are the ſame people; they ſpeak almoſt the ſame language, have the ſame laws, the ſame manners —Is it not ſomewhat ſingular, that this nation, whoſe poſſeſſions are ſo extenſive, ſhould ſcarce be known in Europe?—I ſhall endeavour to give you an idea of thoſe laws, and thoſe manners; you will, from thence, eaſily judge of their agriculture.</p>
                     <p>Travellers, who make obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations on the Malais, are aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to find, in the center of Aſia, under the ſcorching climate of the line, the laws, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the cuſtoms, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the ancient inhabitants of the north of Europe. The Malais are governed by feudal laws, that capricious ſyſtem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for the defence of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a few againſt the tyranny of one, whilſt the multitude is ſubjected to ſlavery and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>A chief, who has the title of king, or ſultan, iſſues his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to his great vaſſals, who obey when they think proper.— Theſe have inferior vaſſals, who often act in the ſame manner with regard to them. A ſmall part of the nation live indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, under the title of <hi>Oramcai,</hi> or <hi>noble,</hi> and ſell their ſervices to thoſe who pay them beſt; whilſt the body of the nation is compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſlaves, and live in perpetual ſervitude.</p>
                     <p>With theſe laws the Malais are reſtleſs, fond of navigation, war, plunder, emigrations, colonies, deſperate enterprizes, adventures, and gallantry. They talk inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly of their honour, and their bravery, whilſt they are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally conſidered, by thoſe with whom they have intercourſe, as the moſt treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015853_0032_0F9A2E8590D40F48"/>
and yet, which appeared to me extremely ſingular, they ſpeak the ſofteſt language of Aſia — That which the Count de Forbin has ſaid, in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the Macaſſars, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly true, and is the reigning characteriſtic of the whole Malay nations. More attached to the abſurd laws of their pretended honour, than to thoſe of juſtice or humanity, you always obſerve, that amongſt them, the ſtrong oppreſs and deſtroy the weak: their treaties of peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip never ſubſiſting beyond that ſelf intereſt which induced them to make them, they are almoſt always armed, and either at war amongſt themſelves, or employed in pillaging their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>This ferocity, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais qualify under the name of courage, is ſo well known to the European companies, who have ſettlements in the Indies, that they have univerſally agreed in prohibiting the captains of their ſhips, who may put into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay iſlands, from taking on board any ſeamen of that nation, except in the greateſt diſtreſs, and then, on no account, to exceed two or three.</p>
                     <p>It is nothing uncommon for a handful of theſe horrid ſavages ſuddenly to embark, attack a veſſel by ſurprize, poignard in hand, maſſacre the people, and make themſelves maſters of her. Malay batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty men, have been known to board European ſhips of thirty or forty guns, in order to take poſſeſſion of them, and murder, with their poignards, great part of the crew The Malay hiſtory is full of ſuch enterprizes which mark the deſperate ferocity of theſe barbarians.</p>
                     <p>The Malais, who are not ſlaves, go always armed: they would think themſelves diſgraced, if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <hi>Crit.</hi> The induſtry of this nation even ſurpaſſes itſelf, in the fabrick of this deſtructive weapon.</p>
                     <p>As their lives are a perpetual round of agitation and tumult, they could never endure the long flowing habits, which prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other Aſiatics. The habits of the Malais are exactly adapted to their ſhapes, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a number of buttons, which faſten them cloſe to their bodies in every part.—I relate theſe ſeemingly trifling obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in order to prove, that, in climates the moſt oppoſite, the ſame laws produce ſimilar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, cuſtoms and prejudices — Their effect is the ſame too with reſpect to agriculture.</p>
                     <p>The lands poſſeſſed by the Malais are, in general, of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior quality. Nature ſeems to have taken pleaſure in there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling her moſt favourite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. They have not only thoſe to be found in the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Siam, but a variety of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers peculiar to theſe iſlands.— The country is covered with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous woods, ſuch as the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or aloes wood, the ſandal, and the caſſia odorata, a ſpecies of cinnamon. You there breathe an air impregnated with the odours of innumerable flowers of the greateſt fragrance, of which there is a perpetual ſucceſſion the year round, the ſweet flavour of which captivates the ſoul, and inſpires the moſt voluptuous ſenſations. No traveller, wandering over the plains of Malacca, but feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtrongly impelled to wiſh his
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015853_0033_0F9A2E864FBECAD0"/>
reſidence fixed in a place ſo luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant in allurements, where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture triumphs without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of art.</p>
                     <p>The Malay iſlands produce va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds of dying woods, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>Sapan,</hi> which is the ſame with the Braſil wood. There are alſo a number of gold mines, which the inhabitants of Sumatra and Malacca call <hi>Ophirs:</hi> ſome of which, thoſe eſpecially on the eaſtern coaſt, are richer than thoſe of Braſil or Peru. There are likewiſe mines of fine copper, mixed with gold, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants name <hi>Tombage.</hi> In the iſlands of Sumatra and Banea are mines of calin, or fine tin; and at Succadana, in the iſland of Borneo, is a mine of diamonds. Thoſe iſlands enjoy alſo, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, the rotin, the ſagou, (or bread palm-tree) the camphre, and other precious aromatics, which we know under the names of various ſpiceries.</p>
                     <p>The ſea too teems with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of excellent fiſh, together with ambergris, pearls, and thoſe delicate birds neſts (ſo much in requeſt in China) formed in the rocks with the ſpawn of fiſhes, and the foam of the ſea, by a ſpecies of ſmall-ſized ſwallow, peculiar to thoſe ſeas: this is of ſuch an exquiſite ſubſtance and flavour, that the Chineſe long purchaſed them for their weight in gold, and ſtill buy them at an exceſſive price.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of all this luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of nature, the Malay is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. The culture of the lands, abandoned to ſlaves, is fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt Theſe wretched labourers, dragged inceſſantly from their ruſtic employments, by their reſtleſs maſters, who delight in war and maritime enterprizes, have rarely time, and never reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to give the neceſſary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the labouring of their grounds. Their lands, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, remain uncultivated; and produce no kind of grain for the ſubſiſtence of the inhabitants.</p>

                     <head>SAGOU.</head>
                     <p>THE ſagou tree, in part, ſupplies the defect of grain. This admirable tree is a preſent which bountiful nature has made to men incapable of labour. It requires no culture; it is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the palm-tree, which grows naturally, in the woods, to the height of about twenty or thirty feet; its circumference being ſometimes from five to ſix. Its ligneous bark is about an inch in thickneſs, and covers a multitude of long fibres, which, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven one with another, enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope a maſs of a gummy kind of meal. As ſoon as this tree is ripe, a whitiſh duſt, which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires through the pores of the leaves, and adheres to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, proclaims its maturity. The Malais then cut them down near the root, divide them into ſeveral ſections, which they ſplit into quarters: They then ſcoop out the maſs of mealy ſubſtance, which is enveloped by and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the fibres; they dilute it in pure water, and then paſs it through a ſtraining bag of fine
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015853_0034_0F9A2E870EE581D0"/>
cloth, in order to ſeparate it from the fibres. When this paſte has loſt part of its moiſture by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, the Malais throw it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of earthen veſſels, of different ſhapes, where they allow it to dry and harden. This paſte is wholeſome nouriſhing food, and preſerves for many years.</p>
                     <p>The Indians, in general, when they eat the ſagou, uſe no other preparation than diluting it in water; but ſometimes they dreſs it after different manners: they have the art of ſeparating the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the flower, and reducing it to little grains, ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling grains of rice. The ſagou, thus prepared, is preferred to the other, for the aged and infirm; and is an excellent remedy for many complaints in the ſtomach. When diluted, either in cold or boiling water, it forms a whitiſh jelly, very agreeable to the taſte.</p>
                     <p>Though this ſagou-bearing-palm grows naturally in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, the Malay chiefs have formed conſiderable plantations of it, which conſtitute one of their principal reſources for ſubſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>They might have the fineſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards in the world, would they give themſelves the trouble to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the various plants of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fruits which nature has ſo liberally beſtowed upon them: we find, however, none but a few ſtraggling trees planted at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom around their houſes, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed over their lands without ſymmetry or order.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of the great iſland of Java have ſomewhat better ideas of agriculture, than the other Malais, ſince their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the government of the Dutch. Theſe ſovereign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have taken advantage of the feudal ſyſtem of the Malais, to reduce them under their yoke; artfully weakening the regal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by fomenting, at times, the rebellions of the great vaſſals; and humbling the vaſſals in their turn, by ſuccouring their princes, when drove to the brink of ruin.</p>
                     <p>The Javaneſe begin to recover from that ſtate of anarchy, the conſequence of their ancient laws now almoſt no longer remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They cultivate, with ſucceſs, rice, coffee, indigo, and ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane. They rear, on the eaſtern coaſt of the iſland, and in the diſtricts of Madur and Solor, in the neighbourhood, numerous herds of buffaloes, of a monſtrous ſize; their fleſh is excellent, and they are of infinite uſe in labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground. They have likewiſe numbers of horned cattle, the largeſt and fineſt, perhaps, in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The common paſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in this, and the reſt of the Malay iſlands, is the ſame graſs I have mentioned under the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the iſle of France, which the coloniſts there almoſt entirely neglect.</p>
                     <p>Here it would be proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the manner of cultivating the ſpiceries, the indigo, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-cane, and the camphre; but theſe muſt be the ſubject of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe.

                     <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                     <p>I Laſt year began to give you a ſketch of my inquiries into the ſtate of agriculture among differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nations of Africa and Aſia. I obſerved, that ſcarce a veſtige of it could be traced amongſt the ſtupid, the indolent negroes, who inhabit the weſtern coaſt of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; whilſt it flouriſhed, under the ſhade of liberty, amongſt the Holanders at the Cape of Good Hope. I pointed out the happy abundance which reigned in the fertile iſland of Madagaſcar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by a people governed by the greateſt ſimplicity of manners, and unacquainted with other laws than thoſe of nature. Whilſt I did juſtice alſo to the ſyſtem of cultivation that prevailed at the iſle of Bourbon, which, having no port, and of conſequence little or no intercourſe with Europe, the coloniſts have preſerved an uncorrupted ſyſtem of manners, ever favourable for agriculture, I was at the ſame time, under the neceſſity of acknowledging, that this art, which requires perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſimplicity, was greatly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015853_0036_0F9A2FB24F4CDEC0"/>
neglected at the iſle of France, which, having two excellent ports, and being much frequented by European ſhips, was more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the inconſtant and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile manners of our quarter of the world; and that, in conſequence, though the ſoil, in point of ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, was equal to Madagaſcar and Bourbon; their harveſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally failed, and an almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſcarcity prevailed over the iſland.—I paſſed from thence to the great peninſula of the Indies, where agriculture, however op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the barbarous laws of the Mogul conquerors, is ſtill honoured and ſupported by the religion, the manners, and the perſeverance of the conquered Malabars.—At Siam, under the happieſt climate, and bleſſed with a ſoil inferior in fertility to no country in the world, agriculture we have obſerved debaſed by the indignities of tyranny, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by a race of ſlaves, whom nothing can intereſt, after the loſs of liberty.—I have repreſented it almoſt in the ſame condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Malais, who inhabit immenſe dominions, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable iſlands, where nature has diſtributed her choiceſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and laviſhed her bounties with a profuſion unknown to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regions. The deſtructive genius of the feudal laws, which keep this people in a perpetual ferment, permits not their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the culture of the fineſt ſoil in the world. Nature alone does all. I am convinced, that if the other nations of the earth, who have the miſfortune to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the feudal ſyſtem, inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a climate equally happy, and lands equally fertile with thoſe of the Malais, their agriculture would be equally neglected: neceſſity alone could force the plough into their hands.</p>
                     <p>In my laſt diſcourſe I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to give you an idea of the moſt intereſting modes of local a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture which came under my obſervation: my principal object, however, was to enable you to remark, that in every country, in every quarter of the world, the ſtate of agriculture depends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the eſtabliſhed laws, and, conſequently, on the manners, cuſtoms, and prejudices from which theſe laws derived their origin. I now proceed.</p>

Being a man of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent reflective genius, which ſo characteriſtically marks his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he could not, without pain, behold immenſe tracts of ground condemned to ſterility, though naturally more fertile than thoſe which formed the riches of his own country: he formed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a plan for their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With this view, having firſt of all hired a number of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, ſome Chineſe, others from the neigbouring nations, he, with great addreſs, inſinuated himſelf into the favour of the moſt powerful princes, who, for a certain ſubſidy, aſſigned him a guard for his protection.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of his voyage to Batavia, and the Philippine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, he borrowed from the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans their improvements, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the art of fortification and defence; with regard to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal police, he gave the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Chineſe. The profits of his commerce ſoon enabled him to raiſe ramparts, ſink ditches, and provide artillery. Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary precautions ſecured him from a coup de main, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him from the enterprizes of the ſurrounding nations of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</p>
                     <p>He diſtributed the lands to his labourers, without the leaſt reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any of thoſe duties or taxes known by the names of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or fines of alienation; duties, which by allowing no real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, become the moſt fatal ſcourge to agriculture, and is an idea which revolts againſt the common ſenſe of every wiſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He provided his coloniſts, at the ſame time, with all ſorts of inſtruments proper for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and improvement of their grounds.</p>
                     <p>In forming a labouring and commercial people, he thought, that no laws ought to be framed, but thoſe which nature has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the human race in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very climate: he made theſe laws reſpected by obeying them firſt himſelf, and exhibiting an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſimplicity, induſtry, fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, humanity, and good faith: —he formed, then, no ſyſtem of laws—he did more—he eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed morals.</p>
                     <p>His territories ſoon became the country of every induſtrious man, who wiſhed to ſettle there. The woods were cleared; the grounds judiciouſly labo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The barbarians of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, amazed to ſee abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ſo ſuddenly ſucceed to ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, flocked for ſubſiſtence to the magazines of Ponthiamas; whoſe dominions, at this day, are conſidered as the moſt plentiful granary of that eaſtern party of Aſia; the Malais, the Cochin-chineſe, the Siameſe, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are naturally ſo fertile, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this little territory as the moſt certain reſource againſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>

                     <p>THE Cochin-chineſe, who border on Camboya to the north, obſerving the lands of this kingdom deſolate and abandoned, ſome years ago took poſſeſſion of ſuch tracts as were moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and have there introduced an excellent culture. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Donnay, uſurped in this manner from Camboya, is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the granary of Cochin-china. This kingdom, one of the greateſt in Eaſtern Aſia, about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years ago, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by an inconſiderable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, barbarous and ſavage, known by the name of <hi>Loi,</hi> who, living partly by fiſhing, partly on roots, and the wild fruits of the country, paid little regard to agriculture.</p>
                     <p>A Tonquineſe prince, unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in a war he carried on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the king of Tonquin, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom he enjoyed an office ſomewhat reſembling the maires de palais, under the Merovingian race of the kings of France) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with his ſoldiers and adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents acroſs the river which divides that kingdom from Cochin-china. The ſavages, who then poſſeſſed this country, fled before theſe ſtrangers, and took refuge among the mountains of Tſiampa. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long war with their old ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who purſued them, the Tonquineſe fugitives remained at length peaceable poſſeſſors of the country known under the name of Cochin-china: it extends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred leagues from north to ſouth, but narrow and unequal from eaſt to weſt. Theſe then applied themſelves entirely to the cultivation of rice, which, being the ordinary food of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Aſia, is to them an object of the greateſt importance. They ſeparated into little canton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and eſtabliſhed themſelves on the plains, which extend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the banks of the rivers.</p>
                     <p>The fertility of the ſoil, which had lain long uncultivated, ſoon recompenſed their labours by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance: population increaſed in proportion to the culture; and their cantons extended in ſuch a manner, that all the plains of this vaſt country being put into a ſtate of improvement, they were temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make encroachments on thoſe of Camboya, which were in a manner totally abandoned. I never ſaw any country where the progreſs of population was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable as in Cochin-china, which muſt be attributed not only to the climate, and the fertility of the ſoil, but to the ſimplicity

of their manners, to the prudence and induſtry of the women as well as the men, and to the variety of excellent fiſh, which, with rice, is their ordinary food.</p>

                        <hi>CULTURE</hi> of different Kinds of <hi>RICE</hi> in <hi>COCHIN-CHINA.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Cochin-chineſe culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſix different kinds of rice: the <hi>Little Rice,</hi> the grain of which is ſmall, oblong and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent; that is by far the moſt delicate; it is generally admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered to the ſick: The <hi>Great Long Rice</hi> is that whoſe form is round: The <hi>Red Rice,</hi> ſo called becauſe the grain is enveloped in a huſk of a reddiſh colour, which adheres ſo cloſely, that it requires a very uncommon operation to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it. Theſe three kinds are produced in the greateſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and form the principal ſubſiſtence of the natives. They require water, it being neceſſary to overflow the grounds where they are cultivated.</p>
                     <p>They raiſe alſo two other ſorts of dry rice, which grow in dry foil, and, like our wheat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no other watering but what they receive from the clouds.— One of theſe ſpecies of rice has a grain as white as ſnow; when dreſſed it is of a ſlimy viſcous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; they make of it different kinds of paſte, ſuch as vermicelli. Both theſe kinds form a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able article in their commerce to China. They cultivate them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the mountains and riſing grounds, which they labour with the ſpade. They ſow theſe grains as we do wheat, about the end of December or beginning of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, when the rainy ſeaſon ends: they are not above three months in the ground, and yield a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful crop.</p>
                     <p>I am induced to believe, that the culture of this valuable grain would ſucceed extremely well in France. In the years 1749 and 1750 I often travelled over the mountains of Cochin-china, where this rice is cultivated; they are very high, and the temperature of the air cold: in the month of January, 1750, I obſerved that the rice was very green, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three inches high, although the liquor in Reaumur's thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter was only about four degrees above the freezing point.</p>
                     <p>I carried ſome quintals of this grain to the iſle of France, where it was ſown with ſucceſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a greater crop than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecies. The coloniſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my preſent with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eagerneſs, as, excluſive of its ſuperior increaſe, it has a finer taſte, is attended with leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there being no neceſſity for overflowing the fields; and, as it ripens fifteen or twenty days ſooner than the other kinds, it can be reaped and ſecured before the hurricane ſeaſon, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently makes dreadful havock with their later harv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſts. The other kinds of rice, being of a ſlower growth, require their grounds to be laid under water, after the manner of the Coroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del

                        </note> but our coloniſts pay ſo little attention to agriculture, that they have never hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it.</p>
                     <p>One might have imagined, that the advantages flowing from the cultivation of dry rice, would have engaged the coloniſts to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it with the greateſt care; and that, from the iſle of France, it might have been with eaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Europe: but I have in vain endeavoured to produce it from this iſland; thoſe to whom I have applied, have ſent me only common rice, which demands water and warmth. The culture of dry rice has, like every other ſpecies of agriculture, been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned to the unexperienced ignorance of ſlaves, who have mixed all the different kinds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in ſuch a manner, that the rice of Cochin-china being ripe long before the others, the grains have dropt from the ears before they were reaped, and the ſpecies, in this manner, has been, by degrees entirely loſt in that iſland. Would any traveller, whom buſineſs or curioſity might lead to Cochin-china, ſend over but a few pounds of this excellent grain, he would deſerve our warmeſt acknowledgements.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin chineſe cultivate the common rice nearly in the ſame manner with the Malabars on the Coromandel coaſt. After having twice ploughed their ground, they ſow the rice in a little field which has been well laboured with the ſpade; the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of this little field they juſt cover with water, to the height only of a few lines; and as ſoon as the rice is about five or ſix inches high, they harrow over their large fields, and overflow them with water; then pulling up the rice plants in the ſeed plots, tranſplant them into theſe grounds thus prepared, in ſmall parcels of four or five ſtalks, about the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſix inches the one from the other. Women and children are generally employed in this work.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineſe have no machine for overflowing their grounds, nor have they any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: their plains, from one end of the kingdom to the other, are commanded by a chain of high mountains, plentifully ſupplied with ſprings and rivulets, which naturally overflow the grounds, according as their courſe is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                     <p>They cultivate likewiſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds of grain, ſuch as the mahis, millets of different ſorts, ſeveral ſpecies of the French bean, potatoes, yams, and a variety of roots proper for the ſubſiſtence of men and animals. But the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of moſt important advantage to them, next to the rice, is the ſugar cane; and no country in Aſia produces it in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance than Cochin-china.</p>

                     <head>SUGAR-CANES.</head>
                     <p>THE ſugar-canes of this country are of two kinds; the firſt grows thick and tall, the joints at a conſiderable diſtance from one another, the colour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways green, the juice abundant, with very little of the ſalt in it. This ſpecies of cane is in general uſe for feeding and fattening of cattle; and experience teaches them, that no kind of food fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ſooner or better the human ſpecies, as well as animals, than this ſugar cane, eat while green, and the ſugar which is extracted from it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſpecies is ſmaller in every reſpect, with its joints approaching nearer together:— when ripe it aſſumes a yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and contains leſs water, and more ſalt, than the other.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineſe, when preparing the ground for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-cane, turn it up to the depth of two feet; this operation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a plank. They then plant joints or eyes of the cane, three and three together, in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal poſition, in the ſame manner almoſt as they plant vines in ſeveral provinces of France— Theſe ſlips are planted ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe about eighteen inches deep in the ground, diſtant ſix feet from one another; this operation they perform near the end of the rainy ſeaſon, in order that the ſlips may be ſufficiently watered, till ſuch time as they have taken root. During the firſt ſix months, they give them two dreſſings with a kind of pick-axe, in order to deſtroy the weeds, and preſerve a moiſture about the roots of the canes, by heaping the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them.</p>
                     <p>Twelve and ſometimes fourteen months after the plantation, they gather the firſt crop. By this time the canes, though planted at the diſtance of ſix feet, become ſo buſhy that it is impoſſible to enter the field, without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a hatchet to clear your way.</p>
                     <p>The canes being cut, and tied up into bundles, are carried to their mills, in order to extract their juice. I ſhall not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the form of theſe machines, which reſemble in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thoſe of the Weſt-Indies:— inſtead of water, they employ horned cattle or mules to ſet in motion the two cylinders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which the ſugar canes are preſſed. Theſe engines have been deſcribed by numbers of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
                     <p>The juice being extracted, they boil it ſome hours in large kettles, in order to evaporate part of its water: it is then tranſported to the neighbouring market, and ſold in that condition. Here ends the induſtry and the profits of the Cochin chineſe planter.— The merchants purchaſe the juice, which reſembles pure water; they boil it again, throwing into the kettles ſome alkaline ſubſtance, ſuch as the aſhes of the leaves of the muſa or bananier, and ſhell-lime; they are acquainted with no other; theſe ingredients throw up a thick ſcum, which the refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er carefully ſkims off; the action of the alkali haſtens the ſeparation of the ſalt from the water, and,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015853_0043_0F9A2FB78FBDD4B8"/>
by the force of ebullition, reduces the juice of the cane to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of ſyrup. As ſoon as this ſyrup begins to granulate, they decant it into a great earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, where they cool it about an hour; when a kind of cruſt, ſtill ſoft, and of a yellowiſh colour, appeals on the ſurface of the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup; they loſe not a moment then to empty it into a veſſel of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic ſhape, which they call a <hi>form.</hi> Without this intermediate opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cooling the ſyrup, it would harden into a maſs, and not being granulated, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently want one eſſential qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſugar.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſugar-cones, or forms in Cochin-china are, like thoſe of our Weſt-India colonies, of baked earth, about three feet high, pierced at their narrow extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and contain in general about forty or fifty pounds of ſugar.— Theſe <hi>forms,</hi> when full, are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on another earthen veſſel, the mouth of which is proportioned to receive the narrow end of the cone, and muſt be large enough to contain the coarſe ſyrup, which diſtils from the ſugar, through ſome ſtraw which imperfectly ſtops up the little opening in the bottom of the <hi>form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they ſuppoſe the ſyrup has acquired the conſiſtence of ſalt in every part of the cone, they then proceed to whiten and purify it. They dilute, in a trough, a fine ſort of whitiſh clay, with ſuch a quantity of water as, when thus prepared, prevents it from having too much conſiſtence; with a truel they then lay it upon the ſurface of the ſugar to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of about two inches, in the void ſpace left at the top of the form by the condenſing of the ſugar, after purging itſelf of the coarſer ſyrup or melaſſes. The water contained in the clay pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating by degrees into the maſs, waſhes it, and carries off inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the remaining ſyrup, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very foreign particle that adheres moſt cloſely to the ſugar. When the clay hardens, they replace it with a freſh quantity, diluted as the firſt: This operation, which laſts about twelve or fifteen days, is the ſame here as in our Weſt-India colonies. Some refiners of Cochin-china, however, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother method. In place of clay, tempered thus with water, they cut into ſmall pieces the trunk of the muſa or bananier, which they place upon the ſugar: The trunk of this tree is very watery; the water of a detergent quality; and diſtils from the fibres, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velope it, in very ſmall drops.— Thoſe who follow this method pretend, that the operation is thereby rendered leſs tedious, and that the ſugar acquires a finer colour.</p>
                     <p>The proceſs of the Cochin-chineſe, in refining their ſugar, goes no further: They are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtoves in uſe in the Weſt-Indies. After having clayed their ſugars ſufficiently, they ſell them in the public mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, particularly to the Chineſe, and other ſtrangers, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to their ports by the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate price of this commodity, which is cheaper at Cochin-china than any where in India.</p>
                     <p>The white ſugar of the beſt quality is generally ſold at the port of Faiſo, in exchange for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther merchandize, at the rate of three piaſtres (about fourteen ſhillings) the Cochin-china quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which weighs from one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

and fifty to two hundred pounds French.<note n="†" place="margin">Ninety one pounds eight ounces French make one hundred pounds Engliſh.</note> The trade in this commodity is immenſe.— The Chineſe alone, whoſe lands do not produce enough for their own conſumpt, purchaſe annually from Cochin-china about forty thouſand barrels, weighing about two thouſand pounds per barrel.</p>
                     <p>This country, it ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which produces this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity in ſuch abundance, and at ſo low a price, being a new king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ought to be conſidered, in ſome meaſure, as a colony: it is worthy obſervation too, that the ſugar-cane is there cultivated by free men, and all the proceſs of preparation and refining, the work of free hands. Compare then the price of the Cochin-chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe production with the ſame commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretched ſlaves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure ſugar from our colonies, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to authorize by law the ſlavery of the unhappy Africans tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to America. From what I have obſerved at Cochin-china, I cannot entertain a doubt, but that our Weſt-India colonies, had they been diſtributed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation amongſt a free people, would have produced double the quantity that is now procured from the labour of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate negroes.</p>
                     <p>What advantage, then, has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to Europe, civilized as it is, and thoroughly verſed in the laws of nature, and the rights of mankind, by legally authoriſing in our colonies the daily outrages againſt human nature, permitting them to debaſe man almoſt below the level of the beaſts of the field? Theſe ſlaviſh laws have proved as oppoſite to its intereſt as they are to its honour, and to the laws of humanity. This remark I have often made.</p>
                     <p>Liberty and property form the baſis of abundance, and good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture: I never obſerved it to flouriſh where thoſe rights of mankind were not firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. The earth, which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies her productions with a kind of profuſion, under the hands of the free-born labourer, ſeems to ſhrink into barrenneſs under the ſweat of the ſlave. Such is the will of the great author of our nature, who has created man free, and aſſigned to him the earth, that he might cultivate his poſſeſſion with the ſweat of his brow; but ſtill ſhould enjoy his liberty.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineſe, excluſive of the ſugar-cane, employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the culture of a variety of other productions, of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance both to their interior fabrics, and external commerce.</p>
                     <p>They cultivate the cotton-tree, the mulberry, the pepper, the varniſh-tree, the date, the tea, the indigo, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This plant would undoubtedly be a moſt valuable preſent to our Weſt-India colonies.</p>

                     <p>The ſoil, in general, of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin-china, is excellent, and they cultivate it well. Their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in general are fallow, as population is not even ſufficiently conſiderable for the cultivation of all the plain grounds they have taken poſſeſſion of in Camboya: Theſe mountains produce, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the eagle or aloe-wood, which is the moſt precious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume in the world; the ſapan-wood, the ſame with that of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil; and the cinnamon, in ſmall quantities indeed, but much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in quality to that of Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—The Chineſe pay three or four times more for it than for that which the Dutch import from that iſland. They have ſeveral ſorts likewiſe of admirable wood for joyner and cabinet work, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the roſe wood; the tea-wood is excellent for building, and is preferred to all others in the conſtruction of the royal gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, having every pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains alſo, and from the foreſts with which they are covered, they procure ivory, muſk, wax, iron, and gold in great abundance — Theſe mountains too are full of game, ſuch as deer, antelopes, wild goats, peacocks pheaſants, &amp;c. The chace is free to all, but dangerous from the number of tygers, elephants, rhinoceros, and other carnivorous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive animals, with which the foreſts abound.</p>
                     <p>The ſea, which waſhes their coaſts, as well as the rivers, are well ſupplied with excellent fiſh. Every one has the liberty of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in this the Cochin-chineſe take great delight. I have already obſerved, that they live chiefly on fiſh and rice.</p>
                     <p>Their domeſtic animals are, the horſe for the road, the buffalo for labour, and the cow, the hog, the goat, the gooſe, the duck, and hens of various kinds, for the table. Theſe animals thrive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well, and are in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. The king alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to himſelf the excluſive right of breeding elephants for the war; and this is a reſervation which no man envies him. He maintains generally four hundred of them: he could maintain four thouſand men at a much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. The Cochin-chineſe have few good fruits; the pine apple, and oranges of different kinds, are the beſt their country produces. They do not cultivate the vine, though it is one of the native pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of their lands. They are but indifferently provided with pulſe. In a word, their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards and their gardens are very inconſiderable.—They attach themſelves to the more eſſential branches of agriculture.</p>
                     <p>Although this art is not yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at that degree of perfection in Cochin-China, to which it might be carried, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſuch an excellent ſoil, yet the manners of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very favourable, it flouriſhes greatly. The Cochin-chineſe are gentle, hoſpitable, frugal, and induſtrious. There is not a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in the country; and robbery and murder abſolutely unknown.

This wiſe maxim is fixed in the breaſt of every Chineſe; and, with this people ſo open to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he who pronounces a wiſe maxim pronounces a law.</p>
                     <p>Behold, gentlemen, a ſlight ſketch of the general picture of Chineſe agriculture, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar genius of that people for this art.

not in obſcure codes, deviſed by chicanery and deceit.—In a word, China owes the proſperity of her agriculture to the ſimplicity of her manners, and to her laws, which are the laws of nature and reaſon.</p>
                     <p>This empire was founded by labourers, in thoſe happy times when the laws of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor were ſtill held in remembrance and the culture of the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the nobleſt of all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the moſt worthy of mankind, and the general occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of all.

                     <head>Ceremony of opening the Grounds.</head>
                     <p>ON the fifteenth day of the firſt moon, in every year, which generally correſponds to the beginning of March, the emperor in perſon performs the ceremony of opening the grounds. This prince, in great pomp, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the field appointed for the ceremony: the princes of the imperial family, the preſidents of the five great tribunals, and an infinite number of mandarins ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him. Two ſides of the field are occupied by the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's officers, and guards; the third is allotted for all the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the province, who repair thither to behold their art ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and practiſed by the head of their empire; the fourth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the mandarins.</p>
                     <p>The emperor enters the field alone, proſtrates himſelf, and nine times ſtrikes his head againſt the ground, in adoration of <hi>Tien,</hi> the God of heaven; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, with a loud voice, a prayer appointed by the tribunal of rites, invoking the bleſſing of the almighty ſovereign on his labour, and on the labour of his people, who form his family; he then, in quality of ſovereign pontiff of the empire, ſacrifices a bullock, which he offers up to heaven, as the ſource of every bleſſing: whilſt they cut the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim in pieces, and place them on the altar, they bring to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror a plough, in which are yoked a pair of bullocks, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently adorned. The empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror then, laying aſide his royal robes, takes hold of the handle of the plough, and turns up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral furrows the whole length of the field; then, with a complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant air, having delivered the plough to the mandarins, they ſucceſſively follow his example, emulating one another in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this honourable labour with the greateſt dexterity. The ceremony concludes with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of money, and pieces of ſtuff, among the labourers there preſent; the moſt active of whom finiſh the remaining labour, in preſence of the emperor, with great agility and addreſs.</p>
                     <p>Some time after, when they have ſufficiently laboured and manured their grounds, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror repairs again, in proceſſion, and begins the ſowing of the field, always accompanied with ceremony, and attended by the labourers of the province.</p>
                     <p>The ſame ceremonies are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, on the ſame days, in all the provinces of the empire, by the viceroys, aſſiſted by all the magiſtrates of their departments, in preſence of a great number of the labourers of their reſpective provinces. I have ſeen this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the grounds at Canton, and never remember to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held any of the ceremonies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by men, with half the pleaſure and ſatisfaction with which I obſerved this.</p>

                     <p>THE vaſt continent of Aſia offers to your conſideration in one quarter, an immenſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated region, peopled by a race of banditti, more intent on plunder than the cultivation of their grounds; in another, a great empire, formerly flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and excellently laboured, now inhabited by the poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of a wretched people, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing with hunger from the neglect of agriculture, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their blood, not for liberty, but for a change of tyrants — This charming fertile quarter of the world (the cradle of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race) now beholds her lands in ſlavery, her labourers in chains, ſubjected either to the blind deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm of unfeeling tyrants, or the deſtructive yoke of the feudal ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>But turn your eyes to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extremity of the Aſiatic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, inhabited by the Chineſe, and there you will conceive a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing idea of the happineſs the world might enjoy, were the laws of this empire the model of thoſe of other countries.
