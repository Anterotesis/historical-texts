            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WE are now assembled to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the most splendid era that graces the annals of nations: An era, the recollection of which kindles up a laudable and lively ardour in the breasts of patriots. Ever since the memory of man, most nations have distinguished certain epochas commemorative of great events. The object of this assembly is not to celebrate the natal day of a powerful monarch, at whose feet we supine ourselves with base humility; not to bear in mind the many victims which have been immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, to satisfy the thirst of regal ambition; but to water with our tears the laurels that decorate the tombs of our ancestors, to rejoice in liberty, and to hail the birth-day of our national inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. The celebration of this day, like the tattered ensign which has survived the battles of our fathers, brings to our recollection the miseries of foreign subjugation, inspires us with military ardour, unites with a magic power the sons of freedom, and vibrates her energies in the bosoms of Americans. Already, on similar occasions, has the tongue of the orator bestowed all the tropes of eloquence, and the pen of the poet lavished all the flights of fancy upon the splendour of American victories. The heroes who bled in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033452_0003_0FF72F46E962C9A0"/>
our revolutionary war, have been sung by our bards in the highest strains of panegyric. But on this anniversary, new scenes arise in our political hemisphere. Twelve months seldom produce a greater change in the political sentiments of any nation, than that which the events of the same period have produced in America. Let us pass over, but not forget, the deeds of former times, and take a short survey of the causes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this great revolution in our bosoms.</p>
            <p>Twenty two revolving years have now elapsed, since the sun of freedom arose in majesty on this western world. When he first appeared above the horizon, his beams, like those of yonder brilliant luminary, at times were encircled with vapour and smoke; but his lustre increased in full proportion to his ascent. We pursued him in his refulgent career, until every cloud was lost in his brightness. We beheld him diffusing life, and splendour, and joy, over four millions of people. Since the termination of the late Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can war, the United States have attracted the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of all nations. Our profitable commerce has whitened our coasts with the canvass of the world. The tree of liberty, planted by the hand of GOD himself, cherished by our ancestors, and watered with their blood—that tree whose branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es shade the Union, has invited the oppressed from all quarters of the globe, and with them some turbulent and factious spirits, who never can rest under <hi>any government,</hi> have been admitted. "<hi>Hinc ille mali labes</hi>"—hence part of our misfortunes— they are not only admitted, but join our public councils. Such is the incautious benignity of our laws! No tyrant here sways the iron sceptre of uncontrouled dominion. Our Constitution
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033452_0004_0FF72F6409557B08"/>
and Government are founded on the immutable principles of justice, and our laws display mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their composition, and inflexibility in their execution. Their influence, like the light of Heaven, spreads equally on all distinctions of men. This happy condition of our country has raised her high on the rolls of fame. Her brilliancy lights up the countenance, and her imposing majesty commands veneration.</p>
            <p>Nations and individuals are governed by the self-same principles of action. Impartiality, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, honour and virtue, have ever been the striking characteristics of the United States, in their intercourse with foreign nations. In no instance can they be charged with a violation of any of these great and fundamental principles of justice and policy. Whenever misunderstandings have prevailed, they have always hitherto, one instance excepted, been adjusted by amicable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. Since the commencement of the wonderful convulsions which at this moment agitate all Europe to its centre, the situation of the United States has been truly alarming. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that nation from whom we once boasted that our ancestors descended, has committed depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations on our commerce. Jealous of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, from that strong attachment which at the commencement of the French revolution seemed to have bound us to France by an inseparable connexion, and stung with the remembrance of former resentments, she attempted the disturbance of the tranquility and repose of this country. Every action which wore the least appearance of partiality towards France increased her jealousy, and sharpened the dagger of her resentment. But the great event we now celebrate, and the pure
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033452_0005_0FF72F756F2BE998"/>
and unconquerable spirit of united America, have taught her the useful lesson, that we are, and will be, free and independent.</p>
            <p>Had France been equally rational and docile, our friendship with her might have still subsisted. But she spurned the olive-branch which we held out to all nations, and which England, Spain, and many other powers, have thought it an honour to accept.</p>
            <p>The French revolution, that great system, burst forth so suddenly, and with such a glare of novelty, that the eyes of mankind were dazzled with its beams. America beheld the spectacle with astonishment, and was for a time fascinated with the striking but deceptive colours which glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the eyes of a deluded imagination. At this period France solemnly proclaimed to the world that a free Constitution was her object, and that liberty and equality, or the rights of man, were the pole-star of her conduct. Firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the sincerity of <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his declaration, American hearts triumphed at the glory of her victories. Blinded with the false glare of her professions, and with a strong sense of obligation to a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try whose rulers had been our friends, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored Heaven that conquest might attend her arms. But these enchanting scenes, these "<hi>base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less fabrics of a vision,</hi>"
which so enraptured Americans, are dissolved, and, like a beautiful frost-work, melted into nothing. Our fondest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, the tender leaves of hope, were blasted by the mildews of faction and anarchy. Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for novelty, though in some degree com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, is particularly characteristic of the French nation. The merits of that political fabric, by revolutionary demoniacs in France
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033452_0006_0FF72F9239D2F2B0"/>
called a Constitution, were to be decided, not by the unbiassed determination of the people, but they were compelled to admire and adore it with the bayonet at their breasts. While the people of France were enraptured with this new political prodigy, their iniquities were confined within their own territories. The bloody massacre of their King and Queen, of their men of honour, of genius, of virtue, of science, of morality and of religion, was but the commencement of the awful tragedy of wicked rapacity and legalized murder. The charm of novelty was however soon dissipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the thirst for domination and power still remained. Intoxicated with ambition, they viewed the rising interests of their neighbours with suspicion. Their envy excited schemes of innovation, inconsistent with their own pretended Constitution and the rights of the people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the laws of nations, and repugnant to the eternal principles of humanity, justice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. What part of their Constitution, or what rights of the people, authorized them to confine thousands, without even the forms of trials, in dungeons, or to stretch them on the scaffold of judicial murder? Where were the laws of nations, when they invaded Holland, and displaced the Stadtholder? When they penetrated Italy, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugated her provinces, erected their military governments, and reduced a flourishing country to a heap of ruins? When they assaulted the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and unoffending Cantons of Switzerland? When they piratically invaded the commerce of America? Where was their humanity, when they countenanced wild and savage tumult to prowl about the streets of their mighty metropolis? When they massacred universally, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033452_0007_0FF72FA027104E20"/>
of age or sex? When the smoke of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages darkened the face of Heaven? Where was their religion, when even the house of GOD was polluted by their crimes, and by their sacrilege the tomb itself was no refuge from their violence? Where was their justice, when, after pillag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost to annihilation the trade of the United States, they demanded of them upwards of FIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, merely for the purchase of <hi>common civility?</hi> This is their boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberty and equality! How opposite in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to American freedom, that emanation from Heaven, which sublimes our souls, and which is interwoven with the very web of our existence. An enthusiastic people, struggling for universal empire, and the subjugation of the world, is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed in lively colours in every feature of French politics. While France pursued rational liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we rejoiced in the glory of her arms; but when she lost sight of her first object, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued a phantom—when she deluged the world with blood, we lamented her departure from the paths of political integrity. The paroxysm of this revolutionary fever in France, has produced atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities sufficient to "<hi>harrow up our souls</hi>" with indignation, and
"<hi>to curdle the blood in our veins.</hi>"
Liberty has been prophaned, humanity has been outraged. True liberty, the daughter and best gift of Heaven, is inseparable from virtue, from science, from morality, and from all the tender ties of social life. To preserve our Constitution and government entire, is our united object.—Amidst all the violent convulsions produced by the French revolution, America has preserved a firm and unshaken neutrality. Notwithstanding the bold clamours of malevolence, and the sly insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033452_0008_0FF72F58299E30A8"/>
of intrigue, America has never departed from the great principles of national justice, integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and honour, or violated the solemn faith of national compacts. We have not only suffered great injuries from the hands of France, but we have been treated with the grossest insult, and most supercilious contempt. All this we have borne with calm dignity, and unabated resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She was sensible of our attachment to her, and availed herself of it. She let loose her arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vessels, like tygers, to prey upon our defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less commerce, while she hypocritically courted our friendship. Little did we think that the smile of friendship on the face, veiled the canker of malice at the heart. No pretext has been omitted to plunder our property, and to insult the majesty of the nation. Her ships of war, for robbery and plunder, have approached within the very bodies of our counties. To adjust these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, ministers, clothed with full powers for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, were dispatched from the United States to France. The effects of this embassy are too well known to require any comment. Methinks I see indignation flash in your countenances, and the American blood boil in your veins, while I mention the subject. Upwards of FIFTEEN MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIONS OF DOLLARS have been demanded of us, merely as the price of <hi>an audience</hi> with five exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable tyrants. These are the fruits of French liberty. Will you, my countrymen, ingloriously submit to these base requisitions? Will you tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surrender your independence into hands pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with robbery and with murder? Will you hear the yoke and the scour<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">

The number and the spirit of the address<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which, on the disclosure of the base designs of that haughty republic, have been presented to our Executive from all quarters of the Union, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, with emphasis, the feelings of our cit<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

"at least receive <hi>one volley,</hi> before we throw down our arms."  The very term in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of which it is our pride to boast, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an entire separation from dependence on a connexion with any power or nation on earth for protection, when the existence of our country is endangered. Let us neither grovel at the feet of the French republic, nor cringe to the monarchy of England; but firmly repeat, what our great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors in the face of Heaven declared, "that we are, and of right ought to be, a free, sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and independent people." Weak and timorous debates no longer degrade our national councils. In this common danger, all party contests sink into oblivion; and whilst our una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity remains firm and decided, I trust our strength will remain irresistible. From St. Croix to St. Mary's, but one voice, the voice of firmness to support our government, and to oppose the vile machinations of an insidious foe, echoes from the people—while the genius of our country cries, "<hi>To arms! to arms!</hi>"</p>
            <p>Here let us pause a moment, to indulge that sense of gratitude which we feel towards the great Executive of our nation. The blessings of peace induced him to make every overture, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with all the requisitions which were consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
