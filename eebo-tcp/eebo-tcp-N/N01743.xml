            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Author being desired by several Gentlemen to Communicate the following Piece of <hi>Natural History</hi> to the Publick, He takes the Opportunity to gratify them upon the Repetition of something like it in ENGLAND on the 19th of <hi>March</hi> last: Especially considering that <hi>Our Country</hi> has not yet been duly informed of this rare <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi> tho' it was observ'd &amp; admir'd almost all over EUROPE: And tho' Dr. HALLEY in the <hi>Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Royal Society,</hi> &amp; Mr. WHISTON in a Piece by it self have wrote on the Subject; yet an Account so Particular by any single Eye-Witness has not yet been divulged to the World.</p>
            <p>IT lies in His <hi>Journal</hi> in a Letter to his Kinsman in LONDON, who Communicated it to Dr. HALLEY aforesaid the Renowned &amp; Learned <hi>Savilian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi> of the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> in the University of OXFORD; Who did Me the Honour to signify that He was so Pleased with the Relation, as He had Thoughts of Printing it Himself with His Remarks on the Subject. I suppose the coming out of Mr. WHISTON'S Account was a reason of Preventing Him.</p>

               <salute>DEAR COUSIN,</salute>
               <dateline>COMBS, <date>

            <p>THIS is to give You an exact Account as possible, of a most amazing <hi>Appearance in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> which I myself with all the Town of STOW-MARKET, beheld for above Half an Hour together, on the last <hi>Tuesday Night</hi> between 7 and 8 of the Clock.</p>
            <p>I WAS then occasionally at the Town aforesaid which is about 2 Miles off the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002068_0004_0FBB792F830C9808"/>
House where I live, and in Company with several Ladies discoursing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Face of the Publick Affairs. We had just been Reading in one of the News Papers of <hi>Sea Monsters</hi> lately observ'd in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean:</hi> &amp; one of the Company told us Her Husband bro't a Report from NORWICH of a wonderful <hi>Sight in the Air</hi> seen over the City 2 or 3 Nights ago. This sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation led some of the Elder of them into a Relation of such kind of Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces They had heard their Parents or other People speak of, as happening in ENGLAND a little before the <hi>Civil War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN Opposition to This I very freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed with some uncommon degree of Warmth &amp; Assurance; Attributing such Things as Those to the fertile Tongues &amp; Inventions of some Romantick People, &amp; the fanciful &amp; fearful Imagination of others. When I was almost rude in Depreciating the Stories &amp; Opinions of the Ladies; a little Girl came running in a Fright to tell us, <hi>There was a Great Sight in the Air.</hi> Upon this observing them to listen with some Concern &amp; Fear, I confess I coud'nt forbare Laughing easily, &amp; telling them in some sort of Triumph; <hi>I Believ'd it was
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002068_0005_0FBB793313855468"/>
from the Whimsies of such little Gi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> as these that such Reports &amp; Apparitions arose.</hi> However, To oblige the Gentlewomen, I went out, which was about <hi>a Quarter after Seven,</hi> &amp; was forc'd immediately to fall a Sacrifice to what I then at least thought to be their more Orthodox Judgment. <hi>Heaven itself</hi> seem'd to undertake their Argument &amp; to prove it in so surprizing &amp; evident a manner that I dare not any longer resist them. I saw what I cou'd never have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined before, and what I believe is utterly impossible for me to represent exactly to your Imagination.</p>
            <p>THERE seemed to be <hi>a great Stream of smoakey Light</hi> rising in the N.E, reaching from near the Earth, ascending &amp; waving like the Light of a great House or <hi>Bon-fire</hi> in a dark Evening about half a Mile off, which we therefore tho't it at first to be: But soon alter'd our minds when we saw it increasing in Breadth Length &amp; Brightness, &amp; pushing forwards, retreating &amp; advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the shape of a <hi>Broad Sword</hi> &amp; like the shooting Vibrations of a very high Blaze, until it extended to the Point over our Heads. As it increased in Bigness, so did it likewise in the Swiftness &amp; Fury of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002068_0006_0FBB7934DC2DC690"/>
its Motion &amp; grew by Degrees into a blewish, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; fiery Colour, almost like to that of the Flame of <hi>Brimstone.</hi> Both the Colour &amp; Figure continually changed I know not how, 'till at length on a sudden it brake forth into the Appearance of a raging &amp; mighty <hi>Torrent</hi> of bloudy Waters, that at first look'd like the sudden giving way of a Damm, &amp; the Sea bearing all irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly before it: Whereupon all that Part of the <hi>Heavens</hi> over us turned of an inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bright <hi>Rainbow</hi> Colour, &amp; immediately run into an admirable, inexpressible Confusion of an infinite <hi>Variety of Motions</hi> that were amazingly quick and terrible to behold.</p>
            <p>I KNOW not how to give you an <hi>Idea</hi> of this part of the Appearance; unless you may conceive something of it by the various &amp; most violent Motions that are in a <hi>great Body of Waters,</hi> when an higher Stream hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to descend and impetuously rush into another. Sometimes they ran into <hi>Circular</hi> Forms, sometimes into <hi>Ovals,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Circles</hi> &amp; <hi>Ovals</hi> were vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously compress'd on their sides by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer to one another, or the greater <hi>Interflux</hi> of the nameless &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002068_0007_0FBB793647533A98"/>
known Matter. Sometimes th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within &amp; hastily pursuing one another in the manner of <hi>Whirlpools,</hi> &amp; sometimes they ran round &amp; cross'd like an 8, &amp; in numberless other different Figures; that something resembl'd the various, quick &amp; confus'd Rambles of <hi>Flies</hi> in the midst of a Room, or of <hi>Spiders</hi> on the surface of a Pond; or the perplexing Contortions &amp; Turnings of a great Heap of <hi>living Eels</hi> just cover'd with Water in the bottom of a Boat; or as the little Foldings &amp; Ridges at the Tops &amp; Bottoms of the <hi>Fingers;</hi> or to mention no more Comparisons, like the Figures it is probable you have seen of CARTESIUS'S <hi>Vortices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL this while, the Brightness, Bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness &amp; Fieryness of the Colours before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd together with the Swiftness of the Motions increased, insomuch as we could hardly trace them with our Eyes; 'till at length almost all the whole <hi>Heavens</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd as if they were set <hi>on a Flame,</hi> which wrought &amp; glimmer'd with <hi>Flashes</hi> in a most dreadful &amp; undescribable manner. It seem'd to threaten us with an immediate Descent &amp; <hi>Deluge of Fire,</hi> filled the Streets with loud &amp; doleful Outcries &amp; Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; frighted a great many People into
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002068_0008_0FBB7938FAEEA3B0"/>
their H<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; we all began to think whither the SON OF GOD was next to make His Glorious &amp; Terrible Appearance, or the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the World was now begun. For the <hi>Elements</hi> seem'd just as if they were melting with fervent Heat, &amp; the <hi>AEtherial Vault</hi> to be burning over us like the fierce Agitations of the Blaze in a <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> or at the Top of a fiery <hi>Oven:</hi> &amp; the glimmering Light look'd as if it proceeded from a <hi>more Glorious Body behind</hi> that was approaching nearer &amp; about to make its sudden Appearance to our Eyes.</p>
            <p>WHILE we expected &amp; wondred what wou'd be the next Alteration &amp; dreaded the Consequence; all on a sudden the flaming Body above us brake into <hi>innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Spears of Light,</hi> that at first darted every way &amp; a-cross one another, but in a little while they conformed to the same Point of Motion &amp; played in a regular &amp; astonishing manner. At first it seem'd as if the very <hi>Frame of the World was a Dissolving:</hi> But afterwards one wou'd have thought that there was a furious <hi>Battle of Invisible Spirits,</hi> that <hi>the Powers &amp; Principalities of the Air</hi> had broke out into a fierce Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; that transforming themselves into
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002068_0009_0FBB793A2FF947D0"/>
               <hi>Angels of Light</hi> They were con<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ted into <hi>Seraphick Flames</hi> &amp; Figures that are said to resemble their Natures.</p>
            <p>THESE distinct &amp; various Lights were in the shape of Swords, &amp; their several Bodies did not appear intirely at the same Time, but seem'd to begin at one End &amp; shoot a prodigious way to a sharp Point in a moment, like one continued Blaze of a <hi>flying Fire-Brand.</hi> As they continually appear'd &amp; stream'd, so they continually vanish'd, like the lucid <hi>Path of a Rocket,</hi> while others were incessantly making their Appearance in different Places round about. The Motion of them all was now pointed <hi>Upwards,</hi> &amp; reached some a greater &amp; some a lesser extent: But none above more than from about 8 or 10 Degrees of the <hi>Horizon</hi> to about 6 or 8 from the <hi>Zenith.</hi> For the most part they flashed unequally: But sometimes they seem'd to begin, shoot &amp; blaze all together &amp; made the Earth almost as light as Day. And then their Appearance was like a Thousand Glittering Swords or <hi>Blazing Stars</hi> shooting upwards from all sides of the <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> but leaving where their Points ended a vacant Space in the <hi>Center</hi> of about 10 or 12
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002068_0010_0FBB793E03299DB8"/>
Degrees <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>eter,</hi> &amp; sometimes of a roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish &amp; sometimes of various multangular Figures, directly over our Heads. For there seem'd to be a remarkable Part of the <hi>Heavens</hi> above us which they all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently push'd at, but cou'd never enter.</p>
            <p>THUS they continu'd their Exercise for about <hi>a Quarter of an Hour,</hi> but Decreased by Degrees both in Number, Quickness &amp; Brightness till they left the <hi>Heavens</hi> as they were before, &amp; indeed all the Time of this amazing Appearance almost as <hi>Clear</hi> I think as ever I saw them. It was the more unaccountable &amp; wonderful that there was no palpable Cloud hung over us: But we saw the <hi>Stars shining</hi> very plainly all the while in the Intervals of the Spears &amp; in the very Places where they were, as soon as ever they vanish'd; unless when the Brightness of the Apparition was so excessive as to drown their Light.</p>
            <p>AFTER the <hi>Scene</hi> was over, which was a little before 8 of the Clock, there was ev'ry now &amp; then a single Flash or Streak or 2 of Light as before in divers Parts of the clear <hi>Firmament,</hi> &amp; some of these retain'd their Appearance for above the

Length of <hi>a Minute,</hi> which none of the other did ever reach near unto: But as the Light of these was always considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fainter, so they proportionably conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued longer before they intirely vanish'd.</p>
            <p>I THEN walked with a Gentleman out of the Town &amp; went up on a Rising Ground, whence we saw a <hi>thick &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Cloud</hi> directly in the <hi>North,</hi> &amp; very near the <hi>Horizon</hi> if not adjoining to it, that appear'd exactly as if the <hi>Full Moon</hi> was behind it, which was not to rise till after <hi>Mid-night,</hi> &amp; that we suppos'd to be the <hi>Scource &amp; Mine-head</hi> of all this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Train &amp; <hi>Fire-work of Nature.</hi> Ev'ry now &amp; then we saw <hi>Beams of Light</hi> issuing from it, somewhat like, but brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than those we often see from the <hi>Sun</hi> thro' the <hi>Crevices</hi> of a dark &amp; broken Cloud, that made it to resemble the <hi>Royal Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery</hi> of Pikes, Spears &amp; Swords &amp; other Armour that are commonly plac'd under the <hi>Kings Picture.</hi> And as the Cloud arose the Streams increas'd &amp; flashed towards us, &amp; we thought the <hi>Aerial Armies</hi> were going to rally &amp; make another onset: But they retreated again, as the Cloud passed on by the <hi>Borders</hi> of the <hi>Horizon</hi> to the

               <hi>West</hi> &amp; slowly moved to a greater Distance from us.</p>
            <p>BY the Brightness of the <hi>Fiery Pillars</hi> &amp; the strange Illumination of the Air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, I came home a foot about 10 of the Clock, when the Ground &amp; Heavens were every whit I think as light as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after <hi>Sun-set.</hi> I sat up &amp; watched till 3 in the <hi>Morning</hi> when I could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern nothing more of them: But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd very visible till between 1 &amp; 2; when the <hi>Heavens</hi> began to be <hi>overspread</hi> with Clouds, &amp; the <hi>Moon arose,</hi> which put a gradual <hi>End</hi> to this real &amp; most incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible <hi>Vision.</hi>

            <p>THUS have I given you a bare, &amp; I'm pretty sure an exact Historical Relation of Things as I saw them.

I SHALL only take Notice, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we consider the Part of the <hi>Natural Day,</hi> the Time of the <hi>Night,</hi> the State of the <hi>Sky,</hi> the Place of the <hi>Moon</hi> or the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Year;</hi> It was on all Accounts most conveniently suited &amp; order'd, &amp; therefore very plainly seems to be designed by PROVIDENCE for a general Observation &amp; Terrour.

            <p>I SHALL Conclude with telling you, that at the Beginning, Rise &amp; Hight of this Apparition, I cou'd not sometimes forbear imagining, that Mr. WHISTON'S <hi>Hypothesis</hi> was coming to pass, &amp; that the Train of a <hi>Burning Comet</hi> was then a seizing on this Terrestial World.
