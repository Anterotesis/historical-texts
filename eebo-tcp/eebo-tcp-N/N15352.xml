            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>woful</hi> practice of calling evil good, and good evil; of putting dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for light, and light for darkneſs, bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter, has been the main ſource of deluſion and ſlavery in all ages. <hi>Iſai. v, 20.</hi> But, as it has now involved the world in very great perplexities, it is hoped that this brief eſſay, to open the nature and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>CHRISTIANITY,</hi> will be candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received; and that our dear Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will be as noble as the Bereans were; and ſearch the ſcriptures daily for light in this matter, which is of infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to us all.</p>

                  <p>And I will give power unto my two witneſſes, and they ſhall prophecy a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days clothed in ſackcloth.</p>

            <p>THE moſt important events, from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic age to the end of time, are exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed in this book; among which the affair of theſe two witneſſes has a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar place. Who they are, why called two and no more, how they prophecy, and the effects thereof, are queſtions which have puzzled many, and have cauſed much controverſy. Such darkneſs has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, that many ſerious minds have been for avoiding any concern therewith. But ſince a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is pronounced upon thoſe who ſhall read and hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein, how can any be willing to diſregard ſuch bleſſedneſs? Therefore, with earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſires after it, let us attempt a brief anſwer to the above inquiries.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WHO are theſe two witneſſes? In the words following we are told, that they are the two olive-trees, and the two candleſticks ſtanding before the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019485_0004_0FABAEE15A2B0538"/>God of the earth. This refers to the ſtate of the church ſoon after her return from Babylon. That return was encouraged and promoted by the civil power; but when her enemies, by falſe accuſations, procured a counter order from thence, the Jews ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the houſe of God, and purſued their own private concerns. Thus they went on for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, and then the prophets Haggai and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah, were ſent to reprove and expoſtulate with them for this iniquity, and to call them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation; to promote which, a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick, all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and an olive-tree on each ſide, was ſet before one of theſe prophets. And upon his enquiring what it meant, the anſwer was, "This is the <hi>word of the Lord</hi> unto Zerubbable, ſaying, Not by might, nor by power, but by <hi>my Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Lord of hoſts: who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thou ſhalt become a plain, and he ſhall bring forth the head-ſtone thereof with ſhouting, crying, <hi>grace, grace,</hi> unto it." Zech. iv. 2—7.</p>
            <p>THE work they were called to, was to build the houſe of God; the mountain in the way of it was the oppoſition of the world; Zerubbable was their governor, whom the ſpirit of God would carry through all difficulties ſo as to finiſh his houſe, and free grace ſhould have all the glory. The candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick repreſented the church of God, the oil his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence, and the two olive-trees the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines through which it was communicated; for they <hi>emptied the golden oil out of themſelves,</hi> ver. 12. So ſays our Lord, <hi>Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth,</hi> John xvii. 17. Among his ancient people oil was made uſe of for food, for medicine, for ornament, for conſecration, and for light, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in their tabernacle and temple.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:019485_0005_0FABAEE2249EEC78"/>
THE Manna which was their food for forty years in the wilderneſs, taſted like <hi>freſh oil;</hi> and it was to make them know, that man doth not live by bread only, but <hi>by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Num. xi. 8. Deut. viii. 3. Mat. iv. 4. Every word of his feeds the ſoul, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by faith. Oil was alſo of a kind and healing nature, and for that end was poured into the wounds of the man who fell among thieves; and of how much greater efficacy is grace to wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? Oil likewiſe made their faces to ſhine; which was but a ſhadow of the <hi>beauties of holineſs</hi> that ſhine in willing converts. Pſalm civ. 15. cx. 3. Anointing was required in all their conſecrations. The tabernacle, and all its rich furniture, with the prieſts who miniſtered therein, were conſecrated in this way: and oil had a ſpecial place in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic offerings. Yea, with an horn of oil David was anointed king over the Iſrael of God; all which were ſhadows of the head and members of the Chriſtian church, that ſpiritual houſe, that holy and royal prieſthood. 1 Pet. ii. 5, 9. Rev. i. 5, 6. And the oil for light, in the Jewiſh tabernacle and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, repreſented the influences of the holy Spirit, whereby the goſpel church is made the light of the world, and the pillar and ground of the truth. Mat. v. 14. 1 Tim. iii. 15, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">II. BUT why are theſe witneſſes called two and no more? In Zechariah's time there was but one teſtament, as well as one church; what then was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the two olive-trees? Anſwer, The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and deſign of witneſſes is to prove points of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance which are diſputed, eſpecially in the affairs of government: and all ſuch diſputes in our world came in by calling in queſtion the truth and equity of God's revealed will, whereby all ought to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019485_0006_0FABAEE2F3896BA0"/>And for him to foretel exactly the future actions of moral agents, and his juſt dealings towards them; and then clearly to record the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe predictions, with the verification of his promiſes and threatenings, are the ſtrongeſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that can be given, of his right to govern the world, and that he governs it right.</p>
            <p>HENCE he warns all againſt fearing any man as his prophet, whoſe prophecy does not follow or come to paſs. And Chriſt is there promiſed as the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of Moſes, who muſt be <hi>heard in all things,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the penalty of being <hi>deſtroyed from among the people.</hi> Deut. xviii. 18—22. Acts iii. 22, 23. And to theſe two witneſſes, of expreſs predictions, and their exact accompliſhment, he makes his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal againſt the brazen obſtinacy, and wilful treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of the Jews, who were tranſgreſſors from the womb. Iſai. xlviii. 1—8. His prophets were mortal, but their words were not ſo. Many of them were verified in the Babyloniſh captivity, and to expoſe the folly of unbelief and diſobedience in thoſe who returned from it, he ſaid, <hi>My words and my ſtatutes, which I commanded my ſervants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and ſaid, Like as the Lord of hoſts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, ſo hath he dealt with us,</hi> Zech. i. 6. They acknowledged that his words were truth, and alſo that they were according to juſtice and equity; ſo that here were two olive-trees, two witneſſes, when there was but one church. And how much deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er root did theſe trees take when our Saviour came, and fulfilled the law, both moral and ceremonial, and accompliſhed all the prophecy concerning him, which had been publiſhed from time to time for four thouſand years?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:019485_0007_0FABAEE39CCC5468"/>
HE was firſt promiſed as the ſeed of the woman, then of Abraham, then of Judah, then of David, in whoſe line was Zerubbable, the builder of the ſecond temple; and the promiſe of his being made <hi>as a ſignet,</hi> pointed directly to Chriſt, the precious corner ſtone in Zion. Hag. ii. 23. Acts iv. 11. Matthew has proved that Joſeph was the legal heir to David's crown, and Luke has traced the line from Mary up to David, whoſe family was reduced ſo low as not to be able to provide a lamb, even when the Son of God was publicly preſented in his houſe; a greater glory than ever appeared in the temple built by Solomon. That they were ſo poor is evident, becauſe the birds then brought were not allowed of, when the firſt-born was preſented, but only in caſe of inability to provide a lamb. Levi. xii. 6, 8. Luke ii. 24. Well then did the prophet ſay, <hi>Who hath believed our report?—for he ſhall grow up as a root out of a dry ground.</hi> Who could believe that a child thus born could be the mighty God, the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah ſo often ſpoken of, who ſhould conquer all his enemies, and eſtabliſh an everlaſting kingdom! None ever did believe it but ſuch as were <hi>taught of God.</hi> John vi. 44, 45.</p>
            <p>DAVID was ſo taught, and thereby was led ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to foretel the rage of Jews and Gentiles againſt Chriſt; his being betrayed by a profeſſed friend, and having his hands and feet pierced, and gall and vinegar given him by his enemies; his laſt prayer to the Father; his reſurrection, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeſſion at the Father's right-hand, with his glorious gifts to his people, and vengeance on his impenitent foes. Pſalm ii. 1—12. xvi. 10, 11. xxii. 1, 16. xli. 9. xlv. 1—7. lxviii. 17—21. lxix. 21. cx. 1—6. All which, with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other predictions, were exactly verified in Jeſus
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019485_0008_0FABAEE4C6033328"/>Chriſt; ſo that though John, who came to prepare his way, was a burning and ſhining light, yet his greateſt <hi>witneſſes</hi> were the <hi>works,</hi> which were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Father, and finiſhed by the Son. John v. 36. viii. 17, 18. The apoſtles explained the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and recorded the perfect accompliſhment of their predictions, and alſo the laws and orders of the goſpel church; and upon this foundation <hi>both</hi> Jews and Gentiles had acceſs by <hi>one Spirit</hi> unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>both</hi> partook of the <hi>root and fatneſs of the olive-tree.</hi> Eph. ii. 18—22. Rom. xi. 6, 17. Thus the two candleſticks appear to be the old and new teſtament churches, and the two olive-trees, the ſpecial laws and inſtitutions given to each of them, through which God communicated his grace. Twelve patriarchs conſtituted the firſt, and twelve apoſtles the laſt of theſe churches; and their union is undoubtedly repreſented by the twenty-four el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders whom John ſaw. The apoſtles were ſet before the prophets, as their true interpreters, in the firſt building of the Chriſtian church, and ſo they will be in her triumph over Babylon. Rev. v. 8, 9. xviii. 20.</p>
            <p n="3">III. HOW do theſe witneſſes ſtill prophecy, ſince the volume of inſpiration is compleated? Anſwer, As the nature and order of the firſt creation, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtate of man, his fall, and the only way of recovery, as well as the future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, could not have been clearly known by him without pure revelation, ſo none can preach theſe great articles aright without the <hi>ſpirit of faith.</hi> Thoſe who are <hi>in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God.

And as with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, ſo with the mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is made unto ſalvation; and ſaints receive one another as Chriſt receives them, to the glory of God.

Which is the exact nature of a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel covenant; and it can no more be the duty of any ſoul to keep any covenant contrary to the revealed will of God, than it can to fear man inſtead of him. And theſe ſpiritual weapons were more extenſively victorious in the apoſtolic age, than the Roman ſword had ever been. And as God has ever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the world with a ſpecial regard to his elect, in and by whom his witneſſes are held up, ſo their cries have procured bleſſings or plagues upon the earth, as often and as far as their wills have been one with his will. 1 John v. 14, 15. Luke xviii. 7, 8. James v. 17, 18. Alſo the light which they have held up, has been terrible to guilty conſciences; therefore they are truly ſaid to ſmite the earth with plagues as often as they will, and to torment its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Context, ver. 5, 6, 10.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. WHY do theſe witneſſes prophecy ſo long in ſackcloth? Anſwer, Becauſe the beaſt bears ſway all that time; only his reckoning is by months, and theirs by days. Rev. xi. 2, 3. xiii. 5. His king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019485_0010_0FABAEE6E74E2628"/>was founded in darkneſs, while they are the children of light; and months are named from the moon, which rules the night, as the ſun does the day. The ceremonial law put a ſpecialty upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very new moon; but when Chriſt came he took that hand-writing out of the way, nailing it to his croſs, and warned his church againſt being brought into bondage, under thoſe weak and beggarly elements, by <hi>deceitful philoſophy,</hi> and the <hi>commandments of men.</hi> Gal. iv. 9.10. Col. ii. 8—23. The fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental order of his kingdom is, that none <hi>can ſee it,</hi> nor have any right to <hi>power</hi> in it, until they are <hi>born again;</hi> and alſo that all ſtriving about who ſhall be the <hi>greateſt,</hi> is excluded therefrom. John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. Matt. xviii. 3, 4. xx. 24—27. Lordſhip one over another is here declared to be of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and by them is the holy city trodden under foot the forty and two months wherein the witneſſes prophecy in ſackcloth; which has ever cauſed mourning in themſelves, and their being deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by others. And mourning in themſelves, and being deſpiſed by the world, are undoubtedly the ideas intended by that cloathing. And when they ſhall have finiſhed their teſtimony, the beaſt that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth out of the bottomleſs pit, ſhall make war againſt them, and ſhall overcome them, and kill them, and their dead bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreet of the great city, which ſpiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where alſo our Lord was crucified. And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, ſhall ſee their dead bodies, three days and an half, and ſhall not ſuffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth ſhall rejoice over them, and make merry, and ſhall ſend gifts one to another; becauſe theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets tormented them who dwelt on the earth. Rev. xi. 2, 3, 7—10.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:019485_0011_0FABAEE9F33D89D8"/>
AND how exactly does this deſcribe the preſent ſtate of things through the world? How is <hi>truth fallen in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter?</hi> A dead body or form of it is kept above ground, but how is its life and influence ſhut out by men in power? This city is ſo large as to include the place where our Lord was crucified; which was done by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of church officers, enforced by the ſecular arm. And within this city will be found all the blood which has been ſhed under the Chriſtian name. It is ſpiritually called Sodom and Egypt. The ſpirit of Sodom was pride, fullneſs of bread, and abundance of idleneſs; neither did they ſtrengthen the hands of the poor and needy, but were haughty and daring in their abominations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Ezek. xvi. 49, 50. Egypt reaped great advantages by the Iſraelites; but turned them all to gratify their own luſts, and moſt cruelly to oppreſs the very people from whom they derived thoſe advantages. And how full is the word of this ſpirit in our day!</p>
            <p>THE beaſt that overcame and killed the witneſſes, came out of the bottomleſs pit. In his firſt form he aroſe out of the ſea, and in his ſecond he aroſe out of the earth; but then he exerciſed all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the firſt beaſt. He was as ſpotted as a leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, as cruel as a bear, and as terrible as a lion; yet he was very changeable. He was, and is not, and yet is. He is the eighth, and is of the ſeven, and goeth into perdition. Rev. xiii. 1—12. xvii. 8—11.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Roman empire was the greateſt beaſt in the world. Dan. vii. 7, 8. His heads appear to be different forms of their commanding power. Kings, conſuls, dictators, decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virs, and tribunes, were all fallen before the apoſtle wrote, when pagan emperors ruled; and Chriſtian emperors ruled but a ſhort time, before the <hi>little horn,</hi> the biſhop of Rome, aſſumed the command over all the churches; to whom the ten horns gave their power. This <hi>eighth is of the ſeven;</hi> for his arbitrary power, which he carried to an amazing length, was enforced by the ſword of the magiſtrate, which was firſt brought into the church by Conſtantine; and this practice was of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by whom the holy city has been trodden under foot.</note> Now compare theſe characters with plain
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019485_0012_0FABAEEB745402E8"/>facts. Chriſt commands his ſervants to let the children of the wicked one, grow together with his children, in the world, until the end of it; while he commands his church to put away wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from among them. Mat. xiii. 30, 38. 1 Cor. v. 12, 13. But leopards, bears and lions, are not more oppoſite to the tender feelings of humanity, than many are to this liberty and purity. When the only true head of the church was deſired to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his influence in the diviſion of an eſtate, he ſaid, <hi>Man, who made me a judge, or a divider over you?</hi> And he commanded his miniſters to depart out of every city, where his goſpel was not <hi>freely</hi> received, and not <hi>forcibly</hi> to carry away ſo much as the duſt of their feet. Luke x. 7—12. xii. 14. But all earthly heads of the church have ever done the contrary.</p>
            <p>THE head of the church of Rome aroſe out of the raging confuſions of the Roman empire, by a myſtical confounding of Jewiſh ceremonies with Chriſtian worſhip, which is as bottomleſs as the ocean; and he aſſumed the power of <hi>dividing</hi> all the world among his votaries. No ſooner was our American world diſcovered, than he, the very next ſpring, preſumed to diſpoſe of it in as ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by a formal deed, as any man could of his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019485_0013_0FABAEEBDF4CEC98"/>farm. And when temporal princes were ſet up as heads of the church, they exerciſed the ſame power. In each nation, their head, which aroſe out of the earth, ſet up by the people, like a harmleſs lamb, yet ſpake like a dragon, under the influence of the two horns, of church cenſures and corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All our American charters were given from that power; and from thence came our late moſt cruel war. The ſociety in London who ſent their miſſionaries into our colonies, had an annual ſermon delivered before them, by the biſhop of Gloceſter, on Feb. 21, 1766, wherein he ſaid, "The ſpreading of GENTILEISM in the colonies, calls for our rejected charity."<note n="†" place="bottom">Gloceſter's ſermon, p. 11.</note> And the next month it was reſolved in Parliament, that they had a right to BIND US IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER.—And before ſaid ſociety, on Feb. 20, 1767, the biſhop of Landaff accuſed the inhabitants of theſe colonies of being "infidels and barbarians;" which, ſaid he, "was contrary to the pretences and <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> under which they obtained <hi>royal grants</hi> and public authority." And after expreſſing his deſires and hopes of the ſpeedy eſtabliſhment of biſhops here, he ſaid, "This point obtained, the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can church will ſoon go out of its infant ſtate, be able to ſtand upon its own legs, and without foreign help <hi>ſupport</hi> and ſpread itſelf. Then the buſineſs of this ſociety will have been brought to the happy iſſue <hi>intended."</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Landaff's ſermon, p. 7, 24, 25.</note> And the tea act, which brought on the war, was paſſed that year. Thus all the <hi>blood</hi> that was ſhed therein, was procured by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of church officers, enforced by the ſword.</p>
            <p>AND we are to remember, that the beaſt which John ſaw had a mouth like a lion; a beaſt that goes
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019485_0014_0FABAEED793EDC88"/>forth to ſeek his prey in the night, and does it by ſitting up a dreadful roar, and then liſtening for the noiſe of creatures in their flight, and purſuing them by the ear and not the eye; for when the morning cometh they retire into their dens. Pſalm civ. 20—22. So, in a very dark time, twenty thouſand mercenaries were brought from Germany, to add terror to the roarings of the Britiſh lion, who blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued his prey, from the lofty mountains of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, to the plains and thickets of Carolina and Georgia, but could not catch it. Yet this bloody chace was no ſooner over, than the merchants of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, even the <hi>great men of the earth,</hi> filled this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with her ſplendid and coſtly wares; by means of which public credit, or the faith of government in America, has been bought and ſold for a trifle. And the ſpirit of pride and luxury, like Sodom, and of tyranny, like Egypt, has prevailed amazingly. No effectual care was taken to ſecure a medium of trade among us, and yet public and private debts are demanded with great rigour; as if brick could be made without ſtraw. Yet hereby the word of God is verified, which is infinitely more precious than gold.</p>
            <p>UNDER the plauſible pretences of religion and government, the worſt of evils have long been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered among all nations; but God has promiſed to deſtroy this covering, and to reveal and conſume the man of ſin, by the ſpirit of his mouth, and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his appearing. Iſai. xxv. 7.2 Theſſ. ii. 3—12. Towards which he has now made great advances. Calling in queſtion the truth and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God's revealed will, and ſitting up the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and will of man againſt it, was the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſin and death came into our world. The firſt Adam, our public head, revolted from heaven, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019485_0015_0FABAEEE1CB5EE08"/>ſeized upon the earth as his own; and we all bear his earthly image, until we are born again, and ſo are changed into the image of our ſecond head, the Lord from heaven. Rom. v. 12—21. 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22, 47—49. To prepare whoſe way ſeveral eminent men were raiſed up, in different ages; as Noah, to ſave the human race from compleat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by the deluge, and Abraham, to be the father of the church of Iſrael; each of whom were eminent types of Chriſt, as Moſes alſo was of his prophetical, Aaron of his prieſtly, and David of his kingly offices. But in the antichriſtian apoſtacy, the veil of the ceremonial law was drawn over the truth and glory of the goſpel. The covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which Jeſus had nailed to his croſs, was taken from thence, and called the covenant of grace; from whence it was declared that dominion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in grace. Common believers were put in the place of Noah and Abraham, and officers in the place of Moſes, Aaron and David; and a ſucceſſive power in officers has been held up as a ſacred thing ever ſince. Teachers procured the crucifixion of our Lord, by ſaying, <hi>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caeſar's friend;</hi> and an appeal to the <hi>king's laws,</hi> has been the refuge of hirelings in every age: But how has God now rent away this veil of darkneſs?</p>
            <p>FOR no man can claim any power in our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was not lately derived from the conſent of the people, without appearing an enemy to his country; and this authority is acknowledged to be good by the greateſt Princes in Europe. And <hi>money</hi> forms the only qualification of the electors of our higheſt rulers; and it was a <hi>ſorcerer</hi> who firſt offered <hi>money</hi> for <hi>power</hi> in the Chriſtian church; and by ſuch <hi>ſorceries</hi> the whore of Babylon has <hi>deceived
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019485_0016_0FABAEEED9055988"/>all nations.</hi> Acts viii. 18—21, Rev. xviii. 23. Yet many in our country ſtill call themſelves mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, who refuſe to be governed by him, and inſiſt upon being ſupported by ſecular <hi>force.</hi> Under the law God called ſuch the <hi>ſons of Belial,</hi> and poured his vengeance on them and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and the way wherein he has promiſed to bring wars to an end, is by exalting <hi>his houſe</hi> above all earthly powers, and drawing the nations <hi>freely</hi> to obey <hi>his laws,</hi> enforced in <hi>his name.</hi> 1 Sam. ii. 12, 16. Micah iii. 5—12. iv. 1—5. Col. iii. 17. Multitudes are ſo averſe to this, as clearly to verify the prophecy of Jude, who ſays, <hi>Wo unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and periſhed in the gainſaying of Core.</hi> In each of which caſes man is to be ſeen rejecting the authority of God, and exalting ſelf above him.</p>
            <p>ELECTION is an honorable word with them, when applied to particular men, whoſe <hi>perſons they have in admiration becauſe of advantage;</hi> but when God makes uſe of the ſame word, to diſplay the glories of his grace, men diſcover a perfect enmity againſt it. Like Cain, they would be accepted without faith in the blood of atonement; and becauſe God gave Abel that faith, and had reſpect to him and his offering in that way, Cain had a bloody rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; <hi>becauſe his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</hi> Heb. xi. 4. 1 John iii. 12. As Cain was the elder brother, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was then in families; Abel was ſtill a good ſubject and never injured Cain in any reſpect by his having the true religion. Gen. iv. 7. Neither did true religion ever injure any man in the world; and yet what enmity have many againſt it! Balaam knew that God had <hi>choſen</hi> Iſrael for his peculiar
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019485_0017_0FABAEEF9C741E60"/>people, who ſhould <hi>dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations:</hi> Yet, for an earthly reward, he taught Balak to lay a ſnare, to draw them into whoredom and idolatry, and ſo to deſtroy that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. And Chriſt warns his church againſt this ſnare of Balaam, of Jezebel, and of the whore of Babylon. Num. xxiii. 9. xxv. 1—3. Rev. ii. 14, 20. xviii. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>THE church is preſented as a chaſte virgin to Chriſt, unto whom none can be married, until, by the work of his Spirit in their hearts, they are made dead to ſin and ſelf-righteouſneſs, and alive to God; which great change is openly declared in baptiſm; and it is <hi>adultery</hi> for any to profeſs to be his in any other way. Rom. vi. 2—4. vii. 1—6. Before this change we all love the creature above the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; and to go after any but him for temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, is <hi>playing</hi> the <hi>harlot.</hi> Coveteouſneſs is <hi>idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> and many make a <hi>god of their belly.</hi> Hoſea ii. 5—8. Eph. v. 5. Phil. iii. 19. Yet daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts are made to draw the ſaints into this whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and idolatry, and that with Core's language. After it was moſt clearly diſcovered that God had <hi>choſen</hi> Moſes as his prophet, and Aaron as the head of the prieſthood, Core gainſayed it, ſaying, <hi>Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the congregation are holy every one of them, and the Lord is among them.</hi> Num. xvi. 3. Which is the exact language of all teachers who refuſe to be governed by the laws of Chriſt, the only antitype of Moſes and Aaron. They rule the church with <hi>force and cruelty,</hi> and trample down the good paſtures, and foul the deep waters with their feet. That is, they corrupt the word of God, and try all arts to darken every thing therein which condemns their deceit and cruelty. And our only way of deliverance from ſuch <hi>evil
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019485_0018_0FABAEF05C616568"/>beaſts,</hi> is the way of faith in and obedience to our ſpiritual David. Ezek. xxxiv. 4, 18—25. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law he gave his people reſt, on the ſeventh day, in the ſeventh year, and after ſeven times ſeven years; and under the goſpel he firſt gives them reſt, and then they work for him. Heb. iv. 1—10. But they who worſhip the beaſt can get no further than ſix, the toiling number, be they in units, tens or hundreds, <hi>they can never have enough; they have no reſt day nor night.</hi> Iſai. lvi. ii. Rev. xiii. 18. xiv. 11. Beaſts act according to their carnal inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without any regard to truth or equity; and ſo do thoſe who empower ſome to judge for others about religious worſhip, and to enforce their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the ſword. This beaſt has often chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his name and appearance, upon which the cry has been, <hi>Who is like unto the beaſt? who is able to make war with him?</hi> And when his fraud has been detected, and his power defeated, he has ſoon aſſumed another name and form, and then has purſued the ſame argument. Thus he was, and is not, and yet is; though he ſhall finally go into perdition. Rev. xiii. 4. xvii. 8. And how earneſt ſhould all be for this great event? For then all will know, that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion never gives officers a right to the property of the people for nothing, nor the people a right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire officers to go a warfare of their own charges; and alſo that no birth or doings of nature can give any ſoul a right to the promiſes of grace, without perſonal faith therein. Ezek. xiv. 20. Gal. iii. 22. Heb. vi. 18.</p>
            <p>NONE can be built upon the Rock without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doing the <hi>ſayings</hi> of Chriſt; and his ſayings demonſtrate, that the only heirs of the bleſſings of his kingdom, are the poor in ſpirit, the mourners, the meek, ſuch as hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019485_0019_0FABAEF34793B668"/>are merciful, pure in heart, peace-makers, and perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake; to whom he ſays, <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you do ye even ſo to them; for this is the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> And thoſe who are oppoſite hereto he calls <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>ſwine,</hi> to whom <hi>holy things</hi> are not to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; and teachers, who by <hi>their fruits</hi> diſcover a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to this law of equity, he calls <hi>wolves,</hi> and commands us to beware of them. Mat. v. 3—12. vii. 6, 12, 15, 24. Hence it is certain, that the diſtinction between his church and the world, is not <hi>carnal</hi> but <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> The bloody ſign of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was a ſeal to Abraham, of the faith he before had in Chriſt, in whom all the families of the earth ſhall be bleſſed. A deſcent from Abraham by blood, or a purchaſe with his money, were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the purchaſe of Chriſt's blood, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation by his grace. But ſince his death, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to build his church upon the covenant of circumciſion is <hi>falling from grace.</hi> The <hi>natural</hi> diſtinctions which it made among mankind, could not be countenanced by Peter nor Barnabas without <hi>diſſimulation.</hi> Rom. iv. 10—12. Gal. ii. 12, 13. v. 1—4. For by that covenant Abraham could not circumciſe any Gentile, until he had bought him as a ſervant with money; neither could he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any ſuch in his houſe without circumciſing him. Kings were to come out of him, and his ſeed were to take the land of Canaan by the ſword, when the iniquity of its inhabitants ſhould be <hi>full,</hi> of which God was the ſole judge. Gen. xv. 16. xvii. 6—14. David was the king who finiſhed that conqueſt, but for the wickedneſs of his poſterity the <hi>crown</hi> was taken from them, and was <hi>overturned, overturned, overturned,</hi> until Jeſus came, and it was given to him. Ezek. xxi. 25—27. Luke i. 32. And he ſays to his diſciples, <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019485_0020_0FABAEF593325650"/>is nothing, but the keeping of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the ſervants of men. One is your Maſter, even Chriſt, and all ye are brethren.</hi> And thoſe who laid heavy burdens on mens ſhoulders, which they would not move with one of their fingers, he called <hi>ſerpents and a generation of vipers.</hi> 1 Cor. vii. 19, 23. Mat. xxiii. 2—8, 33.</p>
            <p>AND how full is our world of ſuch at this time! Boſton now imitates Jeruſalem herein, for no man in Boſton has ever been compelled to ſupport any religious teacher contrary to his perſonal choice, ſince 1693; while her teachers and lawyers have reſolutely denied this liberty to the country, and have claimed a power to compel every pariſh to ſettle and ſupport ſuch teachers as they have called orthodox. And at the commencement of our new Conſtitution, this practice was called GODLINESS, in capitals, while <hi>honeſty</hi> was put in ſmall letters. And a door was left open for the admiſſion of Roman catholics into the higheſt offices in our government: to juſtify which, it was ſaid, "Religion muſt at all times be a matter between God and individuals."<note n="§" place="bottom">Addreſs before the Maſſachuſetts Conſtitution, 1780, p. 17.</note> Since which one of their moſt noted teachers, has publiſhed a book in London, wherein he carries his notions of the gift of grace ſo high as to ſay, "Infallibly, if the greater part of the human kind, notwithſtanding this gift, and the <hi>abounding</hi> of it, are left to periſh eternally, in conſequence of the lapſe through Adam, a broader foundation is really laid for their groaning under the damage by him, than for their rejoicing in the oppoſite advantage derived to the world through Jeſus Chriſt." And he holds forth that perſonal doings and ſufferings,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019485_0021_0FABAEF59F2B89B8"/>either here or hereafter, will bring every child of Adam to virtue and eternal happineſs; for, ſays he, "In what point of light ſoever we take a view of ſin, it is certainly, in its nature, a <hi>finite evil.</hi>—And the conſideration of <hi>hell</hi> as a <hi>purging fire,</hi> is that only which can make the matter ſit eaſy upon one's mind—This is certainly moſt agreeable to the <hi>natural notions</hi> we entertain of the only <hi>good</hi> God.—Nor can I ſuppoſe that any ſoberly thoughtful <hi>Deiſt</hi> would ever have recurred to <hi>mere reaſon,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>revelation,</hi> for the ſupport of a <hi>hope</hi> towards God, if he had entertained this idea of its deſign and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency."<note n="*" place="bottom">Chauncy on Salvation for all men, 1784, p. 85, 87, 319, 324, 325, 361.</note> And who can deſcribe the joys that have been among the nations, upon the opening of ſuch a door! Eſpecially when it is followed with claims of <hi>infallibility,</hi> in carrying the doctrine of <hi>purgatory</hi> in London and Boſton beyond what it is in Rome!

And how is this word now fulfilled?

Rivers of blood have been ſhed between contending ſects, under his name; but any man might as ſoon tell what was the language of Babel, as he can now tell what is orthodoxy in any national church upon earth. And as they now own, that religion is ever a matter between God and individuals, all may know that all force to ſupport ſoul-guides, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to religion. God calls his covenant with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>the covenant of circumciſion.</hi> Acts vii. 8. But men took away that name, and <hi>added</hi> the name <hi>grace</hi> to it.

            <p>BECAUSE Noah was a gracious man, and the ſaving of his houſe in the ark was a figure of our being ſaved by baptiſm; and becauſe Abraham was a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, whoſe houſhold conſtituted the Hebrew church, and were commanded by him to keep the way of the Lord, good men have imagined that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would fail from among them, if their infants were not baptized. But the experience of four times forty years in New-England, has entirely deſtroyed the covering of this iniquity. Our Plymouth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers held that the church was INDEPENDENT of the world, and to be governed wholly by the laws of Chriſt: But the maſſachuſetts rejected that name, and called the church CONGREGATIONAL. They both held that none had any right to a governing power in the church but <hi>regenerate perſons;</hi> and that all office power is derived from Chriſt, by his word and Spirit, to each particular church, and not
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019485_0023_0FABAEF7790C62A8"/>by any local ſucceſſion from any other men in the world. And our Plymouth fathers held, that each church was to act as a united body, their votes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal; but the Maſſachuſetts held that no church act was compleat without the conſent of the elders, and that rulers ought to compel the people to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them. After forty years, they allowed the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of godly parents to be active in baptiſm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any account of <hi>their regeneration.</hi> At the cloſe of the ſecond period ſuch were alſo allowed to come to the ordinance of the ſupper, as a converting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. But an extenſive revival of religion, at the cloſe of the third period, brought many to the knowledge of the <hi>new birth,</hi> which alarmed hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and the land has been filled with controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ever ſince. The year 1780, compleated four times forty years, ſince New-England was planted; and it was a remarkable year of <hi>grace</hi> to many, and alſo of evidence that the name does not belong to the covenant of circumciſion.</p>
            <p>ISRAEL were not to ſet up any rulers over them, but <hi>brethren</hi> in their church; and adultery and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy were capital crimes among them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all but communicants in congregational church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, were excluded from any vote in the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts government, the ſpring after Boſton was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And they enacted the next year, "That if any man have carnal copulation with another man's wife, they ſhall both be puniſhed with death."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prince's annals, p. 28, 35.</note> And they hanged a number of perſons for adultery, many years before they did any for hereſy. When they loſt their charter, their ſcheme of compelling the world to ſubmit to the government of the church, was deſtroyed; and the world, by the help of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019485_0024_0FABAEF921976D20"/>have tyranized over the church in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ever ſince.</p>
            <p>A CHURCH on our weſtern borders holds that "Infant baptiſm is adminiſtered in a view of the <hi>parents being in covenant;</hi> but doth not ſuppoſe the <hi>infant itſelf,</hi> to be poſſeſſed of <hi>any right</hi> whatever, to the privileges of the covenent of grace." That their children, as well as others, are born <hi>under the curſe;</hi> and that parents are under covenant obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to train them up in the nurture and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord. Therefore when a man came from Connecticut, who had been heard to blaſpheme his Maker, and made ſuit to a young widow in their church, who had children under their care, they warned her not to marry him; and becauſe ſhe did it, they excluded her from their communion. But for this, the terms, <hi>grace, ſaving grace,</hi> were dreſſed up in a moſt ridiculous manner, and were thus held forth to the world, from the preſs in Hartford and in Norwich.<note n="†" place="bottom">Huntington's plea, p. 29.

            <p>YET a public complaint is now made, that "A general ſpirit reigns againſt the moſt liberal and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous eſtabliſhments in religion; againſt the civil magiſtrates encouraging or having any thing more to do about religion, than to keep the civil peace among contending ſects." And the advocates for this liberty are implicitly accuſed of favouring infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. But to move rulers to exert their power for the ſupport of miniſters, they ſay, "The church has never been of any political detriment here, for it never has been veſted with any civil or ſecular power in New-England.—And, God be thanked, the ſenatorial Aſſembly of this happieſt of all the United States [Connecticut] ſtill emboſoms ſo many Phinehas's and Zerubbable's, ſo many religious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, the friends of Jeſus and his holy religion; and that the Meſſiah's cauſe is here accompanied with <hi>civil government</hi> and the <hi>prieſthood;</hi> alluſively the <hi>two olive-trees upon the right of the candleſtick</hi> (the churches) <hi>and upon the left; the two golden branches, which through the two golden pipes,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

And as thoſe prieſts could turn a king out of the temple, teachers who have claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch power, have <hi>reigned over kings of the earth.</hi> 2 Chron. xxvi. 20. Rev. xvii. 18. Many of them were lately zealous for excluding the king's power from this land, who ſtill hold their power over the pariſhes which they received in his name; and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence has often been uſed with perſons who have conſcientiouſly refuſed to acknowledge that power. Three men were impriſoned at Worceſter for this cauſe, betwixt the compiling of our new Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the commencement of government upon it; and others ſince. And a new Law-book was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Connecticut in 1784, which does not allow any man to live therein, without paying taxes to ſuch teachers, or elſe giving in a written acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the power that ſupports them. And for refuſing to do it, two gentlement were robbed that fall of ſome lands in Woodſtock, as a baptiſt tenant thereon had before been of a cow.</p>
            <p>THESE gentlemen are of the poſterity of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the baptiſt church in Boſton, when their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe was nailed up in 1680, at the inſtigation of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019485_0029_0FABAEFC93334C68"/>congregational miniſters. Dr. Increaſe Mather was one of them; but he was ſo clearly convinced of his error afterwards, that he freely went into the ſame houſe, and aſſiſted in ordaining a paſtor of that church. And his ſon then delivered a ſermon, wherein he exhorted good men to go as far in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning together as they could without ſin; but where any ſinful terms were impoſed, he ſays, "There the injunction of Heaven upon them is, <hi>Be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, and I will receive you.</hi> The <hi>impoſers</hi> are the <hi>ſchiſmatics."</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Late hiſtory, vol. ii. p. 50.</note> Which things touched the heart of Mr. Hollis, a baptiſt gentleman in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in ſuch a manner as to make him the greateſt benefactor to Harvard college, of any man upon earth. Yet of late, directly after three robbers were hanged in Cambridge, three baptiſts therein were robbed of their property for pariſh teachers; and when they ſued for recompence, the caſe was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them in Cambridge, October 27, 1785, by the ſame judges who condemned the other rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and that notwithſtanding, our conſtitution ſays, "No ſubordination of any one ſect or deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to another ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law."</p>
            <p>WHERE money is forced away from any people, and given to religious teachers, it bribes them to exert all their influence for the increaſe of ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and this bribes rulers to continue in that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. And the people are bribed with the opinion, that grace has brought them into a like covenant as Iſrael were in, who had a right to treat all others, both as to worſhip and commerce, as no others had a right to treat them. And a gift blinds the eyes of the wiſe, and perverts the words of the righteous.

            <p>IN 1708 the miniſters in each county in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, were veſted with a claſſical power over the churches, "upon all occaſions eccleſiaſtical." And in 1744, the firſt church in Canterbury had no way to avoid hearing a candidate whom they had voted out, but by renouncing that power. Yet, for doing it, the miniſters of Windham county ſo plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted themſelves into the ſeat of God, as to take his warning againſt ſeducers, Deut. xiii. 1—3, and to turn it againſt their worſhip, ſaying to the people, "If there ſeem to be never ſo many appearances of God's power attending it, you may not go after it, any more than after a falſe God."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Late hiſtory, vol. ii. p. 37, 169.</note> Since which above forty thouſand people in New-England have withdrawn from that ſect, and the moſt of them have turned to the baptiſt denomination; who are now accuſed, by a miniſter of ſaid county, of renouncing the only living and true God: But how does he prove it?

MEN who bear the ſword are to puniſh none but ſuch as work ill to their neighbours, while in religion each one ſtands or falls to his own Maſter. This is good order; and none can violate it without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſelf-condemned,</hi> which is moſt oppoſite to <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the great end of government. And teachers who <hi>cauſe diviſions</hi> contray to this doctrine, are to be <hi>marked as deceivers.</hi> Rom. xiii. 1—10. xiv. 4, 12, 22. xvi. 17, 18. This was directed to the church of Rome, from whence diviſions have ſpread through all the world; by putting baptiſm before faith, and by impoſing other rules of faith, than ever came from our one Lord. Miniſters, by what they have done upon the foreheads of infants, have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them Chriſtians, without their own knowledge or choice; and rulers, as far as they could extend their power, have forced all to ſupport ſuch teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or elſe to give in a written acknowledgment to the power that did it. Which two points exactly anſwer to the two parts of the body, on which the beaſt cauſed all to receive his mark; and the church obtains victory over him gradually. Rev. xiii. 16—18. xv. 2. Our fathers, when they came to this country; ſeemed to have gotten the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the beaſt, and over his image; but his mark, and the number of his name, are among us to this day.</p>
            <p>GOD always required a liberal ſupport for his worſhip and miniſters, and curſed the bleſſings of thoſe who refuſed to obey him herein. The beſt rulers in Iſrael, by word and example, ſtirred up the people <hi>freely</hi> to bring it in; and then, in concert with church officers, took care to ſecure it, that it might be appropriated according to his appointment; but they did not collect it <hi>by force.</hi> So now, miniſters are called to watch for ſouls as they who muſt give account; and their hearers are commanded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019485_0032_0FABAF025AE9A600"/>unto them <hi>in all good things,</hi> as they can anſwer it <hi>to God who is not mocked.</hi> Each one is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo required to communicate unto the poor, <hi>as God hath proſpered him, who loveth a chearful giver.</hi>

Which ſtandard is the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, to whom the Father ſays, "This is my <hi>covenant</hi> with them, ſaith the Lord, <hi>my Spirit</hi> that is upon thee, and <hi>my words</hi> which I have put in thy mouth ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed's ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and forever."

The mercy-ſeat, the only meeting place between God and his people, was juſt as long, and juſt as broad as the ark. Exod. xxv. 21, 22. Rev. xi. 19. By one offering Chriſt has perfected forever them who are ſanctified; upon which foundation they come boldly to the throne of grace, and obtain mercy and grace to ſerve God acceptably, who is a conſuming fire. Heb. iv. 16. x. 14—22. xii. 28, 29. His ſeed of grace in their hearts can no more be reconciled to ſin, than fire can to water; and he will make it victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over all corruption, which inſures their final perſeverance. 1 John iii. 3, 9. v. 4, 18—20.</p>
            <p>PARTY names, and worldly diſtinctions, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived men amazingly; but revelation aſſures us, that the eſſence of Chriſtianity is TRUTH and LOVE, and that all DECEIT and CRUELTY is of antichriſt and the devil.

SAINTS are his kingdom, his church, in diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all others; and the juſtice and truth of his ways is their joyful theme.

Their wine is the poiſon of dragons, and the cruel venom of aſps." And the Lamb ſays "Ye are of your father the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the luſts of your father ye will do: he was a <hi>murderer</hi> from the beginning, and abode not in the <hi>truth,</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>truth</hi> in him.—He is a <hi>liar,</hi> and the father of it." Deut. xxxii. 4, 31—33, 46, 47. John vi. 53, 63. viii. 44. xvi. 13.

Others inſiſt upon it, that if we have not power in our wills to come when we pleaſe, we are not dealt with as moral agents. But grace cannot reign in us, if it cannot command our hearts and lives. The promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>Lo I am with you alway,</hi> was given to the <hi>eleven,</hi> after Judas was gone to his own place; and their only ſucceſſors therein, are <hi>faithful men who teach all his commandments.</hi> Mat. xxviii. 16—20. 2 Tim. ii. 1, 2. To enforce which he ſays, <hi>With what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he ſhall be ſaved. He that climbeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a thief and a robber.</hi> Mat. vii. 2, 12. John x. 1, 9. And in vain do any try to evade the evidence of his verity and authority.</p>
            <p>HAM and Iſhmael had eminently pious fathers; but what a curſe did their own <hi>ſcornful</hi> behaviour bring on themſelves and their poſterity! Nimrod was a mighty hunter among them, the beginning of whoſe kingdom was Babel, from whence Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019485_0045_0FABAF135E74E7D0"/>has her name; and her <hi>gallies and gallant ſhips</hi> have carried blood and ſlavery round the world. Jews and Mahometans have retained the <hi>letter</hi> of circumciſion in their worſhip; the firſt of whom are monuments of judicial blindneſs among all nations, and the others have enſlaved Aſia and Africa, and are now retaliating the cruel ſlave-trade on Europe and America. Forcing money from any people for religious teachers, is taxing them where they are not repreſented; and how awfully was this evil requited to the nations in the late war! By ſuch taxes thieves and robbers were ſupported in churches; and what a plague have another kind of them been to their ſupporters in their houſes and highways! Yet the cry of many teachers now is, <hi>Caſt in thy lot among us, let us all have one purſe.</hi> And much of the <hi>learning</hi> of the preſent day has been made uſe of, as the old ſavages did of their arrows, in ſhooting from their hiding-places at honeſt men who refuſe to be confederates with them. Germany has been long ranſacked for ſtories to prejudice the people againſt equal liberty and believer's baptiſm; but how was Britain involved in debt, and America in blood, by the late forces that were brought from thence! And an eminent hiſtorian in that country aſſures us, that for more than a century after the death of Chriſt, "The churches were entirely <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent;</hi> none of them ſubject to any foreign ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, but each one governed by its own rulers, and its own laws." After which teachers adopted a maxim from heathen philoſophers, "That it was an act of virtue to <hi>deceive and lie,</hi> when by that means the <hi>intereſts</hi> of the church might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Moſheim's eccl. hiſt. vol. i. p. 77, 155, 314.</note> And no man has proved that infant baptiſm was ever named in the world, till after the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019485_0046_0FABAF142EA3D5A8"/>adoption of that maxim; ſince which the bringing of infants to a miniſter in the church, has been called their coming to Chriſt; whereas none <hi>can come</hi> to him but ſuch as are <hi>taught of God,</hi> and ſuch only are the <hi>children</hi> of his church. John vi. 44, 45. Iſaiah liv. 1, 13.</p>
            <p>BLIND guides among the Jews ſwore by gold and offerings, and not by the temple and alter whereby they were ſanctified; upon which an eminent father of New-England ſaid, "The eſtate of a ſaint is moſt happy and bleſſed, though the perſon never come near an office; but on the contrary, an officer, if he be not alſo, and firſt a ſaint, is a moſt wretched and accurſed creature."<note n="§" place="bottom">Robinſon againſt Bernard, p. 217.</note> 
               <hi>Anathama</hi> is the portion of every man who loves not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only <hi>altar</hi> that can <hi>ſanctify</hi> us and our gifts. 1 Cor. xvi. 22. Heb. xiii. 10—18. The <hi>national holineſs</hi> of the Jews obliged them to put away their ſtrange wives, and the children that were born of them. Deut. vii. 3—6. Ezra x. 19, 44. From whence ſeducers took occaſion to forbid marriage, and to command men to abſtain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thankſgiving of them who believe and know the truth: <hi>for it is ſanctified by the word of God and prayer.</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 1—5. Family relations, with other temporal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, are, in this way, <hi>ſanctified and holy</hi> to believers; and will be much more ſo in the latter day, after God ſhall <hi>pour out his fury upon the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that call not on his name.</hi> 1 Cor. vii. 14. Jer. x. 25. Zech. xiv. 20, 21. None can eſcape his vengeance but <hi>he that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth uprightly. he that deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſſions, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019485_0047_0FABAF1465289A90"/>ſtoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing evil.</hi> Theſe will be ſo far from ſupporting teachers with the power of ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force,</hi> that they will ſay, <hi>The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver, the Lord is our king, he will ſave us.</hi> Gallies and gallant ſhips ſhall then be a <hi>prey</hi> to the <hi>lame,</hi> whom they were deſigned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave or deſtroy. Iſaiah xxxiii. 14—24. His word, which is the only perfect law of liberty, contains three maxims which never ſhould be forgotten by any. Firſt, that none ſhould be choſen into office, but thoſe who have been uſeful and faithful in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſtations. Secondly, that ſuch, like the olive, fig-tree, and the vine, prefer the yielding of good fruit and happineſs to others, to any promotion or power over them, Thirdly, that the man who makes uſe of any bribes or party influence to get into office, or to keep himſelf in power, is a <hi>bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that would ſet all on fire rather than not have his will. Judges ix. 7—15. Acts xx. 28—35. Many of the primitive ſaints ſealed theſe truths with their blood, and thereby overcame the great accuſer. And as the way for the firſt coming of Chriſt was prepared by one who came in the <hi>ſpirit and power of Elias,</hi> ſo his future coming to reign on the earth will be introduced by the reſurrection of the <hi>ſouls</hi> of thoſe old martyrs; which may intend the revival of their <hi>ſpirit and power in the churches;</hi> for when they ſhall ariſe <hi>ſatan ſhall deceive the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no more,</hi> and when the two witneſſes ſhall be raiſed, <hi>time ſhall be no longer.</hi> Rev. x. 6, 7. xi. 11, 15. xii. 11. xx. 3—6. And whether both propheſies do not point to the ſame glorious event, is humbly referred to the great Ruler of the univerſe.</p>
