            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HAVING been oblig'd with the Perusal of the following Sheets, and desired to signify how far we approve them, We do freely declare our Concurrence with the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> in the main Scope and End of the Work, and heartily recommend it to those for whom it is designed, for their serious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and Acceptance in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The Performance discovers Solidity of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a deep Seriousness of Spirit, without Ostentation of Learning; and as the Author professes a high and deserved Affection to these Churches of our Lord Jesus Christ, so we humbly think he judges rightly of those Things which have at present a gloomy Aspect upon their. Welfare and Prosperity, and points out several excellent Methods to be taken to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and preserve their Strength and Glory.</p>
                  <p>We believe what he here offers to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, is the Fruit of much Tho't and Prayer,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003854_0003_10020508EF160808"/>
and hope it may prove a seasonable Piece of Service to the Churches, and be, by the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, instrumental to stablish them in the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order of the Gospel</hi> as they have been taught, and helpful to revive the <hi>Power of Godliness</hi> in them, which is so sadly decayed.</p>
                  <p>We pray God to continue to this His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Strength and Ability to do much Service for Christ and his Church, and to crown his faithful Labours with abundant Success; and especially to give him the peculiar Joy to see his <hi>own Flock</hi> standing fast in the Lord, and flourishing in all those Fruits of Righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ to the Praise and Glory of God!</p>

But I may farther say, and I would speak it in all Humility and Thankfulness, that I have hereto been emboldned and encouraged,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003854_0004_100204FC13CD3E90"/>
as well as herein assisted by the God of all Grace and holy Influences. And ye Mourners in Our Zion, who are apt to despond, and be dispirited, raise up your dejected Heads, and be of good Cheer, for there are more of the Reverend</hi> Pastors <hi>of these Churches, hearty Friends to our Constitution, than you are aware of. These Churches, as to the</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>of the Gospel, are whole at</hi> Heart. <hi>For the very Reverend</hi> Pastors, <hi>as well as the very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> Churches <hi>at</hi> Boston, <hi>have in a late</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>at</hi> Salem, (<hi>at which Council there were no less than</hi> Seven <hi>Churches belonging to that Town) made full Proof of their being</hi> Friends <hi>to the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Government. And there is no Reason to doubt, but in the</hi> Country <hi>as well as in the City, there will appear a great Number of good</hi> Friends <hi>to You, and your</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Order. <hi>Great Reason then have we to hope for a more healthy and</hi> athletick <hi>Church State. If ye, O Holy Churches, will awake, arise, and assert your</hi> Powers, <hi>and</hi> Priviledges, <hi>in fully supplying your selves with</hi> Officers <hi>according to Christ's Appointment; and do your</hi> Parts <hi>as to the maintaining of Strict</hi> Discipline <hi>in the Churches, and manage</hi> Communion <hi>one Church with another, according to the</hi> Rules <hi>in Our</hi> Platform: <hi>I am perswaded the Reverend</hi> Pastors <hi>will be ready to encourage your Hearts, and strengthen your Hands therein. For I trust their Eyes are open to see, that either we must return fully to our</hi> Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>or suffer an utter</hi> Dissolution. <hi>And if any thing I have now written, or have formerly done, 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003854_0004_100204FC13CD3E90"/>
may in any measure serve to restore Our Churches to a healthy State; I shall be willing to bear all the Invectives, hard Speeches, and rash unreasonable Censures, that the Enemies of Our</hi> Faith <hi>or</hi> Order, <hi>can utter against me. I shall ask leave to offer some Things that may serve to direct our Conduct, in such a Day of Temptation as this is; wherein I have reference to Matters of Lamentation, an Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Civil Accounts, as well as Ecclesiastical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We shall do well to keep a strict Watch over our own</hi> Hearts, <hi>and that with all diligence, as</hi> Prov. 4. 23. <hi>Let us not admit one</hi> disloyal <hi>Thought into Our Hearts. Let us heartily Love, and Pray for, our Good and Lawful</hi> King, <hi>and all the Royal Family: Remembering that our</hi> Sovereign, <hi>as well as the whole</hi> Creation, <hi>is that, and only that, to us, which God is pleased to make them.

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003854_0005_1002056E15347398"/>
their</hi> Vindication, <hi>if found Innocent, or Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Reformation, if found Guilty. How uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable a thing is it for Christians to defame their Fellow Members? and perhaps with an</hi> Air of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency. Such are ill and foul</hi> Birds; <hi>they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, are not as harmless as</hi> Doves. <hi>That</hi> Rule <hi>of Christ is shamefully neglected by Professors;</hi> Mat. 18. 15. If thy Brother trespass against thee, go and tell him his Fault between thee and him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, <hi>&amp;c. And by reason of the neglect of this first Step of</hi> Discipline, <hi>there is a great neglect of</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>in the</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Let every one continue in his particular</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: <hi>as,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 20. <hi>I am apt to fear, many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, make too bold with that</hi> Rule. <hi>It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable that many have greatly been frowned upon by God, who have deserted their</hi> Calling <hi>for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, perhaps, only more honourable, or Profitable. Every</hi> Christian <hi>should be willing to be where God would have him be; to do what God would have him do; and to suffer what God would have him suffer. On the Account of the present scarcity of</hi> Money, <hi>many are under strong Temptations to leave their</hi> Trades: <hi>I apprehend this will make bad worse. It will be but a leaping out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire. Keep to</hi> Duty, <hi>and leave the</hi> Event <hi>to God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly. and lastly, Have a Care under your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Straights and Difficulties that you don't</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>one another. Prov.</hi> 28. 3. A Poor Man that oppresseth the Poor, is like a sweeping Rain,

which leaveth no Food. <hi>It is to be feared that there is much Oppression in the</hi> Land. <hi>Our present Circumstances require that we guard against it. We should account nothing worth getting in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful way.

                  <p>SUCH as have at Heart the true Interests of <hi>New-England,</hi> and especially of the Churches therein, must needs be affected with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Situation of the Affairs thereof; and <hi>mourn in secret Places before the Lord.</hi> I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, depending upon the gracious Guidance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to exhibit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The chief <hi>Matters</hi> of Lamentation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Means</hi> which have brought us into these lamentable Circumstances.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Methods</hi> to be taken for our Relief.</p>
                  <p>As to the FIRST, I shall rank them under the <hi>three</hi> following Heads.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> of our Lamentation is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is so little of the Power of Godliness, with the Form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We profess the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> but does there want <hi>Proof</hi> as to the Decay of the Life of <hi>Religion,</hi> or the Power of Godliness? No; this is more than sufficiently proved by the Contempt cast upon <hi>Gospel Grace, Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances.</hi> By the Unchristian Contentions in <hi>Towns, Churches,</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> by notorious Excesses in <hi>lawful Liberties,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And that this is matter of Lamentation appears by what follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003854_0007_100205755E05AF28"/>1. In a <hi>Professing Country</hi> such as are destitute of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> are no better than <hi>Hypocrites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as are short of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> have never experienced the saving Efficacy of Gospel <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations</hi> and <hi>Ordinances.</hi> The Gospel not being <hi>a Savour of Life</hi> unto <hi>Life</hi> to them, is like to be a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Death unto Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such as have lived all their Days under Gospel Means, and after all die destitute of Grace and the Power of Godliness; these go to <hi>Hell</hi> when they <hi>Die,</hi> yea to the hottest place in <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the MEANS leading to this <hi>Decay</hi> of the Power of Godliness, they may be as follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) <hi>An ill treatment of the Spirit of Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under this Head, consider a few Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) <hi>The planting of Grace in the Heart of a convinced and humbled Sinner, as well as the actuating of it in the Heart of a Saint, is by the Agency and Influence of the Holy Spirit;</hi> Application-Work being his proper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>And renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2) <hi>Provocations given to the Holy Ghost, tend to his withholding these powerful Actings, and withdrawing these gracious Influences. Psal.</hi> 81. 11, 12. <hi>But my People would not hearken to my Voice, and Israel would none of me. So I gave them up to their own hearts Lusts, and they walked in their own Counsels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3) <hi>No wonder then, that when a professing People do ill treat, grieve, vex and resist the Holy Ghost, they fall under decays as to the Power of Godliness.</hi> 'Tis grievous and vexatious to, yea a resisting of the Holy Spirit, when God's Professing People violate the <hi>Covenant</hi> in any of its Branches; when they neglect or Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform the Duties of the <hi>Closet</hi> and <hi>Family.</hi> And when they watch not over their <hi>Fellow-Members</hi> in 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003854_0007_100205755E05AF28"/>
Love. When they prophane the holy <hi>Sabbath,</hi> stifle <hi>Convictions,</hi> and act contrary to their pious <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vow and don't pay.</hi> And while they are cold and careless as to the Concerns of their Souls, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; they are over-heated, and deeply engaged in their Affections, towards the Profits, Pleasures, and Preferments of the World: As also when the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of the Holy Spirit are slighted and despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Men think it not worth while to take Pains in the use of proper Means to obtain these: Don't <hi>mourn</hi> under the want of them: Nor <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> after them: when in the mean Time they rise early, fit up late, and work till they are weary and spent from Day to Day, to get the World. This their Way is their Folly, and will soon bring Godliness as to the Power of it, under sad Decays.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>An ungrateful neglect and contempt of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and especially the precious <hi>Promises</hi> thereof, <hi>tends to the Decay of Godliness in its Power.</hi> Scripture Truths are the principal Means (by Divine Appointment) of the Conversion of Sinners, as well as of the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers. John, 17. 17. <hi>Sanctify them by thy Truth, thy Word is Truth.</hi> So Psal. 19. 8. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</hi> The <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Word are the Rules of a holy Life: And the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of the Word are the most potent Arguments for, Motives and Encouragments to a holy Life. 2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Having therefore these Promises, (dearly beloved) let us cleanse our selves from all Filthiness, of the Flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holiness in the fear of the Lord.</hi> Faith laying hold on the Sufficiency and Faithfulness of God, as engaged in the Promises, will fetch into the Soul, more and more of the Fulness of Christ. <hi>For of his Fulness we receive, and Grace for Grace. John</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003854_0008_1002050755925E90"/>3. Another Occasion of the decay of Godliness in the Power of it, <hi>is the neglect or prophane Observance of Gospel Ordinances.</hi> These are the <hi>Wells</hi> of Salvation: And such as would have the <hi>Waters</hi> of Grace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, must repair to, <hi>and draw out of these Wells, and that with Joy.</hi> Isa. 12. 3. When Fruit, Trees, Grass, or Grain, (as in a Time of great Drought) want Mois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at their Roots, they wither and fall under decay; so it is with Professors when the Dews and Rains of the Holy Spirit are withheld. Such as would flourish in Grace and Godliness, must wait under the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> for the conveyance thereof from the <hi>Fountain to the Cistern</hi> thro' these <hi>Pipes.</hi> Isa. 40. last. <hi>They that wait on the Lord, shall renew their Strength, &amp;c. Gospel</hi> Ordinances, and especially the <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> are shamefully neglected by multitudes, notwithstanding the plain and positive Command of our dying <hi>Saviour, Saying, This do in Remembrance of me.</hi> Others ('tis much to be feared) do venture without due <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> without <hi>Examination,</hi> and with an unreconcilable Spirit: yea with reigning <hi>Malice,</hi> and <hi>secret Purposes</hi> of <hi>revenging</hi> Injuries, real or supposed, as they shall have Opportunity. The special Ordinances adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, as well as the Word preached, <hi>are a Sovour of Death unto Death,</hi> to the unqualified and unprepared, as they are <hi>a Savour of Life unto Life,</hi> to the penitent Believer. This should not affright Men from the Ordinances of the Gospel; but quicken them to and in the Work of Preparation, and oblige to engage therein, in the holy fear of God. Psal. 89. 7. <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the Assembly of his Saints: and to be had in Reverence of all them that are about Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Inobservance of God's Footsteps in the Course of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Providence, occasions the Decay of the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi> Christians may have sweet Communion with 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003854_0008_1002050755925E90"/>
God in his <hi>Providences,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Ordinances.</hi> There are therein such evident Manifestations of God's <hi>Dominion, Wisdom, Power, Holiness, Justice, Kindness</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> as tends to draw forth holy <hi>Fear, Faith, Love, Hope, Submission,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> fervent <hi>Prayer,</hi> and grateful <hi>Praises.</hi> Psal. 107. 43. <hi>Whoso is Wife, and will observe those Things, even they shall understand the Loving kindness of the Lord.</hi> But Infidelity, and Inobservance relating to <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> renders Persons as the <hi>Heath in the Desart;</hi> as, Jer. 17. 6. <hi>And shall not see when Good cometh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Decays as to the Power of Godliness are brought on a Professing People, by their restraining Prayer before God;</hi> as the Phrase is, Job 15. 4. <hi>Prayer</hi> is to accompany the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> The Promises are to be pleaded by Prayer. There is all the Grace, Mercy and Peace we want, in the Covenant, and in the great and precious Promises thereof: But we must wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God by fervent and effectual Prayer, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of these to us, as our Case calls for. And we have Leave to come with <hi>an holy Boldness to the Throne of Grace, and may ask for Mercy, and find Help in every Time of Need.</hi> Such Christians must needs be under sad Decays, who <hi>restrain Prayer.</hi> We must pray with all Prayer in the Spirit: And when we know not how to order our Speech before God in Prayer, by reason of Darkness, the Spirit of Supplication will help our Infirmities. 'Tis a sad <hi>Sign,</hi> as well as <hi>Cause</hi> of the Decay of Piety, when Christians seldom Pray, or when they don't Pray in Prayer: when they don't offer up <hi>strong Cries and Tears:</hi> when they don't pray with Faith and Fervency. Such are the Prayers which <hi>prevail,</hi> and obtain the Blessing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. and lastly, <hi>When a professing People cast off Fear,</hi> 'tis a sad Occasion of the decay of Godliness in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003854_0009_10026507DD72A2A0"/>
Power of it; of which holy <hi>Job</hi> was accused, but falsly in the 15. Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 4. Such as <hi>perfect Holiness, 'tis in the Fear of God.</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. Such as make Progress in Holiness, they are careful to cleanse themselves from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit. <hi>Fear</hi> has a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influence to restrain corrupt Affections and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and preserve from Filthiness of Flesh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Job. 41. 25. <hi>When he raiseth up himself, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The Fear of the Lord is clean,</hi> Psal. 19. 9. The stout-hearted <hi>Jaylor</hi> could not forbear trembling at the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and was deeply concerned, and sorely distressed about the State of his Soul, <hi>Acts,</hi> 16. 30. <hi>crying out to Paul and Silas, what shall I do to be saved?</hi> And terrifying Fear and Trembling did take hold of, and possess the Hearts of many stout-hearted Sinners, who were far from Righteousness, in the Time of the late <hi>Earthquakes:</hi> especially the <hi>first Night.</hi> Their Fear brought them to their Knees. How were the Places of publick Worship thronged! How many gave themselves to God, and his People by <hi>Covenant!</hi> Many were added to our <hi>Churches:</hi> all which evidence the Efficacy of <hi>Fear.</hi> Multitudes were apprehensive that the Day of <hi>Judgment</hi> was come. But alas! how sadly is that Scripture verified by Multitudes in the Land, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 34, 35, 36. Turn to the <hi>Place,</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and see if it be not thy Case. Thro' the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working of the Holy Spirit, there was a great and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Change wrought in <hi>Hundreds;</hi> yea according to a Judgment of Charity, on <hi>Thousands</hi> in the Land. <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> are the special Instruments the Holy Spirit uses in bringing Souls to God. What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Good can be hoped for than Heaven? What greater Evil can be feared than Hell? <hi>Hope</hi> is heartned up by the Consideration of the merciful <hi>Nature</hi> of 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003854_0009_10026507DD72A2A0"/>
God, his gracious <hi>Purposes, Promises,</hi> and <hi>Performances.</hi> And <hi>Fear</hi> is awakened by the Belief of God's <hi>Justice, Holiness</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> It was the Psalmist's Prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>Put them in Fear, O Lord, that the Nations may know that they are Men:</hi> That they are mortal, and accountable Creatures; that have precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, capable of eternal Happiness in Heaven, and liable to eternal Misery in Hell. To have <hi>Fear</hi> awakened is of use for the <hi>worst</hi> of Men, to make them fly from the Wrath which pursues them. For Evil of Punishment pursues Sinners, and will certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, if they don't speedily hide themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Shadow of Christ's Wing. And <hi>Fear</hi> is of use to the <hi>best</hi> of Men, to breed Circumspection, and Caution. Christ taught his Disciples <hi>to Fear Him who is able to destroy both Soul and body in Hell,</hi> and not Man, who <hi>kills the body only.</hi> Presumption and carnal Security arise from our putting <hi>far from us the evil Day.</hi> And the bringing it near is wont to beget the greatest Solicitude what to do to be saved.</p>
                  <p>And for this end, I shall offer my Opinion, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most amazing Event in the whole Course of Providence, from the Beginning to the End of the World. <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> the CONFLAGRATION, or Destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth, <hi>that now is</hi> by <hi>Fire,</hi> predicted most plainly, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. which being realized will excite Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Saints. <hi>Saints,</hi> in the 11. <hi>v. Seeing then that all these Things shall be dissolved, what manner of Persons ought we to be, in all holy Conversation and Godliness.</hi> Sinners, v. 14. <hi>Seeing that we look for such Things, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligint, that ye may be found of him in Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Season</hi> of this dreadful Event, as it has been generally received and declared, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>after the final Judgment,</hi> I humbly dissent, and shall offer some Arguments against it; as,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003854_0010_1002650998D3BA68"/>1. If it be at this Season, when Saints are safely housed in Heaven, and Sinners closely imprisoned in Hell; I can't see how this Event should be so <hi>terrible, and amazing,</hi> or how the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> could from this Consideration fetch forcible and perswasive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, <hi>for Reconciliation to God,</hi> and <hi>excelling Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as in the forecited <hi>Texts.</hi> What is there so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying in setting an old House on fire, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are far enough off, and out of all Danger.?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If this will be the Season, <hi>none will by the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration loose their natural Life.</hi> For there is no <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Death,</hi> nor Resurrection from the dead after the <hi>Final Judgment.</hi> But I will advance several Arguments to prove that <hi>Millions</hi> of Lives will be lost at the Conflagration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The World will be destroyed by Fire, in the same Sense that it was by Water,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 6, 7. <hi>Whereby the World that then was, being overflowed with Water, perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the same Word are kept in Store, reserved unto Fire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Day of Judgment, and Perdition of Ungodly Men.</hi> That is against <hi>that Day,</hi> when the Holy God shall inflict a Punishment upon all ungodly Men, which shall be to their Perdition. We read, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Bringing in the Flood upon the World of the Ungodly.</hi> The ungodly World perished by <hi>Water;</hi> so they will by <hi>Fire.</hi> An Emblem thereof we had in the Destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scripture speaks expresly to this Truth: as, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>For behold the Day cometh that shall burn as an Oven, and all the Proud, yea, and all that do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly shall be stubble, and the Day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Root nor Branch.</hi> And they shall be burnt to <hi>Ashes, v.</hi> 3. The Means of their Perdition, shall be

the Heavens and Earth all on a <hi>light Fire, Psal.</hi> 50. 3, 4. Of this most terrible Day speaks the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> 12. Chap. 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>I apprehend the <hi>Season</hi> of this most awful Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be, when <hi>Antichrist</hi> will receive its deadly Wound, its <hi>utter overthrow,</hi> and ruin; and <hi>before the happy State</hi> of the Church. As sure as Antichrist had its <hi>Rise,</hi> so sure will it have its <hi>Ruin.</hi> It shall be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually <hi>consumed,</hi> and then at length utterly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</hi> Dan. 7. 26. 2 Thes. 2. 8. Some of the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians</hi> were troubled, under Apprehensions that Christ's coming was very near, just at the Door, and was what they had reason to expect every Day. The <hi>Apostle</hi> undeceives them in the following Words; and tells them, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> must first have his <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Reign,</hi> and then CHRIST will <hi>destroy him</hi> by <hi>the Brightness of his coming.</hi> And altho' it is God's pleasure to <hi>secreet</hi> the particular <hi>Hour</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> of his coming, that his Church may be kept in a wakeful, watchful Posture, might shake off Security and Sloth, and be painful and prayerful, left Christ at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should find them in a sensual Frame, and idle; <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 32. Yet there are some <hi>Signs</hi> laid down in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and elsewhere, of <hi>his coming,</hi> and some Light given us to discern the advances of this <hi>great and terrible Day of the Lord.</hi> For the <hi>Space</hi> between the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Ruin</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is allowed by all to be <hi>Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years.</hi> Sometimes expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more obscurely by <hi>Time, Times, and a half Time;</hi> as Dan. 7. 25. That is, <hi>Three Years and a half.</hi> Sometimes by <hi>Forty two Months.</hi> Sometimes by 1260 <hi>Days.</hi> As, Rev. 11. 2. 3. <hi>Prophetical Days.</hi> i. e. <hi>Years.</hi> Now if we can find out the Time when Antichrist <hi>Began,</hi> we may find out his End. We find in 2. Thes. <hi>who it was</hi> that <hi>let,</hi> or hindred the Rise of the Man of

Sin; <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>Romans Emperors.</hi> Therefore they can <hi>lett</hi> no longer than they <hi>reign.</hi> And as the Sagacious Mr. <hi>Joseph Mede</hi> observes, <hi>Augustulus</hi> the last <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> was deposed in the Year of our Lord 476: add hereto, 1260, and the Sum Total is 1736. God has frowned upon the over curious Enquirers into these secret Things, by disappointing them; and so he may upon Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> However if he err, he will not err alone; for many <hi>Divines</hi> fall in with him in this Opinion. All that I shall add is, the Expiration of the 1260 Years, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the Rise, to the utter Ruin of Antichrist, must needs be near run out. And it seems very probable that the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Ruin</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> will be the <hi>Season</hi> of the <hi>Destruction of the World</hi> that now is, by <hi>Fire.</hi> 2. Thes. 1. 8. 2 Thes. 2. 8. Immediately before this Day, all things will be as they were for many Generations past. So it was in <hi>Sodom:</hi> They had a fair Morning; the Sun arose and shone upon the Earth; nevertheless it was a dreadful Day to the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Christ will come as a <hi>Thief. And when they say Peace and Safety,</hi> (<hi>in a way</hi> of self flattery) <hi>then sudden Destruction shall come upon them, as Travel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Woman with Child, and they shall not escape.</hi> 'Tis probable that this dismal Dispensation will <hi>preceed</hi> the happy State of the <hi>Church.</hi> For we read, 2 Pet. 3. 13. <hi>Nevertheless we, according to his Promise, look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> Which Promise I apprehend to be the same with the Promises in the Old <hi>Testament,</hi> especially in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> concerning the abounding Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Grace and Peace, Prosperity and Safety of the Church of Christ on Earth; as, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 6. to the end. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 65th. from the 17 <hi>v.</hi> to the end. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>O then! let the secure World, drowned in sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,

and sunk into a deep Sleep of carnal Security; that flatter themselves by saying, The evil Day is afar off; <hi>awake out of Sleep:</hi> And as you are hastening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the coming of the day of God; O! look out sharp for this dreadful Day, <hi>wherein the Heavens being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the Elements shall melt with servent Heat: the Earth also and the Works therein shall be burnt up.</hi> Give your selves no rest till you are found of God in Peace. O! what manner of Persons ought we to be in all holy Conversation and Godliness? Such as are found in their Sins on that Day, will <hi>cry to the Rocks and Mountains to fall upon them, and hide them from the Wrath of the lamb: For the Day of his Wrath is come.</hi> As, Rev. 6. The Generality of the Professing World will not take warning, as the Old World did not, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 26, 27, 28. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 35, 36. <hi>For as a Snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole Earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.</hi> The Old World had Warning an <hi>Hundred and twenty Years</hi> before the <hi>Flood</hi> came, and even <hi>seven Days</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood; but they took no Notice of the one or others, and are said not to know of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 38, 39. <hi>For as in the Days that were before the Flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in Marriage, until the Day that Noah entred into the Ark, and knew not until the Flood came and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.</hi> Some will be heaping up <hi>Treasure for the last Days;</hi> as <hi>James</hi> 5. 3. to be burnt up: Others will <hi>burn</hi> in inordinate and unnatural <hi>Lusts,</hi> till the Flame catch hold of them, as in <hi>Sodom.</hi> Some of you may know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Terrors of that Day, by your Horrors on that Night, when you felt the <hi>Shakes,</hi> and heard

the <hi>Roars</hi> of the <hi>Earthquakes.</hi> But you will find a vast Difference between the meer seeming Appearance and the certain Reality of Christ's coming.</p>
                  <p>But what will become of the Godly in this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Day? I answer in the Words of the Holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver the Godly out of Temptation.</hi> He saved <hi>Noah,</hi> v. 5. <hi>and delivered just Lot.</hi> v. 7. He saved the pious and prayerful, when he destroyed <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> By the Wonder-working Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, they had Liberty to go out of the Gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and by the same Divine Hand were guided to <hi>Pella,</hi> and there preserved. And in this Day, God will gather his Saints together, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 4. <hi>He will make up his Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. <hi>And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> (That is, they that feared the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 16.) <hi>In that Day when I make up my Jewels; and I will spare them as a Man spareth his Son that serveth him.</hi> There is a gracious Promise made by God to his People, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>And at that Time thy People shall be delivered.</hi> And as to the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of God's manifesting his Sufficiency, Faithfulness and Love to his People, it appears to be by <hi>taking them up to himself in the Air;</hi> as, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16. And at their Return they shall see with Hearts full of Wonder and Gratitude, the Difference made by God between the Righteous and the Wicked, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 18. and shall tread on the <hi>Ashes</hi> of the wicked, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Wherefore comfort one another with these Words,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Sinners in Sion may well be afraid,</hi> and <hi>Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling take hold of Hypocrites,</hi> when God shall arise to judge the World; when the Earth shall tremble and totter; when the Air shall be filled with Flame and amazing Thunder; when the Frame of Nature shall be dissolved. And are there not <hi>Signs</hi> of the near

Approach of this great and terrible Day, both in the Kingdom of <hi>Nature,</hi> and in the Kingdom of <hi>Grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In the Kingdom of Nature.</hi> Have there not been <hi>Earthquakes</hi> in divers Places? Have they not been multiplied beyond what any former Age hath expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced? And altho' in our Land we have been thereby (thro' the tender Mercy of a gracious long-suffering God) more scared than hurt, yet other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been dreadfully dissolated thereby. Again, have there not been unusual <hi>Lightnings,</hi> so that the Heavens seemed to be in a <hi>Blaze?</hi> Hath there not been unusual <hi>Darkness</hi> at Times by Day, and at other Times surprizing <hi>Lights</hi> by Night? according to what is written, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 11. <hi>And great Earthquakes shall be in divers Places, and Famines, and Pestilences, and fearful Sights and great Signs shall there be from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In the Kingdom of Grace.</hi> Is there not abundance of Security and Sensuality in the visible Church? And don't the Wise, as well as the foolish <hi>Virgins</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to slumber and sleep? And at what a low Ebb is Religion in the <hi>Protestant</hi> and purest Churches? How unaccountable and amazing is it, that a <hi>Nation</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged above any Nation under Heaven, (the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation excepted) by being early converted to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and early reformed from <hi>Antichristian Errors;</hi> and ever since singularly defended, and blessed by uncommon Measures of Gospel <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> That <hi>this</hi> Nation, thus distinguish'd, should become a Sink of filthy Lewdness and abominable Uncleanness! Yea, that the Sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> should be found in Her. And not only so, but Soul destructive <hi>Errors</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and spreading there, as, <hi>Atheism, Deism, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism,</hi> and <hi>Arminianism!</hi> All which evidence the

sad Decay of the Power of Godliness. Surely we may think that <hi>Satan's</hi> Time is but short, seeing he is come down in such Wrath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. It is high Time for such as would not perish with the ungodly World, to have no farther Fellowship with them in their corrupt Principles and Practices, <hi>Lest they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their Plagues.</hi> 2. Cor. 17. 18. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean Thing; and I will receive you, and I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord God Almighty.</hi>

My Desire is that you don't any longer neglect the important Affairs of your own and your Children's <hi>Souls.</hi> Neglect not Christ and Grace. Comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking, <hi>Labour not for the Meat which perisheth, but for that Meat which endureth to Everlasting Life.</hi> John 6. 27. <hi>Seek first the Kingdom of God, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness thereof.</hi> Our Affections should be moderated towards worldly Possessions, and the Gratifications of the Senses. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 30, 31. <hi>But this I say Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have Wives, be as tho' they had none; and they that weep as tho' they wept not; and they that Rejoyce, as tho' they rejoyced not; and they that buy as tho' they possessed not; and they that use this World as not abusing it: for the Fashion of this World passeth away.</hi> Phil. 4. 5. <hi>Let your Moderation be known unto all men; the Lord is at hand.</hi> See the Want and the Worth of a Saviour; and above all things, labour to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>win</hi> him, that you may at that great and terrible Day of the Lord, (which is very near) be found of him in Peace, without Spot and Blamless.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003854_0013_1002051867916118"/>I come to the Third Thing, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> to shew,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The METHODS to be taken to recover or mantain the Power of Godliness.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Magistrates would do well by good Laws to suppress such Customs and Usages of the Nations which tend to Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiousness, and carnal Security;</hi> and also to the utmost of their Power, to promote, establish and support Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and encourage those that teach the good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ministers would do well in Compassion to a perishing World, to use utmost Care, Diligence and Zeal in plucking Sinners out of the Burning.</hi> Jude 2. 23. <hi>Of some have Compassion, making a Difference; of others save with Fear, plucking them out of the Fire.</hi> Sound <hi>Doctrine</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and powerfully to be preached; and strict <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> is impartially to be practiced.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Christians would do well to associate for religious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</hi> Prayer is a principal Exercise to maintain the Power of Godliness. Solitary, in the <hi>Closet;</hi> private, in the <hi>Family;</hi> and less <hi>Publick,</hi> in the private Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the <hi>Saints.</hi> And doubtless, for every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to have an intimate Friend, to whom he may speak most freely, and upon Occasion unbosome himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it may be of Singular Use to maintain vital Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Eccl. 4. 9. <hi>Two are better than one.</hi> v. 10. <hi>For if they fall, the one will lift up his Fellow; But wo to him that is alone when he falleth.</hi> They that fear the Lord, should often speak together; and declaring what God has done for their Souls, is a special Means to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, encourage and comfort others. God observes and approves this Communication, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003854_0014_1002650B255E0270"/>4. <hi>Parents may do much in maintaining the Power of Godliness;</hi> by being Exemplary themselves, and by giving a Religious Education to their Children, and to all under their Care.</p>
                  <p>Such young Persons as are brought up ignorantly, and in a disorderly Way, seldom prove well. Such as have an irreligious Education, commonly prove Plagues to the <hi>Towns, Families</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> to which they belong. Such as are well taught, well governed, and the Subjects of many Prayers, are wont to prove great Blessings in their Generation.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this head, Let us all lament the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays of the Power of Godliness, and the principal Cause of it; the sorrowful withdrawing of the Spirit of all Grace. Let us welcome the inbreathings and outpowrings of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> Let us cherish his Motions. Let us plead the <hi>Promises.</hi> Let us worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partake of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and wisely observe <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> taking due Notice of the Footsteps thereof. Let us watch, and be sober. Let us avoid all <hi>Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of, and the <hi>first Motions</hi> to Sin. Let us resist the Devil: Fear always: and Finally, Let us love and wait for the coming of the Lord. In a Word, let us submit to God's <hi>Dominion;</hi> depend upon his <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency;</hi> take our full Contentment in his <hi>Goodness;</hi> and devote our selves unto his Service for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is a Matter of Lamentation, That some of Our <hi>Young Men,</hi> and such as are devoted to and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for, the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> are under <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> against, and fall off from, important Articles of the <hi>Faith</hi> of these <hi>Churches,</hi> and cast a favourable Eye upon, embrace, and as far as they dare, <hi>argue</hi> for, <hi>propagate,</hi> and <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Arminian Scheme.</hi> There are 
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003854_0014_1002650B255E0270"/>
many dark Clouds hang over <hi>New-England,</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> therein; but I apprehend this to be as dark and dismal as any. I am bold to say, that the <hi>Arminian Scheme</hi> is another <hi>Gospel,</hi> than what <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> did preach. And consequently the Propagators and Preachers thereof fall under the <hi>Curse</hi> pronounced by the <hi>Apostle Paul,</hi> when under the <hi>infallible Guidance</hi> and immediate <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the Holy Ghost; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>But tho' we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you, than that we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</hi> And for the greater Solemnity, and to shew of what Importance it was, and that it might make a deep Impression on Men's Minds, he repeats it in the 9th. verse. And is it not a lamentable Thing for Men to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others under the fearful Curse of God? But I am apprised 'tis my Work to prove the <hi>Arminian Scheme</hi> or Principles are another <hi>Gospel</hi> than what <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> preached, or than is revealed to us in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Proof of the aforesaid Assertion, I shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the following <hi>Arguments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Arminian Scheme</hi> vacates that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Distinction of the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> into <hi>secret</hi> and <hi>Revealed.</hi> We find this Distinction in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. <hi>The secret Things,</hi> 
                     <abbr>viz.</abbr> of God's <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Decrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God; but those things which are revealed, belong to us, and our Children for ever; that we may do all the Words of this Law.</hi> The <hi>Decree</hi> of God (say the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi>) is God's Purpose to <hi>save</hi> such as believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and persevere therein to the End of Life; and also to <hi>Damn</hi> all such as persist in their Impenitency, and Unbelief unto Death. And is not this the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will of God? as in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003854_0015_1002052150B4A450"/>
shall be saved; and he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> There is a real Distinction between the secret, and the revealed Will of God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>revealed</hi> Will of God shews what should be, what is Matter of <hi>Duty;</hi> the <hi>secret</hi> Will of God shews what shall be as to the <hi>Event.</hi> With respect to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will of God, <hi>some are Vessels of Mercy,</hi> some <hi>of Wrath;</hi> Some are chosen to Salvation, others are left. Yea, appointed to Wrath, as, 1 Thes. 5. 9. <hi>For God hath not appointed us to Wrath, but to obtain Salvation thro' our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> We may well with the <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> cry out, O the depth! These are Acts of <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,</hi> beyond our Comprehension. And all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>God</hi> is pleased to give to us for the present of this tremendous Affair is, because 'tis the <hi>good pleasure of his Will. Eph.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> According to the <hi>Arminian Scheme, Faith</hi> is the <hi>Cause,</hi> at least the Antecedent of <hi>Election;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as according to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> 'tis the Effect or Fruit. For this is their <hi>Opinion,</hi> that such as believe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in Faith and Obedience, are elected to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may rather be called <hi>Postdestination</hi> than <hi>Predestination.</hi> For say they, as in the <hi>New Body of Divinity</hi> concerning God's Decrees, it being much more equitable, that God defers making any <hi>fix'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> concerning particular Men, until he sees the Thread of their Lives, either in a course of Obedience or Disobedience, quite run out. This Book rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the Title of a <hi>Bundle</hi> of <hi>Errors,</hi> than of a <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Divinity:</hi> for the Principles therein contained, derive not their <hi>Original</hi> from the BIBLE, but from <hi>Arminius.</hi> And if we observe what <hi>Authors</hi> this is an extract from, it gives Occasion to remember those Words of Christ, Mat. 11, 25. <hi>At that time Jesus answered and said, I 
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003854_0015_1002052150B4A450"/>
thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast bid these Things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes.</hi> So 1 Cor. 2. 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>For ye see your Calling, Brethren, how that not Many wise Men after the Flesh, not many mighty, not many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are called. But God hath chosen the foolish Things of the World to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak Things of the World to confound the Things that are mighty; and base Things of the World, and Things that are despised, &amp;c. that no Flesh should Glory in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to the Argument: Instead of God's working all things <hi>according to the Counsel of his own Will,</hi> these Men (left God's <hi>Decrees</hi> or <hi>Prescience,</hi> should incroach upon, or abridge Man's free will) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert He must wait until Man has quite run out the Thread of Life, in a Course of Obedience or Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and then He may have their good Leave to <hi>fix</hi> their <hi>State</hi> by a certain <hi>Decree.</hi> How preposterous and absurd is this, to make the First Cause to wait upon the Second; the Will of God, subservient to the Will of Man? And how contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which asserts, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>For the Children being not yet born, neither having done Good nor Evil, that the Purpose of God according to Election might stand; not of Works, but of him that calleth,</hi> v. 13. <hi>as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</hi> And by this Means they make the <hi>Decree,</hi> and the <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it contemporary. But on the contrary, the Scripture asserts, that <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Election.</hi> Sinners are drawn to Christ in a way of believing, by the Cords of electing and everlasting Love, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>My Sheep</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>hear my Voice.</hi> So <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. <hi>As many as were ordained to everlasting Life, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> There is more than a Moral Swasion required in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003854_0016_1002650CE0E668B8"/>
order to Faith. Almighty Power must be put forth, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <hi>The same Power that raised Christ from the dead.</hi> A creating and quickening Power. It is by the Efficacy and Causality of the Holy Spirit to Regenerate, renew, and enable to believe. Christ is said to be the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finisher</hi> of Faith, Heb. 12. 2. <hi>'Tis God that worketh in us both to Will, and to Do, according to his good pleasure.</hi> And 'tis a day of God's <hi>Power,</hi> when of <hi>unwilling any Soul is made willing, Psal.</hi> 110. 2. And who are they that are thus wrought upon? We are told, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Moreover whom He did predestinate, them he also called,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Arminians Originate</hi> the Salvation of such as are saved, in the free Motion, Option, and Determination of their own Wills. But the <hi>Scripture</hi> declares quite the contrary. Such as are effectually called, 'tis according to God's <hi>Purpose, Rom.</hi> 8. 25. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 15, 16. <hi>I will have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy: And I will have Compassion on whom I will have Compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Arminian Scheme</hi> cannot be according to the Scripture; for this is one <hi>Principle</hi> of it; That Christ has by his <hi>Mediation</hi> and <hi>Merits,</hi> restored fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man to a Capacity of obtaining Eternal Life, by the well and wise Improvement of the <hi>Stock,</hi> by this Means, put into his Hands. And so Christ <hi>merited,</hi> that we might <hi>merit.</hi> It is not consistent with <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> to entrust sinful, fallen Man, with a <hi>Stock,</hi> the well or ill Improvement thereof, was of such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, both with respect to God's Glory, and Man's Happiness, after he proved Man in the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Perfection, and found him false and unable 
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003854_0016_1002650CE0E668B8"/>
to stand. God did not put any <hi>Confidence</hi> in Man, in his <hi>best estate;</hi> therefore, from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> he made Provision for the worst; laid in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> a firm Foundation for the Salvation of his <hi>Elect.</hi> And <hi>the Foundation of God stands sure; the Lord knows who are his.</hi> And will God put any <hi>trust</hi> in Man fallen? No; If he enters into a second Covenant, 'tis in and by a Surety, even Jesus Christ, <hi>who is a Surety of a better Testament, Heb.</hi> 7. 22. Who among Men will take the <hi>Bond</hi> of a poor and insolvent Person, unless he has a <hi>Bondsman?</hi> And is <hi>Man</hi> wiser than <hi>God?</hi> Is it consistent with God's <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to leave it in the <hi>Power</hi> of Man, to frustrate all God's gracious <hi>Intentions,</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> for Man's Salvation? Yea, and the Death of Christ to be in vain?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Arminian Scheme</hi> is inconsistent with God's great <hi>End</hi> of saving Sinners by Jesus Christ. <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> the Glory of God's <hi>sovereign, free, rich Grace.</hi> This is God's professed and ultimate End and Aim; as, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>Having predestinated us unto the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children, by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his Will; to the Praise of the Glory of his Grace.</hi> So <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>In whom we have obtained an Inheritance, being predestinated, according to the Purpose of him who worketh all things according to the Counsel of his own Will: that we should be to the praise of his Glory, who first trusted in Christ. Arminians</hi> take from <hi>free Grace,</hi> and give to <hi>free Will.</hi> For what End think you, did God permit Man to fall? but because it gave Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the Exercise and Manifestation of the Riches of his Grace and Mercy, in saving him by Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Arg.</hi> This Way of Salvation opens a Door un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003854_0017_1002052A659F9F50"/>
and gives Occasion for, boasting: But the Gospel way of a Sinner's Salvation excludes boasting. Rom. 3. 27. <hi>Where is boasting then? it is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this impleaded Scheme, <hi>Judas</hi> is as much beholden to God, as <hi>Peter;</hi> And all the Reason that <hi>Peter</hi> is saved, and <hi>Judas</hi> is damned, is because he wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved his <hi>free Will,</hi> and other <hi>Abilities;</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did ill improve the same.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Arminian Scheme</hi> takes from our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and saving <hi>Faith,</hi> an essential Part of it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> our <hi>resting</hi> and <hi>trusting</hi> in Christ for Salvation. Now this is essential to <hi>Faith;</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> is many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, by <hi>trusting in Christ;</hi> as, Eph. 1. 12, 13. and elsewhere. But according to them, <hi>Faith</hi> is only such an <hi>Assent</hi> to Gospel Truths, as is productive of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the Gospel. Besides, according to their Principles, Christ has set them upon their <hi>Legs;</hi> and they must shift for themselves: He has put them into a Capacity, (to good purpose) to deal with God for eternal Life.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Arg.</hi> According to the Arminian Scheme, there is no need of a work of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or passive <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> For all Men are made <hi>alive by Christ:</hi> and all that they need, is the well improvement of <hi>free Will,</hi> and <hi>self Sufficiency.</hi> But Christ teaches an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Work of <hi>Regeneration, John</hi> 3. 3. which has various Denominations in Scripture; as the <hi>Law written in the Heart, the circumcision of the Heart, a Heart of Flesh, a new Creature, the Divine Nature, the Image of God, a Well of Water, Grace,</hi> &amp;c. And without this, the <hi>Heart</hi> will never be <hi>right with God;</hi> neither will there be more than the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> nothing 
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003854_0017_1002052A659F9F50"/>
of the <hi>Power.</hi> We may as well act <hi>Rationally,</hi> without <hi>a Rational Soul,</hi> as exercise <hi>Grace</hi> without a <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Principle of <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Arg.</hi> According to <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles we are <hi>justified</hi> by our <hi>Gospel Obedience,</hi> and inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; not by the Righteousness of Christ <hi>imputed</hi> by God, and received by <hi>Faith,</hi> according to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. <hi>Yea, doubtless, I count all things but less, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And I do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is of the Law; but that which is thro' the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith.</hi> So Tit. 3. 15. <hi>Not by works of Righteousness which we have done; but according to his Mercy be saved us; by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Arg.</hi> According to this <hi>Scheme,</hi> there is no <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi> of Eternal Salvation in this Life. But Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may have <hi>Assurance</hi> long before they die. As, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. Why else are we commanded to make our <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> sure? as, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. Christians in all Generations can give in their Testimony to this Truth, from their certain, and sweet <hi>Experience.</hi> There is the <hi>Joy</hi> of Faith, and the <hi>Joy</hi> of Salvation, which may be lost for a Time. Hence <hi>David</hi> prayeth, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>that it may be restored.</hi> Whence else flows that <hi>strong Consolation</hi> spoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. which the Heirs of the Promises are made to partake of?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Arg.</hi> According to <hi>Arminian Princpiles,</hi> such as are in a State of Grace may fall from it, and that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and finally. But this is not according to the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003854_0018_100265102E484058"/>
Scripture. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he that has begun a good Work in you, will perfect it to the Day of the Lord.</hi> These saving <hi>Gifts</hi> to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ones, are without <hi>Repentance.</hi> The certain <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance</hi> of Saints in Grace to Glory, is secured by that <hi>Golden Chain, Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. <hi>Whom he,</hi> &amp;c. This sweet Truth is built upon a sure Foundation as the Immutability of the Divine <hi>Purpose;</hi> the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Divine <hi>Promises;</hi> the inseperable <hi>Union</hi> of Believers to Christ; the <hi>indwelling</hi> of the Holy Spirit in every gracious Person. They know God and Christ too well <hi>Voluntarily</hi> to forsake him; for the fear of God is in their Hearts. Christ their <hi>Surety,</hi> undertakes that none shall pluck them out of his Hands. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Apostle triumphs, as Rom. 8. 33. <hi>Who shall be able to separate us from the Love of God?</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Arminian Scheme</hi> makes the way of Salvation so plain and easy, that the <hi>Natural Man</hi> seeth his Way plain before him: 'Tis only assenting to Gospel Truths, and setting themselves to obey the Precepts, and imitate the Examples of the Gospel. Yea, the Way is so plain, that the Heathen by a well improvement of the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> will not fail of Heaven. And is this the <hi>straight Gate</hi> and <hi>narrow Way</hi> that we must strive to enter in? And are not the Righteous scarcely saved? And are not the saved of the Lord <hi>few,</hi> a <hi>Remnant,</hi> and that <hi>according to the Election of Grace?</hi> According to these Men, we have no need to have one solicitous Thought, whether we are elected, or whether we are regenerated, or have Union to Christ, or whether the Holy Spirit dwells in us. The Gospel way of Salvation is full of <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> We read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. of the Revelation of 
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003854_0018_100265102E484058"/>
the Mystery. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Having made known to us the Mysterty of his Will.</hi> The way of Salvation by Faith, is above the Natural Man to understand it; as it is above his Ability to comply with the Terms of it. 'Tis supernatural, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God: for they are Foolishness to him; neither can be know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> And to make the way of Salvation so wide as that the Heathen can walk in it, is contrary to what Christ has taught us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 13, 14. And contrary to what is written <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>How then shall they call on him on whom they have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? And, how can they be saved, unless they call upon him? as v.</hi> 13. They are <hi>without God, without Christ, without Covenant,</hi> and consequently <hi>without Hope.</hi> For <hi>where there is no Vision, the People perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Arminian Scheme</hi> is very grateful and agreable to the Sentiments of Men in their natural State. They imbibe Opinions with great Pleasure; and therefore they are not agreable to the Gospel. The Gospel Way of a Sinner's Salvation is what the natural Man is prejudiced against, and averse unto; for it is Supernatural, it is above Humane Nature, and contrary to corrupt Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind is Enmity against God; for it it not subject to his Law, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                     </hi> the Law of Faith, <hi>neither indeed can be.</hi> There is as great an Aversion in the natural carnal Mind to Gospel Truths, as there is in the carnal Will to Gosepl Rules. I proceed,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To enquire into the MEANS leading towards
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003854_0019_100205300671D378"/>
                     <hi>Arminianism:</hi> And I apprehend it to be thus; Our young Men are apt to look upon old Books, as Men do upon old Houses, to be of little Worth; because not built according to the new Mode. And hearing some late Authors highly commended by those that are corrupted by them: and these corrupt Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very agreeable to a nice Taste, as to their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and as agreeable as to the Matter, suiting their Proud and self conceited Hearts, by exalting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling <hi>free Will,</hi> and <hi>self Sufficiency:</hi> They presently and greedily suck in those Opinions, and never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use our <hi>professed Principles</hi> impartially and without Prejudice, and are ready to reject them before they understand them. And these accursed, poisonous and Soul damning Principles being wrap'd up in <hi>sweet Language,</hi> are swallowed down and retained. I come</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To direct to the METHODS to save some from these destructive <hi>Paths,</hi> and to recover others out of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the first Place, being fairly possessed of the Principles of Faith, professed by these Churches, I think you are bound to examine them strictly and impartially, and see whether they be not agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, (which are the professed Rule of the Faith as well as the Manners of all <hi>Protestants</hi>) If they be not deduced from, and agreeable to, the Scriptures, you may warrantably reject them, tho' professed by your Fathers. For I acknowledge we are to call no Man, or Number of Men <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Master,</hi> so as to pin our Faith upon their Sleeve. But if they are built upon the Holy Scripture, we must believe, profess, and hold them fast at our Peril. Yea, 'tis our Duty to content earnestly for the Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="27" facs="unknown:003854_0019_100205300671D378"/>2. Compare the Professed Faith of these Churches, with the Faith of <hi>Protestant Reformed</hi> Churches abroad, and if agreeable to the <hi>Faith</hi> of the purest and holiest <hi>Churches,</hi> we should be very slow in rejecting them; or rather should hold them fast. For there is but <hi>one Faith,</hi> Eph. 4. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Observe what are the <hi>Fruits</hi> and Effects of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Arminian Doctrines</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Is God wont to pour down his Spirit with such Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? I thing it has brought Religion (as to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it) to a very low Ebb. And good reason for it; for can we rationally suppose that the Holy Spirit, (who alone it is that gives converting and saving Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to the Word preached) will co-work with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? by no means: 'tis the Word of Truth that he joyns in with: <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul,</hi> Psal. 19. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is by the Word of God preached.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider seriously of what is written 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Because they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved. And for this Cause God shall send them strong Delusion, that they should believe a lie, and that they might be damned, who believe not the Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Dear Brethren! give me leave to address you with Warmth. Is it not a fearful Thing to be under Darkness and Delusion, in an Affair wherein your Souls and their eternal Felicity are so nearly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? O how sad is it to be misguided, and to go to Hell, under strong Confidence of going to Heaven! To be misled and wander in the Dark till you fall suddenly into the <hi>Ditch</hi> of Hell; and not only destroy
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003854_0020_10026512F38262D8"/>
your selves, but to manage so as that it may be truly said of you, <hi>the blind lead the blind, and they both fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ditch.</hi> You had better be Porters, yea Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Sweepers all your Days, than to have scores and hundreds of damned Wretches cursing you bitterly in Hell, for guiding them into the wrong way. You may be confident that your Opinions are right; as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, that Christ was an <hi>Impostor,</hi> and not the promised Messiah; <hi>For had they known, they would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Yet 'tis with you as it was with them, they did not know that they were right. But the <hi>Disciples</hi> were able to say as in John 6. 69. <hi>And we believe and are sure, that thou art Christ the Son of the Living God.</hi> So you may have a strong Confidence of Arminian Principles, that they are <hi>Sound;</hi> but true Believers are able with boldness to say, with the Disciples, <hi>we believe and are sure, they are corrupt</hi> and poisonous Principles. I am able to say, as one said when disputing with <hi>Quakers,</hi> I was a <hi>Quaker</hi> before I was a <hi>Christian:</hi> so I was an <hi>Arminian</hi> before I was a <hi>Christian.</hi> But God of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy has brought me off from that unsafe and false Way. And I can be positive in this Thing, that if I had an hundred times as much Grace as I have, and were set by God in the State and Circumstances as <hi>Arminians</hi> are (according to their Principles) set, and there left, I should be as surely damned, as I am now alive. For Corruption in the best is stronger than Grace: And are there not Snares laid for our Souls almost every Step we take? And have we not to engage with the <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> the <hi>roaring Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Malignant Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon?</hi> were not <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foiled in the Days of their Temptation? Our Strength is so weak, our Enemies are so many, so mighty, so crafty; that we have need to <hi>watch,</hi> 
                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:003854_0020_10026512F38262D8"/>
and be <hi>sober,</hi> to be <hi>circumspect,</hi> and <hi>stedfast,</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> that we be not led into <hi>Temptation,</hi> and overcome by Temptations. And if the strongest are left of God, to the Power of Temptation, it will be an evil Day with them. Our Security is in having the Holy Spirit to <hi>dwell</hi> in us, and by his powerful Aids and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, to strengthen to Duty, and against Sin; and in having Christ our <hi>Surety</hi> and <hi>Intercessor,</hi> who alone can recover us in a way of bitter Repentance, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reliance on him, when <hi>fallen;</hi> and He alone can keep us from <hi>falling:</hi> for we are <hi>preserved in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> Jude 1. <hi>And we are kept by the mighty Power of God, thro' Faith, unto Salvation,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. and lastly, Labour to know your <hi>Hearts,</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and don't rest 'till you have experienced a thorow Work of Conversion or Regeneration. To be thorowly convinced of Sin and Misery, and deeply humbled under the Sight and Sense of it, and really regenerated, is the most effectual Security against cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Practices;</hi> and especially against <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianism;</hi> for 'tis <hi>Pride</hi> that prompts thereto. Christians see that in their own Hearts, that Pride, Baseness, and Falseness, that will effectually preserve them from these <hi>Presumptions,</hi> and carnal <hi>Confidences.</hi> Men may go far in a <hi>Civil, Moral</hi> Way in practicing the Externals of Religion: They may have strong Confidences of their good Estate: They may advance far in Humane Learning, and yet be Strangers to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation: Witness that great and good Man <hi>Dr. Frank;</hi> an account hereof we have of his own draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and it has been lately published among us; when about twenty four Years old, he experienced a sound Work of <hi>Conversion;</hi> and was eminent as for Learning, so especially for <hi>Faith, Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="unknown:003854_0021_100204EAED0DF750"/>
to the Death. I will conclude by leaving one Thing more for your Consideration, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> Faith objectively, as well as subjectively considered, by how much the more it has been tried, by so much the more gracious it is, according to what you find in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>That the trial of your Faith being much more precious than Gold that perisheth, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Faith I am pleading for, has been tried, in ten thousand Instances; and it has endured the Fire of Martyrdom. <hi>i. e.</hi> such have who professed it. But I never understood that any have suffered Martyrdom for the <hi>Arminian</hi> Faith. Will you then renounce a Faith that has been <hi>tried</hi> to the quick, to embrace a Faith that never was <hi>tried?</hi> Far be it from you.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I come to the Third and last Instance I shall give as Matter of Lamentation, and that is, The present weak and shattered <hi>State</hi> of Our <hi>Churches,</hi> on the account of their <hi>Order, Government,</hi> and <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is evident to every Person of Observation. Hence Particular Churches run into Confusion. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are <hi>aggrieved,</hi> and abide Year after Year in their sorrowful Circumstances. And a farther Evidence thereof, is the Ineffectualness of <hi>Councils</hi> to relieve the aggrieved, and to make Peace. As also <hi>Anti-Councils,</hi> whereby contrary Results are given on the same Case, to the great Reproach of <hi>Councils,</hi> and Blemish of Our <hi>Church Government,</hi> and discouragement of the aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who are ready to lie under their Troubles as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediless. Hence it is that some <hi>Councils</hi> have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>aggrieved,</hi> to promise to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce in the determination of the Council, before they heard the Case, by which their Consciences have been ensnared, and the Council turned into a Solemn <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration.</hi> 
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003854_0021_100204EAED0DF750"/>
This therefore is Matter of just Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I come to enquire,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Into the MEANS which have brought us under these Lamentable Circumstances. In a Word, 'tis our being <hi>prejudiced</hi> against, and not attending to the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of a <hi>Congregational Church,</hi> as laid down in our <hi>Platform:</hi> To go from the Rule is <hi>Arbitrary;</hi> and to go against professed <hi>Principles,</hi> making our <hi>Wills</hi> the Rule, is <hi>Tyranny.</hi> And when a People fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possessed of <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> are thus dealt with, this leads directly to Contention and Confusion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. These Churches have not attended the <hi>Rule,</hi> as to the <hi>compleat Organization</hi> of Churches. 'Tis the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of a Church to chuse its own <hi>Officers;</hi> as, <hi>Plat.</hi> Chap. 10. Sec. 5. <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> the Power granted by Christ unto the Body of the Church and Brotherhood, is a <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Priviledge</hi> which the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In chusing their own <hi>Officers,</hi> whether <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. So Chap. 6. Sec. 4. Of <hi>Elders</hi> some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend chiefly to the Ministry of the Word, as <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi> some attend especially unto Rule, who are therefore called <hi>Ruling-Elders.</hi> Now the want of these <hi>Officers,</hi> exposes Churches to <hi>Arbitrariness,</hi> Contentions and Confusions. As also it renders the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church, in some Cases impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. An Instance of all these great Inconveniences, we have lately had in a Neighbour Church, where all possible Endeavours have been used by the aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (a very great and valuable Part of the Church) to have a Church-Meeting, and when there was great Occasion for it; and yet it could not be obtained:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003854_0022_100265148FD96F20"/>
They had not a Church-Meeting for about fourteen Years: Whereas if they had been furnished with a full supply of <hi>Officers,</hi> they might have easily obtained it, and by that Means put an end to a long and very threatning Contention. Besides had the Pastor called the Church together at their request, there being but one Elder, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> a Teaching one, and He the Party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, it was not possible according to <hi>Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principles,</hi> to have proceeded to <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Censure</hi> therefor. For Ministers are under no <hi>Ecclesiastick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> but in the <hi>Church,</hi> where they are <hi>Members</hi> as well as <hi>Ministers.</hi> Now 'tis a Rule in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Government, as in <hi>Plat.</hi> Chap. 10. Sec. II. no Church Act can be consummated or perfected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of both; that is, the Eldership and Brethren. Now 'tis not at all proper, that an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and faulty <hi>Elder</hi> should be a <hi>Judge</hi> in his own Case; therefore when He is the peccant Party, and no <hi>Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Elders</hi> to joyn the Brethren in an Act of <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Censure,</hi> there cannot be a <hi>valid</hi> Act. And so it is also when a <hi>Minister</hi> is the <hi>Accuser.</hi> Thus by the neglect of <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> (so necessary in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution) the Government is rendered weak; yea, in some Cases impracticable. Therefore it was that when the <hi>Synod</hi> convened, <hi>Oct.</hi> 15. 1679. to enquire what wanted Reformation in the Land, and to propose Expedients therefor, in the 5th Place they say, <q>'Tis requisite that utmost Endeavours should be used, in order for a full supply of <hi>Officers</hi> in the Churches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christ's <hi>Institution;</hi> the defect of these Churches on this Account is very Lamentable, there being in most of the Churches only one teaching <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer</hi> for the Burthen of the whole Church to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Lord Christ would not have instituted <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Teachers, Ruling Elders,</hi> (nor the <hi>Apostles ordained 
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003854_0022_100265148FD96F20"/>
Elders</hi> in every Church), <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. if he had not seen there was need of them for the good of his People; therefore for Men to think they can do well enough without them, is both to break the second Commandment, and to reflect upon the Wisdom of Christ, as if he did appoint unnecessary Officers in his Church. Experience hath evinced, that personal <hi>Instruction</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> have been happy Means to reform degenerate Congregations; yea, and owned by the Lord for the <hi>Conversion</hi> of many Souls. But where there are great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is impossible for one Man besides his <hi>Publick</hi> Labours, fully to attend these other Things of great Importance, and necessary to be done, in order to an effectual Reformation of Families and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q> Thus the Synod.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, these Churches have reduced their Church State to great Darkness, by not attending the Rule of Our Constitution in <hi>Councils.</hi> It has been the Practice of Councils convened according to the second way of Communion in Our Platform, who are only to hold forth Light, and give Advice, to usurp the Power of Judgment in Matters of Fact, as also the Power of Admonition, in case of Offence. Which to do is proper to the third way of Communion; and supposes that a Church wants Correction for an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and not meerly Light and Counsel. And by this Means the 3d way of Communion has been shut out, and not practiced. This thing I am bold to say, has been the Occasion of all our Anti-Councils, as well as the Occasion of the Contentions and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Churches have been left in, after all Endeavours used by neighbour Churches, by way of Councils.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:003854_0023_10020539F02AD750"/>3. I come to the last Thing, and that is, to the METHOD of our Relief.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let Our Churches be advised to get compleatly furnished with <hi>Church-Officers</hi> according to the <hi>Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi> By this Time I hope ye see the necessity of it. Arise, for this Matter belongs to you; and 'tis just Matter of <hi>Offence</hi> if you neglect it any longer.</p>
                  <p>Remember, it is necessary in a Congregational Church: And the Ministers and Members of these Churches would do well to get reconciled to every Part, and Branch of the Constitution. Prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, Aversions and Disaffections to the same, have greatly threatned the utter Dissolation of these Churches. Our Government is firm and strong; but if such as should keep it in good repair, do weaken it, it is in danger of falling to pieces. A Brick House (be it never so firm) if every Tenant takes out a Brick, in Time it will be weak, and shatter to pieces.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Obj.</hi> Our Reverend <hi>Pastors</hi> are against it, and think, that the <hi>Office</hi> is not of <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Ministers should reconcile themselves to the Congregational Government, before they accept of the Pastoral Office in such a Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are three Scriptures which may satisfy the dissatisfied, as to the Divine Right of <hi>Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>God has set in his Church, Governments.</hi> These are Church <hi>Governours</hi> and distinct from <hi>Teachers;</hi> who else can they be but <hi>Ruling Elders?</hi> Let such as have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious Scruples in this Affair, weigh in the <hi>Ballance</hi> 
                     <pb n="35" facs="unknown:003854_0023_10020539F02AD750"/>
of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> the Arguments brought for the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right</hi> of Ruling Elders, in a <hi>Book</hi> entitled <hi>Jus Divinum Regiminis Ecclesiastici;</hi> as also a <hi>Sheet</hi> not long since published, entitled, The <hi>Divine Right of Ruling Elders;</hi> as also, a Rational and nervous Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lately published on this Argument. Enough is said in these to satisfy an unprejudiced Mind as to their <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis the Right and Priviledge of the <hi>Brethren</hi> to chuse their <hi>Officers;</hi> and therefore if they be clear in the Matter, they should not be discouraged or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the use of their just <hi>Liberties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Reverend <hi>Pastors</hi> will be so Arbitrary, as utterly to refuse to call the Church together to chuse these Officers; I suppose the Church may look upon themselves in that Case, and so far, to be without a <hi>Ruler;</hi> and may convene for this Purpose, as when they have no Minister, to chuse one. It must be a great abuse of a Minister's <hi>Power,</hi> to obstruct the Church in the Exercise of that <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Priviledge</hi> Christ has given them, for the preservation of their <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Purity. Englishment</hi> can't patiently submit to <hi>arbitrary</hi> Measures. Two <hi>Kings</hi> within our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have smarted for attempting it. One lost his <hi>Head,</hi> the other his <hi>Empire.</hi> And will <hi>English</hi> Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians tamely submit thereto? Can they be easy, when those who by Divine Appointment are to Minister to them for their Spiritual Edification, Lord it over them who are God's Heritage? 'Tis unreasonable for any to desire or expect it, and base for Christians to submit to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. We would proceed to chuse <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> if there were any Men in the <hi>Church fit</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 'Tis God's Work to fit Men for Offices in Church or State. 'Tis your Duty to chuse such as are
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003854_0024_100265179114F878"/>
best qualified, and depend upon God farther and more fully to fit them. I remember as Introductory to our Election of Ruling Elders, towards <hi>Thirty Years</hi> ago, I preached from those Words, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>And the Lord came down in a Cloud, and spake unto him,</hi> that is to <hi>Moses, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and gave it to the Seventy Elders.</hi> There is the residue of the Spirit to furnish for every <hi>Office of Trust</hi> to which one and another is chosen. And in that the getting Ruling Elders was opposed by many in <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> I preached another <hi>Sermon</hi> from those Words in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.</hi> Reformations are commonly attended with great Oppositions. Lay aside then I pray, your objecting, and attend your Duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Let Discipline be prudently, strictly, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially exercised in particular Churches. Negligence and Partiality herein is very hurtful to the Peace, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and growth of Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Let Councils move in their proper Sphere: let them act agreeable to their Nature, and the Rules laid down in the Platform. Let such as are called to give <hi>Advice,</hi> and to hold forth <hi>Light,</hi> do that, and proceed no farther.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Come into the Practice of the <hi>Third way</hi> of Communion, as laid down in the Platform. When a Church is rent with Division among themselves, and lie under any open <hi>Scandal,</hi> and yet refuse to consult with other Churches for healing and removing the same, this is Matter of Offence; and the aggrieved making a Complaint hereof to a Particular Church, this Church is in a Christian Manner to make Enquiry, and demand an Account of the other Church, in order to their Conviction and Admonition, if faulty, as in <hi>Plat.</hi> Chap. 15, or in order to their Vindication, if 
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003854_0024_100265179114F878"/>
Innocent. There has been in Times past, great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Practice of this Rule. But the late ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Council held at <hi>Salem,</hi> saw Cause to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Practice of that way of the Communion of Churches, and advised the aggrieved there, in case they receive not speedy Satisfaction from the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Pastor pursuant to the Result and Advice of safe Council, to apply to a particular Church in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, as directly in the <hi>Third</hi> way of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Which Thing I humbly apprehend will prove of greater Service toward the establishing these Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, than any Thing done for Scores of Years. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis that <hi>Rule,</hi> and the wise practicing it, that wipes off the Reproach of <hi>Independency</hi> from Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches. They are unaccountable, unless in this way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis this <hi>Rule</hi> that preserves Churches pure in their Communion one with another. For if a Church gives Offence, and continues Obstinate in any sinful way, and other Churches continue to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with such disorderly Church, and don't Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with such disorderly Church, and don't use all possible Means to reclaim her, they are Partakers of their Sin. But there is no other regular way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into her Administrations, to convince her, and admonish her, and separate her from their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but this. Altho' one Church has not <hi>Authority</hi> over another, yet Churches have power to preserve their <hi>Purity,</hi> and to put a Church obstinately Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their <hi>Communion;</hi> or else they must hold Fellowship with her in a sinful way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This <hi>Rule</hi> is necessary to the <hi>Peace</hi> of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, as it will effectually relieve Persons ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved. There can't much Peace be expected where a great part of a Church, are gauled by Arbitrary Measures. But in this way they must give Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003854_0025_1002651929A54528"/>
or sustain the Sentence of <hi>Non-Communion.</hi> And this opens a Door for all aggrieved ones to resettle in an orderly way, in stated Fellowship in some neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Church, as tho' they had been dismissed. 4. This <hi>Rule</hi> doth effectually hinder <hi>Anti-Councils,</hi> or having Councils against Councils; of which there have been too many Instances, to the great Reproach and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of these Churches. For if aggrieved Persons are allowed to call Councils, the Church has <hi>Power</hi> and Liberty to call them; and by this Means, Anti-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils come upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> But if the aggrieved make Complaint to a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> there is no possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Anti-Councils. 'Tis therefore much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, that such mighty Opposition has been made against introducing this <hi>Rule</hi> into Practice in these Churches. And 'tis matter of Thankfulness that the way is prepared by the foresaid <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Salem,</hi> for the Practice thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> It may be objected, <hi>This Rule was not put in Practice in the early Days of these Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Our Fathers were but Men, and had their Defects. Hence tho' they in the <hi>Synod</hi> declared so fully for the full supply of Officers in the Church; and this result of the Synod was approved by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court, recommending the same to the serious Consideration of all the Churches; yet how shamefully was this Expedient for Reformation disregarded by most of our Churches!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I suppose the true Reason why the 3d way of Communion was not practiced in our early Days, was because then there was no Occasion for it. Churches were more tender, and willing to receive Light, when offered by Councils called in the <hi>Second</hi> way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: And when it is thus, there is no Room for the Practice of this Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="unknown:003854_0025_1002651929A54528"/>I shall add the following moving Considerations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Church Government is too good to be thrown away. I am perswaded 'tis nearer the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and better warranted and supported by it, than any Church Government in the World. As to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there is no Scripture Foundation for their <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> as <hi>Arch-Bishops, Lord-Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Officials, Chancellors,</hi> &amp;c. Of late, by one and another Masterly Hand, the following Truth has been set in so clear a Light, that none but the wilfully Ignorant can resist it, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> That the <hi>Scripture Bishop,</hi> is no other than the <hi>Pastor</hi> of a Particular Church. And it is an Innovation and Usurpation, that they are dignified as they are in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, to take out of the Hands of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Pastors,</hi> all Rule in the Church, is unscriptural: for what is more plain, than that they who <hi>Watch</hi> for Souls, are to <hi>Rule</hi> over them also? as, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Their taking away from Churches the <hi>Liberty</hi> of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their own <hi>Officers,</hi> is an intollerable Invasion of the Right of Churches, as well as their introducing many unscriptural <hi>Ceremonies</hi> into Divine Worship.</p>
                  <p>Again, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government, I grant, has been accompained with eminent Holiness; as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Church of <hi>Scotland, Geneva,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reformed Churches. And I acknowledge there is but little Difference between them and us; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if we have <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> and practice the <hi>Third way</hi> of Communion. Yet wherein we differ, I am humbly of Opinion we have the <hi>Scripture</hi> on Our Side. Let any if they can, give a genuine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> and exclude the <hi>Brethren</hi> from having any Hand in <hi>Church Discipline</hi> and <hi>Censures.</hi> Besides what is written, Mat. 18. <hi>Tell it to the Church;</hi> that is, say they, to the <hi>Ministers.</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:003854_0026_100205420679CA88"/>
This is to put the Scripture upon the Rack, to make it speak what we would have it. Let us then be thankful for our Constitution; strictly adhere to, and Practice it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Church Government, if strictly adhered to, will effectually answer all the Intentions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. There is no Member in a Church, no Church in the whole Consociation of Churches, tho' never so stubborn and obstinate, but must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or sustain the dreadful Sentence of <hi>Non-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall conclude the whole with a few Words of Advice, or Counsel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us be very thankful to God, who has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto secured for us Our Civil and sacred Priviledges, notwithstanding our great Barrenness and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableness; yea, and our many and great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. God is slow unto Anger, and abundant in Goodness and Kindness. We have for an <hi>Hundred Years</hi> enjoyed the Dispensation of the Glorious Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in its Power and Purity, and free from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. What could God have done for this his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> which he has not done, in order to our Fruitfulness?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us be warned against withdrawing from the <hi>Fellowship</hi> of these Churches, until we find more <hi>pure Churches</hi> and <hi>Worship;</hi> and of a more Scriptural <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> For any to break with, and break off from these Churches, because their <hi>stubborn Wills</hi> will not submit to the just and regular <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to which they belong; or because they can't have their <hi>Will,</hi> as to the Place of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; these deserve the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Heady</hi> and <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded.</hi> And if their unreasonable Desires are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> then they will turn 
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003854_0026_100205420679CA88"/>
                     <hi>Church-Men.</hi> Surely such <hi>Church-Men</hi> are guilty of <hi>Will-Worship</hi> with a Witness. These <hi>Converts</hi> are worthy to be called Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> who rise up against <hi>Lawful Authority,</hi> and take <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in the Church. The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth too much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Churches, when they account those worthy of their <hi>Fellowship,</hi> who are <hi>worthy</hi> to be rejected by us. I would whisper in the Ears of these thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and unnatural <hi>Converts,</hi> not to say <hi>Apostates;</hi> Will you rashly, and to have your Wills in lesser Matters, return to a State of <hi>Bondage,</hi> when you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy matchless Liberties and Priviledges? Will you take upon you a <hi>Yoke</hi> which your gracious <hi>Predecessors</hi> could not bear? Will you bring a Burthen upon Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, which is intollerable, to humour and ease your selves? Know, when the <hi>Yoke</hi> is once on your Necks, you must pay the <hi>Tythe,</hi> the Tenth part of which you are apt now to think is too much for you to give, or your Minister to receive. And do you think the vast <hi>Arrearages</hi> will not be recovered, one way or another? I mean the vast Sums expended for the <hi>Propagation</hi> of the Gospel: That is, for the bringing over our <hi>Churches</hi> to the <hi>Mother Church!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be kind to your <hi>Ministers;</hi> and don't give them any just Provocation to <hi>desert</hi> you, or to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reconcile themselves to the <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> of the Church. The <hi>Discount</hi> of the Bills of Credit has insensibly and exceedingly hurt them in times past; and it is well if it be not so to this Day with some. I am fully perswaded that Ministers <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries</hi> ought in Justice to be raised in Proportion to the Depreciation of the Bills of Credit; for the <hi>Price</hi> of the Necessaries of Life rise in that Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By no Means discourage the Hearts, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Hands of your Faithful Ministers, who are
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003854_0027_100205501EE6C440"/>
willing to <hi>spend</hi> and be <hi>spent,</hi> in the Service of your precious Souls. Especially be cautious at this <hi>Junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> when so great Temptations are laid before them to desert you, and go <hi>home</hi> and take <hi>Orders.</hi>

                  <p>4thly. and Finally, Study the Principles of your <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> be heartily reconciled to, and be Zealous in the Defence and Practice of them. And as often as any of Our Holy Churches do want a <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> I would advise them when treating with any <hi>Candidate</hi> in order to Settlement, to know his Mind with respect to the professed <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of these Churches; and proceed not to <hi>Election</hi> until he has given his <hi>Assent</hi> to the one, and his Promise to <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> according to the other. This indeed is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly done by his Acceptance of the Invitation of a Congregational Church; but the more explicit, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And when the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Messengers</hi> of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches are (upon Invitation) convened, to assist in the Solemn Separation of a <hi>Pastor</hi> to the <hi>Sacred</hi> Work of the Gospel Ministry, in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; they would doubtless do well to satisfy themselves here about, left they be found to lay their Hands too suddenly upon his Head. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Let us then <hi>stand fast in the Liberties wherewith Christ hath made us free,</hi> Gal. 5. 1. Our <hi>Country</hi> thinks it worth while to spend many <hi>Thousands,</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their <hi>Civil Priviledges</hi> settled upon us by <hi>Charter;</hi> and are not these <hi>Sacred Priviledges</hi> of equal, yea of greater Worth and Value? O then, let us <hi>contend earnestly for the Faith</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the Gospel, left we be found to despise our <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and to destroy our selves.</p>

                  <head>REASONS For adhering to our Platform, AS A RULE of Church-Government, AND OBJECTIONS Against Ruling Elders answered. In a LETTER to a Friend.</head>
                  <byline>By another Hand.</byline>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received a Message from you, that a Friend of yours desires to have some <hi>Reasons</hi> (drawn up in Writing) to shew why we should <hi>adhere</hi> to the PLATFORM as a <hi>Rule of Church-Government,</hi> at least till another and better be provided.</p>
                  <p>I wish a better Head were employed in assigning <hi>Reasons</hi> for it: But to gratify you (in the interim) I shall give you the <hi>general Reasons</hi> inducing me to be of the Opinion that we ought so to do. But first
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003854_0028_10020548079EED80"/>
I <hi>premise,</hi> that whereas it is objected, That the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> are the <hi>only Rule</hi> both of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> and that it is both Sinful and Dangerous to set up humane Composures as our Rule; I perfectly agree with the Objectors, and acknowledge that <hi>no humane Composure</hi> ought to be received, which disagrees with the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi> But if the <hi>Platform</hi> must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected meerly because it is of humane Composure; then by the same Parity of Reason, not only the <hi>Association Principles</hi> but also <hi>all Sermons, Confessions of Faith, practical Catechisms,</hi> and the like, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, these being also humane Composures. And it is very observable, that the same Persons who are for rejecting the <hi>Platform,</hi> would at the same Time have us subject to <hi>such a Government</hi> as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves shall from Time to Time fancy to be agreable to the Scriptures; not allowing us to judge for our selves, whether it be agreable to the Scripture or not; nor willing to be governed or restricted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by any Rule, except the Scriptures in the Sense <hi>they themselves</hi> understand them, or (which is one and the same Thing) by any other than what agrees with their own Sentiments. And with this Allowance I suppose the <hi>Pope</hi> himself could comply with the <hi>Scripture</hi> as the Rule of his Government.</p>
                  <p>But that there ought to be a <hi>Platform</hi> extracted from the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> as a <hi>Particular Rule</hi> of Church Government, and that it is our Wisdom and Interest to adhere to <hi>ours,</hi> at least till another and better be provided, is evident to me, from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Considerations, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Nature, Use and Ends of all Government necessarily implies ORDER: <hi>Order</hi> cannot be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without known and certain <hi>Rules:</hi> The Duties 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003854_0028_10020548079EED80"/>
of <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Ruled</hi> must be stated, circumscribed, and limited by a Rule; otherwise RULERS may be <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> at pleasure, and SUBJECTS <hi>Rebel</hi> whenever they have Opportunity, and neither of them be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tho' the SCRIPTURES are in themselves a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> and the <hi>only Standard</hi> by which <hi>all other Rules</hi> are to be tried; yet it is evident that through the Darkness or Corruption of Men's Minds, <hi>this Rule</hi> is very diversly understood and practiced upon, both with respect to Doctrine and Discipline. Hence the Authors of the most corrupt DOCTRINES pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Scriptures to support their Tenets. So with respect to CHURCH-GOVERNMENT, the <hi>Congregationalist,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the <hi>Episcopalian,</hi> yea, and even the <hi>Papist,</hi> pretend to Rule and Govern according to the <hi>Scripture.</hi> So that they don't so much differ upon the <hi>Question,</hi> Whether the SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE shall be the <hi>Rule,</hi> as upon the <hi>Question</hi> how the <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be <hi>understood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence it follows, that without <hi>some Platform</hi> or Constitution, there can be no orderly Government upheld. This appears to be agreable to the Sense both of <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants, Episcopalians, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> and <hi>Congregationalists;</hi> who all have their <hi>Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms</hi> or <hi>Constitutions</hi> of Church-Government.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Church-Government</hi> in <hi>this Country,</hi> is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a particular <hi>Compact</hi> or Agreement, wherein the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of each particular Church combine to set forward the Worship of God, and maintain the Discipline of his Kingdom <hi>in a Way</hi> which they <hi>judge to be agreable</hi> to the HOLY SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURES;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003854_0029_1002651AF5975088"/>
and to act in way of <hi>Consociation with other Churches</hi> of the same Principles, for their mutual Good and Edification. Upon <hi>this Foundation</hi> were the <hi>Churches</hi> of NEW ENGLAND first settled; and for their more regular Proceeding therein, the PLAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORM (expressing <hi>their Sense</hi> of the SCRIPTURE relating to Church Order and Government) was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed &amp; consented to by the Churches in our primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times: And this Form of Government is so far established, that our <hi>General Consent</hi> to continue and abide in <hi>this Way,</hi> would secure to us the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of it. And this indeed is our only <hi>Barrier</hi> against <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> unless some other Form of Government (not disallowed by the Crown) be received and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the Churches.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But if we slight the Method of Government in our <hi>Platform,</hi> and don't by Agreement fix on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will follow, that either the Government of the Church must <hi>cease,</hi> or a Government <hi>imposed</hi> and Enforced by Humane Laws must succeed. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume most certainly the Churches (so unhinged) must immediately fall into an <hi>absolute Independency</hi> at first; and the Members of each individual Church, must either be <hi>allowed</hi> to be under no Government but what will suit with <hi>their own private Judgment</hi> on the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (which they may be tempted to vary or alter as Occasion may offer;) or else a Power of <hi>Judging for themselves</hi> as to the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> must be <hi>denied</hi> to the <hi>Brethren,</hi> and put over to the <hi>Minister</hi> for him to Judge and Determine as he thinks fit, and to state and fix the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries both of his own Authority and the People's Obedience, as he shall from Time to Time under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Scripture. And who can tell how much 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003854_0029_1002651AF5975088"/>
or how often his Judgment may also vary, upon Occasions or Temptations which may offer? But such a confused State of Things <hi>can't last long;</hi> a more certain and regular Form of Government will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be found necessary; and perhaps a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government may be sought after, but <hi>not found to be attainable.</hi> May it not therefore be proper (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we part with our <hi>Platform</hi>) not only to enquire whether the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Constitution be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Scripture;</hi> but also whether that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be set up and supported here, unless some <hi>other Laws</hi> than we have hitherto had, be enacted, and do obtain the Royal Approbation. That the Royal Approbation may be obtained in Favour of the way of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> can't be doubted; but that it will be obtained in Favour of a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Church Government here, seems hardly probable: which if duly considered, it may well be wondered how Gentlemen (who would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that themselves or Posterity should be placed under <hi>Episcopacy</hi>) can think of <hi>Departing</hi> from <hi>Our Own Platform;</hi> at least 'till another and better be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in the Room thereof.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Our <hi>Platform</hi> was doubtless the Result of <hi>great Tho't and Deliberation,</hi> and of <hi>earnest Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;</hi> composed and consented to by Men of as great <hi>Learning, Piety</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> as any our Age affords; and such as had more <hi>Knowledge</hi> and larger <hi>Experience</hi> of the <hi>State of the Church at Home and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,</hi> than perhaps any among us of the present Age have; and as careful of avoiding humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions as the best of us. Now the <hi>Platform</hi> agreed with <hi>their understanding</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> not only <hi>then,</hi> but <hi>many Years after,</hi> when it was revised by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003854_0030_1002054E85E85828"/>
a succeeding <hi>Synod.</hi> And I am perswaded, if it were now Impartially considered and compared with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> it would be found very consonant therewith. And even <hi>that Part thereof</hi> which asserts the Office of the RULING ELDER (which is as I suppose the most distastful to such as would explode the <hi>Platform</hi>) agrees with the <hi>Scripture</hi> not only in the Judgment of the Divines and Churches in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in our purest times, but also in the Judgment of the most famous Reforming Divines and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that have been in <hi>other Parts of the World.</hi> Both the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of <hi>that Office</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been asserted by Divines vastly more in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than those (among <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalists</hi>) who do or have decried it; and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to them in Learning, Piety or solid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I am told by a Gentleman of Learning and Ingenuity, That the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> of <hi>Geneva, France, Scotland, Holland,</hi> and in general almost all the <hi>Churches of the Reformation</hi> (except <hi>Episcopalians</hi>) have upheld <hi>this Office;</hi> and that it has never been denied by any considerable Number of Protestant Churches (except as aforesaid) till that about the Space of <hi>Fifty Years ago,</hi> a Number of <hi>Ministers</hi> rose up in <hi>New England,</hi> who did oppose it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole therefore, tho' no Man's <hi>Conscience</hi> ought to be bound by <hi>this</hi> or <hi>any other Platform,</hi> in any Matter which he verily believes to be contrary to the <hi>Scripture;</hi> yet it seems impossible to conceive, how a particular Church can uphold an <hi>orderly Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> or a Number of Churches form a <hi>Consocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> unless they do <hi>unite</hi> in the Foundation-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Church-Government; or that the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority prescribe the Rules or Canons of Church Government, and enforce Obedience and Subjection 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003854_0030_1002054E85E85828"/>
thereto, as in the Case of National Churches.</p>
                  <p>From the foregoing Considerations laid together, I think it will appear to be the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of all those who prefer our <hi>own Constitution</hi> before a National Church-Government, and its forcing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, <hi>steadily to adhere to our Platform;</hi> at least till another and better be found, and (after mature Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration) consented to and agreed upon by the Churches.</p>
                  <p>And now because the <hi>Office</hi> of a RULING EL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER is an essential Branch of <hi>Congregational Church-Government,</hi> which if left out, quite alters the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and changes the Government of the Church into a <hi>Monarchical</hi> Form; and because I apprehend that the Prejudices that are taken against the <hi>Platform,</hi> are principally upon this Head; I would now acquaint your Friend (tho' this is further than his Request expresses) upon <hi>what Grounds</hi> I satisfy my self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the <hi>Objections</hi> I meet with against that <hi>Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas it is <hi>objected,</hi> That the <hi>Generality of our Ministers</hi> do not hold this Office to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution: To this Objection I oppose the Judgment of <hi>former Divines</hi> (more in Number, and not less Capable of judging as to the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi>) as also the Judgment of <hi>several Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines now Living</hi> among us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas 'tis <hi>objected,</hi> That according to <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 8, 11, 12. the <hi>ordinary Officers</hi> left by Christ <hi>in the Church,</hi> are only <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Phil.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 1. BISHOPS (or <hi>Pastors</hi>) and DEACONS are the only Officers mentioned: I satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my self as to this Objection, by considering that the Word BISHOP, PASTOR and SHEPHERD,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003854_0031_1002651CA12AE3F8"/>
signify one and the same Thing whenever applied to Ecclesiastical Officers, and imply a Power of <hi>Teaching, Overseeing, Feeding</hi> &amp; Governing. The Word PASTOR is applicable to <hi>all Rulers</hi> whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and is so used in <hi>Scripture:</hi> and tho' the Word BISHOP seems in a more appropriated Sense to belong to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Ruler;</hi> yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Word so appropriated, is comprehended <hi>all Ecclesiastical Rulers,</hi> Guides, Overseers, Shepherds; even as the Word <hi>Magistrate</hi> comprehends <hi>all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rulers</hi> of every Rank and Station. So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these Expressions do exclude any sort of <hi>Elder, Overseer</hi> or <hi>Ruler</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> but on the contrary do include and comprehend them all. And tho' a <hi>Power</hi> of Teaching, Overseeing and Ruling, may all be <hi>attributed</hi> to <hi>one Man;</hi> yet it does not follow that the <hi>Power</hi> of Overseeing and Ruling must <hi>lie solely and absolutely</hi> in Him. For there may be, and is, a <hi>Government</hi> where there is <hi>not</hi> a <hi>Lordly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> (or which is the same thing) <hi>Power</hi> in a <hi>Single Officer,</hi> which has <hi>no other</hi> Branch of Government <hi>to Check and Controul it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas 'tis <hi>objected,</hi> That we have <hi>not Men Capable,</hi> &amp;c. If it be so indeed that there are no Men in our Chuches that have Skill enough or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity enough to Guide in the External Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of the Government and Discipline of the Church; and Capable too of assisting, directing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and comforting their Brethren, as they may have Opportunity; our Degeneracy is very Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table indeed: Our Churches have then none suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Service in <hi>Ecclesiastical Councils.</hi> Every thing at Home and Abroad must be left to the Prudence and Fidelity of the <hi>Ministers;</hi> and wo to that Church 
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003854_0031_1002651CA12AE3F8"/>
(if such a Thing shou'd happen) that falls under the Influences of a Minister no better qualified than themselves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I find an Assertion in a <hi>late printed Pamphlet,</hi> that the Keyes of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And again, To be sure to the <hi>same Persons</hi> is there committed the <hi>Ruling</hi> and <hi>Feeding</hi> of the Flock. The Author refers to the <hi>last Chapter</hi> of <hi>Matthew.</hi> But would he restrain the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Ruling</hi> to the Persons of the <hi>Apostles</hi> or to the Persons of Gospel <hi>Ministers</hi> as <hi>their Successors</hi> in the Work of <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Baptizing,</hi> and to them only; he must then either prove the Government of the Church to be <hi>Monarchical,</hi> or else that <hi>every Church</hi> is obliged to provide a <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>such Teaching Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another <hi>Objection</hi> is, That if we will hve <hi>Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders,</hi> we must provide them <hi>Maintainence;</hi> and this some suppose would fright us out of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such Officers. But to me it appears no way Formidable. For in the first place, I don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Double Honour</hi> principally intends <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance</hi> (as some would have it, from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 17.) and the next Words prove no more than this, that a <hi>suitable Reward</hi> is due, according to the Labour performed. It therefore remains to be proved, that a <hi>Ruling Elder</hi> must spend <hi>his whole Time</hi> in the Service of the Church, before he is entitled to a <hi>Maintainance</hi> from the Church. But if a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and honourable Reward were assigned in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their Service; I believe no Body would have Reason to Complain; and abundance of Good might be done, and Evil prevented, which would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003854_0032_1002651F284C5860"/>
take up no great Quantity of Time. And in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Matters,</hi> I see no reason but their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours should be handsomely rewarded.</p>

                     <hi>Answer.</hi> WE do here freely confess, that if we were of Opinion, as some are, that the Ruling Elder hath no Foundation in the Word of God, but is a meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ordinance, brought into the Church only in a prudential way; we should heartily desire the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abolition of him: For we are not ignorant, that the Ruling Prelate was brought into the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Account, for the avoiding of Schism and Division, and afterwards proved the great Author
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003854_0034_1002056AD3F0FB00"/>
and Fomenter of Schism and Division. And if we should decline the Ruling Prelate and take in the Ruling Elder upon the same prudential Grounds, it were just with God to make him as mischievous to the Church, as ever the Ruling Prelate was: And therefore let us consider what may be said out of the Word of God, for the Justification of this so much <hi>decried Officer.</hi> Yet first we cannot but take notice that the Name of <hi>Lay-Elder</hi> was affixed to this Officer by way of Reproach and Scorn, by the Adversaries of him, and that it ought not to be continued. For though it be evident by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, [<hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 17, 24.] that there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Ministry, usually called the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the People commonly called the Laity; Yet it's also as manifest, that the Scripture distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not by the Names of Clergy and Laity: for asmuch as all God's People are therein stiled the Lord's Clergy or Inheritance, [1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 16.] and the Lord is called their Inheritance. And when Persons are duly chosen from among the People to be Governours in the Church, as such, they are no longer Lay-men, but Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And therefore we profess a dislike of the Name lay Elder, and conceive they ought to be called either Governours in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 23. or Ruling Elders: as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. not because their Office is to rule alone (for the Teaching Elder is a Ruler also,) <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Office is only to Rule.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning these Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders we confess, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non quia soli, sed quia solum praesunt.</hi>
                     </note> that they are Officers somewhat new &amp; strange to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet not new nor strange to the Word of God, nor to the Primitive Times, 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003854_0034_1002056AD3F0FB00"/>
nor (as all know) to the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>They are not new nor strange to the Word of God, neither in the Old Testament, nor in the New.</hi> The Jews in the Old Testament, had two sorts of Elders, <hi>Elders of the Priests, and Elders of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> suitable to our <hi>Teaching and Ruling Elders,</hi> as appears, <hi>Jer.</hi> 19. 1. And these Elders of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did sit and vote with the Priests and Levites in all their Ecclesiastical Consistories, and that by divine Appointment. That they were <hi>constituent</hi> Members of the great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> appears, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 8. where we read, that <hi>some of the chief of the Fathers were joyned with the Priests, to judge in the matters of the Lord.</hi> And howsoever, many things among the Jews after the Captivity, did decline to Disorder and Confusion; yet we find even in the Days of Christ and his Apostles, that the Elders of the People still sate and voiced in the Council with the Priests, according to the ancient Form, as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 57, 59. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 1, 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 23. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 43. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 66. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De divers. grad. Minist. Evang.</hi> cap. 11. p. 108.</note> And <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> himself, who disputeth so much against <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> acknowledgeth thus much: <hi>I find indeed,</hi> (saith he) <hi>Elders in the Assembly of the Priests of the old Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, which were not Priests; and their Suffrages and Authority in all Judgments, were equal with the Suffrages of the Priests.</hi> But he adds, <hi>That these El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the People, were Civil Magistrates:</hi> which is a poor Shift, directly against many Scriptures, which contradistinguish these <hi>Elders</hi> from the Civil <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate;</hi> as appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Josh.</hi> 8. 33. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10. 14. And though it were possible, that some of them might
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003854_0035_1002055AC233C050"/>
be Civil <hi>Magistrates,</hi> as some Elders among us, are Justices of the Peace; yet they did not sit under that Capacity, in the Ecclesiastical <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> but as Ecclesiastical Elders.</p>
                  <p>And that the Jews also had <hi>Elders of the People,</hi> sitting and voting in their inferiour Consistories, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears (as we humbly conceive) from <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8, 17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 22. In which places, we read of the Rulers of the Synagogue, who were neither Priests nor Levites; and yet were Rulers in Church-Matters, and had Power, together with the Priests, of casting Men out of the Synagogue, and of ordering Synagogue, worship, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 42. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15.</p>
                  <p>Now this, <hi>Association</hi> of the <hi>Elders of the People, with the Priests, in the Jewish Church-Government, was by Divine Appointment:</hi> For <hi>Moses</hi> first instituted it, and afterwards <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> restored it, according as they were directed by God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 16. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 8. And it did belong to the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> not as it was Jewish, but as it was a Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore belongeth to the Christian Church, as well as Jewish. <hi>For whatsoever agreeth to a Church, as a Church, agreeth to every Church.</hi> There was nothing Judaical or Typical in this Institution; but it was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Light of Nature, and right Reason, which is alike in all Ages.</p>
                  <p>But leaving the Old Testament, let us consider what may be said for the Divine Right of the <hi>Ruling Elder,</hi> out of the New Testament. For this Purpose, we have already produced three Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which we shall now briefly open; and shew how the Ruling Elder is proved out of them. The Places are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003854_0035_1002055AC233C050"/>The first Place is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>And God hath set some in the Church, first, Apostles; secondarily, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; thirdly, Teachers; after that, Miracles; then Gifts of healing, Helps, Governments, diversities of Tongues;</hi> where we have an enumeration of sundry Officers of the Church; and among others, there are <hi>Helps,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calvin in locum. Chrysostom</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>Estius</hi> upon 1 Cor. 12. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Governments.</hi> By <hi>Helps,</hi> are meant <hi>Deacons;</hi> (as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our <hi>Reformed Divines,</hi> but <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> and <hi>Estius,</hi> and others observe,) and by <hi>Governments,</hi> are meant the <hi>Ruling Elder:</hi> which that it may the better appear, we will propound, and prove these six Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That by <hi>Governments,</hi> are meant <hi>Men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising Government,</hi> the <hi>Abstract</hi> put for the <hi>Concrete.</hi> The Intent of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> is not to speak of <hi>Offices</hi> distinct from <hi>Persons,</hi> but of <hi>Persons exercising Offices.</hi> This appears first, by the beginning of the Verse, <hi>God hath set some in his Church;</hi> this relates to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, not unto Offices. Secondly, by the 29, and 30. Verses, where the Apostle speaks <hi>concretively,</hi> of those Things which he had spoken before <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractively. Are all workers of Miracles? have all the Gifts of Healing? do all speak with Tongues,</hi> &amp;c? and so by Consequence, <hi>Are all Helpers, are all Governours?</hi> And therefore it is, that the Syriack instead of <hi>Helps, Governments,</hi> reads it <hi>Helpers, Governours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Governour</hi> here meant, must needs be a <hi>Church-Governour.</hi> For it is expresly said, that he is seated in the Church, and therefore the Civil Magistrate cannot be meant by this Governour, as some would have it: partly, because this is quite besides the whole Intent and Scope of the Chapter, treating meerly upon <hi>spiritual Church-Matters,</hi> not at all of secular civil Matters; and partly, because
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003854_0036_1002652323194290"/>
the Magistrate, as such, is not placed by God in the <hi>Church,</hi> but in the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> and partly, because the Apostle writes of such Governours, that had at that Time actual Existence in the Church; and neither then, nor divers hundred Years after, were there any <hi>Christian Magistrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this <hi>Church-Governour</hi> is seated by God in his Church. It is a <hi>Plant of Gods own planting,</hi> and therefore shall stand firm, maugre all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. For it is expresly said, <hi>God hath set some in his Church, first Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then Helps, then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That this Church-Governour thus seated by God in his Church, is not only a <hi>Church-Member,</hi> but a <hi>Church-Officer.</hi> For though it be a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the Learned, whether some of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons here named, as the <hi>Workers of Miracles,</hi> and those that had the <hi>Gift of Healing and of Tongues,</hi> were seated by God, as Officers in the Church, and not rather, only as eminent Members, indued with these eminent Gifts; yet it is most certain, that whosoever is seated by God in his Church, as a <hi>Church-Governour,</hi> must needs be a <hi>Church-Officer:</hi> for the Nature of the Gift, doth necessarily imply an Office. The Greek Word for Governments, <note place="margin">ΚUΒΕΡΝΗΣΕΙS.</note> is a Metaphor from <hi>Pilots,</hi> or <hi>Ship-Masters,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning their Ships; (hence the Master of a Ship is called ΚUΒΕΡΝΗΤΗS, a Governour, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 4.) and it notes such Officers as sit at the Stern of the Vessel of the Church, to govern and guide it in Spirituals, according to the Will and Mind of Christ, which is the direct Office of our <hi>Ruling Elder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Church-Governour thus seated by God 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003854_0036_1002652323194290"/>
in his Church, as a <hi>Church-Officer,</hi> is <hi>an ordinary and perpetual Officer in his Church.</hi> Indeed, here is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of Officers extraordinary, as Apostles, Prophets; and of Gifts extraordinary, as the Gift of Miracles, Healing and of Tongues: but here is also mention made of ordinary Officers, perpetually to abide, as <hi>Teachers, Helpers,</hi> and the <hi>Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or Ruling Elder.</hi> And that this Officer is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and perpetual, appears from the perpetual Necessity of him in the Church: for a Church without Government, is as a Ship without a Pilot, as a Kingdom without a Magistrate, and a World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sun.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That this Church-Governour thus seated by God in his Church, as a perpetual Officer, is an Officer <hi>contra-distinguished in the Text from the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Prophets, Teachers, <hi>and all other</hi> Officers <hi>in the Church.</hi> This appears,</p>
                  <p>(1.) By the Apostles Manner of expressing these Officers in an <hi>enumerative</hi> Form; First, <hi>Apostles; Secondarily, Prophets; Thirdly, Teachers; After that, Miracles, then Gifts of Healing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>(2.) By the Recapitulation, vers. 29, 30. <hi>Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teachers? Are all Workers of Miracles?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3) By the Scope of the whole Chapter; which is to set down different Gifts and Offices in different Subjects. It is said, vers. 8, 9. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit, the Word of Wisdom; to another, the Word of Knowledge by the same Spirit; to another, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. And for this Purpose, the Apostle draweth a Simile from the Members of Man's Body: As there are different Members in Man's Body, and every Member hath it's different Office, and every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber stands in need one of another; the Eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003854_0037_100205613B4508E0"/>
say to the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor again, the Head to the Foot, I have no need of thee; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it is in the Church Ministerial, which is the Body of Christ. God hath set different Officers in his Church; some ordinary and perpetual; some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and temporary: And these different Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, have different Offices; some to Teach, others to Distribute to the poor Saints; others to Govern. Are all Teachers? Are all Deacons? Are all Church-Governours? and these have all need one of another. The Teacher cannot say to the Deacon, I have no need of thee; nor to the Church-Governour, I have no need of thee: But if all these Officers were in the Pastor alone, and only, then might he truly say to the Deacon and Ruling Elder, I have no need of thee. But now God hath so set the Members in his Body, which is his Church, that every Member stands in need one of anothers Help and Support.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it be objected, that the Apostles had all these Offices and Gifts here mentioned, eminently seated in them; for they were Prophets, Teachers, Workers of Miracles; and therefore why may not all these be understood of one and the same Person?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Though it be true, that the Apostles had eminently all these; yet it is as true, that there are many here named, which had but one of these Gifts formally seated in them: And it is also apparent, that some of the Persons here named were distinct Officers in the Church, as the Prophet, and the Teacher. Though the Apostles were Prophets and Teachers, yet the Prophet and the Teacher were Officers distinct from the Apostles; and by a parity of Reason, so were the Governours from the Apostle, Prophet, and 
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003854_0037_100205613B4508E0"/>
Teacher: the Scope of the Apostle being (as hath been said) to set out distinct Offices in distinct Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers? The Sum of what we have said from this Scripture, then is this; <hi>That God hath seated some Men in his Church which have a Gift and Office to Govern, which are neither Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, nor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors; and therefore they are Ruling Elders,</hi> which is the Officer we are enquiring after.</p>
                  <p>Now this Interpretation which we have given, is not only the Interpretation of Reformed Divines, both <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> but of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and even the Papists themselves, as appears by the quotations in the Margin <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>The second Text is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. 7, 8. <hi>Having then Gifts differing according to the Grace given; whether Prophesie let us prophesie according to the Proportion of Faith; or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, let us wait on our Ministring; or he that teacheth on Teaching; or he that exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, on Exhortation: He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; He that ruleth, with Diligence; He that shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Mercy, with Chearfulness.</hi> In which Words, we have a perfect Enumeration of all the ordinary Offices of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003854_0038_10026524CAE07838"/>
the Church. These Offices are reduced, first, to two general Heads, <hi>Prophesie</hi> and <hi>Ministry,</hi> and are therefore set down in the <hi>Abstract.</hi> By <hi>Prophesie</hi> is meant the Faculty of right understanding, interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and expounding the Scriptures.

And here likewise we have the Divine Institution of <hi>Ruling Elders:</hi> for so the Words hold forth; <hi>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Gifts differing according to the Grace that is given unto us;</hi> and thus also in the third Verse, <hi>according as God has dealt to every Man,</hi> &amp;c. This Officer is the Gift of God's free Grace to the Church for the Good of it.</p>
                  <p>Against this Exposition of the Text it is objected by those that oppose the Divine Right of the <hi>Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> 
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003854_0038_10026524CAE07838"/>
that the Apostle speaks in these Words, not <hi>of several Offices in several Persons, but of several Gifts in one and the same Person;</hi> for he saith, <hi>having then Gifts differing according,</hi> &amp;c. But we Answer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Word <hi>Gift</hi> is often in Scripture taken for <hi>Office; as Eph.</hi> 4. 8, 11. <hi>When he ascended on high, he led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto Men,</hi> and v. 11. <hi>He sheweth what these Gifts were, some to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, some Evangelists,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Apostle in the <hi>Protasis</hi> speaks not of several Gifts, but of several Offices, and these not in the <hi>same,</hi> but in several <hi>Members,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>As we have many Members in one Body, and all Members have not the same Office.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Apodosis,</hi> must also be understood not only of <hi>several Gifts,</hi> but of <hi>several Offices,</hi> and these in <hi>several Subjects.</hi> And this further appears, by the very Similitude which the Apostle here useth, which is the same he used, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. from the Body natural, wherein there are many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Members, and every Member hath its distinct Office; and so it is in the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. These Gifts here mentioned, and the Waiting upon them, do necessarily imply an Office in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they are; and therefore they are set down em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically with an Article, ΕΙΤΕ Ο ΔΙΔΑΣΚΟΝ O ΠΡΟΙSΤΑΜΕΝΟS. He that hath the Gift of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Exhorting, and Ruling, and waiteth upon this Gift, what is he but a Teacher, Pastor, and Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elder? And this must either be granted, or else we must open a Door for all Members of the Church, even <hi>Women,</hi> not only to preach and teach, but to rule also, and to wait upon Preaching and Ruling.

This Truth is so clear, as that the Papists themselves being convinced of it, do say upon this Text, that the Apostle here first speaks of Gifts in general; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cornelius a lapide, in</hi> Rom. 12. 6, 7, 8.</note> and secondly, applyeth these Gifts to Ecclesiastical Officers, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and afterwards directs his Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all Christians in general.</p>
                  <p>The third Text for the Divine Right of the <hi>Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elder,</hi> is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double Honour, especially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of which Words, we will lay down this Rule; That every Text of Scripture is to be interpreted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Literal and Grammatical Construction; unless it be contrary to the Analogie of Faith, or the Rule of Life, or the Circumstances of the Text: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, we shall make a Nose of Wax of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and draw <hi>qaidlibet ex quolibet.</hi> Now according to the <hi>Grammatical Construction,</hi> here are plainly held forth <hi>two sorts of Elders;</hi> the one, <hi>only Ruling;</hi> and the other, <hi>also labouring in Word and Doctrine.</hi> Give us leave to give you the true Analysis of the Words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is a <hi>Genus,</hi> a General, and that is <hi>Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Two distinct Species, or Kinds of Elders, <hi>Those that rule well, and those that labour in Word and Doctrine;</hi> as Pastor and Doctor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here we have two Participles, expressing these two Kinds of Elders, <hi>Ruling, Labouring;</hi> the first do only rule, the second do also labour in Word and Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here are two distinct Articles, distinctly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed 
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003854_0039_100205682E2A7F28"/>
to these two Participles, OI ΠΡΟΕSΤΟΤΕS, ΟΙ ΚΟΠΙΟΕΝΤΕS. They that rule, they that labour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Here is an <hi>eminent discretive Particle,</hi> set betwixt these two kinds of Elders, these two Participles; these two Articles evidently distinguish one from the other, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> MALISTA, <hi>especially they that Labour,</hi> &amp;c. And where-over this Word MALISTA is used in the New-Testament, it is used to distinguish Thing from Thing, or Person from Person; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 38. In all which Places, the Word [<hi>especially</hi>] is used as a discretive Particle, to distinguish one Thing from another, or one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from another; and therefore being applied here to Persons, must necessarily distinguish Person from Person, Officer from Officer. It is absurd to say, (saith Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi>) that this Text is to be understood of one and the same Elder<note n="*" place="margin">
