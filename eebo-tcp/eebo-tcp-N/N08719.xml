            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of the TRIAL OF <hi>JOSEPH ANDREWS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON Wedneſday the 17th of May, 1769, by Virtue of a ſpecial Commiſſion from his Majeſty, for the Trial of Piracy, &amp;c. at the Hall of the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> was held a Court of Admiralty, conſiſting of the following Gentlemen, viz. His Excellency the Governor Sir <hi>Henry Moore,</hi> Preſident; ten Gentlemen of his Majeſty's Council, the Judge of the Admiralty, the Deputy-Secretary, the Receiver General and Collector of the Province, and the Commander of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Ship <hi>Deal Caſtle,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>JOSEPH ANDREWS,</hi> late of the Sloop Polly, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was brought to the BAR.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Nicholls, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </hi> Regiſter of the Court of Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, and <hi>John M'Kiſſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </hi> Deputy-Regiſter; and a Notary Public, exhabitted five ſeveral Charges againſt the Priſoner; fourteen Witneſſes were, examined on the Part of the Crown, and two on the Part of the Priſoner. It appeared by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1766, he enter'd himſelf on board the Sloop <hi>Polly, Roluff Duryee,</hi> Maſter, bound from <hi>New-York</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> The other Perſons on board were <hi>Peter Demilt, jun.</hi> Mate; <hi>Nicholas Johnſon,</hi> and <hi>William Harris,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,—<hi>Cobbs,</hi> a Cabin Boy, <hi>Wells Coverley,</hi> a young Man; <hi>John Van Bunſchooten,</hi> another young Man, who went for his Health; and an <hi>Antigua</hi> Captain who had ſold his Veſſel, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011149_0003_0F856A1394059C40"/>
was returning home, Paſſenger. Soon after leaving <hi>New-York,</hi> obſerving the Captain and Paſſengers had a good deal of Money, he and Johnſon formed the Deſign of gaining Poſſeſſion of it by Murdering the People. This Deſign they concluded to put in Execution as ſoon as they ſhould make the Land; accordingly about 8 Days after, the Night before they expected to get to St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> about Midnight, <hi>William Harris</hi> being at Helm, and the Captain aſleep on a Hencoop on Deck, <hi>Johnſon</hi> with one Blow of an Ax killed him, and he expired without a Groan or Struggle. They then in like manner between them Murdered the three Paſſengers, and Mate with the Ax, and threw the Boy overboard alive. One of them made a Stroke with the Ax at <hi>Harris,</hi> who ran to the end of the Boltſprit with a Knife, and declared he would Kill the firſt Man that approached him. They then told him, if he would join them and ſwear to be ſecret and faithful, he ſhould be ſafe, and ſhare the Plunder with them; for <hi>Johnſon</hi> having formerly ſail'd with him, pretended to have a Regard for him: But it was previouſly agreed between <hi>Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Andrews,</hi> to kill him before they got aſhore. <hi>Harris</hi> then came into the Veſſel and aſſiſted in throwing the Bodies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; after which they broke open the Captain's and Paſſengers Cheſts and Lockers, got a Bottle of Wine, and drank Damnation to themſelves and each other if they diſcovered the Secret. They then got a Bible and made <hi>Harris</hi> ſwear upon it that he would not betray them; 3 or 4 Days after this, being in Sight of Land, and ſeveral Veſſels appearing, they got out the Boat, put into it two Cheſts, with whatever they thought proper to take, ſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the Veſſel, left her, and ſail'd towards the Land, telling <hi>Harris</hi> to ſteer clear of the Shore. But he telling them, if they did not get pretty near the Land, the Current would drive them to the Leeward of all the Iſlands, they left him to ſteer as he thought beſt,—but intended to throw him overboard before he got to Land. After ſome Time, <hi>Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Andrews</hi> both fell aſleep, when <hi>Harris,</hi> having got near the Shore, ſtripped himſelf, took the Opportuaity to throw overboard, without Noiſe, his Clothes, and both the Oars, one of which he had uſed inſtead of a Rudder to ſteer the Boat, he gently let himſelf down into the Sea and ſwam on Shore at St. Kitts. where he gave a blind ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious Account of himſelf, being afraid to ſay any Thing that might break his Oath of Secrecy; but at laſt he applied to a Miniſter for Advice how a Man ouht to act in a Caſe ſimilar to his own. The Miniſter convinced him that ſuch kind of Oaths were
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011149_0004_0F856A14348BBC88"/>
ſo far from being binding, that it would be highly criminal to keep them He then went before the Judge <hi>Surrogate</hi> of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty and gave his Depoſition of all the Circumſtances he knew of the bloody Affair. Soon after he quitted the Boat, the irregular tumbling of it waked the two Criminals, who ſaw their deſperate Situation, and were enraged they had not an Opportunity to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate their Revenge upon <hi>Harris.</hi> They at firſt endeavour'd to ſteer with their Hats, but afterwards did it more effectually with their Sprit, and by that Means got to Euſtatia, where they ſold the Boat.</p>
            <p>Some Days after their Arrival, the St. <hi>Chriſtopher's</hi> Gazette with <hi>Harris's</hi> Depoſition, made its Appearance in Euſtatia; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> happening to ſee it, immediately left the Iſland, in a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel bound to <hi>Caſco-Bay.</hi> The Governor of St. <hi>Euſtatia</hi>; on ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Depoſition, publiſhed by Proclamation an Order for a deligent Search, and that no Perſon ſhould carry the Criminals off, under the Penalty of 50,000 Pieces of Eight: He alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a Veſſel after <hi>Andrews,</hi> with a proper Notification of the Charge againſt him, and Deſcription of his Perſon. <hi>Johnſon</hi> was ſoon taken up at <hi>Euſtatia,</hi> confeſſed the Fact, and was executed on the 15th of <hi>November,</hi> 1766, by being broke alive on the Rack: He was ſtretched naked on a Croſs, where the Bones of his Arms, Legs and Thighs were broken with an Iron Bar, and he afterwards received upwards 20 Strokes on his breaſt, before he expired. <hi>Andrews</hi> the preſent Criminal was ſoon after his Arrival taken up, and impriſoned ſome Time at <hi>Boſton,</hi> when he attempted to cut his own Throat, but was prevented by the Care of his Attendants. From <hi>Boſton</hi> he was ſent here, where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the Twenty-ſixth Day of <hi>May,</hi> 1767, and remained a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner till his Execution.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Part of the clothing found with the Priſoner in his Cheſt, and by him claimed as his own, in the Preſence of the Court, were very fully and circumſtantially proved to have belonged to Captain <hi>Duryee,</hi> and his Mate, or ſome of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were Murdered on board the ſaid Sloop; and alſo many other Things found in the Cheſt and owned by the Priſoner.— Many of the Clothes were marked with the initial Letters of the Names of their former Owners, and many others of them with the plain Marks of thoſe Letters remaining, tho' the Silk of the marking was taken out, and they were marked J. A. the initial Letters of the Name of the Priſoner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Needle work'd Pocket-Book found with, and own'd by the Priſoner, before it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011149_0005_0F856A181D6F3F70"/>
was ſhewn in Court, was exactly deſcribed by the Woman who made it, particularly that a Corner of it was left unfiniſhed for want of Worſted to do it it; likewiſe a Medal of which the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one of the Murder'd Perſons, had a Copy, Several things ſaid by the Priſoner, during the Courſe of the Trial, and in his Defence, militated much againſt him. The Trial laſted from Ten o'Clock on Wedneſday, until One o'clock on Thurſday Morning, during all which Time his Excellency never left the Bench. The Evidence was full, clear, and particular; the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was found <hi>guilty,</hi> and received Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>He was Executed on Tueſday the 23d of <hi>May,</hi> at the Eaſt-Side of <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River, near <hi>Domini's</hi> Hook, between the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of the Tide: And his Body was afterwards hung in Chains, on the moſt conſpicuous Part of the Peſt or <hi>Bealow's-Iſland,</hi> in <hi>New York Bay,</hi> as a Spectacle to deter all Perſons from the like atrocious Crimes.</p>
            <p>The Account he gave of himſelf was as follows, viz. That he was an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> born at the Town of <hi>Swanzey,</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> of poor but honeſt Proteſtant Parents, who brought him up in their own Perſuaſion, gave him an Education ſuitable to their Circumſtances, and ſent him to Sea: That he has led a Seafaring Life ever ſince, and ſailed to many different Parts of the World; that he had ſome Friends and Connections in <hi>Portugal,</hi> which led him to frequent and make ſome ſtay in that Place, and learn the Language; which gave Riſe to the Report, that he was a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi> and a <hi>Roman-Catholic,</hi> which was not true, as he never profeſſed any other than the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For many Years paſt he has made the City of <hi>New-Fork</hi> (where he married and has left a Widow) the place of his Reſidence, when not at Sea.—His Behaviour on Shore was irregular and diſorderly.</p>
            <p>A Neglect of Religion and all Chriſtian Duties, and a free In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of every vicious Inclination, particulatly in keeping bad Company, led him from one degree of Wickedneſs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, till his Heart was hardened againſt Remorſe and became capable of harbouring and deviſing horrid Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. The reſtraining Influences of the Divine Spirit, ſo often ſlighted and abuſed, were withdrawn from him, and he was left to be governed by the furious Impulſes of his diſorderly Paſſions, and to purſue with Greedineſs the Deſires of his own wicked Heart. The Gratification of theſe Deſires was the Temptation
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011149_0006_0F856A18E9A489A8"/>
that lead him to covet the Money of the Captain and Paſſengers, which he hoped would furniſh him with the Means; and when that Thought had taken Poſſeſſion of his Breaſt he was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remove every Obſtacle to its Accompliſhment, however dreadful the Conſequences.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Minds muſt have been moſt amazingly hardened in Guilt, that could in cool Blood have been ſo long brooding over ſuch a horrible Purpoſe, and Perſiſt in it till its final Execution. This cauſed a Suſpicion that Men capable of a Fact like this, muſt have been Veterans in Blood and Murder, and could not for a firſt Eſſay, have been Actors in ſo dreadful a Scene of Slaughter.</p>
            <p>And therefore theſe Criminals were ſuſpected to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſeveral other Murders perpretated within theſe few Years, particularly of <hi>Anthony De Noyer,</hi> Maſter of a <hi>French</hi> Schooner, near the Iſland of <hi>St. Domingo</hi>; in the Year 1765, and of two Men in <hi>New-Jerſey</hi>; but they both, till their laſt Moments, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſolemnly denying that they had ever before been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in any Murder or other capital Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph Andrews,</hi> was remarkably ignorant or inſenſible in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religious or moral Obligation; and though he ſeem'd hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to feel the Horrot of his Situation; yet all his Diſtreſs ſeem'd to ariſe from the Dread of perſonal Puniſhment—not at all from a proper Senſe of his Guilt; and though he confeſſed the Fact for which he ſuffered, repeatedly, to both the Miniſters, and at the Gallows, yee he always ſeemed to own it with Reluctance; and to feel ſomething of Reſentment againſt the Witneſſes upon whoſe Evidence he was found guilty, but ſaid he forgave them.</p>
            <p>The Excuſe he made for throwing the Boy overboard, was, that in the Scuffle he had received a Wound, which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended would have been Mortal, and that therefore it was beſt to end his Miſery at once.</p>
            <p>At the Gallows he owned his Crime, deſired all People, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Sailors to take Warning by him, and after repeating the Creed and Lord's Prayer, was executed.</p>
            <p>THE Night preceeding ANDREWS's Execution, a Gentleman whoſe veracity can be depended upon, went up to the Room wherein he was confined in the New-Goal, and had a very ſerious converſation with him. And after having joined him in Prayer; he adviſed him to ſatisfy the Public, by confeſſing the Crimes he had been guilty of —Andrews muſed for ſome Time, and then gave the following declaration.—As a dying Man, I think it is

a duty I owe to myſelf, to ſay ſomething againſt the many Crimes laid to my Charge by ſome Perſons, as a clamourous and inſolent, as they are ignorant and ſtupid; for if you take the Voice of the People, in general, there never was a Crime committed by mankind but what has been imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me. I pray God to forgive them and they have both my Forgiveneſs and Pity: My name is Joſeph Anderſon: I was born in Swanzey, in the Southern Part of Wales, near Vaux-Hall, of poor but honeſt Parents—in my Youth, I came over an Indented Servant to Boſton, and ſerved part of an Apprentiſhip to a Capt. of a Veſſel; but being very ambitious to be my own Maſter, I deſerted from him when at Liſbon.—I always had an inſatiable deſire for Money, and this unhappy propenſity has prompted me to do things, the remembrance of which is now very grievous unto me; but who liveth and ſinneth not! And thoſe who rail moſt againſt me, if they will take the trouble of ſcrutinizing their own Lives, they will find their conduct has not been unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable.—However they may ſay of me what they pleaſe, as my Time here, in all probability is very ſhort —And after the Execution of my Sentence, when they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſee my Body Hanging in Chains, they may (as they no doubt will) ſay there Hangs the Body of ANDREWS, the Pirate, who being a Roman Catholick, would make no Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>He was then Silent for a ſhort Time, and upon the Gentleman's Aſking him whether he was a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or not, he Anſwered in the Negative. And added that he had lived and ſhould die a Member of the Church of England. He was very deſirous to know if his Body <hi>realy</hi> was to be hung in Chains, if not, he would give a particular account of the Tranſactions of his Life; but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they perſiſted in their reſolution to Hang him in Chains, the World ſhould have little Satisfaction from him. —His Behaviour at the Place of Execution was decent and reſigned, he Prayed about fifteen Minutes and then deſired the cart to be drove of.—Upon the whole he ſeemed to be a daring reſolute Fellow.</p>
