            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT is natural for perſons, when they take a diſcourſe into their hands, on the occaſion of the following, to enquire after the cauſe or reaſon that has given riſe to it. To be very particular and minute in the detail would be too tedious. The following may ſerve to ſatisfy the candid and impartial inquirer.</p>
            <p>The author's ſituation has been peculiarly difficult, even from his firſt acquaintance with the place, eſpecially by reaſon of the long difficulties and diviſions that have there ſubſiſted, which were riſen to a great height in the days of his honoured prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, <note n="§" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. JOSEPH COIT.</note> and were the unhappy means of bringing his gray hairs with ſorrow to the grave. Theſe difficulties and diviſions that have and ſtill ſubſiſt, were occaſioned by that ſpirit of diſcord, ſown by the arch-enemy in many of our pariſhes; whence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have undertaken, with freedom, to cenſure the conſtitution of the government, and the more common method of miniſterial ſupport; exclaiming with vehemence againſt the churches, as being Antichriſt and Babylon; the rulers as ruling for Baol, and their teachers as teaching for lucre, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This ſpirit of rancour, bitterneſs, and diviſion having made a moſt prodigious progreſs, many minds were prejudiced, and theſe prejudices induſtriouſly propagated, that there were but few whoſe minds were not ſoured by this leaven of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and became cold in their affections to the miniſtry. Theſe things rendered the author's ſupport extremely difficult, there being no way to attain it but by mere dint of law; a method the author try'd many years, with reluctance. There being no proſpect of times being better, and the ſociety ſignifying their deſire, or willingneſs, of their paſtor's being diſmiſs'd from his paſtoral relation, the motion was made to the church, who at firſt manifeſted their unwillingneſs to concur, being united and in full charity with their paſtor; but conſidering, upon a review, that the miniſterial ſupport was from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in conjunction with the church, — that they could not proceed but in conſort, — they paſs'd a vote (tho' with very
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009000_0004_10307F4E10959B00"/>
great reluctance, being in full charity, as it is expreſs'd in their vote) for the diſmiſſion of their reverend paſtor, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him, in their names, to ſend to an eccleſiaſtical coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for that purpoſe; which council, in their reſult, expreſs themſelves as follows.</p>
            <p>"Conſidering the many and great difficulties which have long ſubſiſted in this place, and the deep-rooted (thô, as we believe ill-grounded) prejudices which are in the minds of ſo many againſt their preſent paſtor, and the little proſpect of his being longer uſeful in this place when ſo great a majority appear deſireous of his removal, (as alſo Mr. Rowland's earneſt deſire to be removed) think it beſt that his paſtoral relation to this people be diſſolved; and therefore do (thô with reluctance) diſſolve the paſtoral relation between the rev. Mr. Rowland and the firſt ſociety and the church in Plainfield. As there have been no charges, of any kind, exhibited againſt Mr. Rowland, ſo we freely declare that we know nothing, of any kind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting him, that can be any diſqualification for the work of the goſpel miniſtry; and do very cordially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> recommend him to any part of the chriſtian church where providence may open a door to his future uſefulneſs."</p>

                  <p>And now behold, I know that ye all among whom I have gone, preaching the kingdom of God, ſhall ſee my face no more.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I take you to record, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE words now read, are a part of St. Paul's farewel-ſermon, delivered to the elders of the church of Epheſus, one of the noted churches, in the Leſſer Aſia, of which we have an account in the book of the revelation of St. John. <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 2. beg.—</note> ſome interpreters ſuppoſe the words, tho' immediately directed to the elders of the church, were yet deſigned to include the whole church. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Calvin in Loc.</note> However it is evident the apoſtle ſpent conſiderable time at Epheſus, that his conduct and behaviour was well known both to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people, preaching the goſpel to them, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for their ſalvation, not only in their publick ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, but alſo in their private houſes, from houſe to houſe, as ver. 20. This holy apoſtle was indefatigable in his labours, and never did, thro' ſloth negligence, or weak ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, ſacrifice a good conſcience. He faced dangers and defied cenſure, was ready not only to be bound, but alſo to die, for the name and honour of Chriſt; and when bonds and afflictions awaited him, he made no account of them, not eſteeming his very life precious to himſelf on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he might faithfully and joyfully finiſh his courſe as a chriſtian, and an apoſtle, and fulfil the miniſtry which he had recieved of the Lord Jeſus, even to teſtify the truth, and urge the importance of the glorious goſpel of the free and abundant grace of God; a diſpenſation infinitely
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009000_0006_10307F51872F6E88"/>
glorious, in which the abundant grace of God ſhines with a luſtre not to be equaled, to which we are all indebted, infinitely indebted, miniſters and people, far beyond the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns we can ever make. The apoſtle gloried in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the croſs of Chriſt, as they contained the moſt illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious diſplay of divine grace, and were the power of God to the ſalvation of all that believe, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. i, 16.—</note>. The apoſtle was ſo far from being aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt that he gloried in it; and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truths of it he endeavoured to preſs upon the minds of thoſe to whom he preached; and at Epheſus he kept back nothing that was profitable unto them <note n="‡" place="bottom">V. 20, 21. continued.—</note>; teſtifying, both to Jews and Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And now being about to take his leave of them, he addreſſes them as in the words of my text: And now behold I know that ye all, my dear brethren, among whom I have gone, ſhall ſee my face no more. The words are a Hebraiſm, for, ye ſhall not all ſee my face any more<note n="*" place="bottom">Pool's Synop in loc.</note>. Some ſuppoſe that the apoſtle had it intimated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to him that he ſhould no more come to Epheſus, and therefore never have an opportunity of ſeeing them to whom he was now addreſſing himſelf in the moſt tender and affectionate manner; <note n="‖" place="bottom">Doddridge in Loc. and his note on v. 27.</note> therefore he ſent for them that he might take his ſolemn farewel of them, and to teſtify to them all, that if any of them periſh, yet he ſhould be clear from the blood of all men. I teſtify to you, and God is my witneſs that I have laboured for your ſalvation, and the ſalvation of all that heard me, and have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God. He ſuppreſs'd nothing that was advantageous or that would promote their edification; he did not avoid nor ſhun, from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whatſoever, declaring all the counſel of God; he did not withhold or diſguiſe any important truth, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the open publication of it for fear of diſpleaſing thoſe to whom it ought to be declared: But, on the contrary, he delivered the counſel, or will of God, with the greateſt ſincerity and unreſervedneſs; opening and enforcing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009000_0007_10307F55ED7E1288"/>
truths relating to our redemption, by Chriſt, and the way to eternal happineſs with him, in the moſt plain and faithful manner; not regarding the cenſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt he might incur from the enemies of chriſtianity; deaf to cenſure, to applauſe unelate, reſolute in the face of dangers, and inflexible to every motive of eaſe and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he purſued the arduous work he had undertaken, and, like the ſaints of old, loved not his life to the death <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xii, 11.</note>, that is, he expoſed himſelf to the greateſt dangers, and met death in the glorious conflict; but he fell to riſe, triumph and reign.</p>
            <p>But in purſuing the deſign in view, I ſhall only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two things in general; where I ſhall endeavour,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhew you when a miniſter may be ſaid to ſhun declaring all the counſel of God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Conſider ſome things included and neceſſarily impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in declaring all the counſel of God.</p>
            <p>Then I ſhall make ſome improvement ſuitable to our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the proſpect of our parting.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, I am to ſhew you when a miniſter may be ſaid to ſhun declaring all the counſel of God.</p>
            <p>He who dare make the moſt ſacred things ſerve to gratify his own, or the humours of others, or as a cloke to colour over his pride and avarice, is in the moſt pitiable and unhappy condition. It is a crime too many have been guilty of, trifling with things in their nature ſacred, and a profanation unpardonable, were it not that infinite mercy had been exerciſed in behalf of the greateſt ſinners, even the chief <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Tim. i.15.</note>. Happy had it been for many had the ordinances of Chriſt never been proſtituted to the moſt baſe and merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary views for promoting ſecular intereſt, and inordinate cravings of a ſelfiſh mind; and it would ſtill be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, were there no ſuch pernicious and deſtructive principle prevalent, or ſo much as to be found in this world; and tho' it is what may not be expected in the preſent ſtate, to be perfectly free from ſuch an infelicity; yet it is the deſign of the goſpel of the grace of God to purify and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine men, to fit and prepare them for the moſt noble ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009000_0008_10307F59DB9806A0"/>
in the preſent ſtate, and to conduct them to a better; to free them, while here, from thoſe evils, and to deliver them from thoſe falſe biaſes to which they are ſo incident; to prompt them to act in the moſt diſintereſted manner, with a ſuitable regard to the honour and glory of God, the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their own, and the ſouls of others. Men that are in a ſtate of ſlavery to their luſts, can't well avoid being ſlaves to the humors of others; and it is a thouſand to one, if ſuch do not ſacrifice a good conſcience thro' weak timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and fear of giving offence. —The apoſtle had not ſo learned Chriſt; therefore ſpake the word with all freedom and boldneſs, without fear or affection to any man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would hear or whether they would forbear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that he was to God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, in them that periſh, and in them that are ſaved, to the one a ſavour of life, unto life, but to the other a ſavour of death unto death. <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. ii, 15, 16.</note>

            <p>Here I ſhall mention two or three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A miniſter may be ſaid to ſhun declaring all the counſel of God when he don't deliver the doctrines of Chriſt in a plain and intelligible manner, when he endeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himſelf under unintelligible phraſes, and an uncertain manner of expreſſing himſelf, that his hearers are at a loſs to know what the plain deſign of his expreſſions import. — The doctrines of Chriſt are of the laſt concern to mankind; their well-being and bleſſedneſs nearly, yea neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon their being well underſtood; without this kind of knowledge the heart can't be good <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xix, 2.</note>, there can be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the chief good, no well-grounded hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. —If the opportunities enjoyed for inſtruction are doubtful and uncertain what hope of reaping profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from them? The ſtile in which a miniſter addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his audience, ought not on the one hand to be jejune and flat, ſo as to render his adminiſtrations contemptible, nor on the other hand, too florid and bombaſt, that they can't be recieved by perſons of an ordinary ſize: he ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtudy a graceful decent and plain method of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, that his words, fitly ſpoken, may be like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

of Gold in pictures of ſilver <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. xxv, 11.</note>. The apoſtle Paul plainly intimates to us this as his manner of preaching <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note>; And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſpeech or of wiſdom, declaring unto you the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God; my ſpeech and my preaching was not with enticeing words of mens wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the ſpirit, and of power; not with wiſdom of words, leſt the croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect. The apoſtle lets the Corinthians know that his aim and manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, even from the begining, was not with the pomp of language, no, far very far from affecting ſuch a method to engage their affections, he kept in view the great deſign of the goſpel, which was admirably calculated to ſtain the pride of human glory; he had no need of affecting the ſublimity and ſubtilty made uſe of among the Greeks of that age; the goſpel needed not any ornaments of human invention, nor could the laboured charms of eloquence or philoſophy give luſtre or emphaſis to it: he therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to exhibit it in as intelligible a method as he could; treating it as coming from God: in ſuch a manner ſhould the miniſters of Chriſt addreſs themſelves to their people, then might they, with juſter reaſon, hope for the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their adminiſtrations, and that their hearers might grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt. <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. iii, 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The knowledge of things divine is, in its nature, the moſt excellent, and moſt directly tends to the welfare and happineſs of ſuch as are made effectually acquainted with them, that to prevent, and embarraſs the truths of God, by a doubtful and unintelligible method of explication is an evil almoſt unpardonable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A miniſter may be ſaid to ſhun declaring all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God when he makes uſe of uncertain and ambiguous words or phraſes in his explication of goſpel truths. This being the caſe, it looks like artifice and deſign, a method to conceal himſelf from cenſure and intitle himſelf to a good living. To make uſe of uncertain modes of expreſſion, and certain phraſes to which there is no fixt determinate
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009000_0010_10307F5FCC72CC50"/>
ideas, or, leaſt, they are ambiguous and doubtful, may be underſtood in a proper or leſs proper ſenſe, which leaves the hearer in a ſtate of ſuſpence and uncertainty what the ſpeaker intends; this is ſuppoſed in withholding a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the will of God; it is to diſguiſe it, that it may appear what it really is not, to ſhun and avoid repreſenting of it, in its native ſimplicity <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Leigh's Critica Sacra.</note>. If the preacher ſtudy an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful method of communicating himſelf, and frequently make uſe of ambiguous terms in his explication of ſome of the doctrines of the goſpel, will not his hearers ſuſpect whether he believe them or not, or, if he does, that he eſteems them of little importance, meer ſpeculation! and, of courſe, they, with an air of indifference if not of contempt treat the moſt important realities! —This is a character unworthy a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the goſpel, an embaſſador of the Lord of hoſts. A ſimplicity of expreſſion, as well as manners, free from force formality hypocricy and deceit, is the proper cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick of ſuch as preach the goſpel; and an honeſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and unreſerv'd method of communicating and enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the goſpel ought to be very eminent and conſpicuous in them. This the apoſtle Paul propoſes as the real and genuine character of chriſtianity, its natural and proper effect; and it was the conſciouſneſs he had of his own integrity, plain-heartedneſs, freedom from deceit and guile that animated him in the diſcharge of his embaſſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the clamours and reproaches thrown upon him by ſons of malice ſlander and falſhood: Our rejoicing (ſaith he) is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience that in ſimplicity with godly ſincerity <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Cor. i, 12.</note>, maintaining a ſenſe of the divine preſence and inſpection (the ſureſt guard unto unfeigned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity) we live in the world.—This holy apoſtle ſtudied always the moſt artleſs method of conduct, at all times and in all places; he abhorred the notion of deceit and guile, as methods below the chriſtian and the apoſtle <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. xii, 16. This text has been ſhamefully perverted by ſome, when they have improved it to juſtify the low artifices they have uſed to bring others to their faith and practice. The apoſtle mentions it as an invidious inſinuation of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and ſpeaks of it with abhorrence.</note>. The ſecret conciouſneſs of his integrity ſupported him, in the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009000_0011_10307F63089B1448"/>
moſt couragious efforts, animated him in the midſt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and gave him a fortitude of mind ſuited to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and difficulties of his office. In his enforceing the truths and duties of the goſpel, he behaved in the moſt unaffected manner: Our exhortation (ſaith he) was not of deceit, or of uncleanneſs, nor in guile <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Theſ. ii, 3.</note>; it was not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on any principles of deceit, he had no mercenary or ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al purpoſes to ſerve, there was nothing of guile or crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no under-handedneſs, nothing that could fear the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny, all was fair open ſimple and artleſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A miniſter may be ſaid to ſhun declaring all the counſel of God when he withholds the truth, or any part of the truth, thro' fear, or affection to the perſon of any man.</p>
            <p>It is the apoſtolick character of a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, that he pleaſes not man, but God.—Do I (ſaith the apoſtle) ſeek to pleaſe men? for if I yet pleaſe men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. i, 10.</note>. He that complies with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, ſooths the humours, and flatters the vanity of his hearers, deſerves not the name of a chriſtian, much leſs of a miniſter; for he that acts as an ambaſſador of the prince of peace, muſt not in the diſcharge of his embaſſy be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the cenſure, or applauſe of mortals, whoſe breath goeth forth and they are no more, nor ſhould he by any means ſtudy an accommodation to the taſte and prejudices of ſenſual minds: —it is much becoming his character and office to labour at all times, to ſecure, above all things, the approbation of God, who trieth the heart, with the greateſt exactneſs and care <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Theſ. ii, 4.</note>: We ſpeak not (ſaith the apoſtle) as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men, but God,—nor did we (ſays he) deal in flattering words "to inſinuate ourſelves into your affections, and ſooth you in your ſins, as ye well know, nor had we recourſe to a pretence of piety to promote the ſchemes of covetouſneſs, often artfully conducted under the covert of religious zeal: God is our witneſs, that we were far above every thing of this kind, and made all ſuch views our firſt ſacrifice to the glory of his name, and propagation of his goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor did we ſeek glory or applauſe of men, ſuch among whom we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009000_0012_10307F64B60FC478"/>
have laboured and converſed <note n="†" place="bottom">Doddridge's Paraphraſe.</note>." No, theſe views are far, very far, from influencing the minds of the miniſters of Chriſt, tho' oftentimes they get much illwill and hatred by it. Unhappy indeed muſt it be for the church of Chriſt if any who miniſter at God's altar ſhould ſacrifice truth to the affection, or favour of men. This would moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a threatning omen to the church, as it is the firſt ſtep towards giving up all revealed religion: if a part may be ſo prophanely ſacrificed, why may not the whole?—How unreaſonable and wicked, even to a prodigy, ſuch fear, or condeſcenſion! Our hearers have almoſt as many taſtes as complections; but they are like men ſick with a fever, who can't reliſh the moſt proper food, for the nouriſhment of the body, or the diſordered ſtomach that hankers for that which is moſt unnatural and hurtful.—One cenſures the preacher becauſe he imagines he's too rigid in the doctrine of man's apoſtacy by the firſt Adam,—too much inſiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moral impotency of mankind; another, becauſe he fancies he's little ſhort of blaſphemy, in his explication of the decrees of God, that therein he ſaps the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſinner's endeavours after grace and holineſs;— others, becauſe they ſuppoſe that he is too ſtiff in his notions of the free juſtification of a ſinner before God, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, efficacious grace, &amp;c.— ſome, becauſe he don't inſiſt enough upon topicks of the like nature;—others, becauſe he don't particularly and ſufficiently diſplay the excellencies, and recommend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantages of moral vertue:—one cavils at his dreſs, another at his air:—ſome becauſe he writes and reads his diſcourſes, and ſome becauſe he is able to do it:—one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is flat and lifeleſs, another becauſe he has too much fervor and pathos. Thus they go on in a circle of uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as reſtleſs as the troubled ſea, diſcovering a childiſh temper and diſpoſition, never pleaſed but when humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If every minute part of their miniſter's conduct whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publick private or domeſtick life, don't quadrate with their notions, he's no miniſter for them, be his morals and doctrines as unexceptionable as the goſpel.—He that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009000_0013_10307F6B9C7CE478"/>
the taſk of gratifying the humours of his hearers, will never be able to perform it. He that ſets out to pleaſe one or all will be ſure to pleaſe none at all; for it is as eaſy for a man to ſerve God and mammon, as for a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt to ſerve the humours, the peculiarities of his people, and diſcharge, ſuitably diſcharge the duties of his ſacred office. The ſervant of the Lord ſhould be well-ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and fix'd in the doctrines of the goſpel, not heſitating, or in the leaſt wavering; not afraid or aſhamed to own and recommend the truths of the goſpel;—and well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the various parts and branches of his office; then, with unwearied diligence, to purſue the duties of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, leaving the event.—They ſhould cry aloud and ſpare not, lift up their voice like a trumpet <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſ. v, 8, 1.</note>, be Boanerges, ſons of thunder, to awaken and alarm ſleepy ſinners, and ſtop bold tranſgreſſors in their full career to endleſs miſery and ruin, and, Barnabas-like, ſons of conſolation, to comfort ſuch as mourn in Zion, to raiſe up the bowed down, to ſtrengthen the hands and encourage the hearts of the people of God, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſ. iv, 1, 2.</note> keeping the main end of their embaſſy in view, doing nothing by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in favour of one more than another, according to the inducements of private intereſt, friendſhip, or affection, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, that they may know that there has been a prophet among them <note n="§" place="bottom">Exek. ii, 5.</note>. But,</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am to conſider ſome things included and neceſſarily implied in declaring all the counſel of God.</p>
            <p>A miniſter's declaring all the counſel of God, muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he lays before his people the whole ſyſtem of divine truths, relating to the being, perfections and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, our fall by the firſt, and recovery by the ſecond Adam; theſe truths are neceſſary to our well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terms of the goſpel, and way to eternal life and happineſs, by Jeſus Chriſt; nothing ſhould be kept back or diſguiſed for fear of giving offence. It too often happens that a miniſter's plain and pungent method of addreſs gives offence, tho' it be with the utmoſt prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both in air and expreſſion <note n="*" place="bottom">No ſmall degree of wiſdom and prudence ought to be uſed in our addreſſes that are plain and pungent, for I am very far from thinking that it conſiſts in a bold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and domineering method of treating our fellow-men, as though they were beaſts of burden, obliged to bear whatever in laid upon them, or meer machines to be ſet in motion by vehement exclamations.</note>, eſpecialy when it croſſes ſome humour, or
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009000_0014_10307F6D5826EC20"/>
inclination, ſome prejudice in favour of their peculiar ſet of thoughts. Regardleſs of private intereſt or affection ſhould he who acts as a miniſter of the prince of peace, ſpeak the word with all freedom and boldneſs, as he ought to ſpeak. It will be impracticable for me to go over all the particular branches that naturally ſuggeſt themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head; I ſhall, with as much brevity as may be, and time will allow, touch at a few.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt ſuppoſe a ſuitable illuſtration of the being and perfections of the divine nature. That God is, is the firſt article in the chriſtian creed. He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. xi.6.</note>. Religion is wholly founded upon the doctrine of the one infinitely glorious, perfect and all-ſufficient being, who hath made the heavens, and the earth, and all things that in them are, by the word of his power. Thus it is ſaid, He hath made the earth by his power, he hath eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſdom, and ſtretched out the heavens by his diſcretion. When he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he cauſeth the vapours to aſcend from the ends of the earth: He maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treaſures <note n="‡" place="bottom">Jer. x, 12, 13.</note>. This righteous being is the ſole object of religious worſhip and homage, as in himſelf he is the moſt excellent being, capable, from the infinite ſource of good in himſelf, to communicate to the needy circumſtances of his creatures, and whoſe infinite compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pity has moved him to provide for the relief of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ruined man, a ſaviour and ſacrifice all-ſufficient. It is a theme ſuitable to the ſacred deſk ſeaſonably to diſcant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perfections of the divine nature whether natural or moral, that our eſteem of him may be raiſed and our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of obedience be enforced.—O Lord my God thou art very great; who ſtretcheſt out the heavens as a curtain,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009000_0015_10307F6F083D6BB8"/>
who covereſt thyſelf with light, as with a garment: <note n="¶" place="bottom">Pſal. civ, 1, 2.</note> who ſtretcheſt out the north over the empty ſpace, and hangeſt the earth upon nothing<note n="‡" place="bottom">Job xxvi, 7.</note>: ſeek him that maketh the ſeven ſtars and orion and turneth the ſhadow in the morning and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the day dark with night <note n="‖" place="bottom">Amos v, 8.</note>:—The heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament ſheweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, night unto night ſheweth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: there is no ſpeech nor language where their voice is not heard; their line is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xix, 1-4.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It muſt ſuppoſe, that we endeavour to impreſs the minds of our hearers with a ſuitable ſenſe of the agency of God in all providential events. It is extremely natural for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to misjudge things, and call them what they be not; ſo to attribute the moſt ſurprizing events meerly to the ſkill prudence and ſagacity of themſelves or others, or thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning words Fate or Chance; and by ſuch a miſtaken view of things they eclipſe the glory of the divine agency, that divine agency which produces every event by a ſecret but powerful influence upon ſecond cauſes operating for ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Now theſe miſtakes men ſo naturaly run into ſhould be corrected, and a firm unſhaken belief of the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>He that created all things by the word of his power, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds and diſpoſes them, according to his wiſdom, and by the ſame word of his power: <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. i.3.</note> he alone is independent and ſelf-ſufficient, therefore the idea of a creature implies depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that which depends upon God for being muſt for its continuance in being. There is an unremitted exertion of divine power, call'd the divine manutention, by which we live move and act: accordingly the apoſtle obſerves that it is in Him we live, in him we move, in him we have our being, and in him are all our ways. <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts xvii, 28.</note> —God is ſaid, according to the fix'd laws of nature, to preſerve his creatures by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality of ſecond cauſes. Thus our life is ſupported by the air in which we breath and the food by which we are nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. Thoſe numberleſs things which tend to our comfort,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009000_0016_10307F70B68B5930"/>
are communicated to us by ſecond cauſes, under the direction of a wiſe providence, which it is as much to be aſcribed to, as tho' produced without any ſuch means. God is ſaid to give food to all fleſh: <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal. cxxxvi, 25.</note> and with reſpect to the brutal creation, 'tis ſaid, Theſe all wait upon thee, thou giveſt them their meat in due ſeaſon, that thou giveſt them they gather; thou openeſt thine hand, they are filled with good. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſ. civ, 27, 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How many great and ſurprizing events are produced by what are call'd ſecond cauſes? this ſuppoſes a firſt, by which all others are guided and directed! this can be no creature, ſince it is peculiar to the Glorious God; all act under his influence, his providence, the greateſt and the leaſt are equally under the influence of his providence, and dependent upon Him. He doth according to his will in the army of heaven, as alſo among the countleſs inhabitants of the earth. <note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. iv, 25.</note> In brief, the whole frame of nature is ſupported by Him, the elements and meteors are ſubject to his appointment, fire and hail, ſnow and vapour and ſtormy winds fulfil his word. He looketh to the ends of the earth, and ſeeth under the whole heaven to make the weight of the winds and the weight of the waters by meaſure; when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. cxlviii, 8.</note>.</p>
            <p>To which might be ſubjoind, the providence of God is eminently ſeen in ſending afflictions and troubles for the advantage of his people that he may withdraw man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from him <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Job xxxiii, 17.</note>.—The ſurprizing events of war are according to his wiſe direction, be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoldier his martial genius and teacheth his hands to war, and his fingers to fight; <note n="(b)" place="bottom">2 Sam. xxii, 35.</note> he giveth hardineſs and fortitude, or ſends faintneſs and timidity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſuppoſes that we endeavour to affect our hearers with a ſenſe of their fallen helpleſs circumſtances; that by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all, for that all have ſinned. <note n="¶" place="bottom">Ro. v, 12.</note> The corruption and impotence of human nature are facts ſo ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, being eſtabliſhed by the univerſal experience of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in all generations, that it is vain to diſpute what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009000_0017_10307F74B8309908"/>
ſo evident. Yet, as to the riſe of moral evil, there have been many warm and diſadvantageous controverſies; yet there have been ſome which have thrown much light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, manifeſting theſe important truths of God, and guarding us againſt the dangers we are expoſed to by falſe judging.</p>
            <p>If we attend cloſely to the account the ſacred pages give us of this matter, and judge of them in the moſt plain eaſy and intelligible manner, without force, ſophiſtry, or allegory, we muſt conclude we have guilt derived to us from our feederal head, Adam: by the offence of this one, many are made ſinners, <note n="†" place="bottom">Ro. v. 19.</note> they become obnoxious to death, expoſed to the anger and wrath of almighty God, in time and in eternity. The demerit of ſin is everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it is a conſpiracy againſt a being of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite perfection. The ways of ſin is death, and (according to the antetheſes in the text) it muſt be eternal death: for (ſaith the apoſtle) The gift of God is eternal life; therefore the ways of ſin muſt be eternal death. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ro. vi, ult.</note> Thus expoſed are we every day and moment we live, and yet ſtupidly unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with our danger; blind and cannot ſee afar off; <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pet. i, 9.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of reſcuing ourſelves from our unhappy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; <note n="¶" place="bottom">Joh. xv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> in reſtleſs purſuit of vanity, graſping for fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhadows; amuſing ourſelves with toys, and the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty name of honour; with the uncertain riches of time, and the beaſt-like pleaſures of ſenſe. The heart of the ſons of men is full of evil, and madneſs is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead <note n="*" place="bottom">Ecl. ix, 3.</note>. It is neceſſary that the ſinner have his caſe plainly repreſented to him that he might be affected with his ſtate and condition, excited to flee from the wrath to come, and lay hold of eternal life. If the ſinner be not ſenſible of his need of an intereſt in the favour of God, he will never ſeek after it. Seeking after God, ſuppoſes the loſs of him. If the ſinner never ſees, never feels his need of Chriſt, he will never ſeek par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and help from him. The whole need not the phyſician, but the ſick, and Chriſt came to call ſinners to repentance.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Mat. ix, 12.</note> By the terrors of the law, as well as the invitations of the

            <p n="1">1. What has been obſerved may ſerve to ſhew us wherein the unfaithfulneſs of a miniſter principally conſiſts; it is not in neglecting ſome peculiar things, ſuppoſed neceſſary by ſome, and on which they may lay great weight, though they have no expreſs warrant from the word of God to juſtify them in their peremptory aſſertions: but when he witholds the truth, and don't deliver it with that plainneſs and ſimplicity the goſpel requires; when he keeps back ſomething that might be for the profit and advantage of his hearers, there can be no motive or excuſe ſuffiicent to juſtify ſuch a neglect. It is the principal and main branch of the miniſterial office to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all the counſel of God, to underſtand what is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the good of the people; wherefore he is to ſtudy to ſhew himſelf approved to God, a workman that needeth not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. ii, 15.</note> He who performs this embaſſy with a careleſs indifferency, or only with a view to ſerve himſelf and gratify the humours of his hearers; he who, thro' fear of ſome and affection to others, dare not ſpeak, in plain and intelligible language, the great truths and important duties of religion, and entertains his audience with empty harangues, or with noiſy ignorance, deſigned to raiſe their affections, rather than inform their judgments; that amuſes his hearers with ridiculous tales, and a clamourous ſound without any meaning, this is to prophane the ſacred office, and to be guilty in ſuch an important branch of it, as renders him criminally negligent.

            <p n="2">2. We hence ſee wherein the duty of the miniſters of Chriſt principally conſiſts: it is expreſs'd by the apoſtle, by not ſhunning to declare all the counſel of God. That mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that acts his part well, that faithfully diſcharges his embaſſy, will, in an open free unreſerved manner, apply the truths of the goſpel, according to their nature and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To preach the goſpel is to preach Chriſt; and to preach Chriſt is to preach his word. This is the ſolemn charge given to miniſters, Preach the word: be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon: reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-ſuffering and doctrine. <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. iv, 2.</note> Preaching the goſpel is the great duty, the principal branch of the miniſterial work, and all other things ſhould be done in ſubſerviency to it. It is firſt in the commiſſion, Go, teach all nations; <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. xxviii.19.</note> or (as it is expreſſed by another of the evangeliſts) Go, preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every creature<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. xvi, 15.</note>. Miniſters are Chriſt's heralds, and in the execution of their office, they are to proclaim the awful terrors of God's firey law, in the ſurprizing accents of Sinai's dreadful thunder, to awaken the ſecure, to alarm the lethargic. They muſt cry aloud &amp; not ſpare, lift up their voice like a trumpet &amp; ſhew God's people their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins <note n="¶" place="bottom">Iſ. lviii, 1.</note>. He muſt ſound the jubilee trumpet of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and proclaim liberty to captives, the opening of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon door to them that are bound; proclaiming the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort all that mourn <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſ. lxi, 1, 2.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009000_0023_10307F8743725EB8"/>Some are bold and impudent enough to ſay, that preaching the goſpel is the leaſt part of the miniſterial office; but ſuch are wiſe above what is written. The apoſtle St. Paul, who well underſtood the duties of his office, had views of things very different from ſuch dictators: he eſteemed it the principal branch of his office, as an apoſtle and miniſter. He ſaith, Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, i. e. not ſo much to baptize, as to preach the goſpel <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. i, 17.</note>. This he conſidered as his principal, his main buſineſs, by which he was to bring perſons to that faith which would intitle them to the bleſſings of the goſpel. By preaching the goſpel mens eyes were to be opened, and they turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remiſſion of ſins, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xxvi, 17, 18.</note>. This is the grand deſign of the goſpel, the important end in view, and the medium for its accompliſhment is preaching all the counſel of God. If ſuch as make the objection, mean only the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a diſcourſe, it is juſt: but it muſt be remembered that preaching the goſpel neceſſarily includes every thing requiſite to it, as reading, ſtudy, meditation, and prayer, and when it is conſidered in its neceſſary connection, it is, as it will appear in this view, the grand, the moſt important part of the miniſterial function. The unſcriptural and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble notion that too many have of a miniſter's ſpending a great part, if not all his time in viſits, is at moſt but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary buſineſs, except in caſes of ſickneſs, and the like; it is diſcretionary becauſe there is no poſitive command for it, and there being no poſitive command for it, it muſt be left, as it is, to the miniſters own diſcretion, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another's; and performed as his leiſure will admit and prudence dictates. A practice of this buſineſs, in ordinary caſes, would, I preſume, be more likely to be diſſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than beneficial. And as it is nor an eſſential branch of the miniſterial office, and not ſtrictly enjoined in common caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he muſt be determined by the knowledge he has of perſons and their circumſtances, and ſo conducting he is accountable to none. But in preaching the goſpel he ought to lay himſelf out in the beſt manner, and exert himſelf
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009000_0024_10307F88F546AC00"/>
moſt vigorouſly, that he may ſave himſelf and thoſe that hear him,<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. ix, 27.</note> preach the goſpel like a workman that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be aſhamed, which requires much pains labour ſweat and toil. To be well furniſhed with the moſt proper and wholeſome food for the ſoul, calls for the greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and care. There are other things that belong to the miniſterial office, ſuch as ordination and diſpenſing the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the church. But preaching the goſpel ought to be the firſt thing in view, as this is the method inſtituted by infinite wiſdom for the ſalvation of precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls. It hath pleaſed God, by the preaching of the goſpel, to ſave them that believe<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. i, 21.</note>: therefore being the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted means of ſalvation, by which men are brought to faith, repentance and final happineſs, it ſhould be firſt in our eſteem, and proſecuted with the utmoſt ardour of mind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It muſt certainly give a miniſter comfort and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the near approach of death, or a ſeparation from his people, to have a conſciouſneſs of his not having ſhunned to declare all the counſel of God. At ſuch times will they moſt ſurely recollect, and call to mind their paſt behaviour and conduct; and if, upon the moſt narrow ſearch and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, they can find they have acted in the diſcharge of their embaſſy as ſtewards of the manifold grace of God, tho' their ſercives have been attended with weakneſs, and much imperfection, they are ſafe and ſecure; tho' malice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, prejudice and ill-will may ſlander and defame them, they ſtand firm in their integrity, and as unmoved as the rock againſt which the angry waves daſh, and retire with ſhame. Our rejoicing, is this, the teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that "our aims in religion have been noble, and our conduct ſimple and uniform;—then may we look upon the applauſes or the cenſures of men as comparatively a very light matter." We aim at pleaſing God rather than man, and in the diſcharge of our important work to gain his approbation; and thô this be principal with us, we, upon a careful review, find a thouſand deficiencies to humble us before God; for theſe we implore his pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as alſo our people's.

            <p>This conſciouſneſs, I have mentioned, gives ſatisfaction in the near approach of a miniſter's ſeparation from his people.

            <p>Your ſtate and condition, O ſinners! is infinitely hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, however inſenſible you may be of it; there is but a ſtep between you and the world of ſpirits, where they have no reſt day nor night.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. xiv, 11.</note>—'Tis the brittle thread of life that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains you, and prevents you from immediately ſinking into endleſs deſpair and miſery.

How ſad and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful muſt it be to live and die unacquainted with thoſe things in which conſiſts your higheſt intereſt, which is your trueſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs? To ſpend your days in vanity, and your years in the purſuit of the filth, and droſs of time, is a piece of madneſs, which will be repented of when it is too late.

Every enjoyment of life is taſtleſs, and can yield no comfort to a ſoul that is conſcious of its real eſtimation; vanity will they write on every thing below the ſun.

Think, O Sinner! what muſt be the iſſue of your folly, if you go on in your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of vanity, neglect of God and religion; what can you you expect, what can you hope for? Can you be ſo ſtupid as to flatter yourſelf that you ſhall come off with impunity?

            <p>God, in his infinite kindneſs and pity to ruined fallen man, is uſing a variety of methods, that they might be recovered from the paths of the deſtroyer; therefore, O ſinner! it is that he ſpeaks to you in the language of terror, and threatneth you with ruin and miſery, if you continue in your ſins: he comes to you in thunder and lightning, and ſpeaks in the voice of awful majeſty, denouncing his curſes againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner, to awaken his fear, and to excite his earneſt and unwearied endeavours for pardon and reconciliation: nor does he appear in the terrors of a ſin-avenging God only, but comes dreſt in the garments of ſalvation, and proclaims himſelf reconcileable to rebel man, thro' the ſon of his love. In Jeſus Chriſt all fulneſs dwells, a fulneſs of all gifts, and of every grace, yea, even all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily: by this divine perſon it hath pleaſed the father to reconcile all things to himſelf, i. e. to the purpoſes of his glory; having made peace by the blood of his croſs,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Col. i, 19, 20, 21.</note> that they who are enemies and alienated in their minds to the bleſſed God, by wicked works, may now he reconciled to himſelf and to his church and people, and be made heirs of God and joint heirs with Jeſus Chriſt <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii, 17.</note> of an inheritance that is incorruptible and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved in the heavens. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. i, 4.</note> Chriſt, while on earth, was unwearied in preſſing this treaty of reconciliation; he uſed every argument and motive to induce and perſuade ſinful man to a compliance with the grace of the goſpel; he, as God's herald, proclaimed this treaty, and urged the ſinner's compliance. In the laſt day, that great day of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cryed, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink, &amp;c. <note n="§" place="bottom">John vii, 37, 38.</note> And when he aſcended up on high, he gave gifts to men; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, with a view that this treaty might be carried on, he gave ſome evangeliſts and teachers, for the perfecting of the ſaints for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the ſon of God, unto a perfect man, unto

Thus God is, by them, from time to time, intreating ſinners to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God. Miniſters, having a divine inveſtiture, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of the goſpel, are ambaſſadors for Chriſt; and, agreeably hereunto, the apoſtle ſaith, We are ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us: we pray you, in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God. <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. v, 20.</note> And that the great and important ends of our embaſſy may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually anſwered, we denounce the awful curſes of God's law, in the moſt terrible manner, againſt preſumptuous ſinners, and aſſure them from a divine authority, <note n="*" place="bottom">By a divine authority, is the proper and ſcriptural method of coming to our people.

            <p>Either of theſe conſiderations, ſingly and alone, one would think, were ſufficient to rouſe the moſt ſupine careleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and make him, with the trembling jailor, to cry out What ſhall I do to be ſaved! But when they are taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly, how forceable, how alarming! O let every ſinner in this aſſembly ponder them in his mind, and improve them according to their nature and importance! Your neglect will but render your caſe the more affecting and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. With what tears of compaſſion did the bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer weep over obſtinate deſpiſers of his mercy and grace? When he beheld the city, he wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things of thy peace. <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xix, 41.</note> The words are expreſſive of an ardent wiſh, Oh that thou hadſt known, thou unhappy ſinner, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, the things of thy peace! Let it now appear real to you, and as tho' you ſaw the briniſh tears flowing from the eyes, and trickling down the cheeks of the redeemer; deeply affected with your obſtinacy, and wilful refuſal of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered mercy. Is he not lamenting over you, as over Jeruſalem of old, and ſaying, Oh Plainfield! Plainfield! thou that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth the means for thy converſion and ſalvation, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten would I have gathered thy children together unto me; and yet ye would not hearken to my compaſſionate calls, but have hardned your hearts againſt my love, and repaid me with contempt hatred and perſecution!</p>

Practice every known duty. Take the word of God for your only rule and directory; ſtudy it, and make it the man of your counſel.

eſteem for the ſabbaths and worſhip of God, as theſe are noble means, in the hand of the divine ſpirit, of forming your minds to the noble ſervices of virtue and unfeigned piety. Sabbath-ſanctity has a very great and eminent influence upon us, and is of vaſt ſervice to mankind in general.—Honour the miniſters of Chriſt as his ambaſſadors, who, for the ſake of their office, are worthy of double honour; <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. v, 17.</note> let their feet, their very footſteps, be beautiful, that preach the goſpel of peace and bring you tidings of good things.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſ. lii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.</note> They are men, like yourſelves, and ſubject to numberleſs imperfections, as well as a diſſolution of the human frame; ſo that you ſee the treaſure is in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may appear to be of God, and not of us.<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv, 7.</note> Eſteem them as precious gifts of Chriſt, a legacy he hath bequeathed his church out of his tender care and concern for it: Eſteem their office too ſacred to be invaded by pride and ignorance. It muſt be a bold piece of preſumption to break open the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred incloſure, and a wickedneſs like that of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, who invaded the prieſts office,* which tho' God don't puniſh in ſo viſible a manner, yet will, no doubt, with judicial blindneſs and ſtupefaction, by giving them up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lye, that they may be damned. ¶ Deteſt ſuch a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and prevent its ſpread as much as you can. Stand faſt in the faith. Quit you like men. Be ſtrong. Never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent yourſelves without the ſtated adminiſtration of goſpel ordinances, according to divine inſtitution. Look to him who is the lord of the harveſt, that he would give you a paſtor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his heart, that may feed you with knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Believe his promiſes, rely upon his faithfulneſs, and truſt in his mercy; then ſhall neither tribulation nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs nor perſecution nor famine nor nakedneſs nor peril nor ſword nor death nor life nor angels nor any other creature ſeparate you from the Love of Chriſt. §</p>
            <p>To Conclude. — Let us all ſeriouſly think of the ſolemn change that is haſtening upon us, when we that are now in the houſe of God, uniting in our prayers and religious hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſhall be ſtretched in the duſt of death, and our ſouls

muſt enter the world of unbodied ſpirits, to appear before the judge of all the earth. It is but a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come and not tarry. May we, when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, appear with him in glory. May we enter the new Jeruſalem that is above, riding as in a triumphant chariot, be honoured by God, and the holy angels, and join the bleſſed ſociety in their ſongs of praiſe to the ſacred three in one. There ſhall crowns of unfading glory encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle our victorious brows; there ſhall palms adorn our hands, ſongs of victory and triumph ſhall dwell on our tongues; and we ſhall be free from ſighing, and tears ſhall forever be wiped from our eyes. That this may be the happy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each in this aſſembly, is the fervent wiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned deſire of him who now bids you his hearty Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel. Finally, brethren, Farewel.—Be perfect. Be of good comfort. Be of one mind. Live in peace, and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you. <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. xiii, 11.</note>
