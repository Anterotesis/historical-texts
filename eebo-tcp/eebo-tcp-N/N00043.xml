         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now the very same was the cause of his People Israel, for the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall end of the great assembly mentioned in this Chapter, it was to bring in the <hi>Ark of the Covenant</hi> into the house of the Lord: by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which Covenant the Lord was their God and they were his people; and, the cause of God was theirs, and their cause was his; the cause of God &amp; his People Israel was one and the same, and that was the cause of Religion according to the word of God. Therefore in the Text here Solomon prayes that the hearts of his People might be <hi>enclined to walk in Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wayes and to keep his Commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, it is observable, the word rendred <hi>cause</hi> here in the text is translated [<hi>right</hi>] in the Margine of the 45. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49. <hi>verses,</hi> that he <hi>maintain the right of his People,</hi> there is a right unto house and land and the like, but there is a <hi>jus divinum,</hi> a speciall divine right which the People of Israel had unto the one true Religion, and a liberty annexed unto that right that none could lawfully hinder them from enjoying all that belonged to the service of God.</p>
            <p>So that (in one word) the <hi>cause of his people Israel</hi> was right from God, and liberty from God, to keep Gods Commandements in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. This was the cause of God and Israel then, and I hope it will appear anon, that the very same is the cause of God and his people now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is meant by [the Lords maintaining this cause at all times as the matter shall require] He had made the same request twice before <hi>verse</hi> 45. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49. that he <hi>maintain his Peoples cause</hi>; here he mentions it againe the third time, that he <hi>maintain the cause of his People Israel,</hi> with an addition of this further expression, <hi>at all times as the matter shall require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had before in his large Prayer comprehended all the common cases which might fall out; but because there might be other cases which he could not foresee, or they might be otherwise circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000080_0008_0F9F8FA6518686C8"/>
would not be any help in the ey of reason in the sight of Man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commends the cause of his People Israel to the Lord himselfe, and leaves it with him, and beseecheth him, that he by his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive would maintain <hi>the cause of his people, even as the matter should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And those words in the Text [<hi>at all times</hi>] are in the Margine rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red [<hi>the thing of a day</hi> in his day] <hi>i. e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> not onely in the day of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity when things go <hi>smoothly on</hi>; but in the dayes of adversity, in the <hi>Hirracano's</hi> of tempestuous times, when it is a day <hi>of trouble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and Blasphemy,</hi> as is was in Hezekiahs time, <hi>Isai.</hi> 37.3. in a day of perplexity and treading down, <hi>Isai</hi> 22.5. in such a day as this, the cause of God and Israel is Committed to the Lord himself that he would <hi>maintain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is an Emphasis to be observed in that word [<hi>He</hi>] that He <hi>maintain it,</hi> when there is none else that will, or can, or knowes how: implying the need (the extream need) that the people of Israel might sometimes have for the Lord himselfe <hi>to maintain their cause</hi> above all that themselves, or any else should be able to doe.</p>
            <p>So that the point of Doctrine which I would commend unto the consideration of this present Assembly from hence, is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The times may be such, and the case may be such, as the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the cause of Religion, may need and require more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary help from the Lord himself.</p>
            <p>The times may be so perillous, and the case so circumstanced, and the cause of Religion so endangered, as it may be above the wisedom of Man to direct, or the hand of Man to help: then there is work for Jehovah himselfe, for him to <hi>maintain his own and his Peoples cause,</hi> you see the point: a little for the Proof.</p>
            <p>It is many times the cry of the Church of God in the World, <hi>give us help from trouble O Lord, for vaine is the help of Man, Psal.</hi> 108. <hi>last. and our help is in the Name of the Lord, who made the Heavens and the Earth, Psal.</hi> 124. <hi>last.</hi> there is creating wisedom &amp; power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with him, that is <hi>God over all, Blessed for evermore,</hi> there and from thence alone is the help of his People when its no where else to be seen upon Earth.

            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. The first reason is taken from <hi>the weakness of Men,</hi> from the inability of Gods own People, who are affected unto this cause, and engaged in it, but are not able to maintain it.</p>
            <p>The best of the Saints have flesh as well as Spirit, they have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Old Man, as well as of the New</hi>; they <hi>know but in part,</hi> and are <hi>Sanctified but in part</hi>: and hence many weaknesses in managing the cause of God.</p>
            <p>There is a mixture of Hypocrites amongst the sincere Servants of God, who pretend unto this cause as well as they; and hence many times not onely weakness but wickedness is inter-woven into the fairest pretences to the cause of God.</p>
            <p>There are various apprehensions, affections, and passions, amongst good men. <hi>Moses the Servant,</hi> and <hi>Aaron the Saint of the Lord,</hi> are sometimes unadvised: and when they are most upright, when they lead the People according to the <hi>skilfulness of their hands, and Integrity of their Heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n,</hi> overpoured by a murmuring People, and there were <hi>Men of renown and famous in the Congregation,</hi> that would not submit unto Gods order.</p>
            <p>Sometimes (<hi>alas</hi>) there is a sharp contention between <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000080_0010_0F9F8FA7F25DC0C8"/>
               <hi>Barnabas</hi>: and Godly <hi>Peter doth not ever walk with a right foot</hi>: and blessed <hi>Paul</hi> when most faithfull and true, is under evill surmises, as a <hi>deceiver.</hi> There is names and parties of men, dividing Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: some <hi>departing from the Faith,</hi> others led aside from the simplicity of the Gospel, <hi>on the right hand, and on the left,</hi> and many (in the last dayes very many) that <hi>have the form but deny the power of Godlyness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence the cause of Religion much obscured and ready to be spoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hands of those that profess to be the lovers of it. That is the first Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Taken from the <hi>Malice of the Devil, and his Instruments:</hi> Satan from the beginning hath had an old grudg against the seed of the Woman, and he never wanted instruments, who either by force or fraud or both, have done what mischief they could against the Church and cause of God.</p>
            <p>Thus in the story of <hi>Exod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> no sooner had <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> and the rest of the poor People of Israel begun to reform and set themselves abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>they made them cease by force and power,</hi> though it was but for a time as it appeares afterwards.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h until the time of the End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from hence (againe) the cause of Religion is much endang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by the haters of it. That is the Second Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. The last Reason is taken from <hi>afflicting Providence,</hi> He (the great God) <hi>changeth the times and the seasons, Dan.</hi> 2.21. the History of the Church in all ages hath informed us of this, that after a time <hi>of peace,</hi> comes a time <hi>of trouble,</hi> after a time <hi>of liberty</hi> (to be as good as men would be and as they should be) there comes a time of <hi>restraint</hi>: and sometimes even in the valley of vision <hi>there is a day of perplexitie and treading down,</hi> and <hi>that from the Lord God of Hostes,</hi> as it is in <hi>Isai.</hi> 22.5.</p>
            <p>And though it hath been questioned whether <hi>Dioclesians persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Julians Toleration</hi> were more pernicious to the Church of God, yet without question neither of these was without the Providence of God.</p>
            <p>When the People of God know not how to use their peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, when they have contracted the guilt of the Sins of such times, it is but righteous with the Lord to bring them into bondage, that they may know the service of the Lord with such a kind of Knowledg as <hi>Adam</hi> had after his fall, to know good by the want, and evil by the feeling of it, <hi>by terrible things in righteousness will thou answer us O God, who yet art the God of our Salvation and the confidence of such as are in the ends of the Earth, Psal.</hi> 65.5.</p>
            <p>But from hence also the cause of Religion comes to be in the same condition as the ship in which the disciples went when <hi>Christ</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, there came down such a <hi>storm upon the Lake,</hi> and they were so covered with the waves, and in such Jeopardy, they were faine to cry out unto him, <hi>Master save us or we peris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gather up the Reasons briefly.</p>
            <p>If the lovers of the cause of Religion be so unable to preserve it, if
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000080_0012_0F9F8FA9893EC688"/>
the haters of it be so sedulous to destroy it, and if the Lord himselfe seem to withdraw from it; then it is no wonder if the times be such; and the case be such, as the maintaining of the cause of Religion doth need and require more then ordinary help from the Lord himselfe.</p>
            <p>By this time you see the truth of the Doctrine. Now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the good of it in <hi>Application to our selves,</hi> and that but in a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uple of Uses.</p>
            <p>The one for the <hi>Information of our Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other for <hi>direction in point of Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. We may hence informe our selves, not only <hi>what the Cause of God and his people is in other parts</hi>; but <hi>what it is here with us.</hi> I say, to informe us what is the cause of God and his people in <hi>New-England.</hi> This is the first use.</p>
            <p>A mistake in this may be of dangerous consequence; the true stating of this cause, and the right understanding of it, may be of no little help unto us in the times that are come upon us.</p>
            <p>For it is more then our lives, and as much as our soules are worth, to <hi>own the cause of God,</hi> and to be <hi>faithfull to it in our generation</hi>: to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess or deny this cause, is in Scripture interpretation to confess or deny <hi>Christ himselfe,</hi> and you know what he hath said in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess before my Father which is in Heaven, but whosoever shall deny me before Men, him will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before my Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Scripture light, and what the generallity of all the People of God (not engaged unto parties) will readily subscribe unto.</p>
            <p>First then, <hi>in the general</hi> the cause of God and his people, amongst as is the <hi>Cause of Religion,</hi> I say the cause of Religion <hi>i. e. the profession and practize of the one true Religion to be in all things according to Gods Word.</hi> This was the cause of God and Israel then, the same is the cause of God and his people now. <hi>To keep and seek for all the Cammande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. To walk in his waies and to keep his Commandements which he Commanded our Fathers, as it is in the text: that every thing in</hi> Doctrine Worship and Discipline be conformed unto and regulated by the rule of the word. This is the <hi>Cause of God</hi> and his People in New-England in the Generall.</p>
            <p>But that it may be more clearly understood, let me propound it more particularly both in the <hi>Negative,</hi> what this cause is not, and in the <hi>Affirmative</hi> what it is.</p>
            <p>And first Negatively.</p>

            <p>We deny not the being of Churches, where many things are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their well-being.

They are the <hi>European</hi> Churches, in which that numerous company of 144000. are said to <hi>stand with the Lamb upon mount Sion, Rev.</hi> 14.1. and these are said to <hi>keep the Commandements of God and the faith of Jesus</hi> verse 12. It is the doctrine and worship of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches comming out of Popery, which are said to be as a <hi>Sea of glass mingled with fire, Rev</hi> 15.2. if <hi>glass,</hi> then they are not <hi>clear as Cristall,</hi> as those in the Primitive times, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4 6 and yet not as <hi>the blood of a dead man,</hi> as those under Popery <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.3. it is a <hi>Sea of glass mingled with fire,</hi> (the fire of persecution without, and of contention within) and yet they that stand upon this <hi>Sea</hi> have gotten the <hi>victory over the Beast, and have the Harpes of God in their hands and are accepted of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>The end of our comming hither was a reformation only of what was amiss or defective in the churches we came from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which we

made no separation, but a locall secession only into this wilderness, with true desires and endeavours after a more full Reformation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not a toleration of all Religions,</hi> or of the <hi>Heresies &amp; Idolatries</hi> of the age we live in. I say, not a toleration of these so farr as wee have liberty and power for to help it. How inconsistent would such a toleration be, with the love of the one true Religion revealed in the word of God? would not such a state be guilty of having <hi>other Gods,</hi> where such a toleration is? is it not the end of Civill Authority, that men may <hi>live a quiet &amp; peaceable life, in godliness as well as honesty?</hi> but not in the wayes of ungodliness, no more then in the wayes of dishonesty: in a word, the Gospel of Jesus Christ hath a <hi>right para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> all rights in the world, it hath a <hi>Divine &amp; Supream</hi> right to be received in every Nation, and the <hi>knee of Magistracie</hi> is to bow at the name of <hi>Jesus.</hi> This right carryes <hi>liberty along with it,</hi> for all such as profess the Gospel, to walk according to the <hi>Faith &amp; Order of the Gospell.</hi> That which is contrary to the Gospel hath <hi>no right,</hi> and therefore should have <hi>no liberty.</hi> But the Lawes which have been made by the Civill Government here, with respect unto Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whereby you have declared your <hi>professed subjection to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and your <hi>non-toleration</hi> of that which is <hi>contrary thereunto</hi>; this will be a name and a glory to New-England <hi>so long as the Sun and Moon endure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so much for the Negative, what the cause of God and his People amongst us is not, <hi>viz,</hi> not this Worlds good, not separation, not a toleration.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000080_0016_0F9F8FADEA4E0078"/>There was Religion in the Churches from whence we came, but New-Englands design in this vast undertaking, it was Reformation <hi>i. e. the avoyding of some special corruptions, and the Vigorous profession and practise of every thing, in Doctrine, worship and discipline, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture patterne</hi>: as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. when Moses was about to make the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> he was admonished of God, <hi>saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see that thou make it in all things according to the pattern shewed thee in the mount.</hi> And our Saviour said unto his disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>teach them to observe all whatsoever I have Commanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was and is our Cause, that Christ alone might be acknowledged by us, as the onely head, Lord, and Law-giver, in his Church, that his written word might be acknowledged as the onely Rule, that onely and all his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be observed and enjoyed by us, and that with p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ritie and libertie, with peace and power.</hi> This was the end of our coming hither, this is our Cause, hence I humbly conceive that the consent of the Synod here to the confession of Faith by the Assembly of Westminster, and the platform of Discipline published in the year 49 these for the substance of them, have carryed with them a declaration of the Faith and order of these Churches, and are so looked upon by the reformed Churches abroad, unto which may be added many other books of our divines of the same import: and the practise of these Churches so farr as we have attained.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A progress in Reformation.</hi> I conceive our cause is, not barely, a Reformation, but a progress in reformation; it was the charge of our Saviour to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A conceit of having allready attained a perfect reformation should be farr from us: a true endeavour after a full reformation in the sense of our many defects, is the duty and Spirit of sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that advance the Word of God, as the onely perfect rule, not that we have already attained or are already perfect, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as the Apostle speaks of himselfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. but we are to press forward still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this mark, that we may in all be conformable to the perfect rule of the word of God.</p>
            <p>Hence what we have attained in Doctrine, Worship &amp; Discipline, according to Gods Word, we must h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Our Fathers fled into this Wilderness from the face <hi>of a Lording Episcopacie, and humane injunctions in the Worship of God: now if any of us their Children should yeild unto, or be instrumentall to set up in this Country, any of the wayes of mens inventions, such as Prelacie, imposed Leiturgies, humane Ceremonies in the Worship of God, or to admitt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Scandalous Persons to the Lords Table, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed</hi>: it would be a backsliding to the things which we and our Fathers have departed from, and have openly testified against, to be not of God, as in the Platform of Discipline, and many other wayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Instance againe, if after such a publick witness as hath been given amongst us against a toleration of all Religions, there should be a <hi>graduall yeilding to a toleration</hi> of any false Religion, (either by Law, or against Law, for want of the Execution of Laws,) this also would be a heinous backsliding which the Lords jealousy will not bear. <hi>And for our Civil Government to put forth any act of consent unto either of the former, would be a thing to be trembled at, and Prayed against, that the Lord would keep them from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other side: it is our duty to press forward still to the mark; and to make a progress in reforming what ever is amiss or defective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, as in those the late Synod hath pointed unto, about the subjects of Baptisme, and consociation of Churches.</p>

            <p>This was Holy counsell given to <hi>Job</hi> in the midst of his plunges and distresses, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my Cause, which doth great things, and unsearchable, and mervel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things without number, who disappointeth the devices of the crafty, to set up on high those that are low, that such as mourne may be exalted unto safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Say (Brethren I beseech you) is not this that you would have, <hi>that the Cause of Religion, and those that love it, may be in safety?</hi> then here is the way, for all the servants of God, to <hi>commit this cause unto him which doth great things and unsearchable, and marveilous things without number,</hi> unto him who hath maintained, who doth maintaine, and will maintain <hi>his Own and his Peoples Cause</hi> according to the Counsel of his own will, for the Praise of his Glorious Grace.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Now if it be demanded. But how should we commit this Cause unto him, that he may be engaged in the maintaining of it, above all that we can ask or think?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer breifly in this one direction, (which will be useful to the Honoured worthies of the <hi>General Court,</hi> and yet will also reach the meanest in the Congregation) <hi>that you commit the safety
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000080_0022_0F9F8FB9183CC5E0"/>
of this cause to the Lord himselfe, in the same way as you do commit unto him the Salvation of your own soules,</hi> I say, that we do all commit this cause unto the Lord even in the same way as we do every one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto him the Salvation of our Soules. You may see the bottom of this direction in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. where the Apostle adviseth Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in evil times, to <hi>commit the keeping of their Soules unto God in weldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as unto a Faithfull Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but there are abundance here that are acquainted with this, when in the midst of Spirituall distresses you <hi>commit your Soules to the mercy of God in Christ in the promise,</hi> you do also remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the way of well-doing, the way of <hi>Gods Commandements,</hi> (the <hi>narrow way to life</hi> which our Saviour hath told us of) and in that way you do commit your Soul into the hand of Jesus Christ, Sanctifying him as your onely and alsufficient Saviour.</p>
            <p>As David in <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.3, 5, 6. <hi>unto thy hands I commit my Spirit, thou hast redeemed me O Lord God of truth, for thou art my rock and my fortress, for thy name sake lead me and guide me in thy way, for I hate lying Vanities, but I trust in the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is our case, his Majesty the King whom the Lord hath set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne is the Supream Civill Governour under God, and over us; and the Government setled here by the Charter of this Colonie is a subordinate Government, we are to remember our duty to both, and that <hi>for the Lords sake,</hi> for so is the will of God, that <hi>with well doing you put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,</hi> as the Apostle there speaks <hi>verse</hi> 15.</p>

            <p>My Fathers &amp; Brethren, this is for our Admonition, and this will be for the Honour of Religion, when such as have the managing of Publick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then men,</hi> if it come to a stress, but in managing publick affairs in such times as Daniel lived in the matter did so require for him to be so carefull, as that no errour nor fault might be found in him. This is for our imitation.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghost informes us, <hi>it is the Wisdom of the prudent to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his way, Prov.</hi> 14.8. <hi>And a wise mans heart discerneth of time and Judgment</hi>: and in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Be not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</hi>

            <p>First peaceable from Schisme in the Church, and sedition in the Common-Wealth, or whatsoever tends unto faction, <hi>studying to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and every one to do their own work,</hi> and then faithfull to the cause of Religion according to our duty to God: faithfull to the King accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and faithfull to the Government here according to the Oath of fidelity.</p>
            <p>And be you all exhorted in the words of the Holy Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. <hi>follow after the things which make for peace,</hi> and beware of such things as may endanger it amongst your selves, <hi>let none say that these or those are disaffected to the Cause of God and his People, because they see not in some things as others do,</hi> do not impropriate the cause of Religion to

some in opposition to others, who profess the same cause, none should speak of themselves as if they were the Godly party and eminently Saints and faithful, with despising others, nothing is more offensive amongst Christians, then to confine Religion to some singular Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And the Apostle saw it needfull to admonish the best Christians, <hi>let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, or in a way of provoking one another, avoyding jealousies and uncharitable censures, being watchfull that Satan get no advantage,</hi> this also is for our Admonition, and I hope that the votes of this day will make it appear you have a due respect unto your ancient Magistrates that have born the burden and heat of the day, and that you have no undue prejudice against any that have been and may be still instruments of publick good.

            <p>When the matter requires more then ordinary help from the Lord himselfe, and yet the Lord seems to withdraw and to be asleep, then the Servants of God must awaken him by their Importunate Prayers, as the disciples in the storm did awaken our Saviour, saying, <hi>Lord save us or we Perish.</hi>
