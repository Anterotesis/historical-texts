         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the Year <hi>1741,</hi> there was Printed and Published by <hi>P. T.</hi> in <hi>Charles-Town</hi> in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> for the Authors <hi>P. T—r,</hi> M. D. <hi>H. A—n,</hi> M. A. <hi>D. D—s,</hi> and Others, Land-holders in <hi>Georgia,</hi> (at that Time in <hi>Charles-Town</hi>) a Pamphlet entituled, <hi>A True and Historical Narrative of the Colony of</hi> Georgia <hi>in</hi> America, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dedicated to his Excellency <hi>James Oglethorpe,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> General and Commander in Chief of his Majesty's Forces in <hi>South-Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> &amp;c. The Dedication seems a very just Introduction to such a Narrative, and both the one and the other, the real Offspring of such factious and turbulent Authors, being a mean low witted Sneer, a malicious ill-natured In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective, against that honourable Gentleman, wherein the Authors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to Good Manners or Common Civility, treat his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency (as it were to his Face) with such Rudeness as ill becomes any Person to use even to an Inferior: However, I cannot say but, a very fit Prelude to such an inconsistent, spiteful, false Narrative, as is subjoined to the Dedication; a Narrative founded in Lies and Misrepresentations, projected and published by a few Persons of no Estate, and as little Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, Persons sour'd in their Tempers, because not humour'd in their endeavours of subverting, or at least altering, the Constitution of a new settled Colony, even in it's Infancy, and before any great Experiment was made of Advancing and Improving it; Persons, who were under a necessity of Banishing themselves from a Colony, where, for their sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and rebellious Practices, and turbulent restless Spirits, they were every Day in danger of being call'd to Account, as stirrers up of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and as Incendiaries against the Peace of the Government; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who had shared deeply in his Excellency's Favours, and therefore guilty of the most monstrous Sin in nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Ingratitude; for <hi>Si in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratum dixeris, Omnia.</hi> In short, they are Persons to whom do most justly belong the Character given by the Right Honourable Sir <hi>William Young,</hi> in a Debate concerning the Printer of a seditious Paper,
<q>that they are Men whose daily Employment has been, for some Time, to
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004961_0004_0F5F3CBEA6A7BC98"/>
misrepresent the Publick Measures, to disperse Scandal, and excite Rebellion; who have industriously propagated every Murmur of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and preserved every Whisper of Malevolence from perishing in the Birth.</q>
               <bibl>Gent. Mag. Supplement <hi>to</hi> 1741, <hi>pag.</hi> 682. B.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>These are the mighty Authors and Publishers of the Scurrilous Narrative! the Design of which seems to be pointed chiefly towards obstructing the Peopling, and further Settling, the Colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and sullying the Character and Administration of a Gentleman, who may (without Flattery or Falshood) be justly termed the <hi>Romulus,</hi> Father, and Founder of <hi>Georgia;</hi> a Gentleman who, without any Views but that of enlarging its Majesty's Dominions, propagating the Protestant Religion, promoting the Trade of his Country, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the Wants and Necessities of indigent Christians, has volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily banished himself from the Pleasures of a Court, and exposed himself to the repeated Dangers of the vast <hi>Atlantic</hi> Ocean, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perillous and tedious Voyages; instead of allowing himself the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which a plentiful Fortune, powerful Friends, and great Merit, entitle him to in <hi>England,</hi> he has inured himself to the greatest Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, that any the meanest Inhabitant of this new Colony could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to; his Diet has been mouldy Bread, or boiled Rice instead of Bread, Salt Beef, Pork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Drink has been Water, his Bed the damp Earth, without any other Covering than the Canopy of Heaven to shelter him; and all this to set an Example to this new Colony, how they might bear with such Hardships in their new Settlements.</p>
            <p>His Conduct in War, falls nothing short of his Prudence in private Life, and Policy in Publick Stations, however the same might have been misrepresented to the World, with respect to the Miscarriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>St. Augustine,</hi> the true Causes of which are justly to be laid at the Door of Two Sorts of Men, concerned in that Expedition; first, those under a Command different from the General, upon whose Assistance the Success of that Expedition chiefly depended, but who entirely left him when their Assistance was most wanted. The Second Sort were those Out-Guards, who were to give the Alarm to the Main-Guard, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> advanced; but who, instead of firing their Pieces, and giving the Alarm, flung down their Arms and ran away; by which Means, the Slaughter of the Men at <hi>Musa</hi> happened: And yet, Ill-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will lay the Blame of all to his Excellency, when indeed the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage was occasioned by either Neglect of, or Disobedience to, the Military Orders that his Excellency had given; or by not being support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those under a different Command, on whom he chiefly depended for the Success of that Attack; but (to his Excellency's great Surprize) instead of sending their Boats and Men ashore, according to a Result of a Council of War, held on board one of his Majesty's Ships, to assist in order to destroy the Six Gallies, wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi> greatest Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard

lay, and which continually fired from under the Walls over the River, on the Land Forces, hoisted their Sails and went away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving the least Notice of their Departure, by which Means the Garrison was relieved with Provisions through the <hi>Metanges,</hi> a small Inlet about Four Leagues to the Southward of the Bar, which might have been prevented, had those of a different Command done their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus I leave any impartial Man, to judge the Consequence of their Departure at so critical a Iuncture, and the fatal Event it produced to his Majesty's Land Forces. However, his Excellency's Conduct has been approved of at Home, and will soon appear in such a Light, that his Enemies will be ashamed of their impudent Lies, and perhaps pay for their own Folly; and how far the Ill-Nature, and impotent Malice, of the Authors of the Narrative, have carried them beyond the Bounds of Truth or good Manners, will appear in the following Sheets, which give a true and authentic Account of the Progress of that Colony, from it's first Establishment, to the Year <hi>1741,</hi> which being published by the Order of the Honourable the Trustees, and printed in <hi>London Anno 1741,</hi> is now Re-printed here, with no other View, than to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the Prejudices which may be raised in the Minds of People, by that Scandalous Narrative, and so may be a Means of delivering that New Settlement, from the il Effect of such Misrepresentations as are handed about by that label, to deter his Majesty's Subjects from set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in that Frontier Colony, so necessary for advancing and protecting the Trade of this, and our Mother Country, on the Southermost Part of <hi>North America,</hi> and extending our Colonies both on the Gulf of <hi>Florida</hi>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT, Shewing the Progress of the Colony of GEORGIA IN AMERICA, From it's First ESTABLISHMENT.</head>
            <p>HIS Majesty King GEORGE the Second, by his Letters Patent bearing date the 9<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>Iune,</hi> One thousand seven hundred and thirty two, reciting amongst many other things, that many of his poor Subjects were through Misfortunes and want of Employment reduced to great Necessities, and would be glad to be Settled in any of his Majesty's Provinces of <hi>America,</hi> where by Cultivating the Lands Wast and Desolate, they might not only gain a comfortable Subsistence, but also, strengthen his Majesty's Colonies, and increase the Trade, Navigation and Wealth of his Majesty's Realms, and that the Provinces in North <hi>America</hi> had been frequently Ravaged by Indian Enemies, more especially that of <hi>South Carolina,</hi> whose Southern Frontier continued unsettled and lay open to the Neighbouring Savages; and that to relieve the Wants of the said Poor People, and to protect his Majesty's Subjects in <hi>South Carolina,</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Colony of the said Poor People should be Settled and Established in the Southern Frontiers of <hi>Carolina,</hi> did for the Considerations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, Constitute a Corporation by the Name of, the Trustees for Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the Colony of <hi>Georgia</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> with Capacity to purchase

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004961_0009_0F5F3CC2536E7108"/>
otherwise that the same should be void: And directed, that all Rents, Issues or Profits which should come to the said Corporation, issuing or arising out of, or from the said Province, should be laid out and applied in such manner as would most improve and enlarge the said Colony, and best Answer the good Purposes therein mentioned, and for defraying all other Charges about the same; and directed the said Corporation from time to time to give in to one of the Secretaries of State, and to the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, Accounts of the Progress of the said Colony: And directed that the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council should from time to time for the said Term of twenty one Years from the Date of the said Letters Patent, have Power to appoint all such Governours, Judges, Magistrates, Ministers, and Officers, Civil and Military, both by Sea and Land, within the said District, as they should think fit and needful for the Government of the said Colony (except such Officers as should be appointed for Managing, Collecting, and Receiving such of his Majesty's Revenues as should arise within the said Province) with a Proviso, that every Governour so Appointed, should be Approved by his Majesty, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify himself as other Governours in <hi>America</hi> are by Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to do, and give Security for Observing the Acts of Parliament relating to Trade and Navigation, and Obeying all Instructions from his Majesty, or any Acting under his Authority, pursuant to the said Acts: And Granted, that the said Corporation for the said Term of twenty one Years, from the Date of the said Letters Patent, should have Power, by any Commander or other Officer for that Purpose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to Train, Instruct, Exercise, and Govern, a Militia for the special Defence and Safety of the said Colony, to Assemble in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Array, and put in Warlike Posture, the Inhabitants of the said Colony, and in Time of actual War, Invasion, or Rebellion, to use and exercise the Law Martial, and also to erect Forts and Fortify any Place or Places within the said Colony, and the same to furnish with all necessary Ammunition, Provision and Stores of War for Offence and Defence, and from time to time to commit the Custody and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to such Person or Persons as to them should seem meet, Declaring that the Governour or Commander in Chief of <hi>South Carolina</hi> should have the Chief Command of the Militia of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and that they should observe his Orders: And Granted that the said Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration should have Power to Import or Export their Goods, at or from any Port or Ports that should be appointed by his Majesty within the said Province for that purpose, without being obliged to touch at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Port in <hi>Carolina</hi>: And Declared, that after the End of the said twenty one Years, such Form of Government, and method of making Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances for the Government of the said Province, and it's Inhabitants, should be Observed and Established within the same, as his Majesty his Heirs and Successors should Ordain and Appoint, and should be agreable to Law; and that after the End of the said twenty one Years, the Governour, and all Officers Civil and Military, within
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004961_0010_0F5F3CC373A83E40"/>
the said Province, should be Appointed by his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors.</p>
            <p>In Pursuance of his Majesty's Charter, and in order to fulfil the good Intents and Purposes therein expressed, it was thought necessary for the Trustees to send over such poor People and foreign Protestants as were willing to Live in <hi>Georgia,</hi> not only to cultivate the Lands, but at the same Time to strengthen his Majesty's Colonies. For which purpose they considered each Inhabitant both as a Planter and a Soldier; and they were therefore to be Provided with Arms for their Defence, as well as Tools for their Cultivation, and to be Taught the Exercise of both, and Towns were to be laid out for their Settlements, and Lands allotted to each of them for their Maintenance as near to those Towns as conveniently could be, that they might never have Occasion to be too far distant from their Towns, which were to be regarded as their Garrisons.</p>
            <p>And as the Military Strength of the Province was particulary to be taken care of, it seemed necessary to Establish such Tenures of Lands as might most effectually preserve the Number of Planters, or Soldiers, equal to the Number of Lots of Lands, and therefore each Lot of Land was to be considered as a Military Fief, and to contain so much in Quantity as would Support such Planter and his Family; and Fifty Acres were judged sufficient and not too much for that Purpose, and Provision was made to prevent an Accumulation of several Lots into one Hand, lest the Garrison should be lessened, and likewise to prevent a Division of those Lots into smaller Parcels, lest that which was no more than Sufficient for one Planter, when entire, should if divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst several, be too scanty for their Subsistence.</p>
            <p>And in the Infancy of the Colony, the Lands were Granted in Tail Male, preferable to any other Tenure, as the most likely to answer these Purposes; for if the Grants were to be made in Tail General, it was thought that the Strength of each Township would soon be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, in as much as every Female Heir in Tail, who was unmarried, would have been intitled to one Lot, and consequently have taken from the Garrison the Portion of one Soldier; and by Intermarriages several Lots might have been united into one; and if such Tenant in Tail General had had several Daughters, his Lot must have been Divided equally amongst them all as Co-partners.</p>
            <p>Nor were these the only inconveniencies which were thought likely to arise from Estates in Tail General: For Women being equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to Act as Soldiers or serve on Juries, these Duties, and many others, such as Watchings and Wardings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would return so much oftener to each Man, in proportion as the Number of the Men in the Township was lessened, and by that means become very burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004961_0011_0F5F3CC410315708"/>
to the Remaining Male Lot holders, and in case of any Attack from the <hi>Indians, French</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Township would be less able to make a Defence.</p>
            <p>And as it was not thought proper to Grant Estates in Tail General, it appeared to be more inconvenient to Grant them in Fee Simple; which Estate would have been attended with all the Objections before mentioned incident to Estates in Tail General, and to several other besides; for the Right of Alienation being inseparable from an Estate in Fee, the Grantee might have Sold, Mortgaged, or Aliened his Lands to whomever he thought fit, which was a Power not to be intrusted with the People sent over, for the following Reasons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. From Considering their Condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From Considering the Purposes they were sent for.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From Considering the Persons to whom Lands might be Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. From Considering that it might Occasion a Monopoly of Land contrary to the Intent of the Charter.</p>
            <p>As to the First, The Persons sent over were poor indigent People, who had for the most part so indiscreetly managed what they had been Masters of here, that it did not seem safe to trust so absolute a Property in their Hands, at least in the Infancy of the Colony, and before they had by a careful and industrious Behaviour given some Reason to believe they would prove better Managers for the future.</p>
            <p>As to the Second, They were sent over to inhabit, cultivate, and secure, by a personal Residence, the Lands Granted to them within the Province, and they voluntarily engaged so to do; And in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that they would perform those Engagements, they were Maintained at the Expence of the Publick during their Voyage, and their Passage was paid for them, and they were provided with Tools, Arms, Seeds, and other Necessaries, and Supported from the Publick Store, many of them at least for four Years together from their first Landing, in which respect the Publick may be said to have Purchased those People for a valuable Consideration, their Personal Residence, and all the Industry and Labour they could bestow in the Cultivation of this Province, and to have given them even Pay for the Hazard they might run in the Defence of it.</p>
            <p>As to the Third, It was thought unsafe to Grant them such an Estate as might be the Means of introducing such sort of People as might Defeat what the Trustees had always at Heart, <hi>viz.</hi> The Preservation of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004961_0012_0F5F3CC536F4E4B8"/>
the Protestant Religion in that Province, which was necessary to be taken Care of, both on a Political and Religious Account; the <hi>French</hi> lying to the West and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the South of the Province of <hi>Georgia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Fourth, A Monopoly of several Lots into one Hand would necessarily have been the consequence of a Free Liberty of Buying and Selling Lands within the Province, which would have been directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Intent of the Charter, whereby the Grant of Lands to any one Person is limited not to exceed five hundred Acres.</p>
            <p>A further inconvenience seemed likely to arise in every Case where the Tenant in Fee died without any Children, or without having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of his Lot by Will; for the Heir General who might have the Right to it might not happen to be found out for many Years after, especially if it was one of the Foreign Protestants, and all that Time the House would have run to decay, and the Land remain uncultivated and become a harbour for Vermin, to the great annoyance and damage of the Neighbouring Lots.</p>
            <p>But though the before-mentioned restraints were intended for the good of the whole, yet whenever particular Cases required it they were taken off and dispensed with: And upon any application for leave to alienate Lands, Licences were always granted for that purpose; and when the succession of Females became less dangerous to the Province, by the growing strength and increase of the Poople, and by the Security provided for it by his Majesty's Forces there, the Trustees resolved to enlarge the Tenures of the Lands to Estates in Tail General.</p>
            <p>The Tenures being thus settled, it was thought necessary to require the Inhabitants to cultivate their Lands within a limited Time, and in order to raise Raw Silk, which was intended to be one of the Produces there, a certain proportion of white Mulberry-Trees were to be Planted, and in their respective Grants Ten Years were allowed for the Cultivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and one hundred white Mulberry-Trees were to be planted on every ten Acres of Land when Cleared; with a Power for the Trustees to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter on the Parts that should remain uncultivated.</p>
            <p>But as the People were not able to Cultivate their Lands within the Time required by their Grants, by reason of the Alarms from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Droughts in that part of <hi>America,</hi> and other unforeseen Accidents, the Trustees resolved to release all forfeitures on that Account, and to require the Cultivation of no more than five Acres of the said fifty Acres within the Remainder of the said Term of Ten Years.</p>
            <p>And as other Persons applied to the Trustees for Grants of Land, in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004961_0013_0F5F3CC5503E37E8"/>
order to go over and settle there at their own Expence, particular Grants were made under the same Tenure and on the following Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should within twelve Months from the Date of their Grants, go to and arrive in <hi>Georgia,</hi> with one Man Servant for every fifty Acres Granted them, and should with such Servants abide, settle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit and continue there for three Years. That they should within ten Years Clear and Cultivate one fifth part of the Land granted them, and within the next ten Years Clear and Cultivate three fifth parts more of the said Lands, and plant one thousand white Mulberry-Trees upon every one hundred Acres thereof when Cleared. And that they should not at any time hire, keep, lodge, board or employ any Negroes within <hi>Georgia</hi> on any Account whatsoever without special Leave. Which Conditions were readily approved of, and Counterparts executed by them all; and to those who desired to name their Successor on failure of Issue Male, special Covenants were entered into by the Trustees for that Purpose, agreable to their own Propositions. And for an Encouragement for their Men Servants to behave well, like Covenants were entered into, to Grant to every such Man Servant, when requested thereunto by any Writing under the Hand and Seal of the Master, Twenty Acres of Land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Tenure.</p>
            <p>The Trustees were induced to prohibit the use of Negroes within <hi>Georgia,</hi> the Intention of his Majesty's Charter being to provide for poor People incapable of subsisting themselves at Home, and to settle a Frontier to <hi>South Carolina,</hi> which was much exposed by the small number of its White Inhabitants. It was impossible that the Poor who should be sent from hence, and the Foreign Prosecuted Protestants, who must go in a manner Naked into the Colony, could be able to purchase or subsist them if they had them, and it would be a Charge too great for the Trustees to undertake; and they would be thereby disabled from sending White People. The first Cost of a Negro is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Thirty Pounds,</hi> and this <hi>Thirty Pounds</hi> would pay the Passage over, provide Tools and other Necessaries, and defray the Charge of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of a White Man for a Year, in which time it might be hoped that the Planter's own Labour would grant him some subsistence, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Purchase Money of every Negro (abstracting the Expence of subsisting him as well as his Master) by being applied that way, would prevent the sending over a White Man who would be a Security to the Province, whereas the Negro would render that Security Precarious.</p>
            <p>It was thought the White Man, by having a Negro Slave, would be less disposed to Labour himself; and that his whole Time must be employed in keeping the Negro to Work, and in watching against any Danger he or his Family might apprehend from the Slave, and that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004961_0014_0F5F3CC60C304510"/>
the Planter's Wife and Children would by the Death or even the Absence of the Planter, be at the Mercy of the Negro.</p>
            <p>It was also apprehended, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>St. Augustine</hi> would be continually enticing away the Negroes, or encouraging them to Insurrections. That the first might easily be accomplished since a single Negro would run away thither without Companions, and would only have a River or two to Swim over, and this Opinion has been confirmed and justified by the Practices of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> even in Times of profound Peace amongst the Negroes in <hi>South Carolina,</hi> where, though at a greater Distance from <hi>St. Augustine,</hi> some have fled in Periaguas and little Boats to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and been Protected, and others in large Bodies have been incited to Insurrections, to the great Terror and even endangering the Loss of that Province, which though it has been established above seventy Years, has scarce White People enough to secure her against her own Slaves.</p>
            <p>It was also considered that the Produces designed to be raised in the Colony, would not require such Labour as to make Negroes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for Carrying them on; for the Province of <hi>Carolina</hi> produces chiefly Rice, which is a Work of Hardship proper for Negroes, whereas the Silk and other Produces which the Trustees proposed to have the People employed on in <hi>Georgia,</hi> were such as Women and Children might be of as much use in as Negroes.</p>
            <p>It was likewise apprehended, that if the Persons who should go over to <hi>Georgia</hi> at their own Expence, should be permitted the use of Negroes, it would dispirit and ruin the Poor Planters who could not get them, and who by their Numbers were designed to be the strength of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; it would make them Clamorous to have Negroes given them, and on the Refusal would drive them from the Province, or at least make them negligent of their Plantations, where they would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, nay would certainly disdain, to work like Negroes; and would rather let themselves out to wealthy Planters as Overseers of their Negroes.</p>
            <p>It was further thought, that upon the Admission of Negroes, the wealthy Planters would, as in all other Colonies, be more induced to absent themselves and live in other Places, leaving the Care of their Plantations and Negroes to Overseers.</p>
            <p>It was likewise thought, that the Poor Planter sent on Charity, from his desire to have Negroes, as well as the Planter who should settle at his own Expence, would (if he had leave to alienate) Mortgage his Land to the Negro Merchant for them, or at least become a Debtor for the Purchase of such Negroes; and under these Weights and Discouragements would be induced to sell his Slaves again upon any necessity, and would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004961_0015_0F5F3CC88EFB8E58"/>
leave the Province and his Lot to the Negro Merchant: In Consequence of which all the small Properties would be swallowed up, as they have been in other Places, by the more wealthy Planters.</p>
            <p>It was likewise Considered, that the admitting of Negroes in <hi>Georgia</hi> would naturally facilitate the Desertion of the <hi>Carolina</hi> Negroes through the Province of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and Consequently this Colony instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Frontier and adding strength to the Province of <hi>South Carolina,</hi> would be a Means of drawing off the Slaves of <hi>Carolina,</hi> and adding thereby a strength to <hi>Augustine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From these several Considerations, as the Produces to be raised in the Colony did not make Negro Slaves necessary, as the Introduction of them so near to a Garrison of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would weaken rather than strengthen the Barrier, and as they would introduce with them a greater Propensity to Idleness among the Poor Planters, and too great an Inequality among the People, it was thought proper to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of them a Fundamental of the Constitution.</p>
            <p>When the Trustees had made these Dispositions, and were enabled by Benefactions from several private Persons, on the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1732, It was resolved, to send over One hundred and fourteen Persons Men Women and Children, being such as were in decayed Circumstances, and thereby disabled from following any Business in <hi>England,</hi> and who if in Debt had leave from their Creditors to go, and such as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Minister, Church-Wardens and Overseers of their respective Parishes. And <hi>Iames Oglethorpe,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of the Trustees, went with them at his own Expence, to settle them.</p>
            <p>On the 24<hi>th</hi> of the same Month the People were all Examined whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of them had any Objections to the Terms and Conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to them, which they all declared they had not, but that they were fully satisfied with them, and executed Articles under their Hands and Seals, Testifying their Consents thereto, which are now in the Publick Office belonging to the Trustees.</p>
            <p>But four of them desiring that their Daughters might inherit as well as Sons, and that the Widows Dower might be considered, the Trustees immediately Resolved, that every Person who should desire the same, should have the Privilege of naming a Successor to the Lands granted to them, who in Case the Possessor should die without Issue Male, should hold the same to them and their Heirs Male for ever; and that the Widows should have their Thirds as in <hi>England,</hi> with which Resolutions the People being all acquainted, were very well satisfied.</p>
            <p>The Trustees prepared Forms of Government, agreable to the Powers given them by their Charter; they Established under their Seal a Court
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004961_0016_0F5F3CC93342B228"/>
of Judicature for Trying Causes as well Criminal as Civil in the Town of <hi>Savannah,</hi> (the Name which was given to the first Town to be raised) by the Name and Stile of <hi>The Town Court</hi>; They also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Magistrates there, <hi>viz.</hi> Three Bailiffs and a Recorder; and inferior Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Two Constables and two Tything Men: They Chose for Magistrates such as appeared to them the most Prudent and Discreet, but amongst a Number of People who were all upon a Level at their first setting out, it was impossible to make any Choice or Distinction which would not create some future uneasinesses among them.</p>
            <p>On the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1732, when the One Hundred and Fourteen Persons, and with them the Reverend Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and a Man from <hi>Piedmont</hi> (engaged by the Trustees to instruct the People in the Art of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Silk) Embarkt on Board the Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> Capt. <hi>Thomas</hi>; several of the Trustees went to <hi>Gravesend,</hi> called over the People, and made a strict Enquiry into their Accommodations and Provisions, and left the People very well satisfied. Soon after Fifteen more Persons were sent, Eleven of whom were Sawyers, in order to Assist the People in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Houses.</p>
            <p>At the time of the Embarkation five thousand Acres of Land were Granted to Three of the Colonists, in trust for them or the survivors of them, to make Grants from time to time to every Man of twenty one Years of Age or upwards, (who should arrive in <hi>Georgia,</hi> and desire the same) fifty Acres of Land to hold to him and his Heirs Male.</p>
            <p>The Common Council of the Trustees (in whom by the Charter the disposal of Money was lodged) did resolve at their first meeting, that the Bank of <hi>England</hi> should be desired to keep the Money belonging to the Trust, which the Bank accepted, and have continued so to do, paying no Sums but by Draughts signed by five of the Common Council.</p>
            <p>The Trustees desired by a Letter, Sir <hi>Thomas Lombe's</hi> sentiments of the Goodness of the Raw Silk produced in <hi>Carolina,</hi> and the proper methods of carrying on that Undertaking with Success, on which they received <note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1.</note> from Sir <hi>Thomas Lombe</hi> great Encouragement to proceed in it, by his Approbation of the Silk produced in that Climate, of which he had made Experiments.</p>
            <p>On the 28<hi>th February</hi> 1732, the Trustees received a Letter from Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> dated the 13<hi>th Ianuary</hi> 1732, on Board the Ship
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004961_0017_0F5F3CC9E69B9738"/>
               <hi>Anne,</hi> of <hi>Charles-Town</hi> in <hi>South Carolina,</hi> giving an Account of his safe Arrival there with the People, with the Loss only of two Children.</p>
            <p>On the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1733, they received another Letter from him, which is here inserted at length, as it gives an Account of the situation where he Planted the People.</p>

                  <p>I Gave you an Account in my last, of our Arrival at <hi>Charles-Town;</hi> The Governor and Assembly have given us all possible Encouragement. Our People arrived at <hi>Beaufort</hi> on the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> where I lodged them in some new Barracks built for the Soldiers, whilst I went my self to view the <hi>Savannah-River.</hi> I fixed upon a Healthy Situation about ten Miles from the Sea; the River here forms an half Moon, along the South side of which the Banks are about forty feet high, and on the Top a Flat, which they call a Bluff; the plain High Ground extends into the Country about five or six Miles, and along the River side about a Mile. Ships that draw twelve feet Water can ride with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten Yards of the Bank. Upon the River side in the Centre of this Plain, I have laid out the Town, opposite to which is an Island of very Rich Pasturage, which I think should be kept for the Trustees Cattle; the River is pretty Wide, the Water fresh, and from the Key of the Town you see it's whole Course to the Sea, with the Island of <hi>Tybee,</hi> which forms the Mouth of the River, for about six Miles up into the Country. The Landskip is very agreable, the stream being Wide and bordered with high Woods on both sides. The whole People arrived here on the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>Febuary;</hi> at Night their Tents were got up. Till the <hi>10th</hi> we were taken up in unloading, and making a Crane, which I then could not get finished, so took off the Hands and set some to the Fortification and began to fell the Woods. I have markt out the Town and Common, half of the former is already cleared, and the first House was begun Yesterday in the afternoon. A little <hi>Indian</hi> Nation, the only one within fifty Miles, is not only in Amity, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to be Subjects to his Majesty King <hi>George,</hi> to have Lands given them among us, and to breed their Children at our Schools; their Chief, and his beloved Man, who is the Second Man in the Nation, desire to be instructed in the Christian Religion.</p>

            <p>In this Month of <hi>April,</hi> the Trustees in another Embarkation of seventeen Persons, sent some <hi>Italians</hi> whom they had procured from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in order to promote the Silk Business.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004961_0018_0F5F3CCA98116080"/>They received another Letter from Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> dated the 20<hi>th February</hi> 1732, of which the following Extract gives a further Account of the People and their Situation.</p>
            <q>OUR People are all in perfect Health; I chose the Situation for the Town upon an high Ground, forty Feet perpendicular above High Water mark; the Soil dry and sandy, the Water of the River fresh, Springs coming out from the sides of the Hill. I pitched upon this Place not only for the Pleasantness of the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but because from the above-mentioned and other signs, I thought it Healthy; for it is sheltred from the Western and Southern Winds (the worst in this Country) by vast Woods of Pine-Trees many of which are an Hundred and few under Seventy Feet high. There is no Morse on the Trees, tho' in most parts of <hi>Carolina</hi> they are covered with it, and it hangs down two or three feet from them. The last and fullest conviction of the Healthfulness of the Place, was, that an <hi>Indian</hi> Nation who knew the Nature of this Country chose it for their Situation.</q>
            <p>The Trustees endeavoured very early to secure the Friendship of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who by Ranging thro' the Woods, would be capable of giving constant Intelligence to prevent any Surprize upon the People, and would be a good out Guard for the inland Parts of the Province. For this Purpose they were treated with all possible Candour and Gentleness: They were acquainted, that the <hi>English</hi> had no Intention to Hurt or Distress them, but would be ready to Assist and Protect them on all Occasions. They received several Presents from the Trustees, and were promised, that if any of the People of <hi>Georgia</hi> injured them, they should upon their Complaints and proof of it find a ready Redress. For which, in return, the <hi>Indians</hi> engaged never to take any Revenge themselves, as it might breed ill Blood between the <hi>English</hi> and them. And as they have since found, that Justice has been always done to them upon proper Complaints, they have been true to their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> made a formal and voluntary Cession of that part of the Country to Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> for the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by which a further Right and Title to it was acquired and added to that of the first Discovery and Cultivation; and a Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with them was settled, which was soon after sent over to the Trustees for their Ratification.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1733, the Trustees sent over six Persons more.</p>
            <p>The Number of People sent on the Charity from the beginning to the 9<hi>th Iune</hi> 1733, (on which day of the Month the Trustees Accompt is

Yearly made up, which is directed to be delivered to the Lord Chancellor and the other Persons named in the Charter) amounted to One hundred and fifty two, of whom One hundred and forty one were <hi>Britons,</hi> and Eleven were foreign Protestants, and sixty one were Men.</p>
            <p>The Lands granted in Trust this Year in order to be granted out in smaller Portions in <hi>Georgia,</hi> were the aforesaid five thousand Acres.</p>
            <p>The Lands granted within this Year to Persons going at their own Expence, were four thousand four hundred and sixty Acres.</p>
            <p>The Money received from Private Persons this Year amounted to 3723 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 7 <hi>d.</hi> whereof the Trustees applied 2254 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> of which they exhibited an Account to the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, pursuant to their Charter, and carried the Remainder into their succeeding Accompt.</p>

               <p>BEsides the several Works on which the People were employed at <hi>Savannah,</hi> as Pallisading the Town, Clearing the Place from Pine Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Building of Houses, some other Works were carried on, <hi>viz.</hi> a Publick Garden was laid out, which was designed as a Nursery, in order to supply the People for their several Plantations with white Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry Trees, Vines, Oranges, Olives, and other necessary Plants. A Gardiner was appointed for the Care of it, and to be Paid by the Trustees. A Crane was made for Landing of Goods upon the Bluff; a Battery raised which Commands the River some distance below the Town, and on the Island of <hi>Tybee</hi> at the Entrance of the River a Beacon was Erected Ninety Feet high, which has been of great Service not only to the Ships entering the River <hi>Savannah,</hi> but to those likewise which Sail by the Coast, there being none like it all along the Coast of <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Fort was likewise Built at the narrow passages of an inland River (called <hi>Ogeechee</hi>) in order to Protect the Settlement from any inland In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion from <hi>Augustine.</hi> Two little Villages were laid out and settled at about Four Miles distant from <hi>Savannah,</hi> inland from the River, and a Mile from each other, which were called <hi>Hampstead</hi> and <hi>Highgate.</hi>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2.</note> dated the 22d <hi>March</hi> 1732, a further Account was given of the Settlement at <hi>Savannah,</hi> which was Written by a Gentleman of <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> who with some others went thither out of Curiosity.</p>
               <p>The Parliament having Granted out of Money arisen from the Sale of the Lands at <hi>St. Christopher, Ten Thousand Pounds</hi> for the further Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling and Securing the Colony, the Trustees resolved to lose no Time in Strengthening it with People, and accordingly in the Months of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> and <hi>October</hi> 1733, they sent over two Embarkations of Persons, whose Numbers are entered at the End of this Years Proceedings, and of whom many were Persecuted Protestants from <hi>Saltzburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As very pleasing Accounts of the Country and Settlement were sent from several of the People there to their Friends, the Trustees were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that some Persons had gone about in several Parts of <hi>England</hi> offering Money and Land in their Names (but without their Knowlege or Authority) to any who should be desirous of going to <hi>Georgia:</hi> Therefore they Published an Advertisement in some of the News Papers,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004961_0021_0F5F3CCCCE5A7FE0"/>
in order to prevent the ill Consequences of drawing Laborious People out of the Country with such Expectations, and they declared that they had never given such Power to any Persons whatsoever, and that they never used any Sollicitations to induce People to go over.</p>

               <head>From the 9th <hi>Iune</hi> 1734, to the 9th <hi>Iune</hi> 1735.</head>
               <p>IN the Month of <hi>Iune</hi> 1734, Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> arrived from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and with him came some of the principal <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Lower Creek Nation</hi> who live nearest to <hi>Savannah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When these <hi>Indians</hi> were in <hi>England,</hi> they desired of the Trustees that the Measures, Prices and Qualities of all Goods to be Purchased by them with their Deer-skins, might be settled, as likewise the Weights; that nobody might be allowed to Trade with the Indians in <hi>Georgia</hi> without a Licence from the Trustees, in order that if they were in any respect Injured or Defrauded by the Traders, they might know where to Complain; and they further desired there might be but one Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house in each Indian Town for supplying them with the Goods they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004961_0022_0F5F3CCE05C8E948"/>
might want to Purchase, from whence the Trader should be obliged to supply them at the first Prices.</p>
               <p>The Reason which the Indians gave for this Application, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Traders with them had often in an Arbitrary Manner raised the Prices of Goods, and defrauded them in the Weights and Measures, and by their Impositions had often created Animosities between the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish and Indians, which had frequently ended in Wars between them prejudicial to both.</p>
               <p>The Trustees having considered of their Request, and being informed that the Council and Assembly of <hi>Carolina</hi> had passed an Act the 20th <hi>August</hi> 1731, entituled, <hi>An Act for the better Regulation of the Indian Trade, and for appointing a Commissioner for that purpose with Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> which the Trustees hoped might be effectual in <hi>Georgia,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an Act, entituled, <hi>An Act for Maintaining the Peace with the Indians in the Province of</hi> Georgia, <hi>with the same Regulations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions as were in the</hi> Carolina <hi>Act</hi>; which Act ceased to be in Force in <hi>Georgia</hi> since it was erected into a Distinct Independent Province not subject to the Laws of <hi>Carolina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Trustees receiving frequent Informations from the Colony of the pernicious Effects of Drinking Rum and other Spirituous Liquors, by not only creating Disorders amongst the Indians (who had been plentifully supplied with it by the Traders) but also Destroying many of the English, and throwing the People into various Distempers, prepared an Act, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>An Act to prevent the Importation and Use of Rum and Brandies in the Province of</hi> Georgia, <hi>or any kind of Spirits or Strong Waters whatsoever.</hi> At the same time they endeavoured to supply the Stores with Strong Beer from <hi>England,</hi> Mollasses for Brewing Beer, and with <hi>Madeira</hi> Wines, which the People might purchase at reasonable Rates, and which would be more refreshing and wholesome for them. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of the Town of <hi>Savannah</hi> were likewise impowered to grant Licences to private Persons for Retailing Beer, Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Trustees have great Reason to believe that the remarkable Healthiness of <hi>Ebenezer</hi> in the Northern Part, and <hi>Frederica</hi> in the Southern Part of <hi>Georgia,</hi> is very much owing to the Prohibition of the Use of Rum: For in those Parts where Rum in defiance of the Act has been introduced, the People have not in general been so Healthy and Vigorous.</p>
               <p>At the same Time the Trustees taking into Consideration the many Inconveniencies which would attend the Introduction of Negroes in a Frontier, for the several Reasons before specified, prepared an Act for rendering the Colony of <hi>Georgia</hi> more Defensible by prohibiting the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and Use of Black Slaves or Negroes into the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:004961_0023_0F5F3CCE681B8848"/>These Three Acts were laid before the King in Council in the Month of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1734, and after a Report from the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations to the Committee of Council, that they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to receive his Majesty's Royal Approbation, they were Ratified by his Majesty in Council.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Lands Granted by the Trustees were to Revert to them on failure of Issue Male, in order to be re-granted for keeping up a number of Men; yet the Trustees as Guardians of the People when any such Failure happened, resolved that the value of the Improvements upon the Lands of the late Occupiers, should be Valued and Paid to or for the Benefit of the Female Issue or near Relation, and the first Issue of such a Failure being on the Death of Mr. <hi>De Ferron,</hi> the Value of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements he had made upon his Estate was on the 5th <hi>Febr.</hi> 1734 Ordered and Paid for the Use of his Daughter in <hi>England,</hi> who being destitute would have been absolutely unable to proceed in the Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Father's Lot.</p>
               <p>Two Embarkations were made this Year, whose Numbers are hereafter mentioned, which consisted chiefly of <hi>Saltzburghers,</hi> who with the <hi>Saltzburghers</hi> that went before, were settled in a Town called by them <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> upon the River <hi>Savannah,</hi> at some distance above the Town, and by the Sobriety and Industry of the People they prove a very thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Settlement.</p>

               <p>While these Embarkations were preparing, the Trustees made Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the new Settlements: They Established the Civil Government for the new Town (which was called <hi>Frederica</hi>) in the same Manner as they had before at <hi>Savannah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1735, the Highlanders arrived in <hi>Georgia</hi> (and with them several of the same Country as Servants to private Grantees) they were settled on the <hi>Alatamaha</hi> River, about Sixteen Miles distant by Water from the Island of <hi>St. Simons</hi> (which is at the Mouth of the River) they soon raised convenient Huts 'till their Houses could be Built; and the Town at their own desire was called <hi>Darien</hi>; which Name still remains to the District, but the Town is since Named by them <hi>New-Inverness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 6th <hi>February</hi> 1735, the Embarkation under the Conduct of Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> arrived in <hi>Georgia,</hi> they were settled upon <hi>St. Simon's</hi> Island, the Town called <hi>Frederica</hi> was soon laid out, and the People were set to Work in Building their Houses. The <hi>Creek Indians</hi> who went thither upon Occasion of this new Settlement, agreed that the English should possess <hi>St. Simon's</hi> Island, with the Others contiguous to it: The Land of the Island is very fertile, chiefly Oak and Hickery, intermixed with Savannahs and old Indian Fields, and according to a Survey made of it, it is about Forty five Miles in Circumference.</p>
               <p>For a Communication between the Settlements in the Northern and Southern Parts of the Province by Land, a Road was soon afterwards opened.</p>

               <p>FOr the Security of the People (who were settled the last Year on <hi>St. Simon's</hi> Island) and the Southern Part of the Province, several Forts were Built this Year, <hi>viz</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One at <hi>Frederica,</hi> with Four regular Bastions and a Spur Work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River, and several Pieces of Cannon were mounted on it.</p>
               <p>About Ten Miles from <hi>Frederica</hi> a large Battery is Built command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Entrance into the Sound, where Ten or Twelve Forty Gun Ships may safely Ride, there being sufficient Water on the Bar called <hi>Iekyll</hi> for such Ships to go over, which Bar lies in 30 d. 40 m. and behind <hi>Iekyll</hi> Island there is Water and Room enough for Shipping for Ten Miles up. The Battery is enclosed within a strong Wall, and has a Guard-House within the Wall capable of holding Twenty four Men.</p>
               <p>Another Fort was Built on the Southwest Part of the Island of <hi>St. Peters</hi> (now called <hi>Cumberland</hi>) which lies in 30 d. 30 m. under which Fort, on which are Mounted several Pieces of Ordnance pointed towards the River, all Sloops and Boats in the Inland Passage to this Island must come. Within the Pallisade round the Fort there are fine Springs of Water, and there is a well Framed Timber Log House, Thirty Feet by Eighteen, with a Magazine under it both for Ammunition and Provisions. A Scout Boat is stationed at this Island.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004961_0027_0F5F3CD2B33A74C8"/>As these Precautions were taken for the Southern Part of the Province, Directions were given for a Fort to be Built for the Security of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Part, by way of an Out-Guard against any Invasion by Land. This was at a Place called <hi>Augusta,</hi> which has proved a very thriving Town, it being now the chief Place of Trade with the Indians, and where the Traders of both Provinces of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> resort, from the Security they find there. <hi>Augusta</hi> is about Two Hundred Thirty Miles by Water from the Town of <hi>Savannah,</hi> and large Boats which carry about Nine Thousand Pounds Weight of Deer-skins can Navigate down the River <hi>Savannah.</hi> The Town, which stands upon a high Ground near the River, is well Inhabited, and has several Warehouses in it furnished with Goods for the Indian Trade. A Road has been like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise made, so that Horsemen can now Ride from this Town to <hi>Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> as likewise to the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Indians, who are situated above the Town of <hi>Augusta</hi> and Trade with it. A Garrison has been kept at this Fort at the Trustees Expence, 'till the Arrival of the Regiment his Majesty since Ordered for the Defence of the Colony.</p>
               <p>Whilst these Dispositions were making for the Security of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, the Parliament gave <hi>Ten Thousand Pounds</hi> this Year for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Settling and Securing the Colony; but as the Expences of the Forts and the Supplies which were sent for the Support of the Colony, were very great, and as many People in the Northern Part of the Province were as yet unable to subsist themselves, and out of Compassion to them and their Families a Store was still kept open for their subsistence, the Trus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees sent over but few Persons this Year.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Year 1737, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Augustine</hi> made Preparations for Attacking the Colony of <hi>Georgia</hi>; they laid in Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Corn and Provisions, bought up a great number of Fire Arms, and large Bodies of Regular Troops were sent thither from the <hi>Havannah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lieutenant Governor of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> informed the Magistrates of <hi>Savannah</hi> of these Preparations: This Advice and the frequent Alarms which were otherwise given, drew the People off from their Labour in the Sowing Season, and their Improvements in their Plantations were neglected, and they were obliged to make Preparations for their Defence.</p>
               <p>At the same Time the Highlanders at <hi>New-Inverness,</hi> who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Danger, Built a Fort there and Twelve Pieces of Cannon were mounted on it.</p>
               <p>Tho' the People at <hi>Savannah</hi> were not so immediately exposed to Danger, they began to Build a large Fort at their Town of Pallisade Work with Bastions: But as the Trustees perceived this took off the

People from their Cultivation, that the Work would be very Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and they had not Money to support the Expence, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under a Necessity to put a stop thereto.</p>

               <p>AS several Merchants and Captains of Ships had for their own Interest carried into the Colony from <hi>New-York</hi> and other Places, large Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes of Provisions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> great part of which (to save the Merchants from Losses) was taken in at the Store without a proper Authority from the Trustees, and an Expence created thereby which the Trustees could not Estimate, nor have Ability to Discharge, and for which certified Accounts were returned to them; the Trustees published an Advertisement in the <hi>London Gazette,</hi> and Ordered it to be Published in the <hi>South-Carolina Gazette,</hi> and to be affixed upon the Doors of the Store-houses at <hi>Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> and <hi>Frederica,</hi> That out of a due Regard to Publick Credit they had Resolved, that all Expences which they had Ordered or should Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be made in <hi>America</hi> for the use of the Colony, should be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed and Paid for in <hi>Georgia,</hi> in Sola Bills of Exchange only, under their Seal; and they gave Notice, that no Person whatsoever had any Authority from them, or in their Name, or for their Account, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase or receive any Cargoes of Provisions, Stores or Necessaries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Paying for them in the said Sola Bills.</p>
               <p>Upon the Petition of one <hi>Abraham De Lyon,</hi> a Freeholder of <hi>Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> in <hi>Georgia,</hi> that he had expended a great Sum in the Cultivation of Vines, which he had carried from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and had brought to great Perfection; and several Certificates being produced of his Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Cultivating them, and of the Goodness of the Grapes, and of their Thriving in the most barren Lands of the Province, the Trustees assisted him to proceed in his Improvements.</p>
               <p>The Security of the Colony being provided for by the Regiment sent over by his Majesty, the Parliament gave <hi>Eight Thousand Pounds</hi> for the further Settling the Colony. Therefore the Trustees sent over an Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of all the Expences they allowed to be made in the Province, by which several Military Expences, which they had been engaged in for the Defence of the Colony, and which were very great, were reduced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:004961_0031_0F5F3CD59011C118"/>The Trustees this Year sent over the Rev.

               <p>The Assembly of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> having in the last Year passed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for raising a Sum to indemnify their Traders in opposition to the Act which was approved of by his Majesty in Council for maintaining the Peace with the Indians in the Province of <hi>Georgia,</hi> upon a Memorial from the Trustees complaining of the said Ordinance, and upon a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Council and Assembly of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> against the said Act, there was a solemn Hearing before the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, and afterwards before a Committee of the Lords of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Privy Council: Whereupon his Majesty was pleased to Order, that the said Ordinance of the Assembly of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> should be Repealed and declared Void, and was pleased to send an Instruction to the Trustees to prepare a proper Act or Ordinance for settling the Trade carried on by the Provinces of <hi>South Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> with the Indians, on such a Footing as might be for the mutual Benefit and Satisfaction of both Provinces; And his Majesty at the same Time was graciously pleased to give an Instruction to <hi>Samuel Horsey,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> Governor and Lieutenant-General of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> to Recommend to the Council and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly there to pass a Law for the like Purpose in that Province: But <hi>Samuel Horsey,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> dying soon after, and no other Governor having since gone to <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> that Affair remains unsettled.</p>
               <p>The Trustees immediately sent to Col. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> a Copy of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Instructions, and desired that he would Consult with Lieutenant Governor <hi>Bull</hi> in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> that Plans of proper Acts might be prepared and sent over to the Trustees for their Consideration, in order to answer the Purposes of his Majesty's Instructions, and that in the mean Time the Commissioners of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> and the Commissioners of <hi>Georgia,</hi> might proceed in their respective Provinces in concert with each other to carry on a mutual Trade to the Indians in both Provinces.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> Secretary in <hi>Georgia,</hi> having informed the Trustees, that the Grand-Jury at <hi>Savannah</hi> claimed a Right of Administring Oaths, and making Enquiry thereon into all such Matters as they should think fit, and the Trustees having perceived that in a Representation of the said Grand-Jury they had pretended to such Right, sent a Letter to Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> to acquaint him, That the Trustees were sensible great Mischiefs might be done by ill-designing Men who might procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be put upon the Panel, if this Claim of the Grand-Jury was allowed of, and therefore the Trustees ordered him to acquaint the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the Grand-Jury had no such Right, and that their Claim was intirely illegal.</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:004961_0032_0F5F3CD60B1A4518"/>As the Trustees both by their Letters and Instructions to the Magistrates had constantly exhorted and encouraged the People to a Cultivation of their Lands on which they were to Depend for their Support, and as they found that many (as well of those whom they had sent over as Objects of Charity, as of others who at different Times had gone into the Colony from other Plantations for a Temporary Maintenance) still continued in their Idleness, and were a Burthen upon the Trust, they gave Orders for striking off the Store all such as having had Time to Cultivate their Lands had neglected it. This carried from the Colony many of those who had gone thither or joined it from any Parts of <hi>America</hi> to gain a Subsistence for a Year or two, and of others who had not considered the Hardships of attending the first Settlement of a Country, and were tired of their Labour.</p>
               <p>The Trustees receiving an Account dated the 12th <hi>February</hi> 1738 from their Secretary in the Province, of an Uneasiness amongst several Persons upon the Tenures of their Lots being confined to the Heirs Male, and they considering that the Colony had been for some Time Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the People grown more numerous, and a Regiment being sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in it for it's Defence, whereby the former Tenures became less necessary, did on the 15 <hi>March</hi> following, at their Anniversary Meeting, resolve, That in Default of Issue Male, any legal Possessor of Land, might by a Deed in Writing, or by his Last Will and Testament, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point his Daughter as his Successor, or any other Male or Female Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a Proviso, that the Successor should in the proper Court in <hi>Georgia,</hi> personally claim the Lot Granted or Devised within Eighteen Months after the Death of the Grantor or Devisor.</p>
               <p>This was soon after extended to every legal Possessor's being impowered to appoint any other Person to be his Successor.</p>
               <p>But whilst the Trustees were taking these steps for the Satisfaction of the People, and whilst those in the Southern Part of the Province (tho' exposed to greater Danger) were industrious and easy in their Settlements, many of those in the Northern Part, who had neglected the Cultivation of their Lands, drew up a <note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

               <head>From the 9th <hi>Iune</hi> 1739, to the 9th <hi>Iune</hi> 1740.</head>
               <p>AT the Time that some of the People at <hi>Savannah</hi> were so clamorous for Negroes (for Seventy five Land and Freeholders of whom Fifty two were Freeholders, did not apply for them) the Province of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> was under frequent Alarms on account of their Negroes there. They had Intelligence that a Conspiracy was formed by the Negroes in <hi>Carolina</hi> to Rise and forcibly make their Way out of the Province, to put themselves under the Protection of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; who had proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Freedom to all who should run away to them from their Owners. That this Conspiracy was discovered at <hi>Winyaw</hi> the most Northern Part of that Province, from whence as the Negroes must bend their Course, it argued that the other Parts of the Province must be Privy to it, and that the Rising was to be universal. Whereupon the whole Province was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Guard; the number of Negroes in <hi>South-Carolina</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be about Forty Thousand, and the number of White Men at most not above Five Thousand. As several Negroes who were employed in Periaguas and other like Craft (which they carried off with them) had taken the Benefit of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Proclamation and gone to <hi>Augustine,</hi> the Government of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> sent a solemn Deputation to Demand their Slaves; This Deputation consisted of Mr. <hi>Brathwaite</hi> a Member of the Council, Mr. <hi>Rutlidge</hi> one of the Assembly, and Mr. <hi>Amian</hi> Clerk of the Assembly; But the Governor of <hi>Augustine</hi> tho' in Time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Peace, peremptorily refused to deliver them up, and declared he had Orders to receive all such as should come there and protect them.</p>
               <p>Upon this, and the Petition which was sent from the Highlanders at <hi>Darien,</hi> and the <hi>Saltzburghers</hi> at <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> representing the Danger and Inconvenience of the Introduction of Negroes, the Trustees sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Seal an <note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 11.</note> Answer to the Representation of some of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Savannah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the Persons to whom Grants of Land were made in order to their settling at their own Expence in the Colony, some never went over; others were Gentlemen of <hi>Carolina</hi> who neglected to take up their Lands, or even desire to have them laid out; and others who quitted their Plantations, and went to reside at <hi>Savannah</hi> as Shop-keepers. One Man in particular an Apothecary Surgeon, from the beginning neglected his Grant and followed his Practice in the Town; another quitted his Plantation and betook himself to Selling of Rum: To these Two almost all the Town of <hi>Savannah</hi> were Indebted for Physick or Rum, and they first raised the Clamour that Lands might be alienable, and Negroes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004961_0035_0F5F3CD81E3356A8"/>
which would have made them Possessors of the chief Part of the Lots. To these some others who had gone at their own Expence, and had employed their Covenanted Servants on their Plantations joined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, taking their Servants from their Labour and letting them out to Hire in the Town for the sake of an immediate Profit, on which they lived in an idle and riotous manner; and even at the Time when their Servants were taken off from their proper Labour in their Plantations, they fomented the Clamour for Negroes in order to carry them on: The Spirit of Idleness which was very early introduced in the Town, many of the People were too ready to follow; constant Clubs have been held, and Horse Races kept up by them to amuse and divert the People from their Labour: And Delinquents (who have insulted the Laws even in the Courts of Justice and declared they would do their utmost to destroy the Colony) have when committed to Prison been abetted and supported by them. By these the beforementioned Representation was formed, and many of the People by their own Inclination to Idleness, by the Power the others had over them as Creditors, and by Hopes being given them that if they stuck together the Trustees must grant them Negroes, or see the Colony abandoned, were thus drawn in to Sign the same, in which they in a manner Demanded the Permission of Negroes and an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Tenures.</p>
               <p>The Trustees to make all the People as Easy and Contented as they could, published an Advertisement in the <hi>London Gazette</hi> the 8th <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1739, and other Papers, which was continued for several Days, and ordered it to be Published in the <hi>South-Carolina Gazette,</hi> that they had resolved to enlarge their Grants on Failure of Issue Male, and to make a Provision for the Widows of the Grantees in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lands already Granted should on Failure of Issue Male descend to the Daughters of such Grantees, and in case those should be no Issue Male or Female, that the Grantee might Devise such Lands, and for want of such Devise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that such Lands should Descend to their Heirs at Law; with a Proviso that the Possession of the Person who should enjoy such Devise should not be increased to more than Five Hundred Acres, and that the Widows of the Grantees should Hold and Enjoy the Dwelling-House, Garden, and one Moiety of the Lands their Husbands should Die seized of for and during the Term of their Lives.</p>
               <p>The Trustees directed in the Advertisement, that those who intended to have the Benefit given them should enter their respective Claims, in order that proper Grants and Conveyances in the Law might be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with prepared and executed for that purpose; and that no Fee or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was to be taken for the entering of any such Claim directly or indirectly by any Person or Persons whatsoever.</p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:004961_0036_0F5F3CD8D5F34728"/>In the Month of <hi>August</hi> 1739, the Trustees received Advice from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> That he had frequent Intelligence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to Bribe the Indians and particular the <hi>Creek Nation</hi> into a Rupture with the English, which made it necessary for him to go to the General Assembly of the Indian Nations at the <hi>Coweta-Town</hi> about Five Hundred Miles distant from <hi>Frederica,</hi> in order to prevent such Designs and Seditions among them, and that he had been obliged to buy Horses and Presents to carry up to this Meeting, where the <hi>Choctaws</hi> (who are upon the Frontiers between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Settlements) and the <hi>Chickesaws</hi> were to send their Deputies.</p>
               <p>This Journey of General <hi>Oglethorpe</hi>'s has since appeared to be of great Service to the Publick; for on the 26 <hi>August</hi> 1739, Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> received an Express from Col. <hi>Bull</hi> Lieutenant Governor of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> that he had Intelligence from Lieutenant Governor <hi>Clarke</hi> of <hi>New-York</hi> concerning the <hi>French</hi> Marching from <hi>Mont-Real</hi> near <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> with a Body of about Two Hundred Regular Troops and Five Hundred Indians, who were to be re-inforced by French and Indians in their Journey: That this Army was designed against the Indians in Friendship with his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majesty's Subjects of <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> who are situated near some Branches of the <hi>Mississippi</hi> River. Col. <hi>Bull</hi> added, that he should immediately dispatch an Express to the <hi>Creek Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> with Advice to General <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> of the Contents of Lieutenant Governor <hi>Clarke</hi>'s Letter, and that it was necessary that both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> should be on their Guard, tho' if the <hi>Creek Indians</hi> should prove True the Danger would not be great. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> by his Treaties with the Indians in this Journey has confirmed them in the <hi>British</hi> Interest, and made a new Treaty with them, whereby their former Concession of Lands to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> was Confirm'd and Extended.</p>
               <p>A parcel of Raw Silk was brought this Year from <hi>Georgia</hi> by one Mr. <hi>Samuel Augspourgur,</hi> who made an Affidavit before a Master in Chancery, that he received it from the Hands of Mr. <hi>Thomas Iones</hi> the Trustees Store-keeper at <hi>Savannah,</hi> who told him it was the Produce of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and the said <hi>Samuel Augspourguer</hi> who resided in the Southern Part of the Province said, That, when at <hi>Savannah,</hi> he saw the <hi>Italian</hi> Family there winding off Silk from the Coquons.</p>
               <p>The Silk was shewed at the Trustees Office to Mr. <hi>Iohn Zachary</hi> an eminent Raw Silk Merchant, and Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> one of the greatest Silk Weavers in <hi>England,</hi> who declared it was as fine as any <hi>Italian</hi> Silk, and that it was worth at least <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> a Pound.</p>
               <p>This Mr. <hi>Samuel Augspourguer</hi> who joined the Colony in the Year 1736, left it in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1739, with two Men Servants and their Children

               <head>From the 9th <hi>Iune</hi> 1740, to the present Time.</head>
               <p>THe Trustees this Year took further Methods for the Satisfaction of the People in the Province, they extended the Tenures by which a Daughter of a Grantee, or any other Person, was made capable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Devise or Inheritance, any quantity of Lands which did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease her or his Possession to more than Two Thousand Acres.</p>
               <p>A Licence was likewise Granted to all the present Possessors of Land in <hi>Georgia,</hi> to make Leases of any Parts of their Lots for any Term not exceeding Three Years to any Person residing in <hi>Georgia</hi> and who should reside there during the Term of such Lease.</p>
               <p>A general Release was likewise passed by which no Advantage was to be taken against any of the present Possessors of Land in <hi>Georgia</hi> for any Forfeitures incurred at any Time before Christmas 1740, in relation either to the Tenure or Cultivation of Lands, and the Possessors of Fifty Acres of Land were not obliged to cultivate more than Five Acres thereof in Ten Years from their Grants, and those under Fifty Acres in proportion: And the Possessors of Five Hundred Acres of Land were not obliged to cultivate more than One Hundred and Twenty Acres thereof in Twenty Years from their Grants, and those of under Five Hundred Acres and above Fifty Acres in proportion, in order to prevent any Forfeitures for want of Cultivating the Quantities required.</p>
               <p>Under these Circumstances it is presumed that no Complaint can now with Reason be made against the Tenure by which the Inhabitants at this Time hold their Lands, since they have more Power than is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally given by Marriage Settlements in which the Grantees are only Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants for Life, incapable of Mortgaging or Aliening or making any Disposition by their Last Will, whereas the Freeholders in <hi>Georgia</hi> are now become Tenants in Tail-General, and may with the Licence of the Common Council of the said Trustees upon Application made to them for that purpose, Mortgage or Alien, and further without that Licence have it absolutely in their Power on Failure of Issue in Tail to dispose thereof by their Last Will.</p>
               <p>By an Account received from the Secretary in the Province it appears, that on the 1st <hi>August</hi> 1740, about Seventy Freeholders of the Northern Part of the Province, delivered in the Town Court of <hi>Savannah</hi> their Claims of Lots under the Tenures which were Advertized the last Year in the <hi>South-Carolina</hi> and <hi>London Gazettes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:004961_0039_0F5F3CDC8DB304E0"/>That on the 15th of the same Month, as many or more appeared in the said Town Court on the said Occasion, and that on the 27th of the same Month divers more delivered in their Claims likewise.</p>
               <p>The Trustees are informed by their Secretary in the Province, that in pursuance of their Orders he had just finished an authentical Account of the State of the Colony with respect to the Number of Inhabitants in the several Towns and Villages, the Number of Houses and the Settlements made, the Progress which the several People had made in the Cultivation of their Lands, and their Ability or Inability to support themselves, and in case where the last appeared the Reason of it; the Proportions of the different sorts of Soil as near as could be computed, and an Account of the several Produces which by Experience or Appearance could or might be raised for Trade. And the Trustees are daily in expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from him the said Account. But by the several Accounts before received they are enabled to give, though an imperfect one, the following State of the Settlements, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Savannah</hi> is about Ten Miles up the River <hi>Savannah,</hi> where are (besides Warehouses and Huts) at least One Hundred and Thirty Houses in the Town; as these for the sake of Air, and to prevent the spreading of any Fire, are Built at some Distance from each other, they make several spacious Squares and wide Streets. There is a regular Magistracy settled in the Town, which the Trustees are obliged to be at the Expence of Supporting, 'till the Colony arrives at sufficient Strength to do it. There are in the Town a Court-House, a Store-House, a Goal, a House for the Trust Servants, a Wharf, a Guard-House and some other Publick Buildings; a Church is at present Building and a Clergyman is settled there. The Town is excellently situated for Trade, the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the River being very secure and Ships of Three Hundred Tons can lie within Six Yards of the Town and the Worm does not Eat them.</p>
               <p>About Four Miles from <hi>Savannah,</hi> inland from the River, are the Two Villages <hi>Highgate</hi> and <hi>Hampstead,</hi> which lie at about a Mile distant from each other: The People settled there apply themselves chiefly to Gardening, and supply the Town of <hi>Savannah</hi> with quantities of Greens and Garden stuff.</p>
               <p>By the Account of Mr. <hi>Thomas Stephens,</hi> who at his Father's request was sent over to assist him in his Business of Secretary in the Province and continued with him there some short Time, he states, that there are Twenty Plantations within Twenty Miles round <hi>Savannah,</hi> which have each of them from Five to Thirty Acres of Land Cleared.</p>
               <p>About Fifteen Miles from <hi>Savannah</hi> is a Village called <hi>Abercorn</hi>; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twenty Miles further up the River is the Town of <hi>Ebenezer</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:004961_0040_0F5F3CDEACDBD748"/>
where the <hi>Saltzburghers</hi> are settled with Two Ministers, one of whom computed that the Number of his Congregation in <hi>Iune</hi> 1738 consisted of One Hundred and Forty six. Therefore as the Infants could not be reckoned in the Computation, and as Seven more have since been sent and settled with them, it is believed the Number has been increased; especially since the Town is so Healthy that by a Letter sent to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for Propagating Christian Knowlege by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bolzius</hi> one of the Ministers at <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> dated the 26 <hi>Iune</hi> 1740, he declared, That in a Years Time one Person only had died, which was a Child of Four Years old. The People are Industrious and Sober, they raise not only a sufficient quantity of Corn and other Produces for their own Subsistence, but they sell great quantities to those at <hi>Savannah</hi> who have not been so careful of their own Plantations; they have great Herds of Cattle, and are in so Thriving a Condition that not one Person has abandoned his Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, or sent over the least Complaint about the Tenures or the Want of Negroes. On the contrary they in a Body Petitioned against the use of Negroes, and their Ministers have declared, that their Signing that Petition was a voluntary Act: And at their desire another Embarkation of their Countrymen, who are willing to go from <hi>Germany</hi> and join them, is designed to be sent with all convenient speed.</p>
               <p>About Ten Miles from hence, and upon a River running into <hi>Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> is a Place called <hi>Old Ebenezer,</hi> where is a Cow-pen and a great number of Cattle for the use of the Publick and for Breeding.</p>
               <p>At a considerable distance from hence is the Town of <hi>Augusta</hi> before described, which with the great resort of Traders and Indians, is in a thriving Condition, and is and will be a great Protection to both the Provinces of <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> against any Designs of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Southern Part of the Province is the Town of <hi>New Inverness</hi> upon the River <hi>Alatamaha</hi> where the Highlanders are settled.</p>
               <p>And about Twenty Miles from hence on the Island of <hi>St. Simons</hi> near the Sea is the Town of <hi>Frederica</hi> with a regular Magistracy, as at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah,</hi> supported at the Expence of the Trust; strong Fortifications round the Town are almost finished, and at the South East Point of the Island are Barracks for Three Hundred and Thirty Men.</p>
               <p>There are Settlements on the Islands of <hi>Iekyll</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi> which lie at a small distance from each other to the Southward of <hi>Frederica,</hi> and on the last Two Forts are Built, one of which was described before, and the other was finished in <hi>April</hi> 1740 upon the South End of the Island. It commands the Inlet of <hi>Amelia</hi> Sound, is strongly Pallisaded with Flankers, and is Defended by Eight Pieces of Cannon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:004961_0041_0F5F3CDF4D80B5F8"/>Barracks are Built upon this Island for Two Hundred and Twenty Men with Storehouses, which were finished in <hi>October</hi> 1738.</p>
               <p>There are Six Forts in the Province, and a Battery of Cannon erected to secure the Harbour of <hi>St. Simons,</hi> under which Ships may safely lie.</p>
               <p>The Indians, from the Presents which they have Annually received from the Trustees, and from the Justice and Humanity with which they have been treated, are secured in the <hi>British</hi> Interest, notwithstanding the Arts both of the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to seduce them: By this <hi>South-Carolina</hi> has been free from those Wars, in which (as the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his Majesty's Charter sets forth) they had frequently suffered, and so late as in the Year 1715 had been laid almost Wast with Fire and Sword, and by the Security which <hi>South-Carolina</hi> received by such a Frontier as <hi>Georgia</hi> is to it, very large Tracts of Land have been Cultivated in the Southern Part of that Province, which no Person would venture to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on before, and a great quantity of Rice raised thereon.</p>
               <p>As the People in <hi>Georgia</hi> sent on the Charity were supported to enable them to raise their own Provisions in the first Place on the Lands they should Clear, and to convert the Timber they should cut down in Clearing those Lands into Lumber, which they might to their great Advantage Transport to the Sugar Colonies, and further to raise Silk, Wine and Oil, for which the Climate was very proper, it was hoped from thence they would gain a comfortable Subsistence, and be of service to their Mother Country in raising such Produces, which at present are purchased from Foreigners with Ready Money.</p>
               <p>Having thus stated the Plan laid down for the Trustees by his Majesty's Charter, the several steps taken by them for the Execution of that Plan, with their Yearly Progress therein, the several Obstructions from unforeseen Accidents which have check'd that Progress, with the present Condition of the Colony, according to the latest and most authentick Accounts from thence, they submit the whole to the Wisdom of this Honourable House, being intirely disposed to follow any Directions that shall flow from thence. And as they have no other View but the Service of their Country, by making this Colony as useful to the Interest of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as by it's Situation and Climate it's capable of being, they heartily wish the Trust in abler Hands that those important Services might not be defeated thro' their Inability.</p>

                  <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN Writing this Answer to a Letter I had the Honour to receive from you, dated the 29<hi>th</hi> Instant, wherein you desire to know my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an Undertaking to raise Raw Silk in your new Settlement in <hi>Georgia</hi>; of the Probability of succeeding therein; the proper steps to be taken to bring that Work to Perfection, and my Opinion of the Nature, Quality and Use of the Raw Silk produced in <hi>Carolina</hi>: It is a great Pleasure to me, that from Experiments which I made some Years ago, I can now besides my Opinion, give you some Information concerning that Silk which may be depended upon.</p>
               <p>The Value and Usefulness of the Undertaking will appear as soon as we consider that all the Silk consumed in this Kingdom, is now of foreign Growth and Manufacture, which Costs the Nation very great Sums of Money Yearly to purchase; and that the raising our Supply thereof in his Majesty's Dominions in <hi>America</hi> would save us all that Money, afford Employment to many Thousands of his Majesty's Subjects, and greatly increase the Trade and Navigation of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears to me as Beneficial to the Kingdom, attended with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Hazard or Difficulty, as much Wanted, and which may as soon be brought to Perfection in a proper Climate as any Undertaking so Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in itself, that I ever heard of. I therefore think that there is a very great Probability of it's succeeding, if such proper Methods are
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004961_0043_0F5F3CE050B59680"/>
pursued, and such Assistance afforded to the poor People at their first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, as are necessary to Settle, Instruct and Encourage them.</p>
               <p>The Silk produced in <hi>Carolina</hi> has as much natural Strength and Beauty as the Silk of <hi>Italy</hi> (which is commonly called fine Silk) and by the several Experiments I have tried with it, I am satisfied that it might be made to answer the same Purposes that <hi>Italian</hi> Silk now does, if it be reeled in short Skains, a fine clean and even Thread: To effect which if some experienced Persons are at first sent to Teach the People, the Work will soon be made easy to the meanest Capacity, and the value of the Silk will be thereby greatly increased.</p>
               <p>As for my own Part, if at any Time you should think I can be of use to promote so good a Work, I shall be ready to execute your Commands as far as I am able; and always remain,</p>

               <p>ON Tuesday the 13th Instant I went on board a Canoa in Company with Mr. <hi>Geo. Ducat</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Balantine,</hi> with Four Negroes, and about 10 o'Clock we set out from Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s Bridge for <hi>Georgia,</hi> and passing by <hi>Port-Royal</hi> on Wednesday Night, we arrived on Friday Morning an Hour before Day at <hi>Yamacraw</hi> a Place so called by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, but now <hi>Savannah</hi> in the Colony of <hi>Georgia.</hi> Sometime before we came to the Landing the Centinel challenged us, and understanding who we were, admitted us on Shore. This is a very high Bluff Forty Feet perpendicular from High Water Mark; it lies according to Capt. <hi>Gascoigne</hi>'s Observation in the Latitude of 31 d. 58 m. which he took off <hi>Tybee</hi> an Island that lies at the Mouth of the <hi>Savannah</hi> River. It is distant from <hi>Charlestown</hi> S. W. according to Course and Windings of the Rivers and Creeks about 140 Miles, but by a Direct Course 77, allowing <hi>Suillivant</hi>'s Island to be in the Latitude of 32 d. 47 m. from <hi>Augustine</hi> N. E. and by E. about 140 Miles, and by the Course of the Rivers is distant from <hi>Fort Moore</hi> 300 Miles, but upon a direct Line but 115 Miles N. W. and by W. This Bluff is distant 10 Miles from the Mouth of the Rivers on the South side, and <hi>Purrysburgh</hi> is 24 Miles above it on the North, and is so situated that you have a beautiful Prospect both up and down the River. It is very sandy and barren and consequently a wholsome Place for a Town or City. There are on it 130 odd Souls, and from the Time they Embarked from <hi>London</hi> to the Time I left the Place, there Died but two sucking Children and them at Sea. When they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there was standing on it a great quantity of the best sort of Pine, most of which is already cut down on the spot where the Town is laid out to be Built. The Land is barren about a Mile back, when you come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very rich Ground; and on both sides within a quarter of a Mile of the Town is choice good Planting Land. Col. <hi>Bull</hi> told me that he had been Seven Miles back and found it extraordinary good.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> is indefatigable, takes a great deal of Pains, his Fare is but indifferent having little else at present but Salt Provisions. He is extreamly well beloved by all his People, the general Title they give him is <hi>Father.</hi> If any of them is Sick, he immediately Visits them and takes a great deal of Care of them. If any Difference arises he is the Person
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004961_0045_0F5F3CE1CB7AB0B0"/>
that decides it. Two happened while I was there and in my Presence, and all the Parties went away to outward appearance Satisfied and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his Determination. He keeps a strict Discipline, I never saw one of his People Drunk nor heard one of them Swear, all the Time I was there: He does not allow them Rum but in lieu gives them Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Beer: It is surprizing to see how Chearful the Men go to Work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering they have not been bred to it: There are no Idlers there even the Boys and Girls do their Parts. There are Four Houses already up but none finished, and he hopes when he has got more Sawyers, which I suppose he will have in a short Time, to finish Two Houses a Week. He has ploughed up some Land, part of which he has sowed with Wheat, which is come up and looks promising. He has Two or Three Gardens which he has sowed with divers sorts of Seeds, and planted Thyme and other sort of Pot-herbs, Sage, Leeks, Skellions, Celeri, Liquorice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and several sorts of Trees. He was Paliisading the Town round including some part of the Common, which I do suppose may be finished in about a Fortnights Time. In short he has done a vast deal of Work for the Time, and I think his Name justly deserves to be immortaliz'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> has with him Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s written Journal, and by the Latitude of the Place, the Marks and Traditions of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> it is the very first Place where he first went on shore, and talked with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and was the first <hi>Englishman</hi> they ever saw; and about half a Mile from <hi>Savannah</hi> is a high Mount of Earth under which lies their Chief King: And the <hi>Indians</hi> informed Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> that their King desired before he died, that he might be Buried on the Spot where he talked with that great good Man.</p>
               <p>The River Water is very good, and Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> has proved it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, and thinks it as good as the River of <hi>Thames.</hi> On Monday the 19<hi>th</hi> we took our Leave of Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> at Nine o'Clock in the Morning, and Embark'd for <hi>Charlestown</hi>; and when we set off he was pleased to Honour us with a Volley of Small Arms and the Discharge of Five Cannon: And coming down the Rivers we found the Water per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Fresh Six Miles below the Town, and saw Six or Seven large Sturgeon leap, with which Fish that River abounds, as also with Trout, Perch, Cat and Rock Fish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the Winter Season there is variety of Wild Fowl, especially Turkeys, some of them weighing Thirty Pounds, and abundance of Deer.</p>

               </head>
               <p>YOUR Majesty's most Dutiful Subjects of this Province, having often felt with Hearts full of Gratitude, the many Signal Instances of your most Sacred Majesty's peculiar Favour and Protection, to those Distant Parts of your Dominions, and especially those late Proofs of your Majesty's most Gracious and Benign Care, so wisely calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Preservation of this your Majesty's Frontier Province on the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> by your Royal Charter to the Trustees for Establishing the Colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and your Great Goodness so Timely applied, for the promoting the Settlement of the <hi>Swiss</hi> at <hi>Purrysburgh;</hi> Encouraged by such views of your Majesty's Wise and Paternal Care, extended to your Remotest Subjects, and excited by the Duty we owe to your most Sacred Majesty, to be always Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Support and Security of your Majesty's Interest, especially at this very critical Conjuncture, when the Flame of a War break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in <hi>Europe,</hi> may very speedily be lighted here in this your Majesty's Frontier Province, which, in Situation, is known to be of the utmost Importance to the General Trade and Traffick in <hi>America:</hi> We therefore your Majesty's most faithful Governor, Council, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, convened in your Majesty's Province of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> crave Leave with great Humility to Represent to your Majesty the present State and Condition of this your Province, and how greatly it stands in need of your Majesty's Gracious and Timely Succour in case of a War, to Assist our Defence against the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or any other Enemies to your Majesty's Dominions, as well as against the many Nations of Savages which so nearly Threaten the Safety of your Majesty's Subjects.</p>
               <p>The Province of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> and the new Colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> are the Southern Frontiers of all your Majesty's Dominions on the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> to the South and South-West of which is Situated the strong Castle of <hi>St. Augustine,</hi> Garrison'd by Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have several Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> under their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, besides several other small Settlements and Garrisons, some of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004961_0054_0000000000000000"/>
which are not Eighty Miles Distant from the Colony of <hi>Georgia.</hi> To the South-West and West of us the <hi>French</hi> have erected a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Town near Fort <hi>Thoulouse</hi> on the <hi>Moville-</hi>River, and several other Forts and Garrisons, some not above Three Hundred Miles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from our Settlements; and at <hi>New-Orleans</hi> on the <hi>Mississippi</hi> River, since her late Majesty Queen <hi>Anne's</hi> War, they have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly increased their Strength and Traffick, and have now many Forts and Garrisons on both sides of that great River for several Hundred Miles up the same; and since his most Christian Majesty has taken out of the <hi>Mississippi</hi> Company, the Government of that Country into his own Hands, the <hi>French</hi> Natives in <hi>Canada,</hi> come daily down in Shoals to settle all along that River, where many Regular Forces have of late been sent over by the King to Strengthen the Garrisons in those Places, and according to our best and latest Advices, they have Five Hundred Men in Pay, constantly employed as Wood-Rangers, to keep their Neighbouring <hi>Indians</hi> in Subjection, and to prevent the distant ones from Disturbing the Settlements; which Management of the <hi>French</hi> has so well succeeded, that we are now very well assured they have wholly now in their Possession and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Influence, the several numerous nations of <hi>Indians</hi> that are Situate near the <hi>Mississippi</hi> River, one of which called the <hi>Choctaws</hi> by estimation consists of about Five Thousand Fighting Men, and who were always deemed a very Warlike nation, lies on this side the River not above Four Hundred Miles distant from our Out-settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, among whom, as well as several other Nation of <hi>Indians,</hi> many <hi>French Europeans</hi> have been sent to settle, whom the Priests and Missionaries among them encourage to take <hi>Indian</hi> Wives, and use divers other alluring Methods to Attach the <hi>Indians</hi> the better to the <hi>French</hi> Alliance, by which Means the <hi>French</hi> are become throughly acquainted with the <hi>Indian</hi> Way, Warring and Living in the Woods, and have now a great Number of White Men among them, able to perform a long March with an Army of <hi>Indians</hi> upon any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
               <p>We further beg leave to inform your Majesty, that if the Measures of <hi>France</hi> should provoke your Majesty to a State of Hostility against it in <hi>Europe,</hi> we have a great reason to expect an Invasion will be here made upon your Majesty's Subjects by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> from the <hi>Mississippi</hi> Settlements: They have already paved a Way for a Design of that Nature, by Erecting a Fort called the <hi>Albama</hi> Fort, alias <hi>Fort Lewis,</hi> in the middle of the upper <hi>Creek Indians,</hi> upon a Navigable River leading to <hi>Moville,</hi> which they have kept well Garrisoned and Mounted with Fourteen Pieces of Cannon, and have lately been prevented from erecting a Second nearer to us on that Quarter. The <hi>Creeks</hi> are a Nation very Bold, Active, and Daring, consisting of about Thirteen Hundred Fighting Men (and not above One Hundred and Fifty Miles distant from the <hi>Choctaws</hi>) whom, though
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004961_0055_0F5F3CEC1F8605C8"/>
we heretofore have Traded with, claimed and held in our Alliance, yet the <hi>French</hi> on Account of that Fort and a superiour ability to make them Liberal Presents, have been for some time striving to draw them over to their Interest, and have Succeeded with some of the Towns of the <hi>Creeks</hi>; which, if they can be Secured in your Majesty's Interest, are the only Nation which your Majesty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects here can depend upon as the best Barrier against any Attempts either of the <hi>French</hi> or their Confederate <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We most Humbly pray Leave farther to inform your Majesty, that the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Moville</hi> perceiving that they could not gain the <hi>Indians</hi> to their Interest, without buying their Deer-Skins (which is the only Commodity the <hi>Indians</hi> have to purchase Necessaries with) and the <hi>French</hi> not being able to dispose of those Skins by reason of their having no Vend for them in <hi>Old France,</hi> they have found Means to incourage Vessels from hence, <hi>New-York,</hi> and other Places (which are not Prohibited by the Acts of Trade) to Truck those Skins with them for <hi>Indian</hi> Trading Goods, especially the <hi>British</hi> Woollen Manufactures, which the <hi>French</hi> dispose of to the <hi>Creeks</hi> and <hi>Choctaws,</hi> and other <hi>Indians,</hi> by which Means the <hi>Indians</hi> are much more Alienated from our Interest, and on every Occasion object to us that the <hi>French</hi> can supply them with Strouds and Blankets as well as the <hi>English,</hi> which would have the contrary Effect if they were wholly supplied with those Commodities by your Majesty's Subjects Trading with them. If a Stop were therefore put to that pernicious Trade with the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Creek Indians</hi> chief Dependance would be on this Government, and that of <hi>Georgia,</hi> to supply them with Goods; by which Means great Part of the <hi>Choctaws,</hi> living next the <hi>Creeks,</hi> would see the Advantage the <hi>Creek Indians</hi> enjoyed by having <hi>British</hi> Woollen Manufactures wholly from your Majesty's Subjects, and thereby be invited in a short Time to Enter into a Treaty of Commerce with us, which they have lately made some Offers for, and which, if Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, will soon lessen the Interest of the <hi>French</hi> with those <hi>Indians,</hi> and by Degrees Attach them to that of your Majesty.</p>
               <p>The only Expedient we can propose to Recover and Confirm that Nation to your Majesty's Interest, is by speedily making them Presents to withdraw them from the <hi>French</hi> Alliance, and by Building some Forts among them your Majesty may be put in such a Situation, that on the first Notice of Hostilities with the <hi>French,</hi> your Majesty may be able at once to reduce the <hi>Albama</hi> Fort, and we may then stand against the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> which, if not timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for before a War breaks out, we have too much Reason to Fear we may be soon over-run by the united strength of the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Creeks</hi> and <hi>Choctaws,</hi> with many other Nations of their <hi>Indians</hi> Allies: For, should the <hi>Creeks</hi> become wholly Enemies, who
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004961_0056_0F5F3CEC86198600"/>
are well acquainted with all our Settlements, we probably should also be soon Deserted by the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> and a few others, small Tribes of <hi>Indians,</hi> who, for the sake of our Booty, would readily join to make us a Prey to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savages.</hi> Ever since the late <hi>Indian</hi> War the Offences given us then by the <hi>Creeks</hi> have made that Nation very Jealous of your Majesty's Subjects of this Province. We have therefore concerted Measures with the Honourable <hi>Iames Oglethorpe,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> who, being at the Head of a new Colony, will (we hope) be Successful for your Majesty's Interest amongst that People. He has already by Presents Attached the Lower <hi>Creeks</hi> to your Majesty, and has laudably undertaken to endeavour the fixing a Garrison among the Upper <hi>Creeks,</hi> the Expence of which is already in part provided for in this Session of the General Assembly of this Province: We hope therefore to prevent the <hi>French</hi> from Encroaching farther on your Majesty's Territories, until your Majesty is graciously pleased further to Strengthen and Secure the same.</p>
               <p>We find the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Nation has lately become very Insolent to your Majesty's Subjects Trading among them, notwithstanding the many Favours the Chiefs of that Nation received from your Majesty in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> besides a considerable Expence which your Majesty's Subjects of this Province have been at in making them Presents, which inclines us to believe that the <hi>French</hi> by their <hi>Indians</hi> have been tampering with them. We therefore beg leave to inform your Majesty, that the Building and Mounting some Forts likewise among the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> and making them Presents will be highly necessary to keep them steady in their Duty to your Majesty, lest the <hi>French</hi> may prevail in Seducing that Nation, which they may the more readily be inclined to from the Prospect of getting considerable Plunder in Slaves, Cattle, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Commodities which they very well know they have among us, several other Forts will be indispensably necessary, to be a cover to your Majesty's Subjects settled backwards in this Province, as also to those of the Colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> both which in Length are very extensive; for tho' the Trustees for Establishing the Colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> by a particular Scheme of good Management painfully Conducted by the Gentleman engaged here in that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Enterprize, has put that small part of the Colony, which he has not yet been able to establish, in a Tenable Condition against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Florida</hi> which lie to the Southward; yet the back Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of those Colonies to the vast Number of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> which border on the Westward, must, in case of a War, cry greatly aloud for your Majesty's Gracious and Timely Succour. The Expence of our Safety on such an Occasion, we must, with all Humility, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Majesty, either for Men or Money, can never be Effected by your Majesty's Subjects of this Province, who, in conjunction with <hi>Georgia,</hi> do not in the whole amount to more than Three Thousand
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004961_0057_0000000000000000"/>
Five Hundred Men, which Compose the Militia and wholly consist of Planters, Tradesmen and other Men of Business.</p>
               <p>Besides the many Dangers which by Land we are exposed to from so many Enemies that lie on the back of us; we further beg leave to represent to your Majesty, the Defenceless Condition of our Ports and Harbours, where any Enemies of your Majesty's Dominions may very easily by Sea Invade us, there being no Fortifications capable of making much Resistance. Those in <hi>Charles-Town</hi> Harbour are now in a very ruinous Condition, occasioned by the late violent Storms and Hurricanes which already cost this Country a great deal of Money, and now require several Thousands of Pounds to Repair the old and Build new ones, to Mount the Ordnance which your Majesty was graciously Pleased to send us, which, with great Concern, we must inform your Majesty we have not yet been able to accomplish, being lately obliged for the Defence and Support of this your Majesty's Province and Government, to Raise, by a Tax on the Inhabitants, a Supply of above <hi>Forty Thousand Pounds</hi> Paper Currency <hi>per Annum,</hi> which is a considerable deal more than a Third Part of all the Currency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; a Charge which your Majesty's Subjects of this Province are but barely able to Sustain. Since your Majesty's Royal Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Majesty's Governour here, an intire Stop has been put to the Duties which before accrued from <hi>European</hi> Goods Imported; and if a War should happen, or any thing extraordinary, to be farther Expensive here, we should be under the utmost Difficulties to provide additionally for the same, lest an Increase of Taxes with an Apprehension of Danger, should drive away many of our present Inhabitants, as well as Discourage others from coming here to Settle for the Defence and Improvement of your Majesty's Province, there being several daily moving with their Families and Effects to <hi>North Carolina,</hi> where there are no such Fears and Burdens.</p>
               <p>We must therefore beg leave to inform your Majesty, that, amidst our other perillous Circumstances, we are Subject to many Intestine Dangers from the great Number of Negroes that are now among us, who amount at least to Twenty Two Thousand Persons, and are Three to One of all your Majesty's White Subjects in this Province. Insurrections against us have been often Attempted, and would at any Time prove very Fatal if the <hi>French</hi> should instigate them, by artfully giving them and Expectation of Freedom. In such a Situation we most humbly Crave leave to acquaint your Majesty, that even the present ordinary Expences necessary for the Care and Support of this you Majesty's Province and Government, cannot be provided for by your Majesty's Subjects of this Province, without your Majesty's gracious Pleasure to Continue those Laws for Establishing the Negroes and other Duties for Seven Years, and for appropriating the same, which now lie before your Majesty for your Royal Assent and Approbation;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004961_0058_0000000000000000"/>
and the further Expences that will be requisite for the Erecting some Forts and Establishing Garrisons in the several necessary Places, so as to form a Barrier for the Security of this your Majesty's Province, we most humbly Submit to your Majesty.</p>
               <p>Your Majesty's Subjects of this Province, with fulness of Zeal, Duty and Affection to your most Gracious and Sacred Majesty, are so highly sensible of the great Importance of this Province to the <hi>French,</hi> that we must conceive it more than probable, if a War should happen, they will use all Endeavours to bring this Country under their Subjection; the would be thereby Enabled to Support their Sugar Islands with all sorts of Provisions and Lumber by an easy Navigation, which to our great Advantage is not so Practicable from the present <hi>French</hi> Colonies, besides the facility of gaining then to their Interest most of the Indian Trade on the Northern Continent; they might then easily unite the <hi>Canadees</hi> and <hi>Choctaws</hi> with the many other Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> which are now in their Interest. And the several Ports and Harbours of <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> which now enable your Majesty to be absolute Master of the Passage thro' the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> and to impede, at your Pleasure, the Transportation home of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treasure, would then prove so many Convenient Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for your Majesty's Enemies, by their Privateers or Ships of War to annoy a great Part of the <hi>British</hi> Trade to <hi>America,</hi> as well as that which is carried on through the Gulph from <hi>Jamaica;</hi> besides the Loss which <hi>Great-Britain</hi> must feel in so considerable a Part of it's Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as the Exports of Masts, Pitch, Tar and Turpentine, which, without any Dependance on the Northern Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> are from hence plentifully supplied for the Use of the <hi>British</hi> Shipping.</p>
               <p>This is the present State and Condition of your Majesty's Province of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> utterly incapable of finding Funds sufficient for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this Wide Frontier, and so Destitute of White Men, that even Money itself cannot here raise a sufficient Body of them.</p>
               <p>With all Humility we therefore beg Leave to lay ourselves at the Feet of your Majesty, humbly imploring your Majesty's most gracious Care in the Extremities we should be reduced to on the breaking out of a War; and that your Majesty would be graciously pleased to extend your Protection to us, as your Majesty, in your great Wisdom, shall think proper.</p>

                  <hi>Number</hi> 8. To the Honourable the Trustees for Establishing the Colony of <hi>Georgia</hi> in <hi>America.</hi>
               </head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>May it please your Honours,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE, whose Names are under-written, being all Settlers, Free-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Inhabitants of the Province of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the great Pains and Care exerted by you, in endeavouring to settle this Colony, since it has been under your Protection and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do unanimously join to lay before you, with the utmost Regret, the following Particulars.</p>
               <p>But, in the first Place, we must beg Leave to observe, That it has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us a great deal of Concern and Uneasiness, that former Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, made to you, of the same Nature, have not been thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a due Consideration, nor even of an Answer. We have most of us settled in this Colony, in pursuance of a Description and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it, by you, in <hi>Britain</hi>; and from the Experience of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here several Years, do find, that it is impossible the Measures hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to laid down for making it a Colony can succeed. None of all those who have planted their Lands, have been able to raise sufficient Produce to maintain their Families, in Bread-kind only, even though as much Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Industry have been exerted to bring it about, as could be done by Men engaged in an Affair, in which they believe the Welfare of themselves and Posterity so much depended, and which they imagine must require more than ordinary Pains to make it succeed; so that by the accumulated Expences, every Year, of Provisions, Cloathing, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for themselves, Families, and Servants, several of them have expended all their Money, nay, even run considerably in Debt, and so been obliged to leave off Planting, and making further Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and those who continue are daily exhausting more and more of their Money, and some daily increasing their Debts, without a Possibility of being reimburs'd, according to the present Constitution. This being now the General State of the Colony, it must be obvious, that People cannot subsist by their Land according to their present Establishment, and this being a Truth resulting from Trial, Practice, and Experience, cannot be contradicted by any Theorical Scheme or Reasoning. The Land then, according to the present Constitution, not being able to maintain the Settlers here, they must unavoidably have recourse to, and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004961_0062_0000000000000000"/>
depend upon, Trade; but to our woful Experience likewise, the same Causes that prevent the first, obstruct the latter; for though the Situation of this Place is exceedingly well adapted for Trade, and, if it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, might be much more improved by the Inhabitants, yet the Difficulties and Restrictions which we hitherto have and at present do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under, debar us of that Advantage. Timber is the only Thing we have here which we can Export, and notwithstanding we are obliged to fall it in planting our Land, yet we cannot manufacture it fit for a Foreign Market, but at double the Expence of other Colonies; as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the River of <hi>May,</hi> which is but Twenty Miles from us, with the Allowance of Negroes, load Vessels with that Commodity at one half of the Price that we can do; and what should induce Persons to bring Ships here, when they can be loaded with one Half of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence so near us? Therefore the Timber on the Land is only a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Charge to the Possessors of it, though of very great Service in all the Northern Colonies, where Negroes are allowed, and consequently Labour cheap. We do not in the least doubt, but that in Time Silk and Wine may be produced here, particularly the former; but since the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of Lands with White Servants only cannot raise Provision for our Families, as before mentioned, therefore it is likewise impossible to carry on these Manufactures according to the present Constitution. It is very well known that <hi>Carolina</hi> can raise every thing that this Colony can, and they having their Labour so much cheaper, will always ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Market, unless we are in some measure on a Footing with them; and as in both, the Land is worn out in Four or Five Years, and then fit for nothing but Pasture, we must be always at a great deal more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence than they in clearing new Land for Planting. The Importation of Necessaries for Life comes to us at the most extravagant Rate, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in general, especially of <hi>England,</hi> not being willing to supply the Settlers with Goods upon Commission, because no Person here can make them any Security of their Lands and Improvements, as is very often practised in other Places, to promote Trade, when some of the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Money is laid out in necessary Buildings and Improvements, fitted for the Trade intended, without which it cannot be carried on. The Benefit of the Importation, therefore, is to all transient Persons who do not lay out any Money amongst us, but on the contrary carry every Penny out of the Place: And the chief Reason for their enhancing the Price, is, because they cannot get any Goods here, either on Freight or Purchase, for another Market. If the Advantage accruing from Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation centerd in the Inhabitants, the Profit thereof would naturally cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate amongst us, and be laid out in Improvements in the Colony. Your Honours, we imagine, are not insensible of the Numbers that have left this Province, not being able to support themselves any longer, and those still remaining, who have Money of their own, and Credit with their Friends, have laid out most of the former in Improvements, and lost the latter for doing it on such precarious Titles; and upon account
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004961_0063_0000000000000000"/>
of the present Establishment, not above Two or Three Persons, except those brought on Charity, and Servants sent by you, have come here for the Space of Two Years past, either to settle Land or encourage Trade, neither do we hear of any such likely to come, until we are on better Terms.</p>
               <p>It is true, his Majesty has been graciously pleased to Grant a Regiment for the Defence of this Province, and the neighbouring Colony, which indeed will very much Assist us in Defending ourselves against all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but otherwise does not in the least contribute to our Support; for all that part of their Pay which is expended here, is laid out with Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient People, and our Neighbours of <hi>Carolina,</hi> who are capable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with Provisions and other Necessaries at a moderate Price, which we, as before observed, are not at all capable to do, upon the present Establishment: This being our present Condition it is obvious what the Consequences must be.</p>
               <p>But we, for our parts, having intirely relied on, and confided in, your good Intentions, believing you would Redress our Grievances that should appear, and now, by our long Experience from Industry and continual Application to Improvement of Land here, do find it impossible to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue it, or subsist ourselves any longer, according to the present nature of the Constitution: And likewise believing you will agree to those Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which are found by Experience, capable to make this Colony suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and to promote which we have consumed our Money, Time and Labour; we do, from a sincere and true Regard to it's Welfare, and in Duty both to you and ourselves, beg leave to lay before your immediate Consideration, the Two following chief Causes of these our present Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and this deplorable State of the Colony; and which, we are certain, if Granted, would be an infallible Remedy for both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The want of a Free Title or Fee Simple to our Lands, which, if Granted, would occasion great Numbers of new Settlers to come among us, and likewise encourage those who remain here, chearfully to proceed in making further Improvements, as well to retrieve their sunk Fortunes, as to make Provision for their Posterity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The want and use of Negroes with proper Limitations, which, if Granted, would both induce great Numbers of White People to come here, and also render us Capable to subsist ourselves by raising Provisions upon our Lands, until we could make some Produce of it for Export, and in some measure to balance our Importation. We are very sensible of the Inconveniences and Mischiefs that have already, and do daily arise from an unlimited use of Negroes; but we are as sensible that these might be prevented by a due Limitation, such as, so many to each White Man, or so many to such a Quantity of Land, or in any other Manner
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004961_0064_0000000000000000"/>
which your Honours shall think most proper. By Granting us, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, these Two particulars, and such other Privileges as his Majesty's most dutiful Subjects in <hi>America</hi> enjoy, you will not only prevent our impending Ruin, but we are fully satisfied, also, will soon make this the most flourishing Colony possessed by his Majesty in <hi>America,</hi> and your Memories will be perpetuated to all future Ages, our latest Posterity sounding your Praises as their first Founders, Patrons and Guardians: But if, by Denying us those Privileges, we ourselves and Families are not only Ruined, but even our Posterities likewise, you will always be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the Cause and Authors of all their Misfortunes and Calamaties; which we hope will never happen.</p>

               <p>WE are informed, that our Neighbours of <hi>Savannah</hi> have petitioned your Excellency for the Liberty of having Slaves; we hope and earnestly intreat, that before such Proposals are hearkened unto, your Excellency will consider our Situation, and of what dangerous and bad Consequence such Liberty would be of to us, for many Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Nearness of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have proclaimed Freedom to all Slaves who run from their Masters, makes it impossible for us to keep them, without more Labour in watching them, than we would be at to do their Work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are Laborious, and know a White Man may be, by the Year, more usefully employed than a Negro.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are not Rich, and becoming Debtors for Slaves, in case of their running away, or dying, would inevitably ruin the poor Master, and he become a greater Slave to the Negro-Merchant, than the Slave he bought could be to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It would oblige us to keep a Guard-Duty, at least as severe as when we expected a daily Invasion; and, if that was the Case, hoiw miserable would it be to us, and our Wives and Children, to have an Enemy without, and a more dangerous one in our Bosom.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is shocking to human Nature, that any Race of Mankind, and their Posterity, should be sentenced to perpetual Slavery; nor, in Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, can we think otherwise of it, than that they are thrown amongst us, to be our Scourge one Day or other for our Sins; and as Freedom to them must be as dear as to us, what a Scene of Horror must it bring about! And the longer it is unexecuted, the bloody Scene must be the greater. We, therefore, for our own Sakes, our Wives and Children, and our Posterity, beg your Consideration, and intreat, that instead of introducing Slaves, you'll put us in the Way to get some of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, who, with their Labour, in Time of Peace, and our Vigilance,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004961_0067_AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"/>
if we are Invaded, with the Help of those, will render it a difficult thing to hurt us, or that part of the Province we possess. We will for ever Pray for your Excellency, and are, with all Submission,</p>

               <p>WE <hi>Saltzburghers,</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> that have signed this Letter, intreat humbly in our, and our Brethrens, Names, your Excellency would be pleased to shew us the Favour, of desiring the Honourable Trustees for sending to <hi>Georgia</hi> another Transport of <hi>Saltzburghers,</hi> to be settled at <hi>Ebenezer.</hi> We have, with one Accord, wrote a Letter to our Father in God, the Reverend Mr. <hi>Senior Urlsper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> at <hi>Augsperg,</hi> and in that Letter expressly named those <hi>Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers</hi> and <hi>Austrians</hi> whom, as our Friends, Relations, and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we wish to see settled here. We can indeed attest of them, that they fear the Lord truly, love Working, and will conform themselves to our Congregation. We have given them an Account of our being settled well, and being mighty well pleased with the Climate and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Country, having here several Preferences in Spiritual and Temporal Circumstances, for other People in <hi>Germany,</hi> which your Honour will find in the here inclosed Copy of our Letter to Mr. <hi>Senior Urlsperger</hi>; if they fare as we do, having been provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Beginning with Provisions, a little Stock for Breed, some Tools and good Land, by the Care of the Honourable Trus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, and if God grants his Blessing to their Work, we doubt not, but they will gain with us, easily, their Bread and Subsistence, and lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Honesty. Though it is here a hotter Season than our native Country is, yet not so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hot as we were told on the first Time of our Arrival; but since we have been now used to the Country, we find it tolerable, and, for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People, very convenient, setting themselves to Work early in the Morning, 'till Ten o'Clock, and, in the Afternoon, from Three to Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set; and having Business at home, we do them in our Huts and Houses, in the Middle of the Day, till the greatest Heat is over. People in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> are hindred by Frost and Snow, in the Winter, from doing any Work in the Fields and Vineyards; but we have this Preference, to do the most and heaviest Work at such a Time, preparing the Ground
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004961_0069_0000000000000000"/>
sufficiently for the Planting in the Spring. We were told by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral People, after our Arrival, that it proves quite impossible and dangerous, for White People to plant and manufacture any Rice, being a Work only for Negroes, not for <hi>European</hi> People; but having Experience of the contrary, we laugh at such a Talking, seeing that several People of us have had, in last Harvest, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Crop of Rice, than they wanted for their own Consumption. If God is pleased to enable us, by some Money, for building such Mills, convenient for the cleaning the Rice, as we use in <hi>Germany</hi> for the making several Grains fit for eating, then the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Rice will be an easy and Profitable Thing: For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, we crave your Excellency's Goodness to allow, for the Use of the whole Congregation, some Rice-Sieves of several Sorts, from <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> which cannot be had at <hi>Savannah:</hi> We will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the Store for them. Of Corn, Pease, Potatoes, Pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, &amp;c. we had such a good Quantity, that many Bushels were sold, and much was spent in feeding Calves, Cows, and Hogs. If the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor, according to his Order and Duty, had used Dispatch in laying out our Farms (which we have got not sooner than last Fall) <hi>item,</hi> if not, we all were disappointed by long Sickness, and planting the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Pennsylvania</hi> Corn, we would have been able, by the Blessing of God, to spare a greater Quantity of Grain, for getting of Meat-kind and Cloaths, of which we are in want. It is true, the two Acres of Ground for each Family's Garden, are set out some time ago; but being there very few Swamps fit for planting of Rice, and some of them wanting a good deal of Dung, we were not able, in the Beginning, to dung it well, therefore we could not make such a good Use of those Acres, as we now have Reason to hope, by the Assistance of God, after our Plantations are laid out: Hence it is, that we plant the good Ground first, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the other Soil then, when Occasion will require it, in the best Manner we can. In the first Time, when the Ground must be cleared from Trees, Bushes, and Roots, and fenced in carefully, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo some hard Labour, which afterwards will be the easier and more pleasing, when the hardest Trial is over, and our Plantations are better regulated. A good deal of Time was spent in building Huts, Houses, and other necessary Buildings, in Town, and upon the Farms; and since we wanted Money for several Expences, several Persons of us hired our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out, for some Weeks, for building the Orphan-House and it's Appurtenances. <hi>Item,</hi> The Reverend Mr. <hi>Gronau</hi>'s House, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be built in the hottest Summer-Season, and now some of us are employed to build the Reverend Mr. <hi>Bolzius</hi>'s House, which Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings having taken away some Time from our Work in the Ground; but the fair Opportunity of earning some Money at home, was a great Benefit to us; this being now so, that neither the hot Summer Season, nor any Thing else, hinders us from Work in the Ground, and we wish to live a quiet and peaceable Life at our Place. We humbly beseech the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:004961_0070_0000000000000000"/>
Trustees not to allow it, that any Negro might be brought to our Place, or in our Neighbourhood, knowing by Experience that Houses and Gardens will be always robbed by them, and White People are in danger of Life because of them, besides other great Inconveniences. Likewise we humbly beseech you and the Trustees, not to allow any Person the Liberty of buying up Lands at our Place, by which, if grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would happen, that by bad and turbulent Neighbours our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation would be spoiled, and poor harmless People troubled and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; but we wish and long for such Neighbours to be settled here, whose good Name and honest Behaviour is known to us and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers. The Honourable Trustees have been always Favourers and Protectors of poor and distressed People, therefore we beseech you and them, they would be pleased to take us farther under your Fatherly Care, that the Remembrance of their Benevolence and Kindness to our Congregation might be conveyed to our late Posterity, and be highly praised. We put up our Prayers to God for rewarding your Excellency, and the Honourable Trustees, manifold, for all their good Assistance and Benefits which are bestowed upon us, and humbly beg the Continuance of your and their Favour and Protection, being, with the greatest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Respect,</p>

                  <hi>Number</hi> 11. To the Magistrates of the Town of <hi>Savannah</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>GEORGIA.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Trustees for Establishing the Colony of <hi>Georgia</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> have received by the Hands of Mr. <hi>Benjamin Ball</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Merchant, an attested Copy of a Representation Signed by you the Magistrates, and many of the Inhabitants, of <hi>Savannah,</hi> on the 9th <hi>December</hi> last, for altering the Tenure of the Lands, and introducing Negroes into the Province, transmitted from thence by Mr. <hi>Ro. Williams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Trustees are not surprized to find unwary People drawn in by Crafty Men, to join in a Design of extorting, by Clamour, from the Trustees, an Alteration in the fundamental Laws framed for the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the People from those very Designs.</p>
               <p>But the Trustees cannot but express their Astonishment, that you, the Magistrates appointed by them to be Guardians of the People, by putting those Laws in Execution, should so far forget your Duty, as to put your selves at the Head of this Attempt.</p>
               <p>However, they direct you to give the Complainants this Answer from the Trustees, That they should deem themselves very unfit for the Trust reposed in them by his Majesty on their behalf, if they could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon, by such an irrational Attempt, to give up a Constitution, framed from the greatest Caution for the Preservation of Liberty and Property, and of which the Laws against the use of Slaves and for the Entail of Lands, are the surest Foundations.</p>
               <p>And the Trustees are the more confirmed in their Opinion, of the unreasonableness of this Demand, that they have received Petitions from the <hi>Darien,</hi> and other Parts of the Province, representing the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and Danger which must arise to the good People of the Province from the Introduction of Negroes, and, as the Trustees themselves are fully convinced, that besides the Hazard attending that Introduction, it would destroy all the Industry among the White Inhabitants; and that,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004961_0073_0F5F3CFB4EAE50E8"/>
by giving them a Power to Alien their Lands, the Colony would soon be too like it's Neighbours, void of White Inhabitants, filled with Blacks, and reduced to the precarious Property of a few, equally disposed to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Treachery and foreign Invasion. And therefore the Trustees cannot be supposed to be in a Disposition of Granting this Request, and if they have not before this signified their Dislike of it, their Delay is to be imputed to no other Motives but the Hopes they had conceived, that Time and Experience would bring the Complainants to a better Mind. And the Trustees readily join Issue with them in their Appeal to Posterity, who shall judge between them, who were their best Friends, those who endeavoured to preserve for them a Property in their Lands, by Tying up the Hands of their unthrifty Progenitors, or they who wanted a Power to Mortgage or Alien them; who were the best Friends to the Colony, those who with great Labour and Cost, had endeavoured to form a Colony of his Majesty's Subjects, and Persecuted Protestants, from other Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> had Placed them on a fruitful Soil, and strove to secure them in their Possessions, by those Arts which naturally tend to keep the Colony full of useful and industrious People, capable both to Cultivate and Defend it, or those who to gratify the greedy and ambitious Views of a few Negro Merchants, would put it into their Power to become sole Owners of the Province, by introducing their baneful Commodity, which it is well known by sad Experience, has brought our Neighbour Colonies to the brink of Ruin, by driving out their White Inhabitants, who were their Glory and Strength, to make Room for Black, who are now become the Terror of their advised Masters.</p>
