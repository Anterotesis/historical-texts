            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A TREATISE Concerning <hi>MARRIAGE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MARRIAGE is an Ordinance of God, as old as ſince our firſt Parents, inſtituted in Paradiſe, for their comfortable abiding here, and leaving Poſterity after them; and Men and Women have been the more happy therein, as they have had Regard to the Counſel of God, and his Providential Hand, in choſing ſuch as feared the Lord, and were true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of him; and avoiding thoſe who were Idolaters, and ſuch as feared not the true God.</p>
            <p>And that in ſuch their Caution, their Proceeding was agreeable to the Law of God in the Heart, is very apparent: for
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004322_0003_100414D5C9385A00"/>when the Will and Mind of God was committed to Writing, and promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his peculiar People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. ſpeaking of the Nations who inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the promiſed Land, he ſaid, <hi>Neither ſhalt thou make Marriages with them: Thy Daughter ſhalt thou not give unto his Son; nor his Daughter ſhalt thou take unto thy Son.</hi> And why? Becauſe, ſaid the Lord, <hi>They will turn away thy Son from following me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be the Conſequence ſtill of ſuch <hi>Mixt-Marriage,</hi> then ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are ſtill unlawful, and the Law ſtill in Force; that forbids them. But that the Conſequence of ſuch Marriages is ſtill the ſame, I appeal, not only to the <hi>Witneſs of God in all;</hi> but alſo unto ſound <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and true <hi>Experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the Prohibition aforeſaid was not intended againſt theſe <hi>Seven</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only; but had a more general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: For the <hi>Iſrealites</hi> were not allowed to take them Wives of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Aſhdod</hi> of <hi>Ammon,</hi> or of <hi>Moab;</hi> and for the ſame Reaſon, not of any other People that were <hi>not Circumciſed,</hi> and made Partakers of the true Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004322_0004_1004535A47FA28F8"/>
This appears from the Words of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> chap. 13.23. <hi>In thoſe Days,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſaw I</hi> Jews <hi>that had married Wives of</hi> Aſhdod, <hi>of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and of</hi> Moab, <hi>and their Children ſpake half in the Speech of</hi> Aſhdod, <hi>and could not ſpeak the</hi> Jews <hi>Language,</hi> ver. 24. <hi>And I contended with them, and ſmote certain of them;</hi> and made them renew their Covenant with the Lord, <hi>Saying, You ſhall not take their Daughters unto your Sons; nor give your Daughters unto their Sons.</hi> Adding <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Did not</hi> Solomon, <hi>King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſin by theſe Things? Yet among many Nations there was no King like Him, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his God: Nevertheleſs, even him did ſtrange Women cauſe to ſin: Shall we then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>hearken unto you, to do all this great Evil, to tranſgreſs againſt our God, in marrying of ſtrange Wives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, in ſhort, we ſee how ſuch <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages</hi> are againſt the written Law of God, and the Practice of his faithful People.</p>
            <p>But long before this Law was brought into Writing, the Holy <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and ſuch as feared, and worſhipped the true God, even from the Beginning of the World, ſhewed a <hi>Diſlike</hi> of ſuch <hi>Mixt-Marriages,</hi> from the Senſe of the Law
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004322_0005_1004536C253B5388"/>written in their Hearts; and ſo long as they kept in the true Faith, and at a <hi>lawful Diſtance</hi> from ſuch as were not Partakers thereof with them (which for ſome Time they did) the Lord was with them, and bleſſed them, and made them Inſtrumental in his Hand, for the <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding</hi> his <hi>Wrath</hi> from being preſently poured out upon the old <hi>World.</hi> But when they had generally departed from his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and from the <hi>Example</hi> of the Righteous, even in <hi>this particular Caſe,</hi> mark what followed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It came to paſs, when Men began to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply upon the Face of the Earth, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were born unto them, the Sons of God ſaw that the Daughters of Men were fair, and they took them Wives of all that they choſe.</hi> That is, they made <hi>no Diſtinction</hi> upon the Account of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> But to whomſoever their <hi>fleſhly Minds</hi> inclined, them they took to <hi>Wife;</hi> like the diſhonourable and unchriſtian Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome in our Day. And that ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved the Spirit of the the Lord; ſo that thereupon he ſaid, <hi>I will deſtroy Man, whom I have created;</hi> Gen. 6.5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>And when the <hi>Sons of God</hi> came in unto thoſe <hi>Daughters of Men,</hi> and they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004322_0006_1004537B17B3C790"/>bare Children unto them, the ſame (it is ſaid) became <hi>Mighty Men:</hi> But by whom they were ſo accounted, and for what Cauſe, may be gathered from the Sequel. It was not, ſurely, from their Faith, and Holineſs towards God, that they were ſo accounted: For if it had been ſo, he would not have repented that he had made them, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. it is ſaid he did. But it ſeems rather to have been from their Statuers and Bodily-Strength, whereby they could archive great Matters in the World, which made them be reputed Mighty, by ſuch as did bear the ſame Fallen Image with themſelves; who were known and diſtinguiſhed from the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, by the name of the Children of Men, being, in the Main of their Converſation, without a God-like, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Mark: For, the Earth, it is ſaid, <hi>was full of Violence, and there were Giants in thoſe Days,</hi> Gen. 6.4.</p>
            <p>Now when Things were come to this paſs the People of God having caſt off his <hi>Yoke,</hi> and fallen in with the World and its Spirit (which they openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their Entring into the neareſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity by Marriages with them) and had their Hearts thereby drawn away more
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004322_0007_10045387EFBA8568"/>and more from following the Lord; (which always was and is the natural Conſequence of ſuch <hi>Affinities</hi> by Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and is therefore the more hanious and pernicious:) Then did the Lord call upon <hi>Noah,</hi> and gave him Direction to build an <hi>Ark,</hi> for the Safety of himſelf and his Family. For <hi>all Fleſh had,</hi> by that Time, <hi>corrupted his Way upon the Earth;</hi> which ſo provoked the Lord God that he determined to deſtroy all Fleſh by a Flood, except <hi>Noah</hi> only, and his Family. For <hi>Noah</hi> being a Juſt Man, and Perfect in his Generation, and one that walked with God, found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord, to be exempted from that General Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>If nothing more could be alledged againſt theſe <hi>Mixt-Marriages,</hi> this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration (one would think) were, of its ſelf, enough, to manifeſt how great a Sin it is, and to deter all conſiderate Men and Women from entring into it, that it appears to have been a great Step, that led to the Deſtruction of the old World, the Door that gave the inlet to thoſe Corruptions, and <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> which filled the Earth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord, not only to repent
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004322_0008_100453998012D068"/>that he had made Man, but to pour down his Wrath in a <hi>Flood,</hi> which deſtroyed both Man and Beaſt.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen the Miſchief the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly brought upon Mankind, by thoſe <hi>Mixt-Marriages</hi> before the Flood. Now let us ſee, and heedfully obſerve the great Care the <hi>Godly</hi> took after the Flood, to prevent the like Evil and Danger.</p>
            <p>After the general Overthrow of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Men by the Flood, from which only <hi>Noah,</hi> with his Family (Eight Souls in all) were preſerved in the Ark (which was a Figure of Chriſt) was born <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> whom God called out of his own Country, and from his Father's Houſe, with <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, to make of them a diſtinct and peculiar People to himſelf. And he eſtabliſhed his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> (and his Bleſſing upon his Seed) who ſaw Chriſt's Day, and was glad; and in the Faith thereof walked before the Lord, with a Perfect Heart: In which Faith alſo he offered up his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> unto the Lord, as the Lord had commanded him. Such was the Obedience he added unto his Faith: which was accounted unto him for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> Gen. 3.6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004322_0009_100411D7953F4908"/>
Now when <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Child of Promiſe was grown up to a Marriageable Age, ſo great was the Care of his Godly <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> for him, that he might not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally Yoaked, or joyned in Marriage, calling his eldeſt Servant to him (who had the Charge and Overſight of all that he had) he made him Swear by the Lord, the God of Heaven; and the God of the Earth, that he ſhould not take a Wife unto his Son of the Daughters of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> amongſt whom he dwelt, But <hi>thou ſhalt go,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>unto my Country and to my Kindred, and ſhalt take a Wife unto my Son from: hence,</hi> Gen. 24.</p>
            <p>This ſo ſtrict a Charge, ſo ſolemnly given, and ſo firmly bound, ſhews that this Good Man did not look upon this Matter of <hi>Mixt-Marriages,</hi> with an eaſie Eye as an indifferent Thing; but was earneſtly and heartily concerned, that his Son might not be joined with one of a different Religion: And as his honeſt Care was thus exerciſed in ſending his Servant to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Kindred, to the Family of <hi>Bethuel;</hi> ſo the Providential Hand of God was apparently with him, in the Choice of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they gave to it, ſaying, <hi>The Thing

And as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was walking, and <hi>meditating</hi> in the Fields at Evening-tide, he met <hi>Rebecca</hi> coming with his Father's Servants, and took her to be his Wife: And ſhe, after twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years Barrenneſs, bare him two Sons, <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> whoſe different Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the Caſe of Marriage let us now obſerve.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Eſau</hi> was; is well known, both by his ſelling of his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Characters given him in the Holy Scriptures: When he was Forty Years of Age, he took him Two Wives, and both of them Unbelievers, Daughters of the <hi>Hittites,</hi> which Thing full ſorely grieved his Godly Parents: And is left upon Record, as a Mark of his Unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Diſobedience, in not adviſing with, and being ruled by them, in that ſo weighty Affair. And may it be a Caution unto all ſuch, as profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Chriſtians, and ſo of the Righteous Line, <hi>That they follow not the Example of Profane</hi> Eſau!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004322_0011_100453B735BAAB50"/>
But when he ſaw, that what he had done had diſpleaſed his, Parents, he (to mend, as he thought, the Matter) took him another Wife the Daughter of his Uncle <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the <hi>Scoffer;</hi> who, for <hi>mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſaac,</hi> the right Heir, had in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, been caſt out of the Family. Now if it had been external Kindred on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that was aimed at by <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> in <hi>Marriage,</hi> ſurely <hi>Eſau</hi> had now hit it: For ſhe was his Fathers Neice; yet that brought him not, in a right Senſe within the Family, nor Example of the Faithful.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Eſau</hi>'s thus <hi>running out,</hi> from the Practice of the Godly, to take him ſuch Wives as his airy Mind led him to chooſe, without Regard had to true Religion, ſo ſenſibly affected his Good Mother <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that complaining to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band thereof, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I am weary of my Life, becauſe of the Daughters of</hi> Heth! <hi>If</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhould take a Wife</hi> (as his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath done) of the Daughters of <hi>Heth,</hi> ſuch as are the Daughters of the Land, what good ſhall my Life do me? <hi>Gen</hi> 27.46.</p>
            <p>Good <hi>Iſaac</hi> thereupon, to prevent that <hi>Danger,</hi> calling his Son <hi>Jacob</hi> to him, gave him his Bleſſing, and with it this
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004322_0012_100411E370A308D8"/>ſtrict Charge, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take a Wife of the Daughters of</hi> Canaan. <hi>Ariſe go to</hi> Padan-Aram, <hi>to the Houſe of</hi> Bethuel <hi>thy Mother's Father, and take thee a Wife from thence,</hi> Gen. 28.1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob,</hi> as became a dutiful Child, was obedient to his Parents herein: And the Lord was with him, and bleſſed him; and bleſſed his <hi>Family</hi> alſo until they gave Way to a Liberty, not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Then was <hi>Dinah, Jacob</hi>'s only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made an early <hi>Example</hi> of the Lord's Diſpleaſure, by his ſuffering her to fall into contempt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. Not only for her gratifying a vain Mind, in going out, thro' curioſity to ſee the Daughters of the Land; whereby ſhe came to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared and defiled by Shechem, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. but alſo, as it appears, the <hi>Iſrealites</hi> were at that Time ſo far relapſed, that they had ſtrange Gods among them, and, as may be gathered from the Text, ſtrange Attire alſo; which was to be changed, and done away, before they might go up to the Houſe of God, to worſhip him acceptably there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things might be likely to raiſe an Expectation in the Shechemites that in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004322_0013_100453C69441D638"/>time they might draw them to become one People with them. Whereupon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already got hold of one of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family, they were deſirous of a further Converſe, in order to enter into Affinity, with them; ſaying, <hi>make your Marriages with us: Give your Daughters unto us, and take our Daughters unto you; and you ſhall dwell with us,</hi> Gen. 34.9, 10. And to entice them thereunto, they proffered the <hi>Iſrealites</hi> what Worldly advantages ſoever they would ask, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Nay they went ſo far, as to yield to take on them the <hi>Badge</hi> (and a ſore one too) of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Religion, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. but it was but for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and covetous ends, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to them accordingly. But the Truth of the Matter was, and is, that <hi>Jacob,</hi> the True Seed, (the Peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God) <hi>muſt live alone,</hi> and not be <hi>mixed,</hi> or numbered among the Nations Wherefore, notwithſtanding all the great Proffers, and Importunity of <hi>Shechem</hi> (and the Condeſcention of the <hi>Shechemites</hi>) to have obtained <hi>Dinah</hi> for his Wife; <hi>Jacob</hi> would not hearken unto him. And yet it is ſaid, <hi>The Man was more Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than all the Houſe of his Fathers.</hi> For <hi>Iſrael</hi> having an Eye to the Covenant of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004322_0014_100412146004DA88"/>God, wherein he and his Family were comprehended, he zealouſly withſtood the Temptation; and thereby gave a Demonſtration of his <hi>Faith.</hi> And when, ſoon after the Lord commanded him to go up to <hi>Bethel,</hi> he called firſt for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in his <hi>Family.</hi> Whereupon it is ſaid, They gave unto him all the ſtrange Gods that were in their Hands, and all their Ear-rings that were in their Ears; which he hid under the Oak that was by <hi>Shechem.</hi> And then, having cleanſed his <hi>Family</hi> from thoſe Heatheniſh Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, both he and they were thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth at quiet, from ſuch like Attempts by their Unbelieving Neighbours.</p>
            <p>But to proceed. Having a little touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Things, relating to the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the Holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe unlawful <hi>Marriages;</hi> and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth ſome of the pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that have always attended them, both before and after the Flood: I ſhall now come nearer to the preſent State and Diſpenſation we are under.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> came to ſpeak of this <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Marriage, they ran in the ſame Channel, as all the <hi>Faithful</hi> had done before; ſaying. <hi>Be ye not unequally
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004322_0015_100411EF4E43AC20"/>Yoaked with Unbelievers,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 6.14. And <hi>Peter</hi>'s Exhortation and Care for the Married was, that they might be <hi>Heirs together of the Grace of Life; that their Prayers might not be hindered,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.7. Then ſuch muſt be of the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> and agree in Spirit, or elſe they cannot pray together acceptably, <hi>Mat</hi> 18.19. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed</hi> ſaid the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> Chap. 3.3. Therefore ſuch as are obliged to live and walk together for Term of Life, if they are not ſo agreed and united in Spirit, are like to have but little Comfort, Help and Furtherance (if any) from each other in Spiritual Things; which is the Way that leads to true and laſting Comfort for ever. For ſince without <hi>Faith,</hi> and an anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Converſation it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. Such married Folks as differ in <hi>Faith,</hi> and diſagree in their Religious Converſations, are not like to pleaſe God nor one another; but may rather expect the contrary, with much Confuſion, which doth naturally attend ſuch <hi>Miſ-matchings</hi> in that Condition of Life.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 7.9.) faith, <hi>The Wife is bound by the Law, as long as her Husband liveth:
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004322_0016_100453EA94899D38"/>But when he is dead, ſhe is at Liberty to be married to whom ſhe will, only in the Lord.</hi> That is the ancient Limit.</p>
            <p>But, by the Way, this gives no Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ſuch to marry as are near of Kin; tho' otherwiſe duly qualified</p>
            <p>But if any ſhould object, that <hi>Abraham Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> married their near Kinſ-Women? and thereupon ſhould query, why it might not be as lawfull for ſuch Kindred now to marry, as it was for them then.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, firſt, That what they did in that Caſe then was before the Law was given, which doth expreſly forbid it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a common <hi>Maxim,</hi> and in great Meaſure true, that Neceſſity hath no Law. And every Reaſonable Man is capable of conſidering, that in thoſe early Ages of the World there was a Neceſſity for it. And for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and thoſe before mentioned of his <hi>Poſterity,</hi> they lived <hi>not very long</hi> after the Flood, which gaven Kind of <hi>new Beginning to</hi> the World with Reſpect to its being again Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with People. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was born before the Death of <hi>Shem,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture-Chronology, about
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004322_0017_100453F49973CEE0"/>One Hundred and Fifty Years: And yet <hi>Shem</hi> was an Hundred Years old, when the World was drowned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is to be conſidered, that People lived very long in thoſe Days; ſo that Generations paſſed not away, nor did Kindred wear out ſo faſt as afterwards: Which expoſed thoſe Patriarchs to it by a kind of unavoidable Neceſſity; and that rendered it excuſable in them: But there being no ſuch Neceſſity now, nor any <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of that Nature, to induce any to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their <hi>near Kindred;</hi> they who do ſo, do plainly break the poſitive Law of God, which expreſly ſays, <hi>None of you ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any that is near of Kin to him,</hi> &amp;c. Levit. 18. As alſo contrary to the Apoſtle's Advice, <hi>Phil</hi> 4.8. As not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Good Report, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, all that was done by thoſe Good Men, without Reproof, in thoſe early Ages, is not to be drawn into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample now: For <hi>Abraham,</hi> we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16 took <hi>Hagar,</hi> his Wife's Hand-Maid, to his Bed. And <hi>Jacob</hi> had not only two Wives together, but thoſe two Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? and at the ſame Time had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by each of their Hand-Maids; which Practice none, I hope, even of them
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004322_0018_100453FDE42B6640"/>which plead for Marriage betwixt near Kindred, will attempt to defend as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful now. But from this neceſſary Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, let us return to our former Subject.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Marriage</hi> is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, I have already aſſerted; and now add, by Way of Explanation, that there by <hi>Two</hi> are made <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>inſepa ably joyned</hi> together, for Term of their joynt Lives, by <hi>lawful</hi> Means. As Firſt, In <hi>Spirit;</hi> Secondly, In <hi>Affection;</hi> and Thirdly, In a Solemn Covenant of Marriage, as well External and Publick, as otherwiſe. Theſe are the Conditions, more or leſs, of all thoſe which the Lord joyns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whom no Man may put aſunder. And without theſe Conditions the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Union is not perfectly enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Now whereas I preſs for an <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Unity of Faith and Religious Practices,</hi> in the Parties to be married, as Eſſential to the Marriage which God makes: By Faith; there I mean that <hi>Faith</hi> which the <hi>Holy Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> held, which the True <hi>Church</hi> now holdeth, and which uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the True Church (for by <hi>Faith ye ſtand,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle to the Church of old, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.) which is the <hi>One
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004322_0019_10045408733D5EE0"/>True Faith,</hi> mentioned by the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. And altho' there be in the World <hi>Faiths</hi> many, or at leaſt diſtering <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> and Pretences to it: Yet, being inclined by the <hi>Law of Charity,</hi> to conclude that all, who are ſerious, do think their own particular Faith, Perſwation, and Way to be the <hi>Right</hi> (elſe they would not continue in it) what I have here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten may ſerve indifferently to all that profeſs Faith in Chriſt. And yet tho' I do not here give a more particular Definition of Faith; it doth not thence follow that I am indifferent therein, or in Doubt about it: No, but it is to avoid Controverſy, and becauſe I aim at Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and chooſe rather to let the True Faith be manifeſted by it's <hi>Fruits,</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> adviſeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2 18 of which Fruits what I here contend for is one, and not the leaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That they who profeſs Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and are diſpoſed to marry, are Religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Obliged to take Care that they be not <hi>unequally Yoaked,</hi> by joyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Marriage with any that are under different Perſwaſions and <hi>Practices,</hi> with Reſpect to <hi>Faith</hi> and Religious
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004322_0020_10045412446AAD20"/>Worſhip, as may tend to hinder their perſevering in it.</p>
            <p>The Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11 treats at large of <hi>Faith;</hi> and ſets forth the <hi>Noble Diſpoſition</hi> of Mind, that was in ſuch as believed in <hi>Almighty God;</hi> how it <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> them from the World, and preſerved them out of the <hi>Affections</hi> and Deſires of being joyned to and with the World. And in <hi>Ver.</hi> 24.25. He ſays <hi>By Faith</hi> Moſes <hi>when he came to Years, refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharoah's Daughter; <hi>chooſing rather to ſuffer Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin, which were but for a Seaſon.</hi> He would not it ſeems, be numbered with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who oppreſs'd the Righteous Seed, no, <hi>not for a Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle alſo, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 4. giving a Touch at the Patriarchs Marriages, ſhews the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Kindred,</hi> which is by <hi>Faith.</hi> And to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> chap. 2.19. he ſaith, <hi>Now therefore you are no more Strangers and Foreigners; but Fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of Faith:</hi> And in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. He calls Believers ſo; and in <hi>chap.</hi> 4.48
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004322_0021_10045421721CC028"/>ſays, <hi>Now we Brethren, as</hi> Iſaac <hi>was are the Children of Promiſe.</hi> For whom ſay I, a Spiritual <hi>Canaan</hi> is ordained by God.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I would query? Art thou, Reader, ſuch an One? One of the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kindred,</hi> a Child of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and of the Houſhold of <hi>Faith?</hi> Or wouldſt thou be ſo accounted, and art diſpoſed to Marry,? whither then wilt thou go for a Wife, but to thy kindred? Not in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but in the <hi>Spirit. Have we not Power</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, to lead about a</hi> Siſter <hi>a Wife, as well as other Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. Mark the words well, a <hi>Siſter</hi> Wife, or (as a former Tranſlation hath it) a Wife, being a <hi>Siſter,</hi> which, in Marginal Note there, is explained to be a <hi>faithful and Chriſtian Wife.</hi> So that ſhe ſhould be a <hi>Siſter,</hi> before ſhe be a <hi>Wife;</hi> a <hi>Siſter,</hi> in the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or Religious Relation and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, which Relation in the Faith, as it was to them, is ſtill to us a neceſſary Qualification preceeding Marriage.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That the People of <hi>England,</hi> and of that Part of the World called <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are not to be compared with each other, in this Caſe of Marriage; for the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004322_0022_1004542742850118"/>
               <hi>Nations</hi> which <hi>Iſrael</hi> were forbidden to Marry with, were downright Idolaters Worſhipping Strange Gods of their own deviſing: But the People of England, &amp;c. generally own the True God, and profeſs Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that, altho' they differ among themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Manner of Worſhipping God, yet why may they not marry promiſcuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one ſort with the other, ſeeing they all profeſs Chriſtianity, and are therefore accounted and called Chriſtians, both by themſelves and other Nations, and being of a ſober Converſation, cannot properly be called Unbelievers.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, I am not about to Hethenize any, but am willing to own, and embrace that which is good in all. And though I might turn off the Objection with a ſhort <hi>Anſwer,</hi> in its own Terms, That ſuch ſhould not inter-marry, becauſe they differ; ſince the Nature of Marriage beſpeaks an <hi>Agreement,</hi> not <hi>Difference,</hi> an <hi>Harmomous Unity,</hi> not a <hi>jarring Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord:</hi> Yet for the Sake of ſerious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers, I am willing to enlarge a little upon this Part. Wherefore to proceed; I allow there is a Difference in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, between <hi>outward Iſrael</hi> and the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004322_0023_10045432D8769A90"/>Nations then, and <hi>Spiritual Iſrael</hi> and other People now, that are not of the ſame Society and Communion. For then the Diſtinction was only of Jew and Gentile. Believer and Unbeliever: But now (as the Objection hath it) all that Part which is called Chriſtendom, profeſſeth Faith in one God, and in Chriſt Jeſus, though very differently, and ſome, no Doubt, in all Profeſſions called Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, are of a Sober, Moral Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if General Profeſſion were a ſufficient Qualification, for joining ſuch in Marriage without Exception, then <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and other unſound Worſhippers, bearing the Chriſtian Name, muſt not be excluded or refuſed, if of a Sober Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Which allowance would not a little gratifie <hi>Anti Chriſt,</hi> uphold the Apoſtate Church, called in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> Myſtery, Babylon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chap. 17.5. and tend to keep God's People there, contrary to the expreſs Command of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.6 And of the Voice from Heaven, which ſaid, <hi>Come out of her my People, that ye be not partakers of her Sins, and that ye receive not of her Plagues,</hi> Rev. 18.4. For hath not ſhe long made, and doth ſhe not ſtill make a large <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004322_0024_1004543E07CF8300"/>of Faith in God and Chriſt, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her manner?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle exhorted the <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of old <hi>not to be unequally Yoaked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with unbelievers,</hi> 2 Cor. 6 14 may we ſuppoſe he intended to reſtrain the Prohibition, only to thoſe obſolete and notorious Unbelievers, who were Pagans, or Heathens? Or did it extend to all, that did not believe the Manifeſtation of Chriſt Outwardly in the <hi>Fleſh?</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> did believe in God, and that Chriſt the Son of God ſhould come: But they did not believe in him as He was then come; and manifeſt in the Fleſh among them. Might the Chriſtian Believers, notwithſtanding that, have mingled in Marriages with the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe of their General Belief in God, and in Chriſt to come, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him in his then preſent <hi>Appearance?</hi> Would that have been an Equal Yoaking? So likewiſe, if one that believes, not only the Outward Appearance of Chriſt, with reſpect to his having come in the Fleſh; but his inward Appearance alſo, with Reſpect to his being come in the Spirit, by his Divine Light and Grace, to Rule in the Hearts of his People, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004322_0025_1004544650BB66C8"/>thereby, to both direct and enable them, as they attend thereunto, how to perform Divine Worſhip and Service to God, ſhould marry one that denies, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that Inward and Spiritual Coming and Appearance of Chriſt in the Heart, and ſticks only to his Belief of His Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coming and Appearance in the <hi>Héſh</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Would ſuch a Couple be equally Yoaked.</p>
            <p>But not to preſs the Compariſon too cloſe, becauſe I would both avoid Offence and uſe what Brevity I can; I ſay, if two Perſons of different Judgments about Matters of Faith and Religious Exerciſes (as going to Meetings, Preaching, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thanksgiving, &amp;<hi>c</hi>) ſhould incline to marry each other, preſuming in their <hi>fond Affections,</hi> that, notwithſtanding that Diſagreement, they may live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably together, they will find too late that they were greatly miſtaken. For although, if it were only a Diſagreement in their Tempers or natural Diſpoſitions, which concerned only their outward Converſation one towards the other, or the Management of their Temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, it might be hoped they might live tolerably together: Yet where the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004322_0026_1004121B71236050"/>is of ſo high a Strain and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as concerns the Peace of Conſcience, and Safety of the <hi>Soul</hi> on either Side; that cannot be reconciled, without the Converſion of one of them, which is out of Man's Power, of himſelf to effect. Wherefore, altho' ſuch may talk of, and promiſe to themſelves <hi>Unity</hi> in ſuch <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety:</hi> Yet by that Time <hi>their Folly ſhall have corrected them;</hi> they will find Cauſe to be of another Mind. And if their Love to God and Religion, be not quite conſumed by thoſe Paſſionate <hi>Flames</hi> which engaged them into that unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Undertaking: they will ſeel, after Marriage, their Spirits more plainly and warmly conflicting one with another, and ſtriving to bring each other into a Conformity unto that Way of Worſhip, which he or ſhe is in. And then, whichſoever of them prevails, the other muſt loſe Peace of <hi>Conſcience</hi> (the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all Loſſes) unleſs ſuch Compliance ſpring from a true and unfeigned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the Worſhip ſo conformed to, is the Right: Which is more than may reaſonably be expected by any, who are guilty of Tempting the Lord with ſuch Mixt-Marriages.</p>

Beſides when two of Diſagreeing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions in Religious Exerciſes, do joyn in Marriage, no Man can reaſonably think, that their Affection to each other is grounded on, or governed by Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if not, that it muſt be by ſome Worldly end: And to cloke ſuch a Marriage with a pretence of Hope, to convert each other to what each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth is right, is in plain Engliſh no better then <hi>a ſinning that Grace may abound; a doing Evil, that good may come of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the Caſe is otherwiſe, where two, of one and the ſame Perſwation in Religion or of no Religion, are joyned together in Marriage: And afterwards one of them is converted to the True Religion: The converted may expect the Lord's Bleſſing; and abiding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may be a Means of Sanctification and Good to the other, according to the Apoſtle's Doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. And the Nature of True Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Now as to the latter Part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I readily grant that the Lord hath many, that in a Senſe may be ſaid to belong to him, who are not as yet profeſſed Members of the viſible Church
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004322_0028_1004545B8F779C28"/>nor known unto it. This our Saviour plainly intimated, when in his Diſcourſe to the <hi>Jews</hi> pointing at the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: Them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice; and there ſhall be one Fold, and one Shepherd,</hi> John 10.16. But until theſe other Sheep be gathered, and brought, by the Great Shepherd into the Fold; although they are known to the Lord, yet are they not ſo well known to his People, as to be capable of being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Church-Communion, or Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them; much leſs into that Marriage Union with them, of which we have been treating.</p>
            <p>But to have done, at length, with this Objection, I ſhall now remind the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That when the Sons of God, in the Old World, had degenerated, and were Apoſtatized, as hath been before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, their Motive to theſe Mixt-Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages was, <hi>They ſaw the Daughters of Men were fair and they took them Wives of all that they choſe,</hi> Gen. 6.2. So that to gratifie the Luſt of the Eye, was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of their <hi>Marriages.</hi> And to ſuch an Eye now (as alſo to thoſe as have
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004322_0029_1004546030F13C60"/>a covetous Mind, reaching unduly after the Things of this World) this may ſeem an unneceſſary Scruple; eſpecially when it ſtands in their Way, to hinder them from the obtaining of their deſired End, But the truly Conſcientious will always find themſelves obliged, for the Sake of Religion and Duty to God, to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may hinder their Perſeverance and Progreſſion therein: Which Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement about Religion will naturally do, more or leſs, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Diſagreement.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, though our Caſe be not the ſame as old <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s was in every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: Yet if it be ſo in any Degree, and have the ſame Tendency in any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (which that it has, is undeniable;) then it brings our Times under the Force of the ſame Prohibition and Law, and that for the ſame Reaſon (namely) Becauſe they will turn away, or hinder thy Sons from following me, ſaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>And now my Dear Friends (for unto you who bear the Name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> whether ye be ſuch, as the Lord hath been graciouſly pleaſed to call and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of any other Religious Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004322_0030_100454630B985E58"/>or ſuch as are the Offspring of Believing Parents; in this Profeſſion, do I now more particularly turn my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) if ye would not be overtaken in that extreamly hurtful Caſe of ſuch Mixt-Marriages, keep out of the Way that leads to it. Shun, as much as may be, the too frequent and familiar Converſe with thoſe of other Profeſſions; ſuch, eſpecially, as may be moſt likely to allure and draw your Minds out. Be not cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different about Religion. Halt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Two. If God be God (which, I hope, you are fully perſwaded of) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and keep cloſe with him, that you may know your Minds ſtaid, and eſtabliſhed upon him: And then will ye ſee, for your Encouragement, the <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> and Comfort that ſuch have and enjoy, who make it their Buſineſs to pleaſe him. And whatever your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Circumſtances in this World be, let your chiefeſt Treaſure and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, be in Heaven and heavenly Things; and then your Hearts will be there alſo, as our Saviour taught, <hi>Mat,</hi> 6.21. And then, above all Things, ye will deſire to be Servants, and Diſciples of him, who ſaid, <hi>Where I am, there ſhall my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam be,</hi> John 12.26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:004322_0031_1004546D59003CF0"/>
But all whoſe Minds are ſet upon Things below, whether <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</hi> more than upon their Saviour, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> who died for them, are not <hi>worthy of him,</hi> Mat. 10.37. And ſuch whatever they may profeſs, do moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſs of the Heavenly Bleſſing (which God reſerves for his Peculiar People) notwithſtanding that they alſo may partake largely of Temporal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Bleſſings, in common with other Men. For God, who is the Fountain of Goodneſs, cauſeth <hi>his Sun to ſhine,</hi> and <hi>ſendeth Rain on the Juſt, and on the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> Mat 5.45. But to be a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Heir</hi> of the Heavenly Kingdom, is a great and glorious <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> The Way to this Happineſs is ſet forth, by him who is the Truth it ſelf, in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. (and in many other Places of Holy Scripture, in which it is neceſſary we ſhould be very converſant) <hi>Whoſoever.</hi> ſaith Chriſt there, <hi>doth not bear my Croſs, and come after me, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> And we read (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10.) that he is not only our <hi>Propitiation for our Sins;</hi> but alſo that he hath left us an Example that we ſhould follow his Steps. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. who ſaid, <hi>Learn of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004322_0032_1004547042E46310"/>me for I am meek and low in Heart; and ye ſhall find Reſt unto your Souls,</hi> Mat. 11.29.</p>
            <p>And now, my Friends, I would come near unto you, by Way of Enquiry: Have you indeed been convinced of the Truth, and been made ſenſible of the Croſs, that attends the Profeſſion of it? And have you been faithful to thoſe Convictions, and followed the Lord in the Way of Regeneration? Or have ye not? This is an important Point, the Conſequence of which may turn the Scale to either Hand: Therefore, I pray, let it be duly conſidered. For to be found <hi>perſevering in the Way of Truth,</hi> which we make Profeſſion of, and in all the Parts and Branches of it, will be of a double Advantage to us. It will not only preſerve from adding Sin to Sin, (which, if not timely prevented, will lead ſuch into ſpiritual Adultery, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God and withdrawing from him both their Love and Subjection; which, more or leſs, precedes ſuch <hi>mixt Unſcriptural Marriages:</hi>) But it will alſo bring us to underſtand the Difference which hath always been between the <hi>Two Seeds;</hi> and that will tend greatly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004322_0033_10045475AEC59260"/>to preſerve us from Apoſtatizing. And then, What the Conſequence is of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in well-doing unto the End, ye will be truly ſenſible of, to your Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Joy and Comfort; according as it is promiſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcomes will I give to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne,</hi> where all Fears and Temptations will be done away for ever. But the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Diſobedience will not be ſo: But will have a contrary Event; which I pray God we all may be delivered from before it be too late.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Think not</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Jews,</hi> Mat. 3.9.) <hi>to ſay within your ſelves, We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father,</hi> &amp;c. A Thing very incident to them, to value themſelves upon; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their profeſſing the True Religion, as being the Diſciples of <hi>Moſes.</hi> As if that could be any Advantage to them, while they did not the Works of <hi>Abr ham,</hi> but lived in Diſobedience: So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Advantages they had, and the High Pretences they made, our Saviour Chriſt told them plainly, <hi>They were of their Father the Devil;</hi> and his
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004322_0034_100412318D600E98"/>
               <hi>Proof</hi> therefore was, becauſe <hi>they did his Work.</hi> So that to be the Children of faithful Parents, or to profeſs the True Religion now (as they then did,) and yet not be faithful, as the Parents were, nor live and walk in the True Religion they profeſs; will as little avail ſuch now, as it did thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> then.</p>
            <p>What did it avail <hi>Dives,</hi> or the Rich Man in the Parable, that he could call <hi>Abraham</hi> Father, and that <hi>Ab aham</hi> vouchſafed to call him <hi>Son,</hi> while he mean while was in Hell! Read the <hi>Parable</hi> throughout (<hi>Luke</hi> 16.20. to the End) and conſider it well. The Rich Man there, after he had miſ-ſpent his precious Time in <hi>voluptuous Living</hi> (wearing Rich <hi>Apparel</hi> and <hi>faring ſumptuouſly</hi> every Day) at length died, and was buried too, and that probably, as he had lived, in Pomp and State, as ſuch commonly now a-days are. The Poor Man <hi>Lazarus,</hi> died alſo, but it is likely his Funeral was too mean and private, to be taken Notice of: For we read nothing of it. But that which is better, we read, namely, That he was carried by Angels into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's Boſom. But the next Account we have of <hi>Dives,</hi> is, That he was in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004322_0035_10045484F2B621C8"/>
               <hi>Hell, Begging;</hi> and that for a ſmall Alms too, but a Drop or two of cold Water: And yet (<hi>O miſerable Man!</hi>) even that was denied him. He being in <hi>Hell,</hi> lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his Eyes, and ſaw <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> (poor deſpiſed <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) in his Boſom. Whereupon he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaid, <hi>Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me; and ſend</hi> Lazarus <hi>that he may dip the Tip of his Finger in Water, and cool my Tongue: For I am tormented in this Flame:</hi> A Thing he might well have foreſeen, had he but lifted up his Eyes in Time. <hi>Abraham</hi> not diſallowing his Claim of Kindred according to the Fleſh, yet vindicating the Juſtice of God upon him, anſwered, <hi>Son remember that thou in thy Life-time, received'ſt thy good Things,</hi> [Riches, Honours, Pleaſures and Worldly Delicacies, which thou didſt account thy <hi>Good-things</hi>] <hi>and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi> Lazarus Evil, [Poverty, Pain, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Miſery:] <hi>But now is he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and thou art tormented:</hi> Nor was that all: But, as an <hi>Agravation</hi> of his great <hi>Unhappineſs,</hi> from a Senſe that his Torment are remedileſs, and that there would be no End of his Miſery, he tells him further; <hi>And beſides all this, between
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004322_0036_100454897988AEF8"/>us and you there is a great Gulf fixed: So that they that would paſs from hence to you, cannot; neither can they paſs to us that would come from thence.</hi> This put <hi>Dives</hi> out of all Hopes of Relief for himſelf. Wherefore having now at length ſome <hi>Pity</hi> for his own Family, tho' he had none for <hi>Lazarus;</hi> when he needed it, addreſſing himſelf again to <hi>Ain aham,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>I pray thee therefore, Father, that thou wouldſt ſend him to my Father's Houſe; for I have five Brethren that he may teſtifie unto them, leſt they alſo come into this Place of Torment.</hi> What need of That, ſaid <hi>Abraham, They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the</hi> Prophets; <hi>let them hear them. Nay Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Dives, <hi>but if One went to them from the Dead they will repent.</hi> No, no, ſaid Abraham, <hi>If they hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the</hi> Prophets [which was the means they profeſſed, as appointed by God, for the Inſtruction of his People, under that Diſpenſation] <hi>neither will they be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded though one roſe from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this <hi>Parable,</hi> Two Things, moſt pertinent to my preſent Subject, are to be obſerved. One, That the Higheſt Profeſſion of Religion, the neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004322_0037_10045494225CF770"/>outwardly to the Godly, though it were that of a Child to the moſt God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents, is not ſufficient, without the Living Faith, and the Living Fruits thereof, <hi>a Godly life and Converſation,</hi> to keep from coming into the Place of Torment. The other is, That ſuch as neglect to wait upon, and ſerve God in his own way and Time, to be made by him <hi>Wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> through the Grace and Underſtanding given them for that End in the Preſent Diſpenſation they are under; will Naturally grow Blind and Hard: So that they cannot be wrought upon, to be made ſenſible of the Danger they are in, by the moſt extraordinary Means; No, not <hi>if one were ſent to them from the Dead.</hi> And ſince <hi>there is no other Name under Heaven given, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> but by Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>Acts.</hi> 4.12.) And the Grace coming by Him, brings the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Chriſt, is the Author of; how greatly doth it concern every One, to attend Daily and Diligently on Him, in the Gift of his Grace; and to hearken to and obey his Teachings thereby! For <hi>God who at Sundry Times and in divers Manners, ſpake unto the Fathers by the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004322_0038_10045498AE63DEA8"/>Prophets,</hi> (Heb. 1.1.) <hi>hath in theſe laſt Days ſpoken unto us by his Son:</hi> And that in Divers Manners alſo; as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by his Spirit, inſtrumentally by his Miniſters, as alſo in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by his many Providences. And if, (as the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12.25.) <hi>they eſcaped not, who refuſed him that ſpake on Earth: Much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi>
